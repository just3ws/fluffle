1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
 Finding suitable mental health medications can be a challenge.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,360
 The Genesight test may help.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,620
 Did you know that genetics can play an important role in gaining insight on how a person may

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,680
 respond to various medications?

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,340
 Understanding this may help reduce medication trial and error.

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,920
 Genesight is a genetic test that analyzes variations in DNA.

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,960
 It shows how genes may affect someone's metabolism or responds to medications commonly prescribed

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,400
 to treat depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions.

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,800

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:36,360
 Tonight, a game show reveals a terrible secret.

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:43,200
 What would you do if you found tiny people taking a bath in your bathroom sink?

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,400
 What?

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,960
 And then we travel to West Virginia.

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:56,400
 Or a small creek bubbling through the dark forest actually has a powerful secret.

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,540
 Is there a ghost in West Virginia that can warn us whenever a president will be assassinated

16
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,320
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

17
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:14,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,600
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,600
 I'm having a great day.

20
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,520
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

21
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,520
 Feeling a lot better.

22
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,440
 I think you guys can hear that on my voice.

23
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,440
 Still have the cough.

24
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,640
 That cough has been around for a couple weeks now.

25
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,200
 But we got a lot of stuff to cover so let's go ahead and jump right into this.

26
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,520
 This show is a daily show.

27
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,200
 So this is happening tonight.

28
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,400
 But this also takes place in Germany.

29
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:43,320
 So by the time I'm recording this at 7pm on March 24th, by the time I'm recording it,

30
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,080
 it's probably already happened in Germany.

31
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,080
 But still.

32
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,360
 That's our timely music news.

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,840
 So Big Brother is the show where you get the contestants, they sit in the house and then

34
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,840
 like people get voted.

35
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,920
 I think I've, I can't ever say that I've ever watched more than a few episodes of it.

36
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,480
 But they get voted out I believe.

37
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,800
 And they win money or something.

38
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,800
 Or they win the house.

39
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,800
 I don't know.

40
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,320
 Maybe the last person in the house actually owns the house.

41
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,320
 But it was a British show.

42
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,840
 And then it was spread all over the world.

43
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,000
 Big Brother Germany is going on right now.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,160
 There's a couple other Big Brothers going on right now.

45
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,400
 And the idea is this.

46
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,000
 10 people or whatever.

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,960
 You're chasing any basic research.

48
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,120
 You get a group of people in a house.

49
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,120
 They're totally cut off from the outside world.

50
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,080
 And they bicker and squabble.

51
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,720
 And us normals, us Homo sapiens, get to watch these guys 24 hours on camera feed.

52
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,440
 Technically, we're the Big Brother.

53
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,600
 We're the observing audience.

54
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,120
 But there's actually a Big Brother in the house that can give news alerts or, it doesn't

55
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,120
 really give news alerts.

56
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,520
 And a prompt drama.

57
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,160
 Basically there's an overriding force in the house.

58
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,840
 So people get voted out of the house.

59
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,560
 And then there's this huge crowd.

60
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,560
 Woo!

61
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,840
 Because you go in and you're a nobody.

62
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,320
 And then you come out and you're a celebrity.

63
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,480
 People have been watching your antics for a week or two or three or four, however long

64
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,720
 you last on the show.

65
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,720
 Ah yeah.

66
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,720
 Woo!

67
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,760
 You come out and you find out you have a fan base.

68
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,560
 And or a bunch of stalkers.

69
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,720
 But you know, so we have two different things going on.

70
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,440
 We have a bunch of people isolated in the house.

71
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,320
 And they have no access to the outside world.

72
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,600
 They have no television, no news, nothing.

73
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,800
 The Big Brother show in Germany, it started on February 6th.

74
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,200
 The season started on February 6th.

75
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,120
 And at that time, coronavirus, you had like maybe a couple dozen cases in Germany, a couple

76
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,760
 dozen cases in America and stuff like that.

77
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,000
 They've had no news about what's going on in the outside world.

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,320
 This is, there's a lot of stuff that's messed up about this.

79
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,960
 One, they're not telling them about it.

80
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,040
 This is the gimmick, okay?

81
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,840
 This is what they're doing tonight on ITV.

82
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,160
 On ITV, they're going to announce to these people who've been sequestered in their house

83
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,160
 since February 6th.

84
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,880
 They're like, "Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in big brother Germany history,

85
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,920
 we're going to let you guys know what's going on in the outside world."

86
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,640
 Whoa, what's it going to be?

87
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,640
 Everyone's sick.

88
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,560
 There's a disease rampaging across the planet.

89
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,560
 Be like, "What?

90
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,560
 I don't want to know that."

91
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,440
 They're getting ready to announce that on live television tonight.

92
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,560
 There have been, so when someone gets voted out of the house and another person takes

93
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,560
 their place, the people who have taken their place, one person just entered the house a

94
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,840
 couple of days ago, I hope they tested them.

95
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,920
 I hope they made sure the guy wasn't sick.

96
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,680
 And they said, "You cannot mention what's going on outside at all."

97
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,400
 Even the pandemic, especially the pandemic.

98
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,640
 You can't say anything.

99
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,880
 They've been teasing, they've been advertising this.

100
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,000
 Tune in tonight where we let 10 people know what's going on in the, that's horrible.

101
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,880
 And that definitely raises the stakes for the show.

102
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,600
 Because now you definitely don't want to get voted out.

103
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,520
 Because you know where you're at, you're isolated.

104
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,000
 You're in the lap of luxury, you have unlimited food and water.

105
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,520
 Now you're like, "Oh my God, I live in an apartment with like 10 other roommates and

106
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,120
 they're super disgusting.

107
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,120
 Please don't vote me out."

108
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,280
 The stakes for the show are so high now.

109
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,960
 And I guess I should say this, when we had a similar thing here in the States, 9/11 happened

110
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,680
 and they were doing a season of Big Brother.

111
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,720
 And the rule was, don't tell anyone what's going on in the outside world.

112
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,800
 But one of the girls in the house lost somebody in 9/11.

113
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,440
 So they did say, "Hey guys, we got attacked by terrorists."

114
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,400
 And they kind of broke the rules for that.

115
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,960
 And a couple other seasons are doing Big Brother right now.

116
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,120
 They've broken the rules for that.

117
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,640
 But to let them know what's going on, in the Canadian Big Brother, this is creepy.

118
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,080
 Canadian Big Brother, right?

119
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,000
 The way I described it, remember the people get voted out and they leave and there's like

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,400
 a massive crowd outside the house.

121
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,440
 "Chairing, you were nobody two weeks ago, but now we love you."

122
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,440
 Wow!

123
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,720
 Recently, they had the vote out thing, right?

124
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,200
 And they voted the person saying goodbye to them and they walk out the door and everyone's

125
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,360
 like getting ready to hear the abhorious applause.

126
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,400
 It's dead silent outside.

127
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,320
 Because there's no audience.

128
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,320
 Social distancing.

129
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,560
 The Canadian television network, whatever, didn't have anyone come.

130
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,580
 You can't be that close to anyone.

131
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,440
 So you know the gimmick of the show.

132
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,480
 You've been watching it growing up and now you're on it.

133
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,760
 You know what to expect.

134
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,160
 Someone walks out of the door.

135
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,120
 It's dead silent outside.

136
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,000
 The people are like, because they have the hour long special that you can watch on television

137
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,440
 and then you can watch them on webcams.

138
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,200
 When people were watching the webcam footage after the person leaves, people in the house

139
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,360
 are waiting to hear the roar and they don't hear anything.

140
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,760
 And then they're talking among each other later that night and the people are like,

141
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,520
 "Why didn't we hear anything?"

142
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,300
 And the other person's like, "I don't know.

143
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,860
 That was really weird, right?"

144
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,420
 Yeah, yeah.

145
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,580
 Did they soundproof the house somehow?

146
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,700
 Which would be impossible, but that's what they're thinking.

147
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,060
 That's the only thing they can think of.

148
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,500
 They must have somehow created some sort of...

149
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:54,300
 Did the Canadian television use all that money they got from Degrassi High and build a soundproof

150
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,740
 sci-fi dome around the building?

151
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,980
 And they start discussing why weren't there anyone outside.

152
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,840
 And then the big brother, who like I said, can speak in this intercom system over the

153
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,800
 house to talk to them.

154
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,160
 As these people are trying to figure out what could possibly be going on outside that there

155
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:17,120
 was no one there to greet the person exiting the house, the big brother voice speaks from

156
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,720
 above and says, "Please stop talking."

157
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:25,640
 And everyone in the house just gets quiet.

158
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,960
 They did eventually a couple days later tell the people in that house what was going on

159
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,060
 and that's why there was no crowd.

160
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,060
 But again, definitely raises the stakes for the show.

161
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,060
 You don't want to get voted off.

162
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,460
 Now, I wanted to cover that story for two reasons.

163
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:44,380
 One, I think it's absolutely inhumane to make people fight to stay in a house when this

164
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,500
 is going on too.

165
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:50,700
 I want to talk about a show called Dead Set.

166
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,220
 When I was reading this article, they talked about the show Dead Set.

167
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,660
 Dead Rabbit recommends Dead Set.

168
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:01,680
 It is a show about the big brother house in Britain, which is where Big Brother originally

169
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,680
 started.

170
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,040
 The big brother house.

171
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,880
 And all these people are totally isolated.

172
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,400
 They're a bunch of like, you get all these strangers putting this house together and

173
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:14,080
 they have 24 hour cameras on them and a zombie apocalypse starts outside.

174
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,880
 It's one of the best zombie movies I've ever seen.

175
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,920
 It was actually a mini series.

176
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,000
 But I have it in the show notes.

177
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 You can watch it on YouTube.

178
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,720
 I also got that movie Dig.

179
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,040
 I said it was super rare to find.

180
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,200
 I found that on YouTube.

181
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,540
 It's also in the show notes for this episode as well.

182
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,100
 But I definitely watched Dig.

183
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,180
 I watched it the other night.

184
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,500
 It's still an amazing documentary.

185
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,540
 But Dead Set, and then they're in the big brother house.

186
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,980
 And zombies are laying siege.

187
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:41,140
 And this one girl's boyfriend is like trying to get to the big brother house to save her.

188
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,100
 It's really dark.

189
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,940
 So you may want to save it till after all this is done.

190
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,460
 But definitely it's on there.

191
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,460
 Dead Rabbit recommends Dead Set and Dig.

192
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,060
 It's such a great documentary.

193
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,380
 I also want to say this.

194
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:58,440
 I've reached my level with coronavirus news.

195
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,640
 I don't even read it anymore.

196
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,520
 And I would suggest to most of you guys, if you haven't reached it, to stop reading it.

197
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,400
 I know the basic stuff.

198
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,400
 Don't take ibuprofen.

199
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,220
 They say don't take ibuprofen.

200
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,220
 Keep your hands washed.

201
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,720
 Now they're saying it can stay on services for 17 days.

202
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,120
 But then you look into that and it's like it doesn't.

203
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,000
 It's not contagious at that point.

204
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,640
 I just know if I get cardboard from outside, I don't touch it for 24 hours.

205
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:28,580
 You know what, the basic stuff, I stopped reading all of the horror stories about it.

206
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,140
 I don't even look at the headlines.

207
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,140
 That's not true.

208
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:35,500
 I look at the headlines, but I got tired of clicking on these clickbaity links and finding

209
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:41,020
 either fake information that makes it far more horrible than it actually is.

210
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,260
 And there's a lot of that going on.

211
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,900
 It's really weird.

212
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,420
 I found stories that were 100% that were absolutely horrifying.

213
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,600
 I was like, oh my God.

214
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,040
 And then other people goes that Twitter from that doctor who's telling you that story from

215
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,000
 Italy that he's misspelling words.

216
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,600
 He misspelled his job.

217
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,800
 That's not a real tweet.

218
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,800
 This is fake stuff.

219
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,120
 But they're getting clipped in hammock.

220
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,120
 It's scary.

221
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,120
 Don't get me wrong.

222
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,200
 It is scary and you should social distance and if you can self-isolate and do all these

223
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
 containment things.

224
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,920
 I'm not saying that it's fake or anything like that.

225
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,600
 But what I'm saying is that we can overdo on the scary news about it.

226
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,300
 We need to know the basics.

227
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,300
 That's the same thing.

228
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,660
 There's one thing between knowing about ISIS and then watching ISIS beheading videos.

229
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,660
 Right?

230
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,780
 You get the point.

231
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,980
 There's a brutal terrorist regime taking over swaths of the Middle East.

232
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,380
 You should be aware of basic facts.

233
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,980
 But that doesn't mean you have to go start reading articles where it's telling you what

234
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,980
 they did.

235
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,260
 Stuff like that.

236
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,980
 So that's the approach I've taken towards this.

237
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,820
 I got the basic information.

238
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:48,240
 And I think it was really overwhelming for me, honestly, that first week and a half.

239
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,240
 We're still in it.

240
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,840
 But just reading so every hour looking for new articles to read about stuff and it was

241
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,440
 really, really affecting me.

242
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,440
 It was really getting to me.

243
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,840
 It doesn't mean I'm ignoring the danger.

244
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:04,560
 But it doesn't mean that I'm overwhelming my sense of self and my anger.

245
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,200
 You don't want to get too anxious about it.

246
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,880
 You just want to be careful.

247
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,880
 That's the main thing.

248
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,880
 This is something that we...

249
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,880
 And now this is turned kind of preachy.

250
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:17,500
 But I just want to be preachy right now because I know that we already feel isolated just

251
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,540
 in a normal life.

252
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:24,860
 And now that we actually have to stay away from people, we can feel it even more isolated.

253
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,420
 So don't ignore the news, but know your limit.

254
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,420
 I've reached my limit.

255
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,220
 Now I'll go to websites to look at the headlines.

256
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,220
 That's it.

257
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,220
 I've reached my limit.

258
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,380
 I'm doing what I can do.

259
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,760
 And I'm no longer clicking on these horror stories of this person suffering from this

260
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,760
 or this...

261
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,480
 I got really too deep into it.

262
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,180
 And it was just too much.

263
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,680
 People may say, "Ah, you're putting your head in the sand."

264
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:53,800
 But I say, "No, I think it's the same thing as knowing about a global terrorist group

265
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,680
 versus having to delve into what they do when they enter a village."

266
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,040
 You don't need to know that information.

267
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,000
 You just know that they exist and stuff like that.

268
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,100
 So know what the problem is.

269
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,140
 Know how you can prevent it yourself.

270
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,500
 Know what you can do to not get yourself sick or other people sick.

271
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,500
 And then go on.

272
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:17,940
 You don't have to be clicking on every single creepy Twitter or article that has a sad headline.

273
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,940
 Just keep going forward.

274
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,960
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story, though.

275
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,420
 Our next story takes us to Malaysia.

276
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,420
 So let's hop on board the Carpentercopter.

277
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,780
 We're flying out to Selang Baru.

278
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,100
 Selang Baru.

279
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,180
 You guys know where that's at, right?

280
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,320
 I hope so, because I don't.

281
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,640
 I'm flying the Carpentercopter.

282
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,880
 We're flying out there.

283
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,880
 It's March 1989.

284
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,920
 We're going to meet a little kid, right?

285
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,920
 Some nine-year-old boy.

286
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,560
 His name's Faizul Effendi.

287
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,760
 And he's walking to school.

288
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,760
 [Singing]

289
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,920
 A little backpack.

290
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,040
 He has it over one shoulder because he's one of the cool kids.

291
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,720
 He's not one of those lamos that has it over.

292
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,280
 I used to be that kid.

293
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:00,080
 I didn't want to put my backpack on both shoulders because it looks super lame.

294
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,340
 And then, like, your back starts to hurt.

295
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,760
 But the time you get to high school and the books are super heavy, you're like, "Ugh,

296
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,820
 you look like Quasimodo every time you walk everywhere."

297
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,700
 But anyways, I still did it.

298
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,540
 Nowadays, I put it on both shoulders because I don't care.

299
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:18,260
 Faizul is walking on the street to school and he sees this guy walk by.

300
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,260
 Now that's normal, right?

301
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:22,380
 A lot of times, when you're walking down the street, other people are walking down the

302
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,380
 street, too.

303
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,820
 But this guy was only six inches tall.

304
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:31,040
 Like this little dude is just kind of walking by.

305
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,920
 Now here's the thing.

306
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,720
 You're walking on the street, you see a six inch person, which is unreasonably small.

307
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,840
 Obviously, there are people, there are little people, and they'll be like three feet, two

308
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,200
 feet tall.

309
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:47,960
 But six inches is not normal for anything outside of a uterus, right?

310
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,840
 But you see a little six inch person walking on the street.

311
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,840
 What do you do?

312
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,480
 Quick reaction time.

313
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,480
 What do you do?

314
00:13:53,480 --> 00:14:01,540
 Now I would probably jump back and then I would regain my composure because I'm cool

315
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,860
 and I'd easily take my backpack off because it's only on one shoulder and then I'd get

316
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,940
 down on one knee and go, "Who are you?"

317
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,820
 And I'd try to communicate with this six inch person.

318
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,540
 Faizul does what I think, I think you'd basically have three reactions.

319
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,060
 You'd run away because it's super spooky.

320
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:25,020
 You'd try to talk to the six inch dude or you'd grab it because anything that's small

321
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,340
 enough to grab.

322
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:32,420
 Now again, he's a kid, but I can understand why he grabbed it because, well actually

323
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:36,520
 no I can't because kids don't normally walk around grabbing squirrels and stuff like that.

324
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,440
 I mean babies maybe.

325
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,020
 But I mean, now that I think about it, what if this was just a six foot guy?

326
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,240
 Faizul was walking on the street, would he be grabbing on it?

327
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,240
 Get off of me kid, what are you doing?

328
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:52,920
 But he grabs the six inch dude, the little guy, little guy, bears his teeth and then

329
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,180
 begins super scratching him up.

330
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:01,540
 And scratches him up so much that Faizul drops the dude, guy runs into the bushes.

331
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,020
 You're thinking, "Okay, that's bizarre."

332
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,020
 Right?

333
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,300
 A little feral, you know?

334
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,620
 It's not that he just scratched him up, buried his teeth and then scratched him up.

335
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,780
 It wouldn't make sense for a six inch person to have some really good self-defense techniques.

336
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:19,320
 Not that it has to know like choke holds and stuff like that, but that it would have claws.

337
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,560
 I wonder, no that's not, wait a second, think about it.

338
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,960
 Small animals have claws and big animals don't, right?

339
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,080
 So like cats have claws and then tigers have claws.

340
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,880
 Like tigers aren't small, well think about it, okay.

341
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,320
 You have like birds, they're tiny, they have claws, right?

342
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,680
 But then humans don't and then cats have claws because you know they're like clawing at,

343
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,460
 like mice and stuff like that.

344
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,160
 Why don't dogs have claws?

345
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,160
 Why don't dogs?

346
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,840
 What would that be like good when they're like attacking bears and stuff like that?

347
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,540
 Bears have claws, they're pretty big, that doesn't work for my hypothesis.

348
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,080
 But this is what I'm getting at.

349
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,860
 Hippopotamuses, rhinos, elephants, they don't have claws.

350
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:07,200
 So I think the bigger you get, the less likely it is you're gonna have claws.

351
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,580
 If you have claws, you need every advantage possible to have.

352
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:16,160
 What if everyone says that cats are small tigers, right?

353
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,120
 So like there's a bunch of tigers running around and then they kept having babies and

354
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,960
 the babies got smaller and smaller and that's where house cats came from.

355
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,560
 I'm gonna give a different idea.

356
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,320
 You're like Jason, that's nobody said that.

357
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,280
 That's no scientific theory.

358
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,860
 What if all cats started off as little and then they got big and that's why they still

359
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,940
 have their claws.

360
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,680
 But then a thousand years from now, lions and tigers will no longer have claws because

361
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,220
 they'll not need them.

362
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,260
 What do they use claws for anyways?

363
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,940
 They don't really climb trees.

364
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,980
 Like, why do bears have claws actually?

365
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,980
 Like it's not just because gorillas don't have claws, right?

366
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,580
 So I'm gonna stand by my theory.

367
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:59,780
 I'm gonna stand by my theory that the bigger the animal, the bear doesn't count.

368
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:03,180
 The bigger the animal, the less likely it is to have claws.

369
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,500
 Because if an elephant had claws, if an elephant ate meat, that might be the thing.

370
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,660
 Maybe it's meat eater.

371
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,040
 Wait, no, but rhinos, oh wait, no.

372
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,040
 That's it.

373
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,160
 That's it.

374
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,480
 Meat eaters have claws and omnivores and herbivores.

375
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,000
 You have elephants being like, ah, rip an open bin and never mind.

376
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,080
 Okay, so where was I at?

377
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,660
 So this guy must be a carnivore because he has claws.

378
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,160
 That's what I was trying to get at.

379
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
 I wonder if there's a carnivore.

380
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,680
 Never mind, I'm not gonna.

381
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,880
 Okay, so that's that.

382
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,520
 April 1989, one month later, Salaeng Bahru, Malaysia.

383
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,520
 We're still here.

384
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,760
 We never left town.

385
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,540
 We've been eating their delicious noodles, I'm assuming that they eat noodles over there.

386
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,620
 We're eating noodles and rice and it's so super tasty.

387
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:49,380
 Mmm, it's tasting so good in my little quarantined belly.

388
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,060
 Tasting so yummy.

389
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:55,300
 We're gonna meet a dude named Nor Osme Mod Jamal.

390
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,060
 Nor Osme Mod Jamal.

391
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,980
 He's walking home from school.

392
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,100
 He's coming the opposite direction, but the same area.

393
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,900
 I don't actually know if it's the same geographical area, but same town.

394
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,500
 He's walking home from school.

395
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:11,840
 He sees, walking across the street, two six inch dudes.

396
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,280
 One of them's actually a girl.

397
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,200
 So two six inch dudes.

398
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,280
 One of them's wearing a brown shirt and shorts, which is actually kind of comfortable because

399
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,480
 Malaysia is pretty tropical.

400
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,200
 They're not dressed like the leprechaun.

401
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,960
 They're not dressing like big old hats and stuff like jackets.

402
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,400
 That's actually a good point.

403
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,840
 The leprechauns dressed up like, wait a second, I'm thinking of the leprechaun from the leprechaun

404
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,840
 movies.

405
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,840
 That's not his actual.

406
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:39,260
 But the leprechaun wears a jacket and you wear like big old socks and pants.

407
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,260
 Like shorts.

408
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,020
 They're shorts, but he has like long socks.

409
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,220
 Because Ireland is cold.

410
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,220
 Ireland's cold.

411
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:51,460
 But if you had cryptids in more tropical areas, they'd be wearing like a little sun hat and

412
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,700
 like a commuter shirt.

413
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,820
 Little short-sleeved shirt.

414
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,820
 You wouldn't want to see like, if you were a cryptid, if you were a mythological creature

415
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,500
 in a warm climate, you would dress accordingly.

416
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,300
 That's actually really interesting because it shows.

417
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,000
 Well it shows one of two things.

418
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,520
 It shows that cryptids would have to maintain some sort of internal body temperature that

419
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:15,920
 they're also affected by the climate or that the people making up the stories make them

420
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,920
 up in a way that's relatable to the people in their culture.

421
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:23,120
 I.e. if you were in Ireland and you were talking about a leprechaun, you wouldn't say he had

422
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,400
 a boogie board and it wears shorts and no shirt.

423
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,680
 People would be like, would it run any frees to death?

424
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,680
 And why does it have a boogie board?

425
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,680
 What's a boogie board?

426
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,680
 So it's one of those two things.

427
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,160
 Most likely the second one.

428
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,980
 Anyways, he's walking on the street, he sees two six inch people.

429
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,140
 One of them is wearing a brown shirt, brown shorts.

430
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:42,460
 The other one is wearing a brown shirt and a little skirt.

431
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,060
 And he sees these little guys and he does.

432
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,420
 This is what I think would be more likely than reaching out and grabbing one.

433
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,900
 He starts chasing them.

434
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,540
 Now I said I would sit down and go, what's your name?

435
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,620
 But if it was like walking, I would also probably be likely to pursue them as well.

436
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,220
 I'd still want to talk to them but that's a pretty natural thing.

437
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,060
 He starts chasing them and they take off into the bushes.

438
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:08,440
 But a few days later, Nor, this kid Nor is at home.

439
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,160
 So he walks into his bathroom.

440
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,040
 Like you have the bathroom sink.

441
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:17,160
 And he sees one of the little dudes just kind of hanging out, sitting on the porcelain,

442
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,680
 just hanging out, just chilling on his sink.

443
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,640
 What the hell's going on?

444
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,520
 And then he looks and he sees that the basin of the sink is filled with water and the other

445
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,900
 one's totally naked, do do do do, washing itself.

446
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,360
 Now I don't know if it took like a sliver of soap.

447
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,280
 Aye, laddie, gotta get clean.

448
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,280
 Irish spring!

449
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,040
 Maybe this is a really commercial for Irish spring.

450
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,120
 The little dude is washing himself.

451
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,240
 Which that would be awesome.

452
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,240
 Right?

453
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,240
 I would do multiple things right there.

454
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,240
 One, I'd get a camera.

455
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,240
 Now to be fair, that's not, I'm not pervert.

456
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,240
 I'm not a pervert.

457
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:57,640
 I'm not gonna post these photos on foundcryptidsnew.com or like cryptids on camera, stuff like that.

458
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,020
 I'm not trying to be a pervert because there's a naked cryptid in my sink.

459
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,220
 I'd grab a camera for proof because no one's gonna believe you, obviously.

460
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,840
 And then I would still try to talk to the guys, but then I would sell the water online

461
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,780
 a bunch of weirdos and be like, "Hey guys, how would you like to buy water that a six

462
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,460
 inch person took a bath in?"

463
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,620
 And they would respond, "Man or woman."

464
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,460
 And I'd go, "Doesn't matter.

465
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,980
 A six inch person took a bath in this."

466
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,420
 Okay, it was the woman.

467
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,940
 No, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll buy it, buy it.

468
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,840
 So anyways, he doesn't specify if it was the dude or the girl who was taking the bath,

469
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,400
 but we'll just assume.

470
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,560
 Just to make the story a little more sexy, it was a six inch woman in there.

471
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:40,560
 And so anyways, he's watching her take a bath and then he reaches in, this is the end

472
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:47,720
 thing, he goes to grab the girl in the sink and surprise, surprise, he gets attacked.

473
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:52,240
 He gets bit really, really hard and drops her and the two little people took off.

474
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,940
 Now he goes to tell his parents, obviously, he has to explain why his hand is bleeding

475
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,940
 profusely.

476
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,940
 What happened to you?

477
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,940
 I tried grabbing a naked woman.

478
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,940
 No mom, don't get mad, she was only six inches tall.

479
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,940
 Okay, I'm not pervert.

480
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,900
 Well, kind of a pervert, but what would you do?

481
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:10,700
 He tells his parents this and this story, I got both of these off of that website, think

482
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,700
 about it, docs.com.

483
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:16,620
 The story ends with this sentence, "He told his parents about the incident, but they

484
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,620
 did not believe him."

485
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:25,080
 Given that the tragedy that lives on forever, haven't we all been there, that moment where

486
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:29,120
 we got bit by a naked six inch woman and we went to our parents, the people who love us

487
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,120
 so much.

488
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:36,080
 Mom, dad, I got bit by a tiny person taking a bath in our sink and then you being not

489
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,840
 believed, that is the true tragedy of this world.

490
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,800
 Let's go ahead and move on to our, I find that story funny, I like that story, I like

491
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,800
 little people running around.

492
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,040
 I think it's cute.

493
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:51,940
 I mean, the constant assaults by the giants, maybe not so cute, but I do find it fascinating

494
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:55,140
 and it makes you think, what would you do if you saw a tiny person?

495
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:59,860
 I think I would try to talk to them and probably take pictures of them and sell their bathwater,

496
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,540
 but I don't think I'd be grabbing them all the time just because they're tiny, because

497
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:05,580
 again, I don't grab mice that are running around.

498
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,940
 Let's go ahead and move on to our last story.

499
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,700
 We're headed out to West Virginia.

500
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,340
 All of this information I got from an article, I want to give credit where credit's due,

501
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,500
 from a website called West Virginia Explorer.

502
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:19,080
 The article is "Horse Creek Ghost Set to Fortell the Demise of Presidents" and it was written

503
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,360
 by David Sibre.

504
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,760
 So let's hop back on board the car.

505
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,760
 Let's take the Jason Jalopy.

506
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,960
 We haven't been driving for a long time.

507
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,960
 Well, we're in Malaysia.

508
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,280
 Fine, let's hop back on the Carverner Copture.

509
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,920
 We're going to fly out to West Virginia.

510
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:35,440
 We're going to learn about the Horse Creek Ghost.

511
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,720
 April 8th, 1865.

512
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,520
 Major Walter Hansen and his buddy Elijah Miller, those are some old-timey names for you, are

513
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,520
 hunting.

514
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,060
 They're out hunting by Horse Creek in West Virginia.

515
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,620
 And they hear something in the bushes.

516
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,940
 "Turn around quickly!"

517
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,020
 They spin around to face the noise.

518
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,660
 They get to deer and elk, possibly an elk with claws.

519
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,660
 They've evolved.

520
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,660
 They eat meat now.

521
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:01,420
 And is the Major's ready to face this evolution abomination?

522
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:08,460
 A woman steps out of the bushes, dressed in all black, clothes soaking wet.

523
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:16,560
 She points her finger at the man and says, "Lincoln will be gone before the full moon

524
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,160
 rises."

525
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,480
 And they're like, "What?"

526
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,880
 Because Lincoln's still president.

527
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,720
 And then she, I don't know if she flashes away or if she just kind of like points at

528
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,120
 him for a while and then kind of puts her arm back down and just stands there silently

529
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,080
 and then is kind of like, "I'm going to go back in the bushes."

530
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,080
 She turns and walks away.

531
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,080
 She simply disappears.

532
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,080
 Now it's 1865.

533
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,120
 It's not like you can just pick up a newspaper.

534
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,500
 Major Walter Hansen said it took him two months to find out that Abraham Lincoln had been

535
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,100
 shot by the coward.

536
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,100
 What was his name?

537
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,100
 I don't remember Jimmy Olson.

538
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,100
 What was that guy's name?

539
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,100
 Lee Harvey Olswald.

540
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,100
 No, that was the other guy.

541
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,100
 Who was the guy who shot Lincoln?

542
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,100
 Not Aaron Burr.

543
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:58,820
 And then he jumped and he like fell, he jumped and he like slid down a curtain all dramatically.

544
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,140
 What was his name?

545
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,340
 Dude, he was that actor.

546
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,940
 Who shot Lincoln?

547
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,720
 And then he ran and then he hid in a barn and then the authorities surrounded him.

548
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,640
 You're like, "Jason, you know all this stuff.

549
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,640
 You don't know his name."

550
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,480
 They said the barn on fire and he died.

551
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,200
 There's always been that big conspiracy theory that he didn't die in the barn, that he got

552
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
 away.

553
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,920
 What was his name?

554
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,920
 Patton Olswald?

555
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,920
 It started with an "O."

556
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,240
 I think it had an "O" in it, right?

557
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,040
 I'm going to Google it here real quick.

558
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,920
 It had an "O" in it.

559
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,920
 That's specific.

560
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,920
 Let's see.

561
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,420
 Who killed Lincoln?

562
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:38,340
 What was his name, Perkins?

563
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,980
 John Wilkes Booth.

564
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,580
 See there's three "Os" in it.

565
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,980
 That's what was throwing me off.

566
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:43,980
 There's too many "Os."

567
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,980
 It's throwing me off.

568
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:48,740
 John Wilkes Booth shoots Abraham Lincoln, then does all that other stuff, I said.

569
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,380
 And may or may not have gotten away with it.

570
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:53,980
 But anyways, now we're going to go to the year 1881.

571
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:58,620
 And this guy named Clyde Perdue and his wife, doesn't matter what her name is, are driving,

572
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,860
 are riding their horses or whatever down.

573
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:04,980
 This same street by Horse Creek in West Virginia.

574
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,980
 And this one's interesting.

575
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,340
 So the first time you had the woman, I'm going to assume she was hot, coming out of the bushes,

576
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,180
 dressed in all black, dripping wet.

577
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,860
 This one, you still have the black clothing.

578
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,860
 So this thing comes out in a black shawl.

579
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,260
 That's still dripping wet.

580
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:20,220
 But this time it's a flaming skull and crossbones.

581
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,220
 It's kind of weird.

582
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,780
 They're driving down the road and they see this flaming skull and crossbones with wearing

583
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:28,860
 a black, dripping wet shawl up here in front of them.

584
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:33,380
 And the skeleton guy goes, "James Garfield's going to be assassinated."

585
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:39,060
 And again, I don't know if it faded away or just kind of floated there for a while and

586
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:42,420
 then they drove past it and they're waving to it in the rearview mirror.

587
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,420
 Or they're on horses.

588
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:47,260
 So they were just, I don't actually know where Carson went.

589
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,260
 I was thinking that.

590
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,820
 I was like, "Carrs wore around in 1881, right?

591
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,300
 But there was only like two of them.

592
00:26:55,300 --> 00:27:00,060
 And you're like, "Jason, this might be your least informed episode ever."

593
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,060
 That may be true.

594
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:04,060
 But I think cars wore around in 1881, but nobody had them.

595
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,380
 So I think these guys are on horses.

596
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,740
 It doesn't really matter.

597
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,380
 It has no bearing on the plot.

598
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,980
 The point is, is that a flaming skull and crossbones said that James Garfield's going

599
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:12,980
 to be assassinated.

600
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,700
 And he was in 1881.

601
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,140
 In 1963, there's this dude named Max Alberts.

602
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,900
 Tell me if this is the most depressing job possible.

603
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,700
 He's a traveling...

604
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,020
 I mean, how much money could you possibly...

605
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,980
 This is the albundi of the 1960s.

606
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,580
 He was a traveling magazine subscription salesman.

607
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:38,100
 So you would just walk around the country or drive around the country because I know

608
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,340
 cars were invented in 1963 where they were around.

609
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:46,980
 And you go up knocking on people's doors and says, "Would you like to buy 12 issues of

610
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,620
 this life magazine?"

611
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,780
 Like, how much money could you possibly make doing that?

612
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,780
 It's ridiculous.

613
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,100
 I mean, and then you basically...

614
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,700
 Or you can buy a magazine and all those little cards fall out of it that you can do subscriptions

615
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,580
 and stuff like that for.

616
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,660
 That's so sad.

617
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,660
 That's so sad, right?

618
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:07,580
 But anyways, this guy, maybe it was his favorite job in the world, Max Alberts, traveling magazine

619
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,060
 subscription salesman.

620
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:12,500
 I remember once this salesman came to my mom's house.

621
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,500
 Why?

622
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,340
 It was my house too when I was a kid.

623
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:19,220
 This traveling salesman came to our house to sell us like a vacuum cleaner or set of

624
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,260
 knives or whatever he was selling, right?

625
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:25,820
 And we had a little bowl of milk laid out for a local cat.

626
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,820
 It wasn't our cat.

627
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,900
 It was like a stray cat, but we fed him milk every day.

628
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:34,020
 I mean, we didn't know that milk causes cats to have diarrhea everywhere, but it wasn't

629
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,020
 our cat.

630
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,060
 So we didn't care.

631
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,420
 And so we'd set this milk out.

632
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:41,340
 And I remember one day my mom, like, I see her talking at the door and she's like, "No,

633
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,340
 no, that's okay.

634
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,340
 We don't want anything."

635
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,180
 And then she goes, "Oh, oh, I'm so sorry.

636
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,820
 I'm so sorry."

637
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:51,180
 And then she shuts the door and I was like, "What happened?"

638
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,980
 And mom goes, "Oh my goodness.

639
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,980
 I feel so bad.

640
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,980
 I feel so bad."

641
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:56,980
 I go, "What?

642
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,980
 Okay, now what's going on?"

643
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:02,140
 And she goes, "Well, this man came to the house and he looked down on his luck.

644
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,100
 He looked like things were not going well in his life.

645
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,620
 And he's a door-to-door salesman.

646
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,540
 So that's a really difficult job.

647
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,940
 And he already looked like things weren't going well.

648
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:13,420
 And knocked on the door, tried to sell my mom something.

649
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,420
 She said, "No."

650
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:19,420
 And then as he went to leave, he stepped in.

651
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:27,100
 He stepped in the bowl of cat milk, spilling cat milk all over his pant leg.

652
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,100
 Right?

653
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,100
 It wasn't cat milk.

654
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,780
 It wasn't milk from a cat.

655
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:34,380
 But it was a sizable amount of milk.

656
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,580
 He got it all over his leg.

657
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,340
 And I remember my mom, she felt really bad about it.

658
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,020
 Because here you have this guy who's already things aren't going good for him.

659
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,740
 Now he has milk all over his clothes.

660
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,700
 The worst material, because you've got to wash it right away.

661
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,740
 Otherwise you're going to start smelling like sour milk.

662
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,740
 It's all over his sock.

663
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,400
 It's all over his shoe.

664
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:54,220
 And my mom's telling the story and she can't finish it without kind of smiling, right?

665
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:59,260
 Because it's also kind of, it's like you're so down on your luck and then you get milk.

666
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,500
 And then you get milk all over you.

667
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,260
 And we always, we always felt super bad for the guy.

668
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:09,620
 But me and my brother and my mom always used that as an end of a phrase.

669
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:13,340
 Whenever we were talking about bad news, we're like, "Yeah, and Johnny, not only did he fall

670
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,420
 down and break his ankle, but then his girlfriend left him."

671
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,660
 And then he stepped in some milk.

672
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:22,140
 Like that was always the way for us to end a phrase of a streak of battle luck with

673
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,400
 stepping in some milk.

674
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,240
 So maybe that, maybe that salesman is listening to us right now.

675
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,120
 Anyways, cat milk aside or just milk for cats aside.

676
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,620
 1963.

677
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,680
 Max Alberts is driving down the street.

678
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,680
 He sees the woman, it's a woman again this time.

679
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,560
 Dressed in all black, soaking wet clothes.

680
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,480
 Now this is interesting.

681
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,280
 Because all of these stories were a local legend in the area.

682
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:50,380
 And then they became campfire stories that people told all over West Virginia.

683
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:55,220
 And then they were collected in a book of writings by a guy named Jim Comstock.

684
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,920
 He wrote, wrote about this story in the 1970s.

685
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:02,280
 It's been nationwide since.

686
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,940
 This one's interesting because this one, he's driving down the road and this phantom, this

687
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:12,340
 woman walks out of the bushes, dripping wet, black clothes, a phantom, an oracle of death.

688
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,600
 And the guy doesn't hear what she says.

689
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:19,160
 She's driving down the road and he sees her step out into the road and she points at him

690
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,440
 and she's saying something.

691
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,280
 But he doesn't hear what she's saying.

692
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,280
 What?

693
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,280
 I'm sorry, Layton, what?

694
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,280
 She's like, "Kennedy will die!"

695
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,780
 He's like, "I can't hear you."

696
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,780
 I'm like, "What?"

697
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,780
 And the car's super loud.

698
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,500
 She's like, "I'm trying to warn you, Kennedy's gone."

699
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,780
 He doesn't stop.

700
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,640
 He just keeps on driving.

701
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:41,260
 And this story is included in this collection because in 1963 is when Kennedy died.

702
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:44,840
 Now he apparently told people when he got to the next town, it was super weird, he was

703
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,800
 driving down the road, this woman popped out of the bushes, started yelling at me and I

704
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,320
 just kept driving and people are like, "Uhhh."

705
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,780
 And then Kennedy dies that year.

706
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:58,360
 What's interesting about that part of the story is that if the story is made up, that

707
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,900
 wouldn't be in there, right?

708
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:04,880
 If the story is 100% made up, you wouldn't add it in a part where the guy doesn't hear

709
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,880
 the warning.

710
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,880
 Does that make sense?

711
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,640
 Like if you're, I've always used, I've used this for a couple different times, a couple

712
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,640
 different episodes.

713
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,860
 If the story is made up, it should be more, a little more sensational.

714
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,220
 It doesn't have to be over the top.

715
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:18,580
 It doesn't have to be that she actually like hopped out of his glove box and said, "Lee

716
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,820
 Harvey all is well, it's gonna shoot."

717
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:23,700
 You don't have to have it that dramatic, but he should at least have heard the warning.

718
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,140
 Because if you're making it up, you can change the facts however you want.

719
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:31,220
 The fact that he didn't hear the warning at all and simply told someone later that this

720
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,800
 happened and everyone was like, "Oh."

721
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:38,500
 Makes me think that the story might be true.

722
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,840
 So that's kind of creepy that for whatever reason this location, now there are five

723
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:47,160
 different places in West Virginia called Horse Creek.

724
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,400
 Nobody knows which one it actually is.

725
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,960
 Which again, makes me, if it was made up, you would say it was this horse creek and this

726
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,360
 location and these, these are what happened each time.

727
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,880
 This is what the person said.

728
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,040
 You can make it super specific because you're making it up out of a whole cloth.

729
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,160
 This is the interesting part.

730
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,160
 Let's say that this is true.

731
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,640
 Let's accept that these stories are true.

732
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,340
 There's a location for whatever reason, Horse Creek in West Virginia, that a phantom will

733
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:17,140
 appear whenever a president is assassinated.

734
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:22,980
 If that story is true, you know as well as I do that there is a secret service agent

735
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,100
 in that area now.

736
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,980
 The first time, there was no secret service back when Lincoln was killed.

737
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,700
 No one would think about it.

738
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,540
 The second time when Garfield died, you'd be like, "Oh, that's kind of weird, right?"

739
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:39,680
 But by the third time that it happens, you know if the CIA is testing psychic abilities,

740
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,800
 walking through walls, all this stuff, you know that someone in the government has heard

741
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:47,080
 these stories and said, "Let's find this horse creek."

742
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,800
 There's only five of them.

743
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,920
 And if they don't know which one's which, you could have someone in each location.

744
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:56,760
 You could easily pay someone to just fish all day long at Horse Creek.

745
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,000
 It doesn't have to be the same guy.

746
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 They can work shifts.

747
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,600
 But you'd have someone there all the time.

748
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,720
 What would it really cost?

749
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,380
 You have five locations, rotating shifts.

750
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:10,060
 You have two to three people working a camp at a time.

751
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:18,500
 So for 15 employees, you could predict whether or not a president was going to be assassinated.

752
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:22,900
 And what's interesting is that the last sighting was in 1963.

753
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:28,180
 In all of these sightings, the person warns of the death ahead of time.

754
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:31,740
 Let's them know it's coming.

755
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:36,640
 So is it possible that after 1963, word gets out about this urban legend of West Virginia,

756
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:41,440
 which is right in that hub of you have the Pentagon, you have Langley, all that stuff.

757
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:47,880
 They say, "Let's take some agents, have them camp out, big ol' they can sit there and

758
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:53,880
 make s'mores all day long, big ol' jamboree, we can come and visit on the weekends."

759
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:57,440
 And if this happens again, we'll be warned.

760
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,840
 In the 1980s, Reagan was almost assassinated.

761
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,840
 He was shot.

762
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,900
 You got a secret, as the guy was pulling the trigger, putting bullets into Reagan, one

763
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:10,580
 of the secret service agents jumped in and stuck his finger in between the trigger and

764
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:13,140
 the other part of the gun where the trigger goes.

765
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:17,100
 He stuck his finger in behind the trigger so another shot couldn't get out.

766
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,260
 That's one in a million.

767
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,220
 That's what training's for.

768
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,980
 Sticking your finger as it's going pop, as that trigger's pulling back, pop.

769
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,820
 Pop his finger goes in and jams the gun.

770
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,660
 You can't get another shot off.

771
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:35,440
 Is it possible that on that day people were prepared for an attack on the president?

772
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,520
 Is it possible that there are creeks in West Virginia staffed by secret service agents

773
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,960
 just in case?

774
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,920
 It may seem like a tall tale, it may seem like a campfire story, but when you have the life

775
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:53,340
 of the leader of the free world on the line, is it really that much trouble to have a couple

776
00:35:53,340 --> 00:36:01,780
 secret service agents fishing, hunting, and waiting for a spirit to warn them of an assassination?

777
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:16,180
 DeadRabberRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

778
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:19,100
 You don't have to listen to it every day, but I'm glad you listened to it today.

779
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,500
 Stay safe, be kind.

780
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,900
 I love you guys and I will see you tomorrow.

781
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,900
 Bye.

782
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,900
 Bye.

783
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,900
 Bye.

784
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:24,900
 Bye.

785
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:40,300
