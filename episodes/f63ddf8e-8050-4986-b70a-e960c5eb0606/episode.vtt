00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.320
 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.280
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.400
 They're not just treating the disease.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.520
 They're caring for Olivia.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.920
 They know my baby's name.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.000
 They make me happy.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.360
 And they make me feel better.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.600
 Children's Hospital in Illinois.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.680
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.960
 Was an Australian school shut down

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.960
 because wolves began to roam the hallways?

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.360
 And then we meet a 15-year-old boy and his family

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.040
 who move into their new home.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.960
 Little does he realize that this home will drive him mad.

 Welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

 I'm your host, Jason Barbiner.

 Now, Sir Gio, I'm going to throw a big arm around you.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.800
 It's not my arm.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.720
 It's an arm I found in the hallway.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.640
 And I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys

 A nice leisurely journey all the way across the world

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.240
 Specifically, we're headed to Melbourne, Australia.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.360
 And this story takes place around 2018.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.680
 The person who posted the story online--

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.680
 they didn't give it a real name.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.880
 We're going to call him Tony.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.280
 But Tony said, I'm pretty sure that's the year.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.200
 When I remember it, pretty sure it's 2018.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.360
 He goes, it's possible that it's 2017,

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.560
 but I'm pretty sure it's 2018.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.720
 Tony says, I'm pretty sure that was the year.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.440
 Things have kind of blurred.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.280
 The story itself is kind of odd.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.360
 But he goes, I'm pretty sure that's the year.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.360
 It's possible that maybe I'm off by a year,

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.240
 but I don't think so.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.320
 So we're going to place the story around 2018.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.360
 And Tony said, this is how it all played out.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.800
 One day I was at school.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.760
 I'm assuming high school.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.520
 He didn't specify that.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.440
 Anyways, let's just assume high school.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.000
 We don't have a ton of details about this story.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.280
 But I find it very interesting.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.240
 And Tony does too.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.840
 This is a mystery he's been trying

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.760
 to solve for the past four years, five years at this point.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.320
 Tony said one day I was at school.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.240
 And all of a sudden, the teacher said, OK, everyone,

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.840
 we've got to get out of this classroom,

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.000
 go to this main area.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.240
 So apparently their school was set up with buildings.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.560
 And each building had kind of a common area in it,

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.000
 the way he explained this.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.840
 The teacher goes, everyone get up.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.240
 Let's go to that common area.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.000
 Chop, chop, let's go.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.760
 Let's go, let's go.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.680
 And everyone's like, what?

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.160
 Tony's like, huh?

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.240
 But they do it, right?

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.160
 Because you're a student.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.520
 The teacher's telling you to do something.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.200
 I'm sure there's some cool kid in the back

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.920
 smoking a cigarette.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.400
 He's like, whatever, teach.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.640
 I'm going to do my own thing.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.680
 But the reason why people weren't really rebelling

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.880
 is because this seemed like an active shooter drill.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.840
 But not forget the drill part.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.720
 Forget the part where it's fake, where it's a practice run.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.760
 Tony goes, generally, when a drill was going to happen,

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.440
 an announcement came over the loudspeaker.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.240
 And it was just so it doesn't freak everyone out.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.960
 They said, we're going to have an active shooter drill.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.680
 So you always have to have that last word.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.440
 And everyone were like, ah, I didn't know you

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.680
 scheduled these things in advance.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.320
 We're going to have an active shooter drill right now.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.040
 What do they say?

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.880
 It's like ABC.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.040
 There's an acronym.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.280
 It's like stop, hide, defend yourself or something.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.840
 I might want to be up on this, the amount of active shootings

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.480
 in the world these days.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.320
 I don't want to be sitting there going, what was the last one?

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.680
 What was the last one as I'm getting riddled with bullets

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.320
 in Safeway?

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.400
 Anyways, normally they announce that there's a drill going on.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.240
 So they're like, who's going to sit around?

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.200
 They're like, what's the acronym again?

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.760
 They-- that's normally what happens.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.040
 So when the teacher all of a sudden

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.280
 is like, everyone get up or going on this common area,

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.200
 people are a little concerned by this.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.920
 And then they all get in this common area.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.160
 And Tony notices there's other classrooms

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.960
 from their building also showing up in this common area.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.800
 And if that's not alarming enough, right?

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.560
 Because at this point, you think that it's a real shooting

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.640
 going on.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.440
 All of a sudden, the teachers say, OK,

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.840
 everyone start closing the blinds so no one can see

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.640
 into this room and lock the doors.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.120
 Those are good things to do, right?

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.240
 And again, at this point, you'd be thinking, it's a drill.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.440
 Maybe they just forgot to announce it.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.280
 Well, when the teachers then instruct the students

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.600
 to move the lockers, to move the lockers to block the doors

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.880
 from opening up into this common area,

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.360
 people are going to go concerned.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.360
 People are getting a little concerned.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.600
 This was definitely not something they practiced

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.760
 during any drill.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.520
 OK, everyone, let's redecorate the entire school.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.400
 But it's just a drill.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.320
 No, they were now moving lockers to barricade the doors.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.560
 No announcement, remember?

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.280
 Just all of a sudden, in the middle of class,

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.200
 your teacher says, everyone go in this room

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.880
 and let's barricade ourselves into it.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.720
 Now, the teachers were telling the students,

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.240
 don't worry, it's just a drill.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.840
 It's just they're sweating profusely.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.120
 It's just a drill, kids.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.200
 Don't worry about it.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.080
 Even though this is none of the protocol

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.720
 that we've ever had for any drill ever, this is just a drill.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.320
 And so the students are starting to get a little relaxed,

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.240
 probably except for the ones that are carding lockers around

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.040
 and sending them down.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.840
 Hey, boss, where do you want me to put this one?

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.040
 I'm assuming that's where the football team came in clutch,

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.960
 picking up all those lockers.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.560
 The teacher said it's just a drill.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.120
 Students are starting to relax a bit.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:59.400
 But kids, they're relaxed.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.240
 They start kind of talking at conversational level.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.200
 Some girls laughing at some joke and the guys over there

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.280
 having a tickle contest or whatever.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.200
 And the teachers go, shh.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.720
 It's just a drill.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.440
 But nobody can know we're in here.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:15.940
 Shhh.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:22.560
 Kids are getting nervous again because this is not

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.000
 part of the drill procedure.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
 They're getting shush.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.320
 So now they're thinking, OK, this isn't a drill.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.440
 The teachers were just lying to us.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.800
 Something real bad is going on.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.240
 Something so bad is going on in our high school

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.800
 that simply talking at a conversational level

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.280
 may bring that bad thing here.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:54.240
 In the absence of information, information will be created.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.760
 That's something just part of the human condition.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.400
 So this murmur, this very quiet murmur

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.200
 begins to go through the crowd of kids.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.360
 Tony doesn't know how the story originated.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.280
 He has no idea where this came from.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.880
 But apparently the kids started saying

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:20.200
 that there was a wolf in the school.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.880
 Now, I'm not from Australia.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.400
 Tony obviously is.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.040
 And he goes, there's no wolves around here.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.320
 It's none.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.960
 We're an hour from the closest zoo.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.920
 So couldn't be-- which actually, listen, man,

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:38.320
 you're going to have to do an active shooter drill in your school.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.360
 And you hope it's never an active shooter, obviously.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.720
 But if you ever have to go through this routine,

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.920
 that would be kind of dope.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.640
 If it was just a bunch of animals rampaging through your school,

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.720
 bunch of zoo animals, the chimpanzees

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.120
 are taking over the cafeteria, and elephant

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.400
 has demolished the gymnasium.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.160
 I'd be down with that.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.680
 That'd be kind of cool.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.960
 He goes, it's not a wolf from the local zoo.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.520
 There's no wolves around here.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:06.400
 So how in the world could a wolf have gotten into the school?

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.000
 So Tony asks the teacher.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.840
 He goes, hey, I'm hearing that there's a wolf or wolves,

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:13.440
 really.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.520
 Could be more than one.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:18.240
 But I'm hearing that there's wolves in the school.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.040
 Is that true?

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.320
 And the teacher's like, yeah, sure, just be quiet.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.040
 Just be quiet.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.320
 Wolves or whatever.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.520
 So they get there saying wolves?

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.680
 OK, yeah.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.400
 Just go sit down.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.120
 Be quiet.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.280
 Tony said the teacher was super dismissive.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.240
 But again, like in the absence of information,

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.400
 you're not hearing what you're afraid to hear, right?

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.560
 You're not hearing gunshots.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.240
 On the other hand, you're not hearing growls.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:50.080
 And it's probably more likely, unfortunately,

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.320
 that it's a guy with a gun than it is that a wolf somehow

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:58.360
 escaped a zoo, walked an hour.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.960
 It was probably quicker for a wolf, right?

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:00.880
 Because they got four legs.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.920
 So a half hour, and then come to your school.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.240
 He said that we stayed barricaded in this area

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.280
 until the end of school, which maybe they only

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.720
 had a half hour left, and it wasn't that big of a deal.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.840
 Other than the unending terror in their hearts,

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.760
 it wasn't that big of a deal.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.640
 It's possible that this was like right before lunch.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.320
 And they're like, oh, I'm so hungry.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:24.920
 I'm so hungry.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.000
 I get eaten a wolf.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.840
 He says we stayed in that area until the end of school.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.400
 And then when school was out, we moved the lockers.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.040
 So we unbarricaded the place.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.640
 We moved the lockers back to their original position.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.240
 And their teachers are like, good luck trying to get home.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.880
 There's wolves, maybe?

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.160
 Out there, kids, you no longer are responsibility.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.560
 Head home.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:52.280
 The day is over.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.120
 Would you have to imagine?

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.440
 They'd be very nervous to walk home, right?

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.920
 You're like, hey, wait a second.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.240
 Is they're pushing you out of the school?

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.280
 Did you see there are wolves in here?

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.480
 Or now they're out there if they're not in the school anymore.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.040
 Now they're just prowling the neighborhood.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.520
 Anyways, they are all sent home.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:15.400
 Now, this story makes so little sense

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:21.440
 that even Tony was like, that must have been a dream.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.520
 It must have been a dream.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.960
 It just doesn't make any sense.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.360
 There was no announcement at all.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.160
 All of a sudden, the teacher just somehow

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.360
 knew to put us all in this common area.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.800
 It wasn't like there was an announcement.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:34.840
 And then wolves?

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:35.720
 Like, that's so weird.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.080
 There's no wolves around here.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.080
 Maybe Montana might have a problem with wolves in their school.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.600
 But that's the team.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.360
 They're the timber wolves.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.200
 So as time went on, he just kind of chalked it up

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:48.920
 to a weird dream.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.320
 Nobody talked about it at school, apparently.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.240
 Or maybe they did.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.640
 And Tony's not cool enough to be in the in-crowdy and no friends.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.560
 He's like, oh, that was the closest I was to the rest

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.400
 of the students when we were all crammed into that room

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.360
 waiting to die.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.360
 Tony doesn't really reveal if they talked about it

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:04.880
 the next day.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.200
 I mean, how could they?

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.560
 But anyways, he goes, it doesn't make sense, right?

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.840
 None of this story makes sense.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.360
 I must have been dreaming it.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.800
 And he kind of chalked it up to just a super realistic dream.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.040
 Well, years later, he was hanging out

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.240
 with a friend of his.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.680
 They're talking, talking about the good old times.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.480
 And his friend goes, hey, you know, speaking of the good old

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.520
 times, wasn't that weird that one day we all got put

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.440
 in that common area?

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.880
 Because those wolves showed up.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.280
 And they were like walking around the school.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.120
 And Tony's like, OK, really?

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.080
 I thought that was just my dream.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.440
 I didn't know that was real.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.040
 I don't know if he actually said that out loud.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.840
 And then the friend's like, am I just a dream as well?

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.880
 Are we all nothing but a dream?

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.200
 He goes, when my friend brought it up, I was like, oh, OK.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.000
 So it was real.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.120
 I didn't just imagine it.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.280
 It wasn't just a dream.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.240
 We did get locked in that room.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.760
 And he said, as he's come back--

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.480
 and again, after his friend talked about it--

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.120
 as he has come back to visit home when he's in the Melbourne

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:12.000
 area, one day he ran into a few teachers.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.760
 It must have been a school function, because who else

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.000
 wants to hang out with teachers?

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.360
 He talked to a couple of teachers.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.520
 And he was like, hey, yeah, remember me, Tony?

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.240
 I was that guy who didn't have any friends.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.440
 And I didn't talk to anyone that much.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.480
 What was up with that whole thing?

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.520
 Remember when you guys made us all go into that big area

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.720
 and we moved the lockers in front of the doors?

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.080
 Because the wolves showed up?

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.000
 That can't be true, right?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.040
 And he said he talked to a couple different teachers

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:39.640
 about this.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.720
 And all of them were like, that never happened.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:43.480
 That never happened.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.760
 He's like, well, yeah, I didn't think so either.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.360
 I thought I was just dreaming it.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:52.560
 But one of my friends said that he remembered the wolves as well.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.560
 So what was that?

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.800
 And the teachers would first deny it.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.000
 They'd be like, it didn't happen.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.320
 Then they would say, quit asking me.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:03.160
 Quit asking me questions about that time we locked you

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.640
 into that room for hours on end.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.280
 It was nothing.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.320
 Don't ask about it.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.920
 And it never happened.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.720
 Which has made Tony, of course, on the beginning of us

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.280
 even more suspicious.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.760
 And Tony started to think, listen,

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.360
 the most logical thing is that there was some madman

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.320
 in there with a gun.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.240
 But he goes, I tried looking up news articles

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.880
 to see if there was any reporting of a crazy criminal

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.520
 with a gun or something happening.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.400
 And there's nothing.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:33.880
 I couldn't find anything that mentioned my school and wolves

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.920
 or my school and an armed intruder.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:40.360
 Both of those would make the news.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.640
 Both of those would make the news.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:45.360
 If wolves invaded your school, especially wolves,

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.880
 weren't native to your country, it'd

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:52.640
 be that you'd start the news program like that.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:53.520
 Because it's scary.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.800
 And journalists love scaring you.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:56.880
 News people love scaring you.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:01.720
 But anyways, yeah, he could never find anything about this.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.840
 He knows that it happened because there are two people.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.000
 He remembered it and then thought it was a dream

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.240
 and then someone else mentioned it.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.960
 And then other people that were in the know,

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.720
 you know, teachers, they are like, it never happened.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.800
 And quit asking me about it.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.560
 It's interesting because he posted this online.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:21.040
 Tony posted this under the name Will ZY.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.480
 And a couple other people brought up--

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.680
 this is kind of the most common theory,

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.440
 because basically he's like, what could this have been?

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.920
 And this is the only--

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.400
 I shouldn't say the only possible one.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.960
 This is the most probable one.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:36.880
 And that is there was an estranged parent

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:41.680
 who came in to get their kid.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.960
 And the reason why that makes sense

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.160
 is because you wouldn't reveal that.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.960
 You wouldn't reveal that to the student body.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.200
 You probably wouldn't reveal that to the parents as well.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.440
 Because here's the thing.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.880
 Let's say if they're like, hey, guys,

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.920
 you have to be quiet and hide in this room

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:02.040
 because Judy's dad is an alcoholic nutcase.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:06.960
 And he's coming to take Judy no matter what.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.680
 Now you've just revealed all of Judy's dirty laundry.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.920
 Everyone's going to be talking about how Judy has a dad who

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.000
 can't stop drinking.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.160
 And it's a nutcase.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.160
 They actually use that term.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.720
 He's a nutcase, kids.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.520
 You know what I mean?

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.040
 You wouldn't want to gossip like that.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.320
 So it's possible.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.320
 But here's the thing with that.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:28.920
 The school may have not revealed that information

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:29.800
 to the students.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:34.320
 They may have had a dangerous individual in the sense

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:38.000
 that they were dangerous to the people they were looking for

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.360
 and anyone trying to stop them.

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.160
 So walking around looking for his daughter

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.800
 and you happen to be the custodian,

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.720
 you're listening to your headphones,

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.040
 you don't hear a guy walking around.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:53.160
 And he's like, go, Judy, Judy, it's your paw.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.320
 Come on out.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.520
 Apparently, apparently, I'm a hillbilly.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.600
 I have a hillbilly voice.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.760
 And the custodian doesn't hear that.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:05.440
 And then he bumps into Judy's dad and Judy's dad strangles him.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.200
 Sorry, Judy.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:10.520
 Sorry to out your nutcase homicidal dad.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.960
 But then I mean, I guess if he wasn't

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.160
 at any match for the wolves as well,

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.440
 he's walking around with his headphones on.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.720
 The point is, is like, you would not reveal that to the kids,

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.480
 but you would have to reveal that to the other parents.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.800
 Like, those kids would go home and parents would go,

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:26.520
 how was school today?

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.000
 And they're like, it was absolutely terrifying.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.480
 A bunch of wolves showed up.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.600
 And we were locked in a common area.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:38.000
 Obviously, the parents are going to call the--

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.120
 parents are going to call the schools.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.440
 They're not going to be like, oh, that's interesting.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:45.880
 Well, at work, we were beset upon by a flock of peacocks.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.320
 No, the parents are going to be like, wait, what'd you say?

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.640
 And then they're going to call the school

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.400
 and be like, why is my son telling me

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:55.840
 that he got locked in a room because the wolves were after him?

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.880
 And the school can't just be like, oh, don't talk about it.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.520
 I don't want to talk about it and quit asking questions.

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:01.840
 The parents are going to be like, no, tell us.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.200
 And the school would say, well, we

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:08.240
 had a situation with a girl's father walking around.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.280
 The custodian was strangled to death,

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.680
 but don't worry, everyone else was safe.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.320
 That's who Tony should ask, honestly.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.640
 That's what I would do if I was Tony.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.040
 I would ask my parents and be like, hey, remember that time

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.400
 when I told you when I came home directly from school

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.080
 and told you I was locked in a room because of wolves?

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:24.800
 What was that?

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.480
 Do you guys remember that?

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.120
 And here's a grief of our-- imagine if his parents go,

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.160
 no, we don't remember that.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.680
 And he's like, no, I'm pretty sure I told you.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.720
 And they go, shh.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.960
 Quit asking questions.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.040
 It never happened.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:43.400
 That would be absolutely terrifying.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.840
 That's going to be the official ending

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:48.200
 to my "Ghost Bumps" novel, "Wolves in the School."

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.360
 Question mark?

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.520
 By JC Stein.

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:54.600
 Don't steal that mediocre idea.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.600
 Sergio, let's go ahead and toss you the keys

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.240
 to the carbon or copper we are leaving behind Melbourne,

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.760
 Australia.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:04.440
 Why us all the way out to a house in the suburbs?

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:09.200
 [HUMMING]

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.520
 The year is 2015.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:19.640
 And a family is hopping out of a car in front of a house.

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.000
 Maybe it's beautiful.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.440
 They did not describe it.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.360
 They didn't describe it.

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.720
 But imagine it.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:25.760
 It's a nice-looking house.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.240
 It's not a rundown beater.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.960
 There's no wolves anywhere nearby.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.600
 It's a nice house.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:36.200
 And this young woman we're going to call her Amanda

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:43.200
 is breathing a sigh after a long trip, going finally,

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.040
 we're home.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:44.880
 She didn't say that.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.360
 She didn't say it was a long trip.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.600
 She didn't say she sighed heavily either.

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.880
 But you know, creative license.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:53.480
 She gets out of the car and she's like, ah, yes, home.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.200
 The place that I've wondered about for so long.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.480
 She goes on this 10-minute monologue

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.640
 in deep description of the home.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.320
 Amanda's just moving into this home with her family.

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:04.960
 She has a mom and a dad.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:06.800
 And then a-- Amanda's not her real name.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:11.440
 She goes online by the name Kindly Dirt 5752.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.200
 We're going to call her Amanda.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:13.960
 She has a brother.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:14.800
 She doesn't name him.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.120
 We're going to call him Brian.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:22.560
 Her 15-year-old brother Brian gets out of the car as well.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:26.040
 And he takes in a deep breath of fresh air.

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.920
 Ah, yes.

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:28.920
 Oxygen.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:32.240
 My favorite treat in the morning.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:36.840
 A little bit of oxygen straight into the lungs.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.480
 They're moving into this house.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:42.240
 And Amanda says previously-- so they're moving in in 2015.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:47.120
 Previously, this house was owned by a pastor and his family.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:48.400
 So you figure.

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.680
 It's probably a pretty nice kept up place, right?

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.120
 Men of the cloth are not known to have

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:59.920
 cockroach infestations or leave feces in holes in the wall.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.280
 You know, an upstanding guy, generally speaking.

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.240
 And so they walk into this house.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:08.480
 And everything's going to be OK.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:12.840
 And she said Brian was a good guy, a really good student,

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:16.880
 just kind of like a normal dude.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:20.280
 Nothing crazy about him at all.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.360
 And no history of mental illness.

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.760
 And Amanda says they've lived there for eight years in this

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:26.680
 home.

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:35.720
 And each year, Brian got a little more mentally ill.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:39.160
 Now, you may not notice it the first year, right?

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:42.080
 When Brian comes home from school and they're like,

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.240
 he's all hallucinating wolves.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:47.240
 He's like, I've been attacked by wolves.

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.160
 Locked the school down.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.160
 Locked the school down.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.440
 And they're like, what?

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.640
 He's not that mentally ill right off the bat.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.440
 He's actually really not that mentally ill by the end.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:00.280
 But anyways, so at first, he was just a little mentally ill.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:03.600
 And you would think, oh, you know, growing pains,

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.040
 growing pains, all teenage boys go through that thing

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:13.200
 where they think they're being attacked by bats in the back.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.360
 I really shouldn't be laughing at this.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.960
 For eight-- let me talk, so I'll just keep making jokes.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.480
 Let's just skip ahead a bit.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.960
 Each year, for eight years, he got worse and worse and worse.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:27.040
 I'm not going to go into detail because he started to--

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.480
 this is what he was actually doing.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.480
 He wasn't having full-on hallucinations.

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:34.440
 But anyways, first, he would just stay in his room

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.800
 all the time, which was out of character for Brian.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.000
 I stay isolated from people for long periods of time.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
 I like to be alone.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.120
 But it was out of character for Brian.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:50.000
 And he also liked to sit in the dark with no lights on,

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.160
 which was also out of character for Brian and really most people.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.760
 And before you go, well, I like sitting in the dark.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.320
 I like to just watch movies.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.080
 He wasn't watching movies.

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.960
 He wasn't playing his Switch.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.640
 He wasn't on his laptop.

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:11.360
 He would sit in a pitch black room for hours on end.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:15.600
 I wouldn't-- that doesn't necessarily make you mentally ill.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.760
 But if it's not what you normally do, it is weird.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.040
 I mean, if that's something you're like, I love sitting in the--

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.120
 I love sitting in the pitch dark.

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:27.360
 Refreshes my eyeballs cold sleep.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.800
 Do it eight hours a day.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:29.840
 Am I mentally ill?

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.560
 You're all like going on a webMD to check your symptoms.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:33.880
 No, you're fine.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.400
 But again, if it's out of character for you,

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:40.280
 that's when you start to look at some sort of mental illness.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:44.360
 He got rid of his phone and his television set.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.120
 He's like, give these out of here.

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.800
 I'm just going to sit in the dark.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.840
 And he sits in the dark again.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.200
 I don't have a television.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:52.720
 No more.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.120
 It's actually right here on the floor.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.200
 I'm touching it with my foot.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.440
 I just keep it here just in case I want to watch something.

00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.000
 I never do.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.320
 So just sitting on my floor in the middle of the living room,

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.160
 you're like, Jason, I think you can easily be classified

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:09.520
 as mentally insane for a numerous amount of reasons.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.680
 Anyways, now if all of a sudden your boy starts

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.720
 sitting in the dark all the time, he's a teenager,

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.720
 you think maybe he's going through a goth phase.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.320
 He doesn't want to do it right.

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.000
 You're like, hey, Brian, you're supposed to dress in all black,

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.160
 not exist in all black.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.320
 That's whatever.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.120
 Someone wants to be alone in a pitch black room, whatever.

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:36.800
 He also then starts to hear voices and see shadows.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.080
 I'm hard in a pitch black room.

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:44.360
 I'm telling you, this is not supposed to be a funny story.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:47.720
 I did not plan on this me laughing so much.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.400
 I don't know why I'm finding it so amusing.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.720
 But it's true.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.040
 It would be kind of hard to see shadow people in a pitch black

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.720
 room, but I digress.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:59.880
 He's hearing voices.

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:02.000
 He's seeing shadow people.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.640
 At this point now, you're thinking, now he's hallucinating.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.880
 Like it's not just about being in the dark.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:11.560
 Now he has an active psychological problem.

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:17.040
 He would also have these quick changes in personality.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:21.280
 One example that Amanda gave was that within one minute,

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.360
 he would switch topics.

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:25.880
 He-- Amanda said one day he was talking to mom,

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:30.920
 and he was telling mom how he had sold his soul to the devil.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:35.200
 And then within a minute, switches to talking--

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.000
 Bible quotes.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.840
 He's quoting the Bible.

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:41.920
 So it's just kind of jarring, right?

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.000
 Also, if you're just sitting there,

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.120
 and your son comes downstairs and says, I sold my soul to Lucifer,

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:53.280
 that's-- that in and of itself is pretty alarming.

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:57.760
 And he also talked about being abducted by aliens.

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:02.560
 Now, I know that all of this stuff I talk about on this show,

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:03.880
 I understand that.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.880
 I've talked about all of these subjects on the show.

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.200
 But this was alarming.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:12.560
 And again, I've been talking about this stuff since I was a kid.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:17.480
 We did that recent episode about that possible spy ring in Canada.

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.320
 And what was alarming to the family--

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:20.880
 I'll put it in the show notes, but what

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:24.200
 was alarming to the non-spies of the family

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.200
 was everything was totally fine for five years.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.400
 This woman had married this guy.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:32.360
 And then last Christmas, he's like, I hate Christmas.

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:34.360
 And I don't want to celebrate Christmas anymore.

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.400
 And I'm going to make it miserable for everyone.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.360
 Also, I don't work on Saturdays.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.120
 That all happened within a week.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.360
 He'd been one person for five years.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:47.160
 And all of a sudden, he's like, nope, not working at all on Saturdays.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.280
 And I hate Christmas.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:50.720
 So that's alarming.

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:53.880
 If over time, he'd been like, you know what?

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.800
 Saturdays are too nice to work on.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.520
 And then a year later, he's like, man,

00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.120
 I really miss having Saturdays.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.120
 And then by year five, he's like, I'm not working on Saturdays anymore.

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.400
 That's fine.

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:07.640
 That's totally like a legit slow morphine.

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.920
 I'm not saying that you only do one thing a year.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.480
 You're like, oh, man, I really wanted to start this hobby.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.560
 But Jason said, I have to just do a little bit each year.

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.440
 You want to build a model train set.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.960
 You just have one wheel.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.280
 You're like, oh, see you next year, model train.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:23.480
 And you know what I mean?

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:24.880
 And then to hate Christmas.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.440
 People will slowly just be like, I'm over it.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.960
 I'm tired of all the consumerism.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:31.320
 I'm just not going to do Christmas this year.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.640
 My Christmas trees got smaller and smaller.

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.880
 They just disappeared.

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:35.800
 They did.

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.680
 I used to buy a little Christmas tree.

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.800
 And then it would just get smaller and smaller.

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:42.600
 And then I was like, whatever, I'm just done.

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.000
 Not done with Christmas.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:44.920
 I love Christmas.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.000
 But what do I need a tiny Christmas tree for?

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.960
 Anyways, the point is that he talked about all this stuff.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.360
 It all really kind of came out of the blue.

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:57.400
 As opposed to someone who talks about this stuff for years.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:01.840
 It's less insane if you talk about selling your soul

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:02.320
 to the devil.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.640
 I've never sold my soul to the devil.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:04.760
 I'm not saying that.

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.400
 I'm talking about these topics.

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:07.680
 I've talked about them for years.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:10.560
 That's far less insane than just blurting them out

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:11.760
 in the middle of the night.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:18.920
 Well, anyways, eventually he is either forced to seek treatment

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:19.880
 or get a diagnosis.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.160
 Or he willingly went.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:24.240
 But he ended up getting diagnosed with schizophrenia,

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:29.360
 psychosis, and bipolar disorder, among others, Amanda says.

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.160
 That wasn't it.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:34.000
 He got diagnosed with all of this stuff.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.240
 And then he got arrested.

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:43.720
 And Amanda doesn't say what charge he was arrested on.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:46.640
 I mean, pick your poison, right?

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.120
 But she said he got arrested generally when people don't

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:52.200
 say why it's the bad ones.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.680
 Like if you robbed a bank, tax evasion or something like that,

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:59.200
 stole a car, we would tell people that.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.760
 We would be like, yeah, my buddy got caught robbing a bank.

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.080
 I think even murdered too.

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.200
 As long as it wasn't somebody you knew.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.600
 Be like, yeah, my buddy, he's doing time for murder.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.680
 It's when you go-- I don't want to talk about it.

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:11.680
 I don't want to talk about it.

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:14.160
 It was wolf related.

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.280
 It was wolf related.

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:16.440
 I don't want to talk about it.

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.240
 What happened to your buddy?

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:17.840
 I don't want to talk about it.

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:18.440
 You got arrested.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.000
 That's the end of it.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.840
 That's when you think the worst.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:22.200
 Right?

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.600
 That's when you think, oh my god, what did this guy do?

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:28.240
 Anyways, he gets arrested.

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:31.800
 And Amanda says, listen, he was going to be gone for a while.

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:34.640
 The family decided that since he wouldn't be coming home

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:37.600
 for a while, we're going to clean his room.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:40.640
 We're going to go in and get it all organized.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.640
 Do you imagine it would be a--

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.720
 I imagine it would be a huge mess.

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.320
 There's no lights on.

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.720
 There could be soda cans everywhere in pizza boxes

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.280
 crawling with cockroaches.

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:49.960
 You wouldn't know.

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.920
 It wouldn't really bug you because you couldn't see him.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:30:00.360
 They also started leaving his door open and the light on.

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:04.520
 And it's interesting.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:05.720
 She doesn't specifically--

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.560
 I don't think it's a passive aggressive thing.

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.680
 I feel like it's almost--

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.120
 the family decided that it was like a cleansing.

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.520
 And she doesn't specifically say that either,

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:17.000
 but it could be subconsciously trying to cleanse the room

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.760
 in some way by exposing it to light.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.320
 But they leave the door open.

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.240
 They leave the light on.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.600
 They're cleaning the room.

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:28.760
 And what the family starts to realize

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:35.840
 is it is possible that Brian was not alone in that room.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:41.960
 She says that they begin noticing scratches in the carpet.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.280
 Which is interesting.

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:46.840
 I don't really know how that works.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.120
 How you scratch a carpet.

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.960
 But I mean, I guess if you scratched it hard enough,

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.440
 you could.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.560
 And she said they were inhuman scratches.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.480
 So it's not like someone was walking around

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.680
 and they didn't clip their toenails for a bit.

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:01.120
 They're cleaning up his room on their hands and knees

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.400
 and they're scratching the carpet up.

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.480
 No, she said they were inhuman scratches.

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.240
 And they would see him on the carpet

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:10.360
 and they would fix them.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.240
 Maybe it was like a thick carpet and you could kind of tell.

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:13.600
 I don't know.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.800
 Anyway, she's saying that there's inhuman scratches

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:19.640
 on the carpet and they would fix them.

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:20.920
 They're re-sewing.

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.200
 They're re-sewing the carpet.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.560
 How do you make a carpet, actually?

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:25.720
 Now that I think about it.

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:28.440
 Anyway, she says there's inhuman scratches on the carpet.

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.000
 They repair them.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.680
 They fix it.

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:35.920
 And then a new set of scratch marks would appear.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:42.200
 And she said as late as February 4th, 2023,

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:48.680
 brown stains began to appear on the walls of the room.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.800
 We've talked about this a lot on this show

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.640
 because it's one of the most terrifying things for me.

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.080
 And I'm not going to talk for too long about it.

00:31:55.080 --> 00:32:01.880
 But listen, I know mental illness is a real thing.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.600
 I know mental illness is a real thing.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.080
 And millions of people struggle with it every single day.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.480
 And some people struggle with it for the rest of their lives

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.440
 or for their entire lives.

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.080
 It's awful.

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:14.440
 A lot of people are able to live good lives,

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:17.600
 even though they have it.

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:21.360
 But I do believe mental illness is our real.

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.680
 That is, I'm not trying to imply anything

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.520
 by what I'm about to say.

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:27.480
 What I'm going to say is I do think

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:32.600
 that supernatural events can, yes,

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.720
 be a symptom of mental illness.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:36.800
 There's obviously people who are mentally ill who

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.760
 think they are seeing things that aren't there.

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:41.880
 And they aren't seeing ghosts or shadow people

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:44.000
 or aliens or anything like that.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.120
 They're hallucinating.

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.320
 They're having delusions, gangstalking.

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:50.200
 It's a perfect example of that.

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:56.000
 But I also believe that supernatural events can--

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:56.760
 I think they can--

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.960
 I don't want to say cause mental illness

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.440
 because I think that that's different.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:02.800
 That's implying something different.

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:06.920
 I think they can induce mental illness.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:07.960
 You're like, Jason, come on.

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.280
 That's a wiggle word.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:13.840
 I think that if you have somebody who is either

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:17.160
 prone to being mentally ill, the sad thing is,

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.840
 is that he is right in that age group.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.520
 He was 15 when they moved in.

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:26.680
 It's eight years later, so he would be about 23 now.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.640
 That's the age group where schizophrenia

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:32.400
 begins to show up in young men.

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:37.040
 So he's right in that danger zone for that.

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:41.080
 But I mean, I don't think that every mentally ill person is

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:42.000
 possessed by a demon.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.880
 And I don't think every case of mental illness

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.120
 is caused by a demon.

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:51.520
 But I do think that dealing with these types of entities,

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.440
 can--

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:56.200
 it can induce mental illness in people.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:59.080
 Whether they are prone to it and this type of entity

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:02.080
 is speeding it along or they were never

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:04.680
 going to suffer from any of these mental illnesses.

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:06.760
 Because there's no history of this in the family.

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:08.240
 There technically doesn't have to be,

00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:10.920
 but it's obviously, if you're predisposed to it,

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:13.840
 the chances of you having a severe mental illness is higher.

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:15.880
 I do think you could take somebody--

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.680
 it's a controversial statement probably,

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:20.040
 but I'm not on YouTube, so it doesn't matter.

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:24.240
 I think you can take somebody who has no history

00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:27.400
 of mental illness and would not be mentally ill in the future.

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:32.800
 How do they not cross a supernatural entity?

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.400
 I do believe that demons and other supernatural entities

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.720
 can cause mental illness.

00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:40.800
 And at the very least, interacting

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:44.560
 with these type of entities looks a lot like mental illness.

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.560
 I remember when I first started seeing Shadow People,

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.000
 we talked about it on the show.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.720
 I thought I was going crazy because I was seeing stuff

00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:53.840
 that shouldn't exist.

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:55.960
 I legit thought I was losing my mind

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.160
 and I was so worried about it.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.080
 Same thing when I started seeing ghosts.

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:03.560
 There's two separate times.

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.440
 Because there are really two separate types of entities,

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.040
 I thought I'm losing my mind.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.160
 These things don't exist.

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:10.440
 I never saw these things until I'm 17,

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:13.000
 which was when I first started seeing ghosts and hearing ghosts.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.080
 And I knew I was right in that age group

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.520
 for when schizophrenia starts to show up.

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:22.520
 And I thought I was losing my mind.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:26.120
 So the fact that just by interacting with these things

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:30.560
 simulates psychosis, I do believe

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:34.960
 that they can induce it as well.

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.680
 Do we know if that's the case here?

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:39.680
 That's kind of what Amanda seemed to be getting at.

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:42.320
 Like, he was--

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.480
 he did get diagnosed with all those mental illnesses,

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:51.760
 but there was something else in that room that was with him.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:55.520
 So how much of those actions were Brian individually making,

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.560
 shutting off the lights, cutting himself off from society,

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.760
 not having a phone or a television?

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:02.080
 How much of that was him?

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:04.160
 Because it's super out of character for him,

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:08.880
 and how much of it was this entity in that room.

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.440
 And I think it's super interesting.

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:14.240
 I was kind of being playful about it in the beginning

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.920
 that a man of the cloth, a pastor in his family,

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:20.560
 wouldn't have any poop in the walls or any sort of--

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:22.760
 they would treat the house nice and things like that.

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:26.440
 And that may be true.

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:30.720
 But remember, pastors, men of the cloth of any religion,

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:35.680
 they're on the front lines of the war against darkness.

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:38.120
 They are the ones that if a spirit, if a demon,

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:41.520
 can corrupt the person of the pulpit,

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:45.800
 they can corrupt an entire congregation.

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.160
 So while the house may look nice,

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:52.000
 because the pastor and his family have to keep up appearances,

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.520
 there could have been extremely dark forces in that house

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:56.880
 living along with them.

00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:00.160
 Maybe they even invited it in with them.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:06.760
 But when they left that spirit, that creature,

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:11.240
 that demon, stayed behind, knowing it would have

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:14.560
 a fresh victim to feed off of.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:25.360
 Brian was a young man with a bright future ahead of him.

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:29.960
 And hopefully, he will be able to regain that future

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:33.480
 and take control of his life.

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:39.600
 The question is, will he regain reality

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:45.160
 through medical professionals and medication, therapy

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:47.640
 and treatment?

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:52.840
 Or will all those things fail because a dark entity

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:57.520
 has attached itself to his soul?

00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:59.920
 Doesn't show up on an x-ray?

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.520
 Doesn't show up in a blood test?

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:06.440
 But it's there.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:11.880
 It's possible that Brian not only needs to heal his mind,

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:15.920
 but also needs to save his own soul.

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:25.040
