 We are so lucky to have these people that just care.

00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,280
 At Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago,

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,520
 we know that caring for your child takes more than medicine.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,400
 They're not just treating the disease.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,520
 They're caring for Olivia.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,920
 They know my baby's name.

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,000
 They make me happy.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,360
 And they make me feel better.

00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,880
 With cutting-edge treatments and kid-friendly care,

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,840
 there's a reason Lurie Children's has ranked the number one

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,600

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,680
 I would always recommend Lurie Children's, always.

14
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,960
 Was an Australian school shut down

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,960
 because wolves began to roam the hallways?

16
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,360
 And then we meet a 15-year-old boy and his family

17
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,040
 who move into their new home.

18
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:51,960
 Little does he realize that this home will drive him mad.

 Now, Sir Gio, I'm going to throw a big arm around you.

00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,800
 It's not my arm.

46
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,720
 It's an arm I found in the hallway.

 Specifically, we're headed to Melbourne, Australia.

55
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,360
 And this story takes place around 2018.

56
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,680
 The person who posted the story online--

57
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,680
 they didn't give it a real name.

58
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,880
 We're going to call him Tony.

59
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,280
 But Tony said, I'm pretty sure that's the year.

60
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,200
 When I remember it, pretty sure it's 2018.

61
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,360
 He goes, it's possible that it's 2017,

62
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,560
 but I'm pretty sure it's 2018.

63
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,720
 Tony says, I'm pretty sure that was the year.

64
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,440
 Things have kind of blurred.

65
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,280
 The story itself is kind of odd.

66
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,360
 But he goes, I'm pretty sure that's the year.

67
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,360
 It's possible that maybe I'm off by a year,

68
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,240
 but I don't think so.

69
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,320
 So we're going to place the story around 2018.

70
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,360
 And Tony said, this is how it all played out.

71
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,800
 One day I was at school.

72
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,760
 I'm assuming high school.

73
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,520
 He didn't specify that.

74
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,440
 Anyways, let's just assume high school.

75
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,000
 We don't have a ton of details about this story.

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,280
 But I find it very interesting.

77
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,240
 And Tony does too.

78
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,840
 This is a mystery he's been trying

79
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,760
 to solve for the past four years, five years at this point.

80
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,320
 Tony said one day I was at school.

81
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,240
 And all of a sudden, the teacher said, OK, everyone,

82
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,840
 we've got to get out of this classroom,

83
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,000
 go to this main area.

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,240
 So apparently their school was set up with buildings.

85
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,560
 And each building had kind of a common area in it,

86
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,000
 the way he explained this.

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,840
 The teacher goes, everyone get up.

88
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,240
 Let's go to that common area.

89
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,000
 Chop, chop, let's go.

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,760
 Let's go, let's go.

91
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,680
 And everyone's like, what?

92
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,160
 Tony's like, huh?

93
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,240
 But they do it, right?

94
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,160
 Because you're a student.

95
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,520
 The teacher's telling you to do something.

96
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,200
 I'm sure there's some cool kid in the back

97
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,920
 smoking a cigarette.

98
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,400
 He's like, whatever, teach.

99
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,640
 I'm going to do my own thing.

100
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,680
 But the reason why people weren't really rebelling

101
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:00,880
 is because this seemed like an active shooter drill.

102
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,840
 But not forget the drill part.

103
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,720
 Forget the part where it's fake, where it's a practice run.

104
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:11,760
 Tony goes, generally, when a drill was going to happen,

105
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,440
 an announcement came over the loudspeaker.

106
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,240
 And it was just so it doesn't freak everyone out.

107
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,960
 They said, we're going to have an active shooter drill.

108
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,680
 So you always have to have that last word.

109
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,440
 And everyone were like, ah, I didn't know you

110
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,680
 scheduled these things in advance.

111
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,320
 We're going to have an active shooter drill right now.

112
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,040
 What do they say?

113
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,880
 It's like ABC.

114
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,040
 There's an acronym.

115
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,280
 It's like stop, hide, defend yourself or something.

116
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,840
 I might want to be up on this, the amount of active shootings

117
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,480
 in the world these days.

118
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,320
 I don't want to be sitting there going, what was the last one?

119
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,680
 What was the last one as I'm getting riddled with bullets

120
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,320
 in Safeway?

121
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,400
 Anyways, normally they announce that there's a drill going on.

122
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,240
 So they're like, who's going to sit around?

123
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,200
 They're like, what's the acronym again?

124
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,760
 They-- that's normally what happens.

125
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,040
 So when the teacher all of a sudden

126
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,280
 is like, everyone get up or going on this common area,

127
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,200
 people are a little concerned by this.

128
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,920
 And then they all get in this common area.

129
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,160
 And Tony notices there's other classrooms

130
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,960
 from their building also showing up in this common area.

131
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,800
 And if that's not alarming enough, right?

132
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,560
 Because at this point, you think that it's a real shooting

133
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,640
 going on.

134
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,440
 All of a sudden, the teachers say, OK,

135
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,840
 everyone start closing the blinds so no one can see

136
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,640
 into this room and lock the doors.

137
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,120
 Those are good things to do, right?

138
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,240
 And again, at this point, you'd be thinking, it's a drill.

139
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,440
 Maybe they just forgot to announce it.

140
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,280
 Well, when the teachers then instruct the students

141
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,600
 to move the lockers, to move the lockers to block the doors

142
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,880
 from opening up into this common area,

143
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,360
 people are going to go concerned.

144
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,360
 People are getting a little concerned.

145
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,600
 This was definitely not something they practiced

146
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,760
 during any drill.

147
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,520
 OK, everyone, let's redecorate the entire school.

148
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,400
 But it's just a drill.

149
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,320
 No, they were now moving lockers to barricade the doors.

150
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,560
 No announcement, remember?

151
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,280
 Just all of a sudden, in the middle of class,

152
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,200
 your teacher says, everyone go in this room

153
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,880
 and let's barricade ourselves into it.

154
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:21,720
 Now, the teachers were telling the students,

155
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,240
 don't worry, it's just a drill.

156
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,840
 It's just they're sweating profusely.

157
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,120
 It's just a drill, kids.

158
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,200
 Don't worry about it.

159
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,080
 Even though this is none of the protocol

160
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,720
 that we've ever had for any drill ever, this is just a drill.

161
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,320
 And so the students are starting to get a little relaxed,

162
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,240
 probably except for the ones that are carding lockers around

163
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,040
 and sending them down.

164
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,840
 Hey, boss, where do you want me to put this one?

165
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,040
 I'm assuming that's where the football team came in clutch,

166
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,960
 picking up all those lockers.

167
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,560
 The teacher said it's just a drill.

168
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,120
 Students are starting to relax a bit.

169
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,400
 But kids, they're relaxed.

170
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,240
 They start kind of talking at conversational level.

171
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,200
 Some girls laughing at some joke and the guys over there

172
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,280
 having a tickle contest or whatever.

173
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,200
 And the teachers go, shh.

174
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,720
 It's just a drill.

175
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,440
 But nobody can know we're in here.

176
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:15,940
 Shhh.

177
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:22,560
 Kids are getting nervous again because this is not

178
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,000
 part of the drill procedure.

179
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 They're getting shush.

180
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,320
 So now they're thinking, OK, this isn't a drill.

181
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,440
 The teachers were just lying to us.

182
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,800
 Something real bad is going on.

183
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,240
 Something so bad is going on in our high school

184
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,800
 that simply talking at a conversational level

185
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,280
 may bring that bad thing here.

186
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:54,240
 In the absence of information, information will be created.

187
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,760
 That's something just part of the human condition.

188
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,400
 So this murmur, this very quiet murmur

189
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,200
 begins to go through the crowd of kids.

190
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,360
 Tony doesn't know how the story originated.

191
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,280
 He has no idea where this came from.

192
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,880
 But apparently the kids started saying

193
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:20,200
 that there was a wolf in the school.

194
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,880
 Now, I'm not from Australia.

195
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,400
 Tony obviously is.

196
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,040
 And he goes, there's no wolves around here.

197
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,320
 It's none.

198
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,960
 We're an hour from the closest zoo.

199
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,920
 So couldn't be-- which actually, listen, man,

200
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,320
 you're going to have to do an active shooter drill in your school.

201
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,360
 And you hope it's never an active shooter, obviously.

202
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,720
 But if you ever have to go through this routine,

203
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,920
 that would be kind of dope.

204
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,640
 If it was just a bunch of animals rampaging through your school,

205
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,720
 bunch of zoo animals, the chimpanzees

206
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,120
 are taking over the cafeteria, and elephant

207
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,400
 has demolished the gymnasium.

208
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,160
 I'd be down with that.

209
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,680
 That'd be kind of cool.

210
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,960
 He goes, it's not a wolf from the local zoo.

211
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,520
 There's no wolves around here.

212
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,400
 So how in the world could a wolf have gotten into the school?

213
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,000
 So Tony asks the teacher.

214
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,840
 He goes, hey, I'm hearing that there's a wolf or wolves,

215
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,440
 really.

216
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,520
 Could be more than one.

217
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,240
 But I'm hearing that there's wolves in the school.

218
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,040
 Is that true?

219
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,320
 And the teacher's like, yeah, sure, just be quiet.

220
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,040
 Just be quiet.

221
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,320
 Wolves or whatever.

222
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,520
 So they get there saying wolves?

223
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,680
 OK, yeah.

224
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,400
 Just go sit down.

225
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,120
 Be quiet.

226
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,280
 Tony said the teacher was super dismissive.

227
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,240
 But again, like in the absence of information,

228
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,400
 you're not hearing what you're afraid to hear, right?

229
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,560
 You're not hearing gunshots.

230
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,240
 On the other hand, you're not hearing growls.

231
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,080
 And it's probably more likely, unfortunately,

232
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,320
 that it's a guy with a gun than it is that a wolf somehow

233
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,360
 escaped a zoo, walked an hour.

234
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,960
 It was probably quicker for a wolf, right?

235
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,880
 Because they got four legs.

236
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,920
 So a half hour, and then come to your school.

237
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,240
 He said that we stayed barricaded in this area

238
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,280
 until the end of school, which maybe they only

239
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,720
 had a half hour left, and it wasn't that big of a deal.

240
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,840
 Other than the unending terror in their hearts,

241
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,760
 it wasn't that big of a deal.

242
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,640
 It's possible that this was like right before lunch.

243
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,320
 And they're like, oh, I'm so hungry.

244
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:24,920
 I'm so hungry.

245
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,000
 I get eaten a wolf.

246
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,840
 He says we stayed in that area until the end of school.

247
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,400
 And then when school was out, we moved the lockers.

248
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,040
 So we unbarricaded the place.

249
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,640
 We moved the lockers back to their original position.

250
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,240
 And their teachers are like, good luck trying to get home.

251
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,880
 There's wolves, maybe?

252
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,160
 Out there, kids, you no longer are responsibility.

253
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,560
 Head home.

254
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,280
 The day is over.

255
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,120
 Would you have to imagine?

256
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,440
 They'd be very nervous to walk home, right?

257
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,920
 You're like, hey, wait a second.

258
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,240
 Is they're pushing you out of the school?

259
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,280
 Did you see there are wolves in here?

260
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,480
 Or now they're out there if they're not in the school anymore.

261
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,040
 Now they're just prowling the neighborhood.

262
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,520
 Anyways, they are all sent home.

263
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:15,400
 Now, this story makes so little sense

264
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:21,440
 that even Tony was like, that must have been a dream.

265
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,520
 It must have been a dream.

266
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,960
 It just doesn't make any sense.

267
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,360
 There was no announcement at all.

268
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,160
 All of a sudden, the teacher just somehow

269
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,360
 knew to put us all in this common area.

270
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,800
 It wasn't like there was an announcement.

271
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,840
 And then wolves?

272
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,720
 Like, that's so weird.

273
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,080
 There's no wolves around here.

274
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,080
 Maybe Montana might have a problem with wolves in their school.

275
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,600
 But that's the team.

276
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,360
 They're the timber wolves.

277
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,200
 So as time went on, he just kind of chalked it up

278
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,920
 to a weird dream.

279
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,320
 Nobody talked about it at school, apparently.

280
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,240
 Or maybe they did.

281
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,640
 And Tony's not cool enough to be in the in-crowdy and no friends.

282
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,560
 He's like, oh, that was the closest I was to the rest

283
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,400
 of the students when we were all crammed into that room

284
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,360
 waiting to die.

285
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,360
 Tony doesn't really reveal if they talked about it

286
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:04,880
 the next day.

287
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,200
 I mean, how could they?

288
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,560
 But anyways, he goes, it doesn't make sense, right?

289
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,840
 None of this story makes sense.

290
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,360
 I must have been dreaming it.

291
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,800
 And he kind of chalked it up to just a super realistic dream.

292
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,040
 Well, years later, he was hanging out

293
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,240
 with a friend of his.

294
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,680
 They're talking, talking about the good old times.

295
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,480
 And his friend goes, hey, you know, speaking of the good old

296
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,520
 times, wasn't that weird that one day we all got put

297
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,440
 in that common area?

298
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,880
 Because those wolves showed up.

299
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,280
 And they were like walking around the school.

300
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,120
 And Tony's like, OK, really?

301
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,080
 I thought that was just my dream.

302
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,440
 I didn't know that was real.

303
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,040
 I don't know if he actually said that out loud.

304
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,840
 And then the friend's like, am I just a dream as well?

305
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,880
 Are we all nothing but a dream?

306
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,200
 He goes, when my friend brought it up, I was like, oh, OK.

307
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,000
 So it was real.

308
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,120
 I didn't just imagine it.

309
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,280
 It wasn't just a dream.

310
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,240
 We did get locked in that room.

311
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,760
 And he said, as he's come back--

312
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,480
 and again, after his friend talked about it--

313
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,120
 as he has come back to visit home when he's in the Melbourne

314
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,000
 area, one day he ran into a few teachers.

315
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,760
 It must have been a school function, because who else

316
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,000
 wants to hang out with teachers?

317
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,360
 He talked to a couple of teachers.

318
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,520
 And he was like, hey, yeah, remember me, Tony?

319
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,240
 I was that guy who didn't have any friends.

320
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,440
 And I didn't talk to anyone that much.

321
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,480
 What was up with that whole thing?

322
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,520
 Remember when you guys made us all go into that big area

323
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,720
 and we moved the lockers in front of the doors?

324
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,080
 Because the wolves showed up?

325
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,000
 That can't be true, right?

326
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,040
 And he said he talked to a couple different teachers

327
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,640
 about this.

328
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,720
 And all of them were like, that never happened.

329
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,480
 That never happened.

330
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,760
 He's like, well, yeah, I didn't think so either.

331
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,360
 I thought I was just dreaming it.

332
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,560
 But one of my friends said that he remembered the wolves as well.

333
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,560
 So what was that?

334
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,800
 And the teachers would first deny it.

335
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,000
 They'd be like, it didn't happen.

336
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,320
 Then they would say, quit asking me.

337
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,160
 Quit asking me questions about that time we locked you

338
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,640
 into that room for hours on end.

339
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,280
 It was nothing.

340
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,320
 Don't ask about it.

341
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,920
 And it never happened.

342
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,720
 Which has made Tony, of course, on the beginning of us

343
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,280
 even more suspicious.

344
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,760
 And Tony started to think, listen,

345
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,360
 the most logical thing is that there was some madman

346
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,320
 in there with a gun.

347
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,240
 But he goes, I tried looking up news articles

348
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,880
 to see if there was any reporting of a crazy criminal

349
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,520
 with a gun or something happening.

350
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,400
 And there's nothing.

351
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,880
 I couldn't find anything that mentioned my school and wolves

352
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,920
 or my school and an armed intruder.

353
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,360
 Both of those would make the news.

354
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,640
 Both of those would make the news.

355
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,360
 If wolves invaded your school, especially wolves,

356
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,880
 weren't native to your country, it'd

357
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,640
 be that you'd start the news program like that.

358
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,520
 Because it's scary.

359
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,800
 And journalists love scaring you.

360
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,880
 News people love scaring you.

361
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,720
 But anyways, yeah, he could never find anything about this.

362
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,840
 He knows that it happened because there are two people.

363
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,000
 He remembered it and then thought it was a dream

364
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,240
 and then someone else mentioned it.

365
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,960
 And then other people that were in the know,

366
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,720
 you know, teachers, they are like, it never happened.

367
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,800
 And quit asking me about it.

368
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,560
 It's interesting because he posted this online.

369
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,040
 Tony posted this under the name Will ZY.

370
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,480
 And a couple other people brought up--

371
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,680
 this is kind of the most common theory,

372
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,440
 because basically he's like, what could this have been?

373
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,920
 And this is the only--

374
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,400
 I shouldn't say the only possible one.

375
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,960
 This is the most probable one.

376
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,880
 And that is there was an estranged parent

377
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,680
 who came in to get their kid.

378
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,960
 And the reason why that makes sense

379
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,160
 is because you wouldn't reveal that.

380
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,960
 You wouldn't reveal that to the student body.

381
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,200
 You probably wouldn't reveal that to the parents as well.

382
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,440
 Because here's the thing.

383
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,880
 Let's say if they're like, hey, guys,

384
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,920
 you have to be quiet and hide in this room

385
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,040
 because Judy's dad is an alcoholic nutcase.

386
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,960
 And he's coming to take Judy no matter what.

387
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,680
 Now you've just revealed all of Judy's dirty laundry.

388
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,920
 Everyone's going to be talking about how Judy has a dad who

389
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,000
 can't stop drinking.

390
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,160
 And it's a nutcase.

391
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,160
 They actually use that term.

392
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,720
 He's a nutcase, kids.

393
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,520
 You know what I mean?

394
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,040
 You wouldn't want to gossip like that.

395
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,320
 So it's possible.

396
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,320
 But here's the thing with that.

397
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,920
 The school may have not revealed that information

398
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,800
 to the students.

399
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,320
 They may have had a dangerous individual in the sense

400
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,000
 that they were dangerous to the people they were looking for

401
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,360
 and anyone trying to stop them.

402
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,160
 So walking around looking for his daughter

403
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,800
 and you happen to be the custodian,

404
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,720
 you're listening to your headphones,

405
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,040
 you don't hear a guy walking around.

406
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,160
 And he's like, go, Judy, Judy, it's your paw.

407
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,320
 Come on out.

408
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,520
 Apparently, apparently, I'm a hillbilly.

409
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,600
 I have a hillbilly voice.

410
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,760
 And the custodian doesn't hear that.

411
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,440
 And then he bumps into Judy's dad and Judy's dad strangles him.

412
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,200
 Sorry, Judy.

413
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,520
 Sorry to out your nutcase homicidal dad.

414
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,960
 But then I mean, I guess if he wasn't

415
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,160
 at any match for the wolves as well,

416
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,440
 he's walking around with his headphones on.

417
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,720
 The point is, is like, you would not reveal that to the kids,

418
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,480
 but you would have to reveal that to the other parents.

419
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,800
 Like, those kids would go home and parents would go,

420
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,520
 how was school today?

421
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,000
 And they're like, it was absolutely terrifying.

422
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,480
 A bunch of wolves showed up.

423
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,600
 And we were locked in a common area.

424
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,000
 Obviously, the parents are going to call the--

425
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,120
 parents are going to call the schools.

426
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,440
 They're not going to be like, oh, that's interesting.

427
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,880
 Well, at work, we were beset upon by a flock of peacocks.

428
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,320
 No, the parents are going to be like, wait, what'd you say?

429
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,640
 And then they're going to call the school

430
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,400
 and be like, why is my son telling me

431
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,840
 that he got locked in a room because the wolves were after him?

432
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,880
 And the school can't just be like, oh, don't talk about it.

433
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,520
 I don't want to talk about it and quit asking questions.

434
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,840
 The parents are going to be like, no, tell us.

435
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,200
 And the school would say, well, we

436
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,240
 had a situation with a girl's father walking around.

437
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,280
 The custodian was strangled to death,

438
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,680
 but don't worry, everyone else was safe.

439
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,320
 That's who Tony should ask, honestly.

440
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,640
 That's what I would do if I was Tony.

441
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,040
 I would ask my parents and be like, hey, remember that time

442
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,400
 when I told you when I came home directly from school

443
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,080
 and told you I was locked in a room because of wolves?

444
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,800
 What was that?

445
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,480
 Do you guys remember that?

446
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,120
 And here's a grief of our-- imagine if his parents go,

447
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,160
 no, we don't remember that.

448
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,680
 And he's like, no, I'm pretty sure I told you.

449
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,720
 And they go, shh.

450
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,960
 Quit asking questions.

451
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,040
 It never happened.

452
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:43,400
 That would be absolutely terrifying.

453
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,840
 That's going to be the official ending

454
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,200
 to my "Ghost Bumps" novel, "Wolves in the School."

455
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,360
 Question mark?

456
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,520
 By JC Stein.

457
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,600
 Don't steal that mediocre idea.

458
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
 Sergio, let's go ahead and toss you the keys

459
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,240
 to the carbon or copper we are leaving behind Melbourne,

460
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,760
 Australia.

461
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,440
 Why us all the way out to a house in the suburbs?

462
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,200
 [HUMMING]

463
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,520
 The year is 2015.

464
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:19,640
 And a family is hopping out of a car in front of a house.

465
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,000
 Maybe it's beautiful.

466
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,440
 They did not describe it.

467
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,360
 They didn't describe it.

468
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,720
 But imagine it.

469
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,760
 It's a nice-looking house.

470
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,240
 It's not a rundown beater.

471
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,960
 There's no wolves anywhere nearby.

472
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,600
 It's a nice house.

473
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,200
 And this young woman we're going to call her Amanda

474
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:43,200
 is breathing a sigh after a long trip, going finally,

475
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,040
 we're home.

476
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,880
 She didn't say that.

477
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,360
 She didn't say it was a long trip.

478
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,600
 She didn't say she sighed heavily either.

479
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,880
 But you know, creative license.

480
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,480
 She gets out of the car and she's like, ah, yes, home.

481
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,200
 The place that I've wondered about for so long.

482
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,480
 She goes on this 10-minute monologue

483
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,640
 in deep description of the home.

484
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,320
 Amanda's just moving into this home with her family.

485
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,960
 She has a mom and a dad.

486
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,800
 And then a-- Amanda's not her real name.

487
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,440
 She goes online by the name Kindly Dirt 5752.

488
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,200
 We're going to call her Amanda.

489
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,960
 She has a brother.

490
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,800
 She doesn't name him.

491
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,120
 We're going to call him Brian.

492
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,560
 Her 15-year-old brother Brian gets out of the car as well.

493
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,040
 And he takes in a deep breath of fresh air.

494
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,920
 Ah, yes.

495
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,920
 Oxygen.

496
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,240
 My favorite treat in the morning.

497
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,840
 A little bit of oxygen straight into the lungs.

498
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,480
 They're moving into this house.

499
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,240
 And Amanda says previously-- so they're moving in in 2015.

500
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,120
 Previously, this house was owned by a pastor and his family.

501
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,400
 So you figure.

502
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,680
 It's probably a pretty nice kept up place, right?

503
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,120
 Men of the cloth are not known to have

504
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,920
 cockroach infestations or leave feces in holes in the wall.

505
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,280
 You know, an upstanding guy, generally speaking.

506
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,240
 And so they walk into this house.

507
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,480
 And everything's going to be OK.

508
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,840
 And she said Brian was a good guy, a really good student,

509
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,880
 just kind of like a normal dude.

510
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,280
 Nothing crazy about him at all.

511
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,360
 And no history of mental illness.

512
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,760
 And Amanda says they've lived there for eight years in this

513
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,680
 home.

514
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:35,720
 And each year, Brian got a little more mentally ill.

515
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,160
 Now, you may not notice it the first year, right?

516
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,080
 When Brian comes home from school and they're like,

517
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,240
 he's all hallucinating wolves.

518
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,240
 He's like, I've been attacked by wolves.

519
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,160
 Locked the school down.

520
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,160
 Locked the school down.

521
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,440
 And they're like, what?

522
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,640
 He's not that mentally ill right off the bat.

523
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,440
 He's actually really not that mentally ill by the end.

524
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,280
 But anyways, so at first, he was just a little mentally ill.

525
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,600
 And you would think, oh, you know, growing pains,

526
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,040
 growing pains, all teenage boys go through that thing

527
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:13,200
 where they think they're being attacked by bats in the back.

528
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,360
 I really shouldn't be laughing at this.

529
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,960
 For eight-- let me talk, so I'll just keep making jokes.

530
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,480
 Let's just skip ahead a bit.

531
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,960
 Each year, for eight years, he got worse and worse and worse.

532
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,040
 I'm not going to go into detail because he started to--

533
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,480
 this is what he was actually doing.

534
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,480
 He wasn't having full-on hallucinations.

535
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,440
 But anyways, first, he would just stay in his room

536
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,800
 all the time, which was out of character for Brian.

537
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,000
 I stay isolated from people for long periods of time.

538
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 I like to be alone.

539
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,120
 But it was out of character for Brian.

540
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:50,000
 And he also liked to sit in the dark with no lights on,

541
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,160
 which was also out of character for Brian and really most people.

542
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,760
 And before you go, well, I like sitting in the dark.

543
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,320
 I like to just watch movies.

544
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,080
 He wasn't watching movies.

545
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,960
 He wasn't playing his Switch.

546
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,640
 He wasn't on his laptop.

547
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:11,360
 He would sit in a pitch black room for hours on end.

548
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,600
 I wouldn't-- that doesn't necessarily make you mentally ill.

549
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,760
 But if it's not what you normally do, it is weird.

550
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,040
 I mean, if that's something you're like, I love sitting in the--

551
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,120
 I love sitting in the pitch dark.

552
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,360
 Refreshes my eyeballs cold sleep.

553
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,800
 Do it eight hours a day.

554
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,840
 Am I mentally ill?

555
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,560
 You're all like going on a webMD to check your symptoms.

556
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,880
 No, you're fine.

557
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,400
 But again, if it's out of character for you,

558
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,280
 that's when you start to look at some sort of mental illness.

559
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,360
 He got rid of his phone and his television set.

560
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,120
 He's like, give these out of here.

561
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,800
 I'm just going to sit in the dark.

562
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,840
 And he sits in the dark again.

563
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,200
 I don't have a television.

564
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,720
 No more.

565
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,120
 It's actually right here on the floor.

566
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,200
 I'm touching it with my foot.

567
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,440
 I just keep it here just in case I want to watch something.

568
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,000
 I never do.

569
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,320
 So just sitting on my floor in the middle of the living room,

570
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,160
 you're like, Jason, I think you can easily be classified

571
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:09,520
 as mentally insane for a numerous amount of reasons.

572
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,680
 Anyways, now if all of a sudden your boy starts

573
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,720
 sitting in the dark all the time, he's a teenager,

574
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,720
 you think maybe he's going through a goth phase.

575
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,320
 He doesn't want to do it right.

576
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,000
 You're like, hey, Brian, you're supposed to dress in all black,

577
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,160
 not exist in all black.

578
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,320
 That's whatever.

579
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,120
 Someone wants to be alone in a pitch black room, whatever.

580
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:36,800
 He also then starts to hear voices and see shadows.

581
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,080
 I'm hard in a pitch black room.

582
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:44,360
 I'm telling you, this is not supposed to be a funny story.

583
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,720
 I did not plan on this me laughing so much.

584
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,400
 I don't know why I'm finding it so amusing.

585
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,720
 But it's true.

586
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,040
 It would be kind of hard to see shadow people in a pitch black

587
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,720
 room, but I digress.

588
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,880
 He's hearing voices.

589
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,000
 He's seeing shadow people.

590
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,640
 At this point now, you're thinking, now he's hallucinating.

591
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,880
 Like it's not just about being in the dark.

592
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,560
 Now he has an active psychological problem.

593
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:17,040
 He would also have these quick changes in personality.

594
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,280
 One example that Amanda gave was that within one minute,

595
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,360
 he would switch topics.

596
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,880
 He-- Amanda said one day he was talking to mom,

597
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,920
 and he was telling mom how he had sold his soul to the devil.

598
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:35,200
 And then within a minute, switches to talking--

599
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,000
 Bible quotes.

600
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,840
 He's quoting the Bible.

601
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,920
 So it's just kind of jarring, right?

602
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,000
 Also, if you're just sitting there,

603
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,120
 and your son comes downstairs and says, I sold my soul to Lucifer,

604
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,280
 that's-- that in and of itself is pretty alarming.

605
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:57,760
 And he also talked about being abducted by aliens.

606
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,560
 Now, I know that all of this stuff I talk about on this show,

607
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,880
 I understand that.

608
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,880
 I've talked about all of these subjects on the show.

609
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,200
 But this was alarming.

610
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,560
 And again, I've been talking about this stuff since I was a kid.

611
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:17,480
 We did that recent episode about that possible spy ring in Canada.

612
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,320
 And what was alarming to the family--

613
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,880
 I'll put it in the show notes, but what

614
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,200
 was alarming to the non-spies of the family

615
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,200
 was everything was totally fine for five years.

616
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,400
 This woman had married this guy.

617
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,360
 And then last Christmas, he's like, I hate Christmas.

618
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,360
 And I don't want to celebrate Christmas anymore.

619
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,400
 And I'm going to make it miserable for everyone.

620
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,360
 Also, I don't work on Saturdays.

621
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,120
 That all happened within a week.

622
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,360
 He'd been one person for five years.

623
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,160
 And all of a sudden, he's like, nope, not working at all on Saturdays.

624
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,280
 And I hate Christmas.

625
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,720
 So that's alarming.

626
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,880
 If over time, he'd been like, you know what?

627
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,800
 Saturdays are too nice to work on.

628
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,520
 And then a year later, he's like, man,

629
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,120
 I really miss having Saturdays.

630
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,120
 And then by year five, he's like, I'm not working on Saturdays anymore.

631
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,400
 That's fine.

632
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,640
 That's totally like a legit slow morphine.

633
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,920
 I'm not saying that you only do one thing a year.

634
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,480
 You're like, oh, man, I really wanted to start this hobby.

635
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,560
 But Jason said, I have to just do a little bit each year.

636
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,440
 You want to build a model train set.

637
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,960
 You just have one wheel.

638
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,280
 You're like, oh, see you next year, model train.

639
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,480
 And you know what I mean?

640
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,880
 And then to hate Christmas.

641
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,440
 People will slowly just be like, I'm over it.

642
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,960
 I'm tired of all the consumerism.

643
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,320
 I'm just not going to do Christmas this year.

644
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,640
 My Christmas trees got smaller and smaller.

645
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,880
 They just disappeared.

646
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,800
 They did.

647
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,680
 I used to buy a little Christmas tree.

648
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,800
 And then it would just get smaller and smaller.

649
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,600
 And then I was like, whatever, I'm just done.

650
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,000
 Not done with Christmas.

651
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,920
 I love Christmas.

652
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,000
 But what do I need a tiny Christmas tree for?

653
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,960
 Anyways, the point is that he talked about all this stuff.

654
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,360
 It all really kind of came out of the blue.

655
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,400
 As opposed to someone who talks about this stuff for years.

656
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,840
 It's less insane if you talk about selling your soul

657
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,320
 to the devil.

658
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,640
 I've never sold my soul to the devil.

659
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,760
 I'm not saying that.

660
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,400
 I'm talking about these topics.

661
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,680
 I've talked about them for years.

662
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,560
 That's far less insane than just blurting them out

663
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,760
 in the middle of the night.

664
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:18,920
 Well, anyways, eventually he is either forced to seek treatment

665
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,880
 or get a diagnosis.

666
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,160
 Or he willingly went.

667
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,240
 But he ended up getting diagnosed with schizophrenia,

668
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,360
 psychosis, and bipolar disorder, among others, Amanda says.

669
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,160
 That wasn't it.

670
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,000
 He got diagnosed with all of this stuff.

671
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,240
 And then he got arrested.

672
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,720
 And Amanda doesn't say what charge he was arrested on.

673
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,640
 I mean, pick your poison, right?

674
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,120
 But she said he got arrested generally when people don't

675
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,200
 say why it's the bad ones.

676
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,680
 Like if you robbed a bank, tax evasion or something like that,

677
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,200
 stole a car, we would tell people that.

678
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,760
 We would be like, yeah, my buddy got caught robbing a bank.

679
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,080
 I think even murdered too.

680
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,200
 As long as it wasn't somebody you knew.

681
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,600
 Be like, yeah, my buddy, he's doing time for murder.

682
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,680
 It's when you go-- I don't want to talk about it.

683
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,680
 I don't want to talk about it.

684
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,160
 It was wolf related.

685
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,280
 It was wolf related.

686
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,440
 I don't want to talk about it.

687
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,240
 What happened to your buddy?

688
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:17,840
 I don't want to talk about it.

689
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,440
 You got arrested.

690
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,000
 That's the end of it.

691
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,840
 That's when you think the worst.

692
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,200
 Right?

693
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,600
 That's when you think, oh my god, what did this guy do?

694
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,240
 Anyways, he gets arrested.

695
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,800
 And Amanda says, listen, he was going to be gone for a while.

696
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,640
 The family decided that since he wouldn't be coming home

697
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,600
 for a while, we're going to clean his room.

698
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,640
 We're going to go in and get it all organized.

699
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,640
 Do you imagine it would be a--

700
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,720
 I imagine it would be a huge mess.

701
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,320
 There's no lights on.

702
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,720
 There could be soda cans everywhere in pizza boxes

703
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,280
 crawling with cockroaches.

704
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:49,960
 You wouldn't know.

705
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,920
 It wouldn't really bug you because you couldn't see him.

706
00:29:52,920 --> 00:30:00,360
 They also started leaving his door open and the light on.

707
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:04,520
 And it's interesting.

708
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,720
 She doesn't specifically--

709
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,560
 I don't think it's a passive aggressive thing.

710
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,680
 I feel like it's almost--

711
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,120
 the family decided that it was like a cleansing.

712
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,520
 And she doesn't specifically say that either,

713
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,000
 but it could be subconsciously trying to cleanse the room

714
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,760
 in some way by exposing it to light.

715
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,320
 But they leave the door open.

716
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,240
 They leave the light on.

717
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,600
 They're cleaning the room.

718
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,760
 And what the family starts to realize

719
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:35,840
 is it is possible that Brian was not alone in that room.

720
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:41,960
 She says that they begin noticing scratches in the carpet.

721
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,280
 Which is interesting.

722
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,840
 I don't really know how that works.

723
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,120
 How you scratch a carpet.

724
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,960
 But I mean, I guess if you scratched it hard enough,

725
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,440
 you could.

726
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,560
 And she said they were inhuman scratches.

727
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,480
 So it's not like someone was walking around

728
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,680
 and they didn't clip their toenails for a bit.

729
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,120
 They're cleaning up his room on their hands and knees

730
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,400
 and they're scratching the carpet up.

731
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,480
 No, she said they were inhuman scratches.

732
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,240
 And they would see him on the carpet

733
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,360
 and they would fix them.

734
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,240
 Maybe it was like a thick carpet and you could kind of tell.

735
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:13,600
 I don't know.

736
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,800
 Anyway, she's saying that there's inhuman scratches

737
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,640
 on the carpet and they would fix them.

738
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,920
 They're re-sewing.

739
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,200
 They're re-sewing the carpet.

740
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,560
 How do you make a carpet, actually?

741
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,720
 Now that I think about it.

742
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,440
 Anyway, she says there's inhuman scratches on the carpet.

743
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,000
 They repair them.

744
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,680
 They fix it.

745
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,920
 And then a new set of scratch marks would appear.

746
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:42,200
 And she said as late as February 4th, 2023,

747
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:48,680
 brown stains began to appear on the walls of the room.

748
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,800
 We've talked about this a lot on this show

749
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,640
 because it's one of the most terrifying things for me.

750
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,080
 And I'm not going to talk for too long about it.

751
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:01,880
 But listen, I know mental illness is a real thing.

752
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,600
 I know mental illness is a real thing.

753
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,080
 And millions of people struggle with it every single day.

754
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,480
 And some people struggle with it for the rest of their lives

755
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,440
 or for their entire lives.

756
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,080
 It's awful.

757
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,440
 A lot of people are able to live good lives,

758
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,600
 even though they have it.

759
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,360
 But I do believe mental illness is our real.

760
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,680
 That is, I'm not trying to imply anything

761
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,520
 by what I'm about to say.

762
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,480
 What I'm going to say is I do think

763
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:32,600
 that supernatural events can, yes,

764
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,720
 be a symptom of mental illness.

765
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,800
 There's obviously people who are mentally ill who

766
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,760
 think they are seeing things that aren't there.

767
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,880
 And they aren't seeing ghosts or shadow people

768
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,000
 or aliens or anything like that.

769
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,120
 They're hallucinating.

770
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,320
 They're having delusions, gangstalking.

771
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,200
 It's a perfect example of that.

772
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:56,000
 But I also believe that supernatural events can--

773
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,760
 I think they can--

774
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,960
 I don't want to say cause mental illness

775
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,440
 because I think that that's different.

776
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,800
 That's implying something different.

777
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,920
 I think they can induce mental illness.

778
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,960
 You're like, Jason, come on.

779
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,280
 That's a wiggle word.

780
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,840
 I think that if you have somebody who is either

781
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,160
 prone to being mentally ill, the sad thing is,

782
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,840
 is that he is right in that age group.

783
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,520
 He was 15 when they moved in.

784
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:26,680
 It's eight years later, so he would be about 23 now.

785
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,640
 That's the age group where schizophrenia

786
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,400
 begins to show up in young men.

787
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:37,040
 So he's right in that danger zone for that.

788
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:41,080
 But I mean, I don't think that every mentally ill person is

789
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,000
 possessed by a demon.

790
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,880
 And I don't think every case of mental illness

791
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,120
 is caused by a demon.

792
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:51,520
 But I do think that dealing with these types of entities,

793
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,440
 can--

794
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,200
 it can induce mental illness in people.

795
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,080
 Whether they are prone to it and this type of entity

796
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,080
 is speeding it along or they were never

797
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,680
 going to suffer from any of these mental illnesses.

798
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,760
 Because there's no history of this in the family.

799
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,240
 There technically doesn't have to be,

800
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,920
 but it's obviously, if you're predisposed to it,

801
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,840
 the chances of you having a severe mental illness is higher.

802
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,880
 I do think you could take somebody--

803
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,680
 it's a controversial statement probably,

804
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,040
 but I'm not on YouTube, so it doesn't matter.

805
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,240
 I think you can take somebody who has no history

806
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,400
 of mental illness and would not be mentally ill in the future.

807
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:32,800
 How do they not cross a supernatural entity?

808
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,400
 I do believe that demons and other supernatural entities

809
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,720
 can cause mental illness.

810
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,800
 And at the very least, interacting

811
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,560
 with these type of entities looks a lot like mental illness.

812
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,560
 I remember when I first started seeing Shadow People,

813
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,000
 we talked about it on the show.

814
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,720
 I thought I was going crazy because I was seeing stuff

815
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,840
 that shouldn't exist.

816
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,960
 I legit thought I was losing my mind

817
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,160
 and I was so worried about it.

818
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,080
 Same thing when I started seeing ghosts.

819
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,560
 There's two separate times.

820
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,440
 Because there are really two separate types of entities,

821
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,040
 I thought I'm losing my mind.

822
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,160
 These things don't exist.

823
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,440
 I never saw these things until I'm 17,

824
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,000
 which was when I first started seeing ghosts and hearing ghosts.

825
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,080
 And I knew I was right in that age group

826
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,520
 for when schizophrenia starts to show up.

827
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,520
 And I thought I was losing my mind.

828
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,120
 So the fact that just by interacting with these things

829
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:30,560
 simulates psychosis, I do believe

830
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,960
 that they can induce it as well.

831
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,680
 Do we know if that's the case here?

832
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,680
 That's kind of what Amanda seemed to be getting at.

833
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,320
 Like, he was--

834
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,480
 he did get diagnosed with all those mental illnesses,

835
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:51,760
 but there was something else in that room that was with him.

836
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,520
 So how much of those actions were Brian individually making,

837
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,560
 shutting off the lights, cutting himself off from society,

838
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,760
 not having a phone or a television?

839
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,080
 How much of that was him?

840
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,160
 Because it's super out of character for him,

841
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,880
 and how much of it was this entity in that room.

842
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,440
 And I think it's super interesting.

843
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:14,240
 I was kind of being playful about it in the beginning

844
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,920
 that a man of the cloth, a pastor in his family,

845
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,560
 wouldn't have any poop in the walls or any sort of--

846
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,760
 they would treat the house nice and things like that.

847
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,440
 And that may be true.

848
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,720
 But remember, pastors, men of the cloth of any religion,

849
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,680
 they're on the front lines of the war against darkness.

850
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,120
 They are the ones that if a spirit, if a demon,

851
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,520
 can corrupt the person of the pulpit,

852
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,800
 they can corrupt an entire congregation.

853
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,160
 So while the house may look nice,

854
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,000
 because the pastor and his family have to keep up appearances,

855
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,520
 there could have been extremely dark forces in that house

856
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,880
 living along with them.

857
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,160
 Maybe they even invited it in with them.

858
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:06,760
 But when they left that spirit, that creature,

859
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:11,240
 that demon, stayed behind, knowing it would have

860
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,560
 a fresh victim to feed off of.

861
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:25,360
 Brian was a young man with a bright future ahead of him.

862
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:29,960
 And hopefully, he will be able to regain that future

863
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,480
 and take control of his life.

864
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:39,600
 The question is, will he regain reality

865
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:45,160
 through medical professionals and medication, therapy

866
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,640
 and treatment?

867
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:52,840
 Or will all those things fail because a dark entity

868
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:57,520
 has attached itself to his soul?

869
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,920
 Doesn't show up on an x-ray?

870
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,520
 Doesn't show up in a blood test?

871
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:06,440
 But it's there.

872
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:11,880
 It's possible that Brian not only needs to heal his mind,

873
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,920
 but also needs to save his own soul.
