 Learning to swim is a magical time in a child's life.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.600
 The excitement of the water.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.700
 Playing with friends.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.900
 Making memories on vacations that will last a lifetime.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.800

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.400
 What happens when you're recording a paranormal podcast

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.200
 and the world of the paranormal wants a sneak peek at your latest episode?

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.300
 Then we travel to a lonely road in Georgia

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.900
 where an overnight attendant is besieged by a smelly vagrant.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.400
 It's paranormal. It's not just somewhere.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.600
 It's not just some smelly oboe walking around.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.100
 It's paranormal and then we uncover a brand new conspiracy theory

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.700
 that's currently making the rounds.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.400
 Well, one guy's talking about it, so we're going to talk about it on the show.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:10.600
 Is it possible that elderly people are actually grey aliens in disguise

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.400
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.300
 Hey, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.200
 I'm your host, Jason Garvenor. I'm having a great day.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.500
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.300
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.100
 Also, I hope you're not over the age of 65 because you might be a grey alien

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.600
 and then you might want to kill me for the second story.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.200
 But before we get to that, before we get to your elderly enraged vengeance streak

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.500
 against me, let's go ahead and introduce our Patreon supporter.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.900
 I don't know how old this guy is. This guy might be 88.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.400
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now, everyone give a round of applause to

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.700
 LacanianLifter.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.500
 Woo! Come on in Lacanian.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.600
 Yeah, give you a big round of applause. Checking your ID, seeing how old you are.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.500
 Lacanian actually used to be a Patreon and then something happened and they stopped.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.800
 They're like, "Your show started to suck, bro."

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.500
 Now, something happened and they stopped, but they're joined back on.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.800
 So thank you so much, Lacanian.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.500
 You're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.500
 Because you can't to wear the Patreon, I totally get it.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.200
 Trust me, I do. Just help spread the word about the show that really, really helps out a lot.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.700
 Lacanian, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the...

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.600
 Jason Jett.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.600
 We're actually, no, we're not going anywhere right now.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.400
 Give me those keys back, bro.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.000
 I want to tell you guys this.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.100
 If you guys listened to yesterday's episode, it might have ended a little bit abrupt.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.900
 I haven't finished the final edit of yesterday's episode, but actually our first story takes place

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.000
 here in Dead Rabbit Command, here in the recording studio.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 What happened yesterday was I was finishing up the story about the ghost car.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.700
 It was really cool. I really liked the story of the guy walking around taking the trail through Georgia.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.800
 Got some good Georgia stories this week.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.200
 And let me play you the audio.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.200
 I edited this out because I thought it was too distracting.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.100
 It's definitely too distracting, right?

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.700
 So here, let me set this up for you.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.700
 So when I'm recording, I do record in a closet.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.100
 I call it the haunted closet because I have sensed the ghost in this closet before,

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:25.700
 but it's really been a long time since I've seen anything in my house or really anything even in the closet.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.000
 Now, as a studio, studio, it does what it does.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.600
 It has pretty good audio, but it also gets really, really hot.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.000
 These are my first episodes coming back from a long break.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.900
 I was super nervous.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.100
 I was just sweating the whole time.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.200
 So what I did was at a certain point, I cracked open the door.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.100
 I know that's not good for studio recording.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.700
 They normally don't snoop, dog normally doesn't go, "Hey, I'm about to bust the track."

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.800
 Open the windows.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.600
 Let's get all that outside noise.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.500
 But I opened the door.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.400
 Okay.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.700
 The doors open maybe, I don't know, a little less than a foot.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.100
 I'm getting some sunlight in here.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.500
 I'm getting some fresh air.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.900
 And if you've never, I do a live show every Sunday morning for the Patreon supporters.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.400
 So they'll often see this.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.100
 Sometimes I add video to it.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.400
 They definitely hear it.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.200
 None of this show is really scripted.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.500
 It's all just notes.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.700
 And then I just kind of go off the top of my head.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.200
 That's why I'm always laughing at the jokes because it's the first time I've heard those jokes too, right?

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.600
 But a lot of times I come to the end of an episode and I'll just kind of go riff for like 10 minutes

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.400
 trying to find the right combination of words to wrap up an episode.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.600
 And that's what was happening yesterday.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.300
 And I'm sitting there in my closet.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:47.400
 I'm trying to figure out a good way to wrap up the story about a guy who saw a ghost car.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.500
 And I just can't find it.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.400
 And you know, it's like 8 o'clock at night.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.300
 I'm super tired and I'm super sweaty.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.600
 And I look out the little, look out my door, right?

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.900
 I'm just kind of gazing around trying to think of a way to finish this episode.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:10.700
 And when I look out the door, I see an apparition.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.700
 I straight up see a ghost.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.200
 Well, okay, so what I see, it's so weird.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:27.100
 I turn and I look and I see standing right outside my door like this thing was watching me record the podcast.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.500
 It was as if you took a ribbon.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:40.800
 Now it was a black ribbon that was bold black on the edges and in the middle was like translucent, almost see-through, almost smoky material.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:49.200
 I turned and I look and I saw hovering there for a good few seconds, hovering there, a ribbon.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:58.400
 And it looked like if you had an invisible woman, invisible man standing outside your closet, like you're like, "Oh, I know exactly what that looks like, Jason."

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:05.100
 If you had an invisible person and you placed a ribbon on them, you could see, I could see the outline of the top of their head.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.700
 And then it came down and then it was the outline of their left shoulder.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.100
 The ribbon was probably about maybe two feet long.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:19.500
 And I'm turning, I'm gonna play the clip for you without any audio processing or anything.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.700
 I'll play that for you in a second so you can kind of hear what was going on while I was experiencing this.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.000
 But I turn and I look because I'm just trying to think of a way to end this episode.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.700
 I've been recording for like two hours at this point.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.600
 I did two episodes back to back yesterday.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:44.200
 So I look and I see this ribony, this smoky ribony thing outside of my closet in full bedroom light, you know, full lamp.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.600
 Jason's not saying to the term.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.600
 You know, full light bulb light.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:55.400
 And I see it and it hangs there for a second and then it disappears.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.400
 And it doesn't go, "Bip!"

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.700
 It doesn't disappear like a flash.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.400
 It just slowly fades from view.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.500
 And you can hear the audio of me experiencing this.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:12.000
 I just stopped talking and I'll play that for you right now.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.400
 I think the answer to that is pretty clear.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:25.400
 We have a lot of stories of people mysteriously vanishing in the woods

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.600
 or down dark alleys

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.900
 or inside houses.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:35.100
 We have a lot of stories of people mysteriously vanishing in the woods

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:43.400
 and very, very few of them ever return.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.700
 Would you be one of them?

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:56.800
 Would you be one of those that make it back to the world of our reality?

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:13.800
 Dude, no joke.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:23.900
 There was something standing outside my closet watching me record that.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:30.500
 That was insane.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.100
 Yeah, I turned.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.100
 I don't know why I turned to look.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.900
 You guys might have even heard me turn while I was talking.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.800
 This is not scripted and nothing like that.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.600
 I don't mess around with this type of stuff.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.900
 Like I don't joke about this stuff.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.900
 No, he profools or nothing.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:51.900
 I turned and I looked.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:59.200
 And it was like a black ribbon.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.300
 Would have been.

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.400
 Hold on.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:06.800
 Yeah, this is not joking around.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:12.300
 It would have been about maybe six feet tall, but it was a black ribbon.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:20.700
 But it looked like a phenomenon in my house.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.200
 I do have to live.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.600
 It's probably it would be like if you put a ribbon on somebody's head

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.600
 and like laid across the top of their head, but there's no ribbon.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.300
 I don't know how often you guys watch videos of my house.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:33.500
 I don't.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.400
 I'm not a big ribbon a fishy and not.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:39.700
 That was weird.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:44.800
 I got that was creepy.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:56.300
 There was straight up something watching me do that.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.300
 Now I it was so weird, right?

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.000
 I kind of then I got up and I walked.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 I don't know how much of the clip I'm actually going to play for you.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.200
 But what if I don't play at all?

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.500
 What I do is then I get up and I walk around my bedroom.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:12.100
 I'm kind of processing what I saw and I'm still talking into the microphone.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.800
 I'm saying how tall.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.800
 So here's the thing.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.000
 This is the weird thing about ghosts.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.500
 There's a lot of weird things about ghosts.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.300
 First off, they're dead people or demons or whatever they are.

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:27.700
 But one thing that I've had in my experience because I've seen a lot of ghosts in my life is ghosts.

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:35.200
 Don't and if it's a real ghost in a place that I'm at, I'm not scared of it.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.800
 I'm a little bit be a little bit at ease like uneasy.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.700
 If it's real, I'm not scared.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.600
 If it's fake, I'm scared.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:50.800
 So I saw this black ribbon materialize outside my closet.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.800
 Like it was peeking in.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.400
 Not scared.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:00.700
 When about my business actually went to the living room and while I was kind of editing episodes and stuff like that,

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.900
 I see something out of the corner of my eye in the living room.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:08.700
 And then my black mouse, you know, my computer mouse is black and it's shiny.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:14.000
 I actually see something move over the mouse like the reflection changed.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.400
 So we also had that stuff going on as well.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.600
 So wasn't scared.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.300
 Right.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:23.600
 Came in, shut my light off to go to bed, pulled down my phone, goofing off,

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.300
 going to stupid websites, stuff like that went to bed.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:32.200
 Even though I saw a ghost that don't know what it is, don't know what its intent is.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.300
 I see it in here.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.700
 Yesterday morning, I was walking to work.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.300
 I just watched the movie, the bye bye man.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:43.400
 I'd watched the movie, the bye bye man and I was walking to work and I was thinking of the bye bye man

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:47.200
 and a squirrel jumped out of a bush and I almost beat my pants.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.400
 It's so weird.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.200
 It's so weird.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.800
 Like something that's fake will scare me.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.000
 The bye bye man.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.800
 I'm like, oh, but when there's a ghost in my actual apartment, it doesn't scare me.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.100
 However, I know I'm a paranormal researcher.

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.000
 I know I'm a ghost hunter.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.400
 You don't want it in your house.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.000
 Really.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.100
 I mean, now it's attacking me.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:12.400
 Ah, no, I'm not saying you got to leave, but it's more troublesome.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:16.400
 Like I don't really think this, whatever this is, has any ill will towards me.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.200
 So that's interesting.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:24.400
 But like if the goblins are supposed to be at your house and then I go to your house

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.800
 and investigate goblin activity.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.800
 I don't think even a hunter, like if you were a hunter, I don't think you want a bunch of rabbits

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:31.900
 jumping around in your house.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:32.200
 Right.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:37.600
 I mean, you're like, I love shooting rabbits in the brain with the shotgun, but I like to go.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.800
 I like to do it on my off time, not at home.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.400
 So we'll see what happens.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.700
 Like this could have been a one off thing.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:50.600
 I didn't feel any ill will towards if it does decide to stick around, you know, I'll deal with it.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:54.700
 I'm not going to sage the place or anything like that if it has good intent, right?

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.900
 But that was really weird.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.700
 It was really weird to see something like that.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:04.500
 It's been years since I've seen a ghost on that level.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.600
 But there's one here now, apparently.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.700
 Maybe it's just passing through.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.600
 Maybe it's waiting for the ghost bus.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.800
 Maybe it's on the way to your house.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.200
 And if so, then I think it's pretty chill.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.300
 Actually, I wouldn't worry about it.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.400
 But yeah, it's just weird, just weird to be record.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.400
 And you know, it's so funny.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.100
 I think it was in that episode or the episode before it.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.300
 I was like, oh, that ghost can come to my house.

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:28.000
 I kept talking about someone who's trying to get a ghost to come to their house.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.600
 I think it was the Monday episode and maybe a ghost, maybe a ghost.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.700
 And then understand I was speaking in the third person.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:35.300
 Who knows?

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:39.400
 But a weird story nonetheless.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.000
 You know, that took a lot longer.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.100
 And I know with all the processing and everything like that,

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.000
 that segment's probably going to be like 20 minutes.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.100
 Let's go ahead and set aside the hobo vagrant story.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.100
 We're going to save that for tomorrow.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:14:00.100
 Let's move into a snowier region than my house.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.900
 So let's go ahead and toss the canning and lifter the keys to the carpenter copter.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.000
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.100
 We're flying all the way out to a snowy mountain town.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:18.200
 This story is short.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.400
 We might have time for the Georgia story, but I want to make sure I can give the story.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.000
 It's full, full due.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.300
 And I've got to give a shout out to Amphis Allen.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:31.700
 Amphis Allen, longtime supporter of the show, sent us a lot of really good stuff for Dead Rabbit.

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.500
 I really, really appreciate it.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.600
 This story is just as good as the other ones.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.600
 Like sending me nothing but gold.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:46.800
 Amphis Allen apparently posted this video the other day of a 70 year old woman.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.300
 He, let me get this straight actually.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.200
 So he videotaped, no, no, no.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.200
 He posted a video.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:56.300
 He's skiing and his mother-in-law is filming him.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.700
 His 70 year old mother-in-law is filming him.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:04.200
 And he's like, "Chair in a month, go Amphis Allen, go!"

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.600
 And it was like, "Hey, look at this."

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.000
 It was from a subreddit called Praise the Cameraman.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.500
 Because the cameraman's doing, or camera woman, don't be sexist subreddit.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.800
 So anyways, this actually was a woman.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:16.700
 They're going down the hill.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:17.700
 So he posted this video.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:21.900
 It's like, "Hey, look at my mother-in-law is filming me as I'm flying down the slopes."

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:25.600
 This dude actually is like a world renowned athlete, Amphis Allen.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:31.700
 So he posted this video and because the internet is a super, super weird place,

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:36.000
 he gets a comment from a guy known as Ahoyle.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.100
 And Ahoyle tells this story.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.700
 Ahoyle says, "You know what?

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:43.500
 I used to live in a mountain town."

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.100
 And that's where we're walking around right now.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:46.900
 We're walking around this unnamed mountain town.

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:50.900
 We got big mittens on in like the parkas and we're walking around.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:52.000
 Ahoyle's story is this.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:00.300
 He used to live in a mountain town up in a snowy region.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:04.600
 And he worked at the local pizza shop, the local pizzeria where you'd go in and you'd

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:11.800
 get some delicious food, maybe throw back a brusque or two and watch the snow fall outside.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.900
 And he says, you know what?

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:17.500
 He's referring to Amphis Allen's 70-year-old mother-in-law videotaping this.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:18.500
 He goes, "You know what?

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:25.600
 I'm going to be surprised how many old people can ski in snowboard and do it fairly well."

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:30.600
 And he goes, "I have a theory and to be honest, I'm kind of joking, but I'm kind of not.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:37.800
 I believe that aliens hide out in mountain towns all over the world."

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.200
 So think about it.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.800
 Old people look like gray aliens, right?

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:47.000
 Hold your questions until the end.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.300
 Old people kind of do look like gray aliens, right?

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.100
 They're balding.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.900
 Gray aliens are bald.

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.900
 They got skinny little limbs.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:59.500
 Gray aliens have skinny little limbs.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.500
 That's kind of weird that they're not gray.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.700
 Most old people aren't gray.

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:06.100
 However, they do start to get a little ashy looking, right?

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:07.100
 Why do they do that?

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:08.300
 Why do you old people...

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:12.900
 YouTube's going to shut this down for ageism, but when you get old, you know, you do...

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:16.400
 You kind of lose a little bit of color in your skin.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.400
 So why?

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.500
 Is it because they're old and they are having less nutrients or they're out in the sun less?

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.700
 Is it because they're not human anymore?

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.100
 Gray aliens?

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:29.800
 But he says it's weird because old people do kind of look like gray aliens, but that's

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:30.800
 not the only thing.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.900
 That's not the only part of this conspiracy theory.

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:38.000
 He goes, "Sometimes when I'm working at a pizzeria, I'd get these elderly people showing

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:44.200
 up to the pizza shop and they would be paying me in cash.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:50.700
 And the cash was always old money, like the bills, the bills, the dates when the bills

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:57.000
 were printed were like the 1960s, but they looked brand new.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.500
 So I was getting this money that was brand new that had old dates on it from like the

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:08.440
 60s, and I thought, hmm, maybe they're gray aliens, right?

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:12.400
 These people up in mountain regions pay me in weird money.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.100
 Now I would assume there's some sort of counterfeit ring going on.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:16.100
 That would be my first assumption.

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:17.100
 Did I ever talk to you?

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.440
 Did I ever mention that before?

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:22.720
 My grandpa knew a guy who counterfeited money.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.720
 My grandpa's dead.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:28.500
 You can't come after him, FBI, but my grandpa knew a dude who would counterfeit money and

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:34.640
 he lived on a boat in Sacramento and he would just have a water cooler of $5 bills, fake

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.160
 $5 bills, and he would just hand them out to people.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.240
 I don't know who the guy was before the feds come and asked me.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.760
 I don't know who the guy was.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.960
 It's been 20 years since I heard that story, but so you do have old people who counterfeit

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.920
 and they just counterfeit very, very low bills.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:53.440
 But anyways, anyways, now that it's a counterfeit ring, he thinks they might be gray aliens,

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.000
 but here's the interesting part, right?

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.220
 Ampestal and Sendis told me we both had a good chuckle, but there was something that

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:02.160
 could be fact checked with this conspiracy theory, and those are always the best conspiracy

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:05.840
 theories, the ones that we can actually take a really close look at.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:15.120
 He said snow, this is what Ohio said, snow is actually kind of a rare phenomenon as far

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:19.560
 as the galaxy goes.

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.840
 Now I can't fact check that old people love to use new bills other than the fact that

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:27.320
 my grandpa knew a counterfeiter, an elderly counterfeiter.

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:32.480
 And yeah, sure, old people do kind of look like gray aliens if you forget the fact they

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:37.320
 have giant eyeballs and they're three feet tall and they have these massive heads, sure,

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:41.520
 they share some of the qualities of a gray alien, i.e. they have arms and legs and they're

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.560
 bold.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.240
 But snow is a rare phenomenon galactically.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:54.040
 So me and Ampestal were kind of joking about this and then I looked it up.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:58.040
 Snow is extremely rare.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:03.000
 H2, I know a bunch of scientists, I know a bunch of people who are into science who listen

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
 to this podcast are typing comments and emails right now, hold on.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:16.040
 Snow as we know it, H2O snow that sticks and packs and forms snow shelves and snowy mountains

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:20.640
 and stuff like that, we're the only place in the solar system that we know that this

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.680
 happens.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:27.960
 There's other planets, there's moons that we think it snows, but it's like volcanic

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:31.080
 ash coming down from the sky.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.800
 It's carbon snow.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:39.280
 It's like Mars, it snows like there's ice, but snow they said it doesn't stick, like

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:44.880
 it snows in the poles, but by the time it hits the ground it's gone.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:50.120
 We think, we think it might snow on Pluto, as much as we know that Pluto is like super

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:51.660
 frozen.

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:53.120
 We don't know for sure.

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:54.280
 Even then it's Pluto.

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:58.600
 Even then it's a dirt ball of a planet that's super far away.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:06.400
 This is super interesting because snow is so rare in our solar system that you would

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.760
 have to extrapolate that out.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:11.280
 It's probably very rare galactically.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.320
 Something that for the most part we take for granted.

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:19.400
 I always thought it was interesting that the number one, as far as we know, the number

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:26.460
 one rarest thing in the universe, liquid water, we pour all over our bodies, we splash it

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:27.460
 in our face.

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:28.900
 I mean we do drink it, right?

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:35.420
 But we build holes in the ground and fill it full of the most precious resource in the

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:36.420
 universe.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.860
 As far as we know, liquid water is one of the rarest things ever.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:44.820
 It rains diamonds on like Jupiter or Saturn or something like that, or one of the moons.

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:48.860
 But there's no liquid water anywhere else that we know of.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:52.880
 And we put it in balloons and throw it at people, right?

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:57.600
 We spray our dogs with a hose and they go "ugh" and they get it all wiggly all over you and

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.000
 it's fun.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.840
 And then Charles Crone yells at you "Bate-O-Van!"

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:03.840
 That's weird.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:07.080
 That is the detail that makes me go "Maybe there is something to this."

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:12.600
 Now again, YouTube and anyone else who thinks I'm being "agist" I'm not saying that all

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.480
 old people are grey aliens.

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:23.140
 So what I am saying is that if you could travel the galaxy and you'd seen stars explode and

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:26.440
 you'd watch your buddies get sucked into a black hole and you're like "Oh that prank went

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.440
 bad!"

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:31.980
 As you watch their entire starship get stuck on the event horizon, you've seen all of these

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:36.300
 great things but snow.

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:42.660
 Standing outside watching frozen water softly come down sticking out your little tongue,

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.020
 getting some on it.

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:50.280
 It's to be so rare you could experience so many other amazing things throughout the galaxy

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:57.040
 but if you wanted to see snow you'd have to come here.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:03.760
 You wanted to ski, snowball fight, igloos, whatever.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.360
 You'd have to do it here.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:13.160
 That's so interesting and think about this when you have like old people here or rich

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:18.440
 people whatever and they want to vacation, sure they could go to a tropical location

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.460
 anywhere on the planet.

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.180
 They could go to some deserted island.

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:22.540
 They're rich and powerful.

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:23.540
 They can go anywhere, right?

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:24.540
 They can afford anything.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:29.060
 But they still go to the same resort towns that everyone else goes to because the infrastructure

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:31.700
 is there to support them.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:36.380
 If Bill Gates wanted to go to a tropical island but there's no landing pad there and let's

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:38.820
 say that he goes "Build the landing pad then he gets there."

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.540
 There's no hotels, there's no houses.

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:42.240
 It's just a deserted island.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.880
 He's like "Ah, this totally sucks and you'd have to build the infrastructure."

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.840
 All that infrastructure is here.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:54.800
 So sure even if there was another planet where it did snow, H2O, there's no resorts, there's

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:58.640
 no pizzerias, there's no infrastructure for that.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:03.240
 So this, it's interesting because we always talk about Earth being a prison planet.

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.960
 We talk about Earth being a zoo.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:09.440
 The aliens a long time ago put us here and they crossbred themselves with the monkey

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:14.300
 people and then that's where the Homo sapiens came from and we went to dig up gold for the

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.740
 Anunnaki and da da da da.

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:19.500
 It's always so dismal and dark and evil, right?

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:28.260
 It's always we were slaves or we are prisoners or the Archons or drinking our loosh when

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.900
 we die and we get stuck in a reincarnation.

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:34.100
 Why is it always so dismal with conspiracy theories?

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:38.140
 Why is it always so negative?

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:41.040
 Pretty Earth is the happiest place in the galaxy.

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:45.640
 I mean, okay, outside of all the wars, outside of all the wars and the pestilence and stuff

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.240
 like that and all the horrible crimes.

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:54.360
 Galactically speaking, we don't have volcanoes that rip the atmosphere in two.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:59.040
 We are not sitting on the edge of a star system that's about to go supernova.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.040
 Pretty chill, right?

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:03.800
 The environment is stable.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:09.940
 It snows, it rains, there's beautiful sunsets.

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:16.420
 You can sit on a beach and a day later be scaling a mountain, looking down at the valley

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:17.420
 below.

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:20.620
 It's really a beautiful place.

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:22.540
 So maybe we aren't a prison planet.

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:27.460
 Maybe we aren't some sort of zoo where the monkeys have taken over.

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:32.260
 Maybe we're club med as far as the galaxy goes and that's why so many aliens are coming

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:33.260
 here.

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:38.980
 We're always hearing about these reptilians and Pleiadians and the grays and all these

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:39.980
 other guys, right?

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:44.480
 Because you imagine, I don't think the Pleiadians have a bunch of reptilians walking around.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:48.700
 And I imagine on the gray alien homeworld, if that even exists, a lot of people think

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.960
 it's their biorobots created by the reptilians.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:55.060
 But we're going to into the weeds here.

00:25:55.060 --> 00:26:00.480
 We're the only planet that all these other different species can come to, right?

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.660
 Maybe we are a resort planet.

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:09.500
 Maybe we are the cancun of the galaxy.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:13.780
 And so it would make sense that you would have gray aliens coming down or any aliens,

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:14.780
 right?

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:18.860
 I think a lot of alien with an alien lore, especially with reptilians, their shapeshifters,

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:23.060
 it would make sense for them to come down to a place that's peaceful, that doesn't have

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:24.060
 all of their wars.

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:29.580
 It has our wars, but it doesn't have these galaxy spanning conflicts.

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:35.180
 We may actually be the Casablanca of the galaxy, a neutral planet that people can come and

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:36.180
 relax.

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:40.540
 Very, very fascinating conspiracy theory, I think.

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:42.980
 And we need more positive conspiracy theories.

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:43.980
 I really do.

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.700
 If you want to talk about the Archons drinking our lush, the way you could generate the

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:49.220
 mo- We did a whole episode on that.

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:50.980
 That's really what in the world's lush.

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:51.980
 I'm not sure what that episode is.

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:56.220
 The idea is that there's this matrix built around the planet.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:01.020
 And when you die, when it says go into the light, that's actually a trick to get your

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.740
 soul to reincarnate on Earth.

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:07.660
 And these demons, Archons, whatever you want to call them, these alien overlords are drinking

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:09.180
 all of your negative energy.

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:13.820
 And what produces more negative energy than telling somebody that they're trapped in a

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:16.060
 matrix full of negative energy?

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:18.500
 We need more positive conspiracy theories.

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:23.620
 And I think the fact that if you start looking at elderly people thinking they're actually

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:26.220
 gray aliens on vacation, that's pretty dope.

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.020
 Again, not all of them.

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:32.420
 Don't go to a retirement home and have a conga line and be like, "Come on, grays, get on

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:33.420
 up."

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:34.420
 Actually, that sounds pretty good.

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.340
 You should volunteer at your local retirement home.

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:37.940
 It really helps out.

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:41.860
 But do not retire just because you think they're gray aliens.

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:44.660
 You're like, "Now I'll do the probing."

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:45.660
 Don't do that.

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:48.940
 There's actually a lot of crimes that happen in retirement homes.

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:51.820
 My point is, this is a good conspiracy theory.

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:52.820
 I like this.

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:54.500
 We need more of this stuff.

00:27:54.500 --> 00:28:01.220
 We need more stories that don't inspire negativity in us, but inspire hope.

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:02.980
 So ohoyle, I hope you are correct.

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:07.780
 I hope there is a portion of the elderly community that are gray aliens.

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:12.740
 Because then it would mean that this world isn't a dismal place on the brink of annihilation

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:14.060
 every single day.

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:20.420
 It's actually stable enough for aliens of all races to come here and hang out for a

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.020
 bit.

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:23.020
 That's a great conspiracy theory.

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.580
 I really do like that.

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:29.220
 Or I have to be very careful because I'm sure there's one guy right now probably grabbing

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:32.380
 his crowbar being like, "I got to take care of those gray aliens."

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:33.620
 They're walking to the retirement home.

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:38.140
 I am not saying that all elderly people are gray aliens just so we are clear.

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:40.300
 But I love this conspiracy theory.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:46.380
 Are some of them, are some elderly people gray aliens visiting in disguise?

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:47.780
 Are really any aliens, right?

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:51.500
 Although if I was a reptilian, I think I would take the form of like Shaquille O'Neal

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:55.260
 and not a 80 pound old man.

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.460
 But I like this.

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:57.460
 I like this.

00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:59.620
 I like positive conspiracy theories.

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:04.380
 And what a way to think of the world as a beautiful place that other people want to

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:05.860
 come to visit.

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:11.300
 Not a dismal place of hate and vengeance and blood and ash, but a place that is so okay

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:12.300
 to be fair.

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:13.580
 It is those things.

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:19.140
 But maybe it is better than those things combined.

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:24.540
 I think maybe the love and the joy and the passion that humanity truly has for each other

00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:31.100
 reaches out and attracts aliens of all stripes to this world.

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:32.300
 Because we're that dope.

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:33.300
 We're that awesome.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:39.580
 We're the only place in the known galaxy where it snows.

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:41.100
 They may have the starships.

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:42.880
 They may have the technology.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:47.580
 They may have the cure for all the diseases that plague us.

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:55.220
 But from the highest peak to the lowest valley, earth is the place to be.

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:57.580
 They're jealous of us.

00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:02.180
 They have all that technology, but they're jealous of us.

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:11.500
 This is the only place in the known galaxy where you can walk outside and watch it snow

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.040
 from the heavens.

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:29.280
 Powdery white bliss raining down on the beautiful planet known as our home.
