1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Learning to swim is a magical time in a child's life.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,600
 The excitement of the water.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,700
 Playing with friends.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,900
 Making memories on vacations that will last a lifetime.

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,800

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,400
 What happens when you're recording a paranormal podcast

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,200
 and the world of the paranormal wants a sneak peek at your latest episode?

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,300
 Then we travel to a lonely road in Georgia

14
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:48,900
 where an overnight attendant is besieged by a smelly vagrant.

15
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,400
 It's paranormal. It's not just somewhere.

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,600
 It's not just some smelly oboe walking around.

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,100
 It's paranormal and then we uncover a brand new conspiracy theory

18
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,700
 that's currently making the rounds.

19
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,400
 Well, one guy's talking about it, so we're going to talk about it on the show.

20
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:10,600
 Is it possible that elderly people are actually grey aliens in disguise

21
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,400
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

22
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,300
 Hey, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

23
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,200
 I'm your host, Jason Garvenor. I'm having a great day.

24
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,500
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

25
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,300
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing.

26
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:36,100
 Also, I hope you're not over the age of 65 because you might be a grey alien

27
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,600
 and then you might want to kill me for the second story.

28
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:44,200
 But before we get to that, before we get to your elderly enraged vengeance streak

29
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,500
 against me, let's go ahead and introduce our Patreon supporter.

30
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,900
 I don't know how old this guy is. This guy might be 88.

31
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:56,400
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now, everyone give a round of applause to

32
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,700
 LacanianLifter.

33
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,500
 Woo! Come on in Lacanian.

34
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,600
 Yeah, give you a big round of applause. Checking your ID, seeing how old you are.

35
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,500
 Lacanian actually used to be a Patreon and then something happened and they stopped.

36
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,800
 They're like, "Your show started to suck, bro."

37
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,500
 Now, something happened and they stopped, but they're joined back on.

38
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,800
 So thank you so much, Lacanian.

39
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,500
 You're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

40
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,500
 Because you can't to wear the Patreon, I totally get it.

41
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:23,200
 Trust me, I do. Just help spread the word about the show that really, really helps out a lot.

42
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,700
 Lacanian, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the...

43
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,600
 Jason Jett.

44
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,600
 We're actually, no, we're not going anywhere right now.

45
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,400
 Give me those keys back, bro.

46
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,000
 I want to tell you guys this.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,100
 If you guys listened to yesterday's episode, it might have ended a little bit abrupt.

48
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,900
 I haven't finished the final edit of yesterday's episode, but actually our first story takes place

49
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,000
 here in Dead Rabbit Command, here in the recording studio.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 What happened yesterday was I was finishing up the story about the ghost car.

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,700
 It was really cool. I really liked the story of the guy walking around taking the trail through Georgia.

52
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,800
 Got some good Georgia stories this week.

53
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,200
 And let me play you the audio.

54
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
 I edited this out because I thought it was too distracting.

55
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,100
 It's definitely too distracting, right?

56
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,700
 So here, let me set this up for you.

57
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,700
 So when I'm recording, I do record in a closet.

58
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:19,100
 I call it the haunted closet because I have sensed the ghost in this closet before,

59
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:25,700
 but it's really been a long time since I've seen anything in my house or really anything even in the closet.

60
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,000
 Now, as a studio, studio, it does what it does.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,600
 It has pretty good audio, but it also gets really, really hot.

62
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,000
 These are my first episodes coming back from a long break.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,900
 I was super nervous.

64
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,100
 I was just sweating the whole time.

65
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,200
 So what I did was at a certain point, I cracked open the door.

66
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,100
 I know that's not good for studio recording.

67
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,700
 They normally don't snoop, dog normally doesn't go, "Hey, I'm about to bust the track."

68
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,800
 Open the windows.

69
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,600
 Let's get all that outside noise.

70
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,500
 But I opened the door.

71
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,400
 Okay.

72
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,700
 The doors open maybe, I don't know, a little less than a foot.

73
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,100
 I'm getting some sunlight in here.

74
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,500
 I'm getting some fresh air.

75
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,900
 And if you've never, I do a live show every Sunday morning for the Patreon supporters.

76
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,400
 So they'll often see this.

77
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,100
 Sometimes I add video to it.

78
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,400
 They definitely hear it.

79
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,200
 None of this show is really scripted.

80
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,500
 It's all just notes.

81
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,700
 And then I just kind of go off the top of my head.

82
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:27,200
 That's why I'm always laughing at the jokes because it's the first time I've heard those jokes too, right?

83
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,600
 But a lot of times I come to the end of an episode and I'll just kind of go riff for like 10 minutes

84
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,400
 trying to find the right combination of words to wrap up an episode.

85
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,600
 And that's what was happening yesterday.

86
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,300
 And I'm sitting there in my closet.

87
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:47,400
 I'm trying to figure out a good way to wrap up the story about a guy who saw a ghost car.

88
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,500
 And I just can't find it.

89
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,400
 And you know, it's like 8 o'clock at night.

90
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,300
 I'm super tired and I'm super sweaty.

91
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:59,600
 And I look out the little, look out my door, right?

92
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,900
 I'm just kind of gazing around trying to think of a way to finish this episode.

93
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:10,700
 And when I look out the door, I see an apparition.

94
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,700
 I straight up see a ghost.

95
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,200
 Well, okay, so what I see, it's so weird.

96
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:27,100
 I turn and I look and I see standing right outside my door like this thing was watching me record the podcast.

97
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,500
 It was as if you took a ribbon.

98
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:40,800
 Now it was a black ribbon that was bold black on the edges and in the middle was like translucent, almost see-through, almost smoky material.

99
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:49,200
 I turned and I look and I saw hovering there for a good few seconds, hovering there, a ribbon.

100
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:58,400
 And it looked like if you had an invisible woman, invisible man standing outside your closet, like you're like, "Oh, I know exactly what that looks like, Jason."

101
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:05,100
 If you had an invisible person and you placed a ribbon on them, you could see, I could see the outline of the top of their head.

102
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,700
 And then it came down and then it was the outline of their left shoulder.

103
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,100
 The ribbon was probably about maybe two feet long.

104
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:19,500
 And I'm turning, I'm gonna play the clip for you without any audio processing or anything.

105
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,700
 I'll play that for you in a second so you can kind of hear what was going on while I was experiencing this.

106
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,000
 But I turn and I look because I'm just trying to think of a way to end this episode.

107
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,700
 I've been recording for like two hours at this point.

108
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,600
 I did two episodes back to back yesterday.

109
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:44,200
 So I look and I see this ribony, this smoky ribony thing outside of my closet in full bedroom light, you know, full lamp.

110
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,600
 Jason's not saying to the term.

111
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,600
 You know, full light bulb light.

112
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,400
 And I see it and it hangs there for a second and then it disappears.

113
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,400
 And it doesn't go, "Bip!"

114
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,700
 It doesn't disappear like a flash.

115
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,400
 It just slowly fades from view.

116
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,500
 And you can hear the audio of me experiencing this.

117
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:12,000
 I just stopped talking and I'll play that for you right now.

118
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,400
 I think the answer to that is pretty clear.

119
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:25,400
 We have a lot of stories of people mysteriously vanishing in the woods

120
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,600
 or down dark alleys

121
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,900
 or inside houses.

122
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:35,100
 We have a lot of stories of people mysteriously vanishing in the woods

123
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:43,400
 and very, very few of them ever return.

124
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,700
 Would you be one of them?

125
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:56,800
 Would you be one of those that make it back to the world of our reality?

126
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:13,800
 Dude, no joke.

127
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:23,900
 There was something standing outside my closet watching me record that.

128
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:30,500
 That was insane.

129
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,100
 Yeah, I turned.

130
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,100
 I don't know why I turned to look.

131
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,900
 You guys might have even heard me turn while I was talking.

132
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,800
 This is not scripted and nothing like that.

133
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,600
 I don't mess around with this type of stuff.

134
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,900
 Like I don't joke about this stuff.

135
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,900
 No, he profools or nothing.

136
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:51,900
 I turned and I looked.

137
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:59,200
 And it was like a black ribbon.

138
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,300
 Would have been.

139
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,400
 Hold on.

140
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:06,800
 Yeah, this is not joking around.

141
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,300
 It would have been about maybe six feet tall, but it was a black ribbon.

142
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:20,700
 But it looked like a phenomenon in my house.

143
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,200
 I do have to live.

144
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,600
 It's probably it would be like if you put a ribbon on somebody's head

145
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,600
 and like laid across the top of their head, but there's no ribbon.

146
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,300
 I don't know how often you guys watch videos of my house.

147
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:33,500
 I don't.

148
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,400
 I'm not a big ribbon a fishy and not.

149
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,700
 That was weird.

150
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:44,800
 I got that was creepy.

151
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:56,300
 There was straight up something watching me do that.

152
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,300
 Now I it was so weird, right?

153
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,000
 I kind of then I got up and I walked.

154
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 I don't know how much of the clip I'm actually going to play for you.

155
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,200
 But what if I don't play at all?

156
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,500
 What I do is then I get up and I walk around my bedroom.

157
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,100
 I'm kind of processing what I saw and I'm still talking into the microphone.

158
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,800
 I'm saying how tall.

159
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
 So here's the thing.

160
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,000
 This is the weird thing about ghosts.

161
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,500
 There's a lot of weird things about ghosts.

162
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,300
 First off, they're dead people or demons or whatever they are.

163
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,700
 But one thing that I've had in my experience because I've seen a lot of ghosts in my life is ghosts.

164
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:35,200
 Don't and if it's a real ghost in a place that I'm at, I'm not scared of it.

165
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,800
 I'm a little bit be a little bit at ease like uneasy.

166
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,700
 If it's real, I'm not scared.

167
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,600
 If it's fake, I'm scared.

168
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:50,800
 So I saw this black ribbon materialize outside my closet.

169
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,800
 Like it was peeking in.

170
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,400
 Not scared.

171
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,700
 When about my business actually went to the living room and while I was kind of editing episodes and stuff like that,

172
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,900
 I see something out of the corner of my eye in the living room.

173
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,700
 And then my black mouse, you know, my computer mouse is black and it's shiny.

174
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:14,000
 I actually see something move over the mouse like the reflection changed.

175
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,400
 So we also had that stuff going on as well.

176
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,600
 So wasn't scared.

177
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,300
 Right.

178
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,600
 Came in, shut my light off to go to bed, pulled down my phone, goofing off,

179
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,300
 going to stupid websites, stuff like that went to bed.

180
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:32,200
 Even though I saw a ghost that don't know what it is, don't know what its intent is.

181
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,300
 I see it in here.

182
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,700
 Yesterday morning, I was walking to work.

183
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,300
 I just watched the movie, the bye bye man.

184
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,400
 I'd watched the movie, the bye bye man and I was walking to work and I was thinking of the bye bye man

185
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,200
 and a squirrel jumped out of a bush and I almost beat my pants.

186
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,400
 It's so weird.

187
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,200
 It's so weird.

188
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,800
 Like something that's fake will scare me.

189
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,000
 The bye bye man.

190
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,800
 I'm like, oh, but when there's a ghost in my actual apartment, it doesn't scare me.

191
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,100
 However, I know I'm a paranormal researcher.

192
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,000
 I know I'm a ghost hunter.

193
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,400
 You don't want it in your house.

194
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,000
 Really.

195
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,100
 I mean, now it's attacking me.

196
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:12,400
 Ah, no, I'm not saying you got to leave, but it's more troublesome.

197
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,400
 Like I don't really think this, whatever this is, has any ill will towards me.

198
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,200
 So that's interesting.

199
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:24,400
 But like if the goblins are supposed to be at your house and then I go to your house

200
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,800
 and investigate goblin activity.

201
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,800
 I don't think even a hunter, like if you were a hunter, I don't think you want a bunch of rabbits

202
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,900
 jumping around in your house.

203
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,200
 Right.

204
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:37,600
 I mean, you're like, I love shooting rabbits in the brain with the shotgun, but I like to go.

205
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,800
 I like to do it on my off time, not at home.

206
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,400
 So we'll see what happens.

207
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,700
 Like this could have been a one off thing.

208
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:50,600
 I didn't feel any ill will towards if it does decide to stick around, you know, I'll deal with it.

209
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,700
 I'm not going to sage the place or anything like that if it has good intent, right?

210
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,900
 But that was really weird.

211
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,700
 It was really weird to see something like that.

212
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:04,500
 It's been years since I've seen a ghost on that level.

213
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,600
 But there's one here now, apparently.

214
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,700
 Maybe it's just passing through.

215
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,600
 Maybe it's waiting for the ghost bus.

216
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,800
 Maybe it's on the way to your house.

217
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,200
 And if so, then I think it's pretty chill.

218
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,300
 Actually, I wouldn't worry about it.

219
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,400
 But yeah, it's just weird, just weird to be record.

220
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,400
 And you know, it's so funny.

221
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,100
 I think it was in that episode or the episode before it.

222
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,300
 I was like, oh, that ghost can come to my house.

223
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,000
 I kept talking about someone who's trying to get a ghost to come to their house.

224
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,600
 I think it was the Monday episode and maybe a ghost, maybe a ghost.

225
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,700
 And then understand I was speaking in the third person.

226
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,300
 Who knows?

227
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:39,400
 But a weird story nonetheless.

228
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,000
 You know, that took a lot longer.

229
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,100
 And I know with all the processing and everything like that,

230
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,000
 that segment's probably going to be like 20 minutes.

231
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,100
 Let's go ahead and set aside the hobo vagrant story.

232
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,100
 We're going to save that for tomorrow.

233
00:13:53,100 --> 00:14:00,100
 Let's move into a snowier region than my house.

234
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,900
 So let's go ahead and toss the canning and lifter the keys to the carpenter copter.

235
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,000
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

236
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,100
 We're flying all the way out to a snowy mountain town.

237
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:18,200
 This story is short.

238
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,400
 We might have time for the Georgia story, but I want to make sure I can give the story.

239
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,000
 It's full, full due.

240
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,300
 And I've got to give a shout out to Amphis Allen.

241
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:31,700
 Amphis Allen, longtime supporter of the show, sent us a lot of really good stuff for Dead Rabbit.

242
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,500
 I really, really appreciate it.

243
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,600
 This story is just as good as the other ones.

244
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,600
 Like sending me nothing but gold.

245
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:46,800
 Amphis Allen apparently posted this video the other day of a 70 year old woman.

246
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,300
 He, let me get this straight actually.

247
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,200
 So he videotaped, no, no, no.

248
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,200
 He posted a video.

249
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,300
 He's skiing and his mother-in-law is filming him.

250
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,700
 His 70 year old mother-in-law is filming him.

251
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:04,200
 And he's like, "Chair in a month, go Amphis Allen, go!"

252
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,600
 And it was like, "Hey, look at this."

253
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,000
 It was from a subreddit called Praise the Cameraman.

254
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,500
 Because the cameraman's doing, or camera woman, don't be sexist subreddit.

255
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,800
 So anyways, this actually was a woman.

256
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,700
 They're going down the hill.

257
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,700
 So he posted this video.

258
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,900
 It's like, "Hey, look at my mother-in-law is filming me as I'm flying down the slopes."

259
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,600
 This dude actually is like a world renowned athlete, Amphis Allen.

260
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,700
 So he posted this video and because the internet is a super, super weird place,

261
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:36,000
 he gets a comment from a guy known as Ahoyle.

262
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,100
 And Ahoyle tells this story.

263
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,700
 Ahoyle says, "You know what?

264
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,500
 I used to live in a mountain town."

265
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,100
 And that's where we're walking around right now.

266
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,900
 We're walking around this unnamed mountain town.

267
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,900
 We got big mittens on in like the parkas and we're walking around.

268
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,000
 Ahoyle's story is this.

269
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:00,300
 He used to live in a mountain town up in a snowy region.

270
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,600
 And he worked at the local pizza shop, the local pizzeria where you'd go in and you'd

271
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:11,800
 get some delicious food, maybe throw back a brusque or two and watch the snow fall outside.

272
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,900
 And he says, you know what?

273
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,500
 He's referring to Amphis Allen's 70-year-old mother-in-law videotaping this.

274
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,500
 He goes, "You know what?

275
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:25,600
 I'm going to be surprised how many old people can ski in snowboard and do it fairly well."

276
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,600
 And he goes, "I have a theory and to be honest, I'm kind of joking, but I'm kind of not.

277
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:37,800
 I believe that aliens hide out in mountain towns all over the world."

278
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,200
 So think about it.

279
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,800
 Old people look like gray aliens, right?

280
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,000
 Hold your questions until the end.

281
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,300
 Old people kind of do look like gray aliens, right?

282
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,100
 They're balding.

283
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,900
 Gray aliens are bald.

284
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,900
 They got skinny little limbs.

285
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,500
 Gray aliens have skinny little limbs.

286
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,500
 That's kind of weird that they're not gray.

287
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,700
 Most old people aren't gray.

288
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,100
 However, they do start to get a little ashy looking, right?

289
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,100
 Why do they do that?

290
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,300
 Why do you old people...

291
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:12,900
 YouTube's going to shut this down for ageism, but when you get old, you know, you do...

292
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,400
 You kind of lose a little bit of color in your skin.

293
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,400
 So why?

294
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,500
 Is it because they're old and they are having less nutrients or they're out in the sun less?

295
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,700
 Is it because they're not human anymore?

296
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,100
 Gray aliens?

297
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,800
 But he says it's weird because old people do kind of look like gray aliens, but that's

298
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,800
 not the only thing.

299
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,900
 That's not the only part of this conspiracy theory.

300
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:38,000
 He goes, "Sometimes when I'm working at a pizzeria, I'd get these elderly people showing

301
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,200
 up to the pizza shop and they would be paying me in cash.

302
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:50,700
 And the cash was always old money, like the bills, the bills, the dates when the bills

303
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:57,000
 were printed were like the 1960s, but they looked brand new.

304
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,500
 So I was getting this money that was brand new that had old dates on it from like the

305
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:08,440
 60s, and I thought, hmm, maybe they're gray aliens, right?

306
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,400
 These people up in mountain regions pay me in weird money.

307
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,100
 Now I would assume there's some sort of counterfeit ring going on.

308
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,100
 That would be my first assumption.

309
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,100
 Did I ever talk to you?

310
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,440
 Did I ever mention that before?

311
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,720
 My grandpa knew a guy who counterfeited money.

312
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,720
 My grandpa's dead.

313
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,500
 You can't come after him, FBI, but my grandpa knew a dude who would counterfeit money and

314
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:34,640
 he lived on a boat in Sacramento and he would just have a water cooler of $5 bills, fake

315
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,160
 $5 bills, and he would just hand them out to people.

316
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,240
 I don't know who the guy was before the feds come and asked me.

317
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,760
 I don't know who the guy was.

318
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,960
 It's been 20 years since I heard that story, but so you do have old people who counterfeit

319
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,920
 and they just counterfeit very, very low bills.

320
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:53,440
 But anyways, anyways, now that it's a counterfeit ring, he thinks they might be gray aliens,

321
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,000
 but here's the interesting part, right?

322
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,220
 Ampestal and Sendis told me we both had a good chuckle, but there was something that

323
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,160
 could be fact checked with this conspiracy theory, and those are always the best conspiracy

324
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,840
 theories, the ones that we can actually take a really close look at.

325
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:15,120
 He said snow, this is what Ohio said, snow is actually kind of a rare phenomenon as far

326
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,560
 as the galaxy goes.

327
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,840
 Now I can't fact check that old people love to use new bills other than the fact that

328
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,320
 my grandpa knew a counterfeiter, an elderly counterfeiter.

329
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:32,480
 And yeah, sure, old people do kind of look like gray aliens if you forget the fact they

330
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,320
 have giant eyeballs and they're three feet tall and they have these massive heads, sure,

331
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,520
 they share some of the qualities of a gray alien, i.e. they have arms and legs and they're

332
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,560
 bold.

333
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,240
 But snow is a rare phenomenon galactically.

334
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,040
 So me and Ampestal were kind of joking about this and then I looked it up.

335
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:58,040
 Snow is extremely rare.

336
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:03,000
 H2, I know a bunch of scientists, I know a bunch of people who are into science who listen

337
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 to this podcast are typing comments and emails right now, hold on.

338
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:16,040
 Snow as we know it, H2O snow that sticks and packs and forms snow shelves and snowy mountains

339
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,640
 and stuff like that, we're the only place in the solar system that we know that this

340
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,680
 happens.

341
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:27,960
 There's other planets, there's moons that we think it snows, but it's like volcanic

342
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,080
 ash coming down from the sky.

343
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,800
 It's carbon snow.

344
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:39,280
 It's like Mars, it snows like there's ice, but snow they said it doesn't stick, like

345
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,880
 it snows in the poles, but by the time it hits the ground it's gone.

346
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,120
 We think, we think it might snow on Pluto, as much as we know that Pluto is like super

347
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,660
 frozen.

348
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,120
 We don't know for sure.

349
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,280
 Even then it's Pluto.

350
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,600
 Even then it's a dirt ball of a planet that's super far away.

351
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:06,400
 This is super interesting because snow is so rare in our solar system that you would

352
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,760
 have to extrapolate that out.

353
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,280
 It's probably very rare galactically.

354
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,320
 Something that for the most part we take for granted.

355
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:19,400
 I always thought it was interesting that the number one, as far as we know, the number

356
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:26,460
 one rarest thing in the universe, liquid water, we pour all over our bodies, we splash it

357
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,460
 in our face.

358
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,900
 I mean we do drink it, right?

359
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:35,420
 But we build holes in the ground and fill it full of the most precious resource in the

360
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,420
 universe.

361
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,860
 As far as we know, liquid water is one of the rarest things ever.

362
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:44,820
 It rains diamonds on like Jupiter or Saturn or something like that, or one of the moons.

363
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,860
 But there's no liquid water anywhere else that we know of.

364
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,880
 And we put it in balloons and throw it at people, right?

365
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,600
 We spray our dogs with a hose and they go "ugh" and they get it all wiggly all over you and

366
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,000
 it's fun.

367
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,840
 And then Charles Crone yells at you "Bate-O-Van!"

368
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,840
 That's weird.

369
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,080
 That is the detail that makes me go "Maybe there is something to this."

370
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:12,600
 Now again, YouTube and anyone else who thinks I'm being "agist" I'm not saying that all

371
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,480
 old people are grey aliens.

372
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:23,140
 So what I am saying is that if you could travel the galaxy and you'd seen stars explode and

373
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,440
 you'd watch your buddies get sucked into a black hole and you're like "Oh that prank went

374
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,440
 bad!"

375
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,980
 As you watch their entire starship get stuck on the event horizon, you've seen all of these

376
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,300
 great things but snow.

377
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:42,660
 Standing outside watching frozen water softly come down sticking out your little tongue,

378
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,020
 getting some on it.

379
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:50,280
 It's to be so rare you could experience so many other amazing things throughout the galaxy

380
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:57,040
 but if you wanted to see snow you'd have to come here.

381
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:03,760
 You wanted to ski, snowball fight, igloos, whatever.

382
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,360
 You'd have to do it here.

383
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:13,160
 That's so interesting and think about this when you have like old people here or rich

384
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:18,440
 people whatever and they want to vacation, sure they could go to a tropical location

385
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,460
 anywhere on the planet.

386
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,180
 They could go to some deserted island.

387
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,540
 They're rich and powerful.

388
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,540
 They can go anywhere, right?

389
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,540
 They can afford anything.

390
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:29,060
 But they still go to the same resort towns that everyone else goes to because the infrastructure

391
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,700
 is there to support them.

392
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:36,380
 If Bill Gates wanted to go to a tropical island but there's no landing pad there and let's

393
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,820
 say that he goes "Build the landing pad then he gets there."

394
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,540
 There's no hotels, there's no houses.

395
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,240
 It's just a deserted island.

396
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,880
 He's like "Ah, this totally sucks and you'd have to build the infrastructure."

397
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,840
 All that infrastructure is here.

398
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:54,800
 So sure even if there was another planet where it did snow, H2O, there's no resorts, there's

399
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,640
 no pizzerias, there's no infrastructure for that.

400
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,240
 So this, it's interesting because we always talk about Earth being a prison planet.

401
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,960
 We talk about Earth being a zoo.

402
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,440
 The aliens a long time ago put us here and they crossbred themselves with the monkey

403
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,300
 people and then that's where the Homo sapiens came from and we went to dig up gold for the

404
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,740
 Anunnaki and da da da da.

405
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,500
 It's always so dismal and dark and evil, right?

406
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:28,260
 It's always we were slaves or we are prisoners or the Archons or drinking our loosh when

407
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,900
 we die and we get stuck in a reincarnation.

408
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,100
 Why is it always so dismal with conspiracy theories?

409
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,140
 Why is it always so negative?

410
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,040
 Pretty Earth is the happiest place in the galaxy.

411
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:45,640
 I mean, okay, outside of all the wars, outside of all the wars and the pestilence and stuff

412
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,240
 like that and all the horrible crimes.

413
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:54,360
 Galactically speaking, we don't have volcanoes that rip the atmosphere in two.

414
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:59,040
 We are not sitting on the edge of a star system that's about to go supernova.

415
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,040
 Pretty chill, right?

416
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,800
 The environment is stable.

417
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:09,940
 It snows, it rains, there's beautiful sunsets.

418
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:16,420
 You can sit on a beach and a day later be scaling a mountain, looking down at the valley

419
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,420
 below.

420
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,620
 It's really a beautiful place.

421
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,540
 So maybe we aren't a prison planet.

422
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:27,460
 Maybe we aren't some sort of zoo where the monkeys have taken over.

423
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:32,260
 Maybe we're club med as far as the galaxy goes and that's why so many aliens are coming

424
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,260
 here.

425
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:38,980
 We're always hearing about these reptilians and Pleiadians and the grays and all these

426
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:39,980
 other guys, right?

427
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:44,480
 Because you imagine, I don't think the Pleiadians have a bunch of reptilians walking around.

428
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,700
 And I imagine on the gray alien homeworld, if that even exists, a lot of people think

429
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,960
 it's their biorobots created by the reptilians.

430
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,060
 But we're going to into the weeds here.

431
00:25:55,060 --> 00:26:00,480
 We're the only planet that all these other different species can come to, right?

432
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,660
 Maybe we are a resort planet.

433
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:09,500
 Maybe we are the cancun of the galaxy.

434
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,780
 And so it would make sense that you would have gray aliens coming down or any aliens,

435
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,780
 right?

436
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,860
 I think a lot of alien with an alien lore, especially with reptilians, their shapeshifters,

437
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:23,060
 it would make sense for them to come down to a place that's peaceful, that doesn't have

438
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,060
 all of their wars.

439
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:29,580
 It has our wars, but it doesn't have these galaxy spanning conflicts.

440
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:35,180
 We may actually be the Casablanca of the galaxy, a neutral planet that people can come and

441
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,180
 relax.

442
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:40,540
 Very, very fascinating conspiracy theory, I think.

443
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,980
 And we need more positive conspiracy theories.

444
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,980
 I really do.

445
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,700
 If you want to talk about the Archons drinking our lush, the way you could generate the

446
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,220
 mo- We did a whole episode on that.

447
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,980
 That's really what in the world's lush.

448
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,980
 I'm not sure what that episode is.

449
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:56,220
 The idea is that there's this matrix built around the planet.

450
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:01,020
 And when you die, when it says go into the light, that's actually a trick to get your

451
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:02,740
 soul to reincarnate on Earth.

452
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:07,660
 And these demons, Archons, whatever you want to call them, these alien overlords are drinking

453
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,180
 all of your negative energy.

454
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:13,820
 And what produces more negative energy than telling somebody that they're trapped in a

455
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,060
 matrix full of negative energy?

456
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,500
 We need more positive conspiracy theories.

457
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:23,620
 And I think the fact that if you start looking at elderly people thinking they're actually

458
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,220
 gray aliens on vacation, that's pretty dope.

459
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,020
 Again, not all of them.

460
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:32,420
 Don't go to a retirement home and have a conga line and be like, "Come on, grays, get on

461
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,420
 up."

462
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,420
 Actually, that sounds pretty good.

463
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,340
 You should volunteer at your local retirement home.

464
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,940
 It really helps out.

465
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:41,860
 But do not retire just because you think they're gray aliens.

466
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,660
 You're like, "Now I'll do the probing."

467
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,660
 Don't do that.

468
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,940
 There's actually a lot of crimes that happen in retirement homes.

469
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,820
 My point is, this is a good conspiracy theory.

470
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,820
 I like this.

471
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,500
 We need more of this stuff.

472
00:27:54,500 --> 00:28:01,220
 We need more stories that don't inspire negativity in us, but inspire hope.

473
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,980
 So ohoyle, I hope you are correct.

474
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:07,780
 I hope there is a portion of the elderly community that are gray aliens.

475
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:12,740
 Because then it would mean that this world isn't a dismal place on the brink of annihilation

476
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,060
 every single day.

477
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:20,420
 It's actually stable enough for aliens of all races to come here and hang out for a

478
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,020
 bit.

479
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,020
 That's a great conspiracy theory.

480
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,580
 I really do like that.

481
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:29,220
 Or I have to be very careful because I'm sure there's one guy right now probably grabbing

482
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,380
 his crowbar being like, "I got to take care of those gray aliens."

483
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,620
 They're walking to the retirement home.

484
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:38,140
 I am not saying that all elderly people are gray aliens just so we are clear.

485
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,300
 But I love this conspiracy theory.

486
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:46,380
 Are some of them, are some elderly people gray aliens visiting in disguise?

487
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,780
 Are really any aliens, right?

488
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:51,500
 Although if I was a reptilian, I think I would take the form of like Shaquille O'Neal

489
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,260
 and not a 80 pound old man.

490
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,460
 But I like this.

491
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,460
 I like this.

492
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,620
 I like positive conspiracy theories.

493
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:04,380
 And what a way to think of the world as a beautiful place that other people want to

494
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,860
 come to visit.

495
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:11,300
 Not a dismal place of hate and vengeance and blood and ash, but a place that is so okay

496
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,300
 to be fair.

497
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,580
 It is those things.

498
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:19,140
 But maybe it is better than those things combined.

499
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:24,540
 I think maybe the love and the joy and the passion that humanity truly has for each other

500
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:31,100
 reaches out and attracts aliens of all stripes to this world.

501
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,300
 Because we're that dope.

502
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,300
 We're that awesome.

503
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:39,580
 We're the only place in the known galaxy where it snows.

504
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,100
 They may have the starships.

505
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,880
 They may have the technology.

506
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,580
 They may have the cure for all the diseases that plague us.

507
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:55,220
 But from the highest peak to the lowest valley, earth is the place to be.

508
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,580
 They're jealous of us.

509
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:02,180
 They have all that technology, but they're jealous of us.

510
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:11,500
 This is the only place in the known galaxy where you can walk outside and watch it snow

511
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,040
 from the heavens.

512
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:29,280
 Powdery white bliss raining down on the beautiful planet known as our home.

513
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,840
