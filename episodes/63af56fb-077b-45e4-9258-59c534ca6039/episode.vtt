 And the superhero is also a serial killer, so get ready.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 And then, we take a look at a trio of terrifying ghost stories.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 But these just aren't any spooky ghost stories.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
 We're gonna take a look at three ghost stories

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 that may be the worst possible places

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 for your soul to be trapped forever.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 [music]

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 I'm having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 We got a lot of stuff to cover, so we're gonna get started right away.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 First off, coming in from my list of Christmas livestream contributors,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 wearing all the jingle bells in the world.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 Everyone give a round of applause for Dave.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 Woo yeah, come on in buddies, come on in.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 Those jingle bells are stapled to your skin.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 Don't even try to get them off.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 Dave, you're gonna feel like wildlife,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 give you money, we're always tormented.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Dave, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 If you guys can't support the show financially,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 I totally understand just helps Fred the word about the show

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 that really, really, really helps out a lot.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 And I want to say this real quick,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 I know we got a lot of stuff to cover, but I gotta say this.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 This week is the four year anniversary of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 Four years, 901 episodes,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 and I could not have done any of it without you guys.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 If you guys have ever told someone else to listen to Dead Rabbit Radio,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 if you guys have ever donated any money to Dead Rabbit Radio,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 if you guys have even sat back with a smile and listened to one of my super disturbing episodes,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 apparently there's some serial killers who listen to this show,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 you guys have done your part to keep Dead Rabbit Radio going.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 And I really, really appreciate that.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 Really appreciate that.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 The audience of this show has grown tremendously over the past four years,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 and it is so amazing that I can walk into my closet,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
 sit in front of a microphone and speak to so many people,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 but I could not do that if it wasn't for you.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 So really guys, thank you so much,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 and I'm telling you this, not just a brag,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 I'm telling you this because I want you to start your projects as well.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 I started this show four years ago,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 it has changed my life for the better.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 It really, really has.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 So if you guys have an artistic project,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 or if you guys have a personal project,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 a personal goal you want to do,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 please start it today.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 Start it today, stick with it,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 because my life has been tremendously impacted in only the most positive ways

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 because of Dead Rabbit Radio,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 and I want to share that with you.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 I want to share that inspiration with you.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 Okay Dave, Dave's still trying to pull those staples out.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 Don't pull the staples out, those are like medical staples.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 You're going to jingle the rest of the episode.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 Dave, let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the Jason Jalopy.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 We are driving all the way out to Little Rock, Arkansas.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 [imitates car engine]

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 And by the time we get there, it's nighttime.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 [imitates car engine]

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 There's a wolf sitting on a big old rock, and we pass.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 It's actually the Little Rock, the Little Rock in the middle of Arkansas.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 We see a little wolf, he's howling, and like the moon's in the sky,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 and there's an owl.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 [imitates animal howling]

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
 I'm just naming all the animals now, there's a squirrel.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 [imitates animal howling]

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
 All the animal noises I could possibly do in elephant walks,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 and whaa, we're in Little Rock, Arkansas.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 And the streets seem to be empty.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 You can even hear the bluebirds in our district.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 The streets seem empty, but they're not.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 There's two people stalking the streets of Little Rock at this time in the morning.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 One is the Little Rock slasher, but hot on his trail.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 Is the real-life superhero, Shadow Vision.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 This is true stuff is actually going on, this is totally true.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 Back on August 24th, 2020, in Little Rock, Arkansas,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 some guy's walking down the road early in the morning,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 and he sees someone slumped up, kind of curled up on the porch of this house.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 I think that was the check on him.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 Hey buddy, you okay? You okay buddy?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
 He wasn't okay, just to jump to the conclusion he's dead.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 This guy, Larry Eugene McChristian, a 64 year old man, has been stabbed to death.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 So the dude calls the police and the medics and everything and they show up,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 and what they find out, that wasn't his house.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
 That wasn't his house, he just had ended up on the stoop of some random person's house.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 And the police find out that this homeowner has a security camera.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 Probably couldn't have if people were being killed on your front porch.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 The police are reviewing the footage and what they see.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 This is the place in the early morning.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 They see Larry get murdered on camera.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 This guy's like stabbing him, he's like "Ahhh!"

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
 And then the dude leaves, not Larry, he's unfortunately staying there.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000
 The killer leaves, he walks off camera and then he comes back and starts stabbing him some more,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 and then leaves again.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 But unfortunately this camera footage did not show the killer's face,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 the cops are like "Oh no, we were hoping our job would be super easy,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
 we were hoping that he would wave at the camera and hold up a copy of his driver's license."

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 The very next month, September 23rd, 2020, a man is found on a porch.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 A man is found stabbed to death on a porch.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 This time though, it was his own porch.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
 That makes a difference, I don't know if it's more comfortable to die on your own porch.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 I've never been murdered, but I figured it'd be more comfortable to die on my own porch, right?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
 Cause you're like "Ahhh, hold the memories!"

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 You know what I mean?

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 At least you're like dying in a familiar place versus dying on someone else's porch.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 I don't know though.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
 He stabbed it up on his own porch, and this guy's name was Jeff Welch, he was also 64.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 And the police at this point are kind of thinking these two might be related,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
 I mean, they have a lot of similarities, right?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
 They're both stabbed on porch, well they're both stabbed, that's the most important thing, right?

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 They're both stabbed, they're both stabbed on porches, they're both around the same age.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 And it seemed to be that these people were just out late at night,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 they had no connection to each other, they had no connection to criminal activity,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 they just got stabbed.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 But then nothing happened, nothing happened until April 11th, 2021,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 where Deborah Walker, a 41 year old woman, was walking down 19th and Marshall,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 she was in that area in Little Rock,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.000
 and she passes a stranger who pulls out a knife and just starts stabbing her.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 Now she survived, she was stabbed 15 times, and she survived.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:55.000
 But less than 24 hours later, the Little Rock slasher struck again,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 less than 24 hours later, and only a block away from where Deborah Walker was stabbed,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000
 Marlin Anthony Franklin, a 40 year old homeless man, is stabbed to death.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 Those are the four victims we know about, we don't know if this guy's traveling around the country or what.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 But we don't have to worry, we do not have to worry citizens of the world

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 because Shadow Vision, a real life superhero, is on the case.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000
 Now I've done a couple episodes on real life superheroes, I love real life superheroes.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 I do think it's kind of torky, I think it's kind of torky,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
 but the idea of being able to dress up in a superhero costume and walk around and fight crime,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
 who doesn't want to do that?

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 Who doesn't want to do that?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 Now I'm not physically fit enough to do it.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 I'm not even physically fit enough to put on the costume, it would look like a joke on me,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 unless that was my identity if I was like the Incredible Bulk or something like that.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
 But otherwise, that's a bad idea, I'm not gonna do that, I'm not gonna do that,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 but even like dressing up in the gear, dude, oh that'd be so dope and you're walking around

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
 and you're like, "Stop, evil doer," and then you're like jumping out of the shadows

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 and grabbing people and you're punching them in the head.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
 Where's your money?

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 Dude are you just a criminal as well?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 Well that's the interesting thing about this.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 We did a big episode on the rise and fall of Phoenix Jones, he was a real life superhero in Seattle,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 and in that episode he does become a criminal in real life, like he was this, he was the prototypical

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 real life superhero and then he turned out, if I remember correctly, to be a drug dealer, allegedly, right?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
 I think the trial's still going on, but...

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 Well that's when we take a look at this character named Shadow Vision,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 and again, I am completely enamored by this dude,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 because his gear looks dope.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 This guy, he has one of the best superhero costumes that I've seen,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 well okay, let me back up, one of the best real life superhero costumes I've ever seen.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 He's all clad in black, he does kinda look like he's wearing hockey pads in a couple places,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
 he says it's bulletproof, but I don't think so, I think he got it at Big Five Sports,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 he does have two katanas and two size, you know those little things that Raphael used,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
 and people used for farming in ancient Japan, he has one of those on each hip,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:22.000
 and he has two swords in his back, like Storm Shadow, he's dressed in all black, like black armor, not like black tight,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
 and then he has a helmet on, and I watched the interview with him,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000
 and if you didn't think this costume could get badass enough, he has a voice changer in his helmet,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 now it does make it very hard to understand, it does sound like he's whispering,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000
 it does sound like he's quite a shy superhero, but it's still dope, I love real life superheroes.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 So when I saw that Shadow Vision was hunting the little rock slasher, I was like,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 "Oh, I didn't know the little rock slasher existed, now I saw this article from Oxygen.com,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 that Shadow Vision is hunting down the serial killer that I wasn't even worried about."

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 But here's the problem, what if your real life superhero, who's hunting a serial killer, is a serial killer?

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:18.000
 Oxygen.com, their true crime section, reached out to this dude, to ask him about this hunt for the little rock slasher,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 and he said that he has already killed two serial killers.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:33.000
 Shadow Vision, who's probably more than capable enough with his weaponry to kill someone,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 says that he killed a serial killer in North Carolina, and another serial killer in Arkansas,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
 back in the 1990s.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
 Now sure, they're serial killers, I'm not saying they need human rights or anything like that,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 but I'm pretty sure if you kill more than one person, you're a serial killer,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 it's generally if you killed in more than one person over a prolonged period of time,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 if you do it very quickly, it's a mass killing, and if you do it over the course of a couple hours in multiple locations,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 it's a SPREE killing, but if you do it over a prolonged period of time, it's a serial killer,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 so that's like the definition between those.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:20.000
 He admitted this, he admitted this, and now, he doesn't want to catch the little rock slasher and bring him to justice,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
 he wants to kill this guy too.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 He has challenged the little rock slasher, who has a body count of three, right?

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 They're almost died, they're almost died.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 He wants to challenge the little rock slasher to a one on one fight.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
 That's dope.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 That's so awesome, that is so awesome.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
 Now obviously, I was not saying Shadow Vision wins, but then he's just killed another person.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 This is interesting.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 Shadow Vision, I'm pretty sure that's against the law, I'm pretty sure, like yes, serial killers suck,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 I'm pretty sure you just can't kill him, and I'm pretty sure you can't acknowledge it in an interview on Oxygen.com.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 He's admitted to killing two people, and I don't know what the Arkansas police have to say about this.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
 They must know this guy is nuts, right?

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
 Actually, I was going to say, "Hey, go ahead, just make it enough."

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 But if someone who's nuts say that they've murdered two people, you should probably look into it a little bit more.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000
 And he also says he loves hunting down high ranking gang members.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 And he does have this weird belief that the little rock slasher is obsessed with Shadow Vision.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 He's like, "I know you're on my Facebook page. I know he's watching every move, so I have a challenge for you.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
 I know your name, I'm coming for you, I'm looking for you right now."

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 He does say that he knows this guy's name, he's not even giving it to the police.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 He wants to have a one on one fight with a serial killer.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
 "Hey, that's dope. I'm not going to knock the guy's hustle.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 I'm a little concerned that he's killed more than one person.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
 And, you know, even though I don't like serial killers, that's against the law.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
 You also probably should go to jail."

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 But until then, this is dope. I would love to see this fight.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 I imagine it's going to take place in a warehouse.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
 An abandoned warehouse where Shadow Vision is walking in with his swords.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 They come out, come out, little rock slasher.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 And then they find Shadow Vision's body on a patio somewhere.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 I don't think you could take out a random serial killer like this.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
 A Ted Bundy dude easily. Easily.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
 I think most of America could beat the butter out of Ted Bundy.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
 I think he was a wuss. I think a lot of him.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 I think John Wayne Gacy, I think Jeffrey Dahmer.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 But they all used tricks and drugs and manipulation.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 Someone who's just walking down the street.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
 Someone who's just walking down the street with a knife randomly stabbing people.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 That's fast. That takes speed. It takes skill.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 That has the element of surprise.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
 Like for all Shadow Vision knows, he's going to be walking on the street one day.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 Bulletproof armor is not knife-proof.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
 I could easily identify many vulnerable parts of his uniform.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 And I was just looking at photos on Oxygen.com.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 I'm not walking behind him with a knife.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 Shadow Vision, I wish he the best. I really do love Real Life Super Heroes.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
 I wish he the best. I also wish that you would stop antagonizing serial killers.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 Because maybe he knows you can beat him.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 And he's like, "Oh no, I thought I was the biggest badass dude in Little Rock."

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
 "I guess I'll just move to Miami and stab people down there."

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
 The cops aren't looking for him down there.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 Shadow Vision maybe don't scare him away.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 You know what? Shadow Vision maybe just give his name to the police.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
 That's what I think would be the sensible thing.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 But I am not a Real Life Super Hero. I don't know how the industry works.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 Maybe once your swords are drawn, they must taste blood.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 Dave, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Carbenter Coptor.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 We are leaving behind Little Rock.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 We're going to take a look at a trio of terrifying ghost stories.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
 First off, take us all the way out to Huntsville, Alabama.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 [hums]

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 A lot of times when we think about how spooky a ghost story is,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 we think about how it affects us as living people, right?

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 You don't want to see a ghost when you're in the shower.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
 You don't want to be walking out to your car and you see like a little ghost kid hiding underneath it.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 We think about the haunted house in the end of the street

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 or the fear that our own house may be haunted.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 Going into the bathroom of your workplace late at night when you're the only employee

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
 and you hear the bathroom door open behind you.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 All this stuff, we think about, wouldn't that be creepy?

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 I don't want to be in a situation with a ghost,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
 but very rarely do we think about the situations of the ghosts themselves.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 How sucky it might be to be a ghost.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 Now, I would say most ghosts live a pretty chill life, right?

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
 But I think there are some ghosts that end up in really bad situations.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
 I know at the local Walmart here, I've talked about this before,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 it's haunted, the Walmart and Hood River is haunted.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000
 And apparently this is the theory, it's haunted by an old lady.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 At one point, there was a huge chunk in the back of the story that was fabrics and crafts.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.000
 It had one of the biggest fabrics and crafts sections in the entire area.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 And they ended up turning it into automotive.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 And the theory was, my theory really, the employees were like,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 we don't even like being back there late at night, it's haunted.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
 But my theory was, I go, I wonder if there was an old lady who loved going through arts and crafts

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 and she was there for years going through all the new designs

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 and looking at all the happy kids who were like, yeah, I get to do arts and crafts.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 And then she's looking at carburetor fluid and socket wrenches and stuff like that.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 And she's mad, she keeps knocking stuff over.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
 That's how they feel there's a ghost in there.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
 That would suck.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
 I think some ghosts have it bad.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 And I found these three ghost stories where the torment these guys are going through has to be awful.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
 In Huntsville, Alabama, there's the Heritage Bible College.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.000
 And on campus, there is the WHBC Frat House.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 So toga, toga.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.000
 I mean, I guess it's Bible College, they're actually wearing togas for their Greek courses they're doing.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 But at the Frat House, they must throw some really cool parties at the Frat House at the Bible College late at night.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
 You can hear a ghost walking around.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 And they know who this ghost is.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 It's a former youth minister who resided there, Anthony Stevens.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
 And you can hear his footsteps walking through the house.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 He's also known for fleshing the toilet.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 [Flushing]

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 I gotta say, out of all the places I could haunt, a Frat House would be pretty dope.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 You'd be invited to all the parties.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 Secondly, they can't get rid of you, you're a ghost.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
 They're all putting body paint on you, you're holding up glow sticks and dancing.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 That'd be dope!

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 I would love to be at a Frat House.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000
 Constantly possessing dudes and being like, "Hey ladies, this way."

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
 My head spinning around and throwing up, throwing up.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 Frat House would be dope.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 But what made this one get the list of really bad hauntings, bad places to haunt,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
 is that Anthony Stevens is not alone.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
 There are two other ghosts trapped with him.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 And not only are they trapped in the house with him, because you can figure if he's in the bathroom flesh in the toilet,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 you can have one up in the attic just sitting there all spooky,

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 and then one in the basement playing pinball or whatever.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 They can have their own rooms.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 But no, at WHBC Frat House, Anthony Steven walks through the house.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:41.000
 And these two other spirits, Robert, Ekibus, and Adam Cooper, they know the names of these ghosts as well,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 are constantly right behind Anthony.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 The whole time, you hear Anthony's footprints, and then you hear two people standing right behind him going,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 "Cheese."

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 "Cheese."

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
 "Cheese."

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
 Forever.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 You just hear people saying the word "cheese," or a word that sounds like cheese,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 as you hear disembodied footprints.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 Anthony's walking.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 While those two other buddies have Casper bodies, you don't hear them walking.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
 They're just kind of floating around, and forever and always, they say, "Cheese."

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 "Cheese."

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
 That sounds like bullying, bro.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.000
 I'm wondering if, like, Anthony was constantly pestered by these two guys,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 and they just said, "Cheese." They weren't very inventive. They weren't really good at coming up with nicknames or jokes or anything.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 And they just said, "Cheese" to them all the time, and it's like this eternal torment.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 That would suck.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:57.000
 Could you imagine being trapped in a haunted house, not as a living person, trapped as a spirit?

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
 You're the haunting with your bully.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 That might have to be one of the worst possible death outcomes ever.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 Your bully was chasing you down the street. You both fell at the same time, and a steamroller ran you both over.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 Your guts squished together, forming one mass.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 But somehow, somehow the coroner could tell that the bully was still punching you in the liver as you guys were getting squished.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
 Now you and the bully are haunting a location.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
 And the bully hasn't stopped being a bully.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 You think this isn't bold and damn.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 He now has the power to pull all sorts of pranks.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
 He's giving you ghost wedgies. He's giving you ghost noogies.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
 He constantly throws you into hell.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 And you have to claw your way back to the world of the living.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 He's like, "Ha ha ha, he's laughing so hard."

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 That's nuts.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000
 Could you imagine haunting the same location as people who taunted you all the time?

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
 That might be a fate worse than death.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
 But if you think that's bad,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 the day fire of that carbonar copter were leaving behind Heritage Bible Colleges have shown my run a little long.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 Some of them might run a little long, but I'm having a kick out of this one.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
 This next one's actually really sad.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 This next one's actually pretty sad.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000
 Dave, fire of that carbonar copter, we're leaving behind Heritage Bible College.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 We're headed all the way out to Valonia, Arkansas.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
 [imitates car engine]

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 This one, I don't even know.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000
 This one's so disturbing, I almost didn't include it because the other two were kind of funny.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 But I think, like, talk about being trapped somewhere that you didn't even want to be in the first place.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:38.000
 In Valonia, there is the Valonia School Annex Basement.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
 So right there, right?

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
 The basement's bad enough to be drafted, but you're not even cold enough to be drafted in the basement.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 You're trapped to the attachment of the basement.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 This is an interesting haunt scene because it is only visible during school hours.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
 I have a theory about that in a second, I'll get to that, but...

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 This is only visible during school hours.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
 What a weird set of rules for a haunt scene.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 It's almost always the opposite.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:10.000
 If you go to the Valonia School Annex Basement, there's a little basement window that you can kind of look through.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 Or, like, if you look through the crack in the door into this room, during the school day, if you look into this room...

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:24.000
 If you open the door, you won't see it, but if you look through the window, or if you look through, like, a crack in the door,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 you will see, in the dark--I guess I don't use this room anymore--in the dark room,

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 you will see the ghosts of special education students moaning and screaming.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 That's utterly terrifying.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000
 Jason, you just told all these jokes!

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 You just told all these jokes about cheese, and now you're telling us a super depressing one!

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 The moans? It's so interesting because you don't just hear them.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:08.000
 You look into this room and you will see the ghosts of special education students screaming and moaning in pain and fear,

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 as if they were being disciplined by their teacher.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
 Not like, "Oh, you did bad on that test!"

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000
 Like, corporal punishment, like the teacher spanking them with a paddle or hitting them with a ruler.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:28.000
 And you're hearing these children scream out loud in the dark for it to stop.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:35.000
 I guess at this school, they used to shuttle the--I doubt they do this anymore, I'm sure they have a room above ground.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:41.000
 But back in the day, apparently, they shuttle the special needs students underneath the school,

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
 and then into an annex underneath the school, and then beat them.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
 And all that psychic energy is trapped there.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
 That's spooky. Like, I can't think of almost the worst place to be.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000
 Well, then the next story might be worse in another way.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000
 But when we talk about haunting, we talk a lot about psychic energy.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000
 Like, when we talk about hauntings, we go, "What's the recording of a real event that's stuck there?"

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
 So something traumatic happens, and it plays out over and over and over again.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 But the soul itself, the person who left that recording, has entered the afterlife.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
 This was just an event that was so traumatic, it's just a recording.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 And you can't interact with those types of ghosts.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
 Then we have ghosts that the actual soul is still there, or demon disguises as a soul.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000
 Whatever path you want to go down on that as well, because there's multiple possibilities with that.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
 So it could just be a recording.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 This could just be a psychic recording of all of the torment and abuse that these children allegedly go through.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
 I shaft at that. I don't want Valonia's school to sue me.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
 They show up at my door with two lawyers and four teachers with paddles.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 I'm like, "Ah!"

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 Like, if this left such a psychic mark on the room, these children in the darkness crying out as they're being punished for rules they probably don't even really understand.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 Is it that, or are these actually the souls of these kids trapped in that room?

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 It's such a weird phenomenon that it only happens during the day and it only happens during the school day.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 First, I thought, this might be a cover.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
 They might still be doing some shady stuff down there, they're selling drugs.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:25.000
 And they tell kids, "Don't look in here during the day, because you will see an awful sight."

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000
 This is where all the teachers nap, all the teachers nap and smoke cigarettes and everything like that.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
 It's weird, maybe it's a legend to cover up, but not necessarily illicit activity.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
 Please don't send your lawyers and paddles after me.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
 But it's weird.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
 It's super rare to see a haunting that only happens during the day.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 Especially only during the school day.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
 So it could be more urban legend than ghost story, but if this is a true haunting, terrifying.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
 Terrifying story, even if it's just their psychic energy.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 See, if it's their souls trapped there, that's absolutely horrifying.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:04.000
 But even if it's just their psychic energy, that's terrifying because you imagine you had that psychic energy there of these kids who had been beaten over the years.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000
 And then, as new kids are brought down there and other kids matriculate out of that school and go on,

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:16.000
 those kids are now sitting in a room full of that psychic energy, full of that darkness and that fear and that pain.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 And they're picking up on that psychic energy and then the teacher turns around and goes, "Lesson starts now."

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 And she's just trying not to say that they were actually brutal people.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000
 She's swinging a bat, she's swinging a bat as she's walking through the crowd.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:37.000
 But imagine your own physical torment that's happening right now and you can feel the psychic torment of the students before you.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 Dave, we got one last destination. We are leaving behind Valonia School before the lawyers can get all their paperwork finalized.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 We are headed all the way out to California.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000
 [imitates music]

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 Specifically, we're headed to Banning, California.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000
 Banning is a city in Riverside County, California, where I grew up in Riverside.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 It's been a lot of my life down there.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
 Beautiful area. Disney lands around there. We're not going to Disneyland. You guys are super excited.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000
 Disneyland goes. That sounds great. No, because see, that would be a good place to be dead.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
 You'd constantly be walking around and going on rides and stuff like that. Wee!

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
 You'd be like a ghost on Space Mountain and stuff like that. You'd be a ghost in the haunted mansion. What?

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:26.000
 That'd be awesome, man. That's one of my top 10 places to die to Disneyland.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:37.000
 But we're going past Disneyland. We're headed to a pay less shoe source in Banning, California.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:44.000
 So we're walking to this pay less- you're already like this would be the most depressing place to die.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:52.000
 We walk into this pay less shoe source and we're trying on some shoes. You got any size 13s? I'm a size 13.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:58.000
 Get my new shoes. Buy one. Get one half off. This is becoming an advertisement for a pay less shoe source.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
 Buying a couple shoes, but we're not here for the great deals.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 We're here because of the story of a little boy.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 This ghost is trapped in the break room of a pay less shoe source.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 If you guys don't know what a pay less shoe source is, pay less shoe source while their shoes are very inexpensive.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000
 You got some good deals. They do. I bought a lot of shoes there and the shoes hold up really well.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:33.000
 But the stores are ugly. They're ugly places to be in. They're always a mess.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000
 They're always yellow. They're this weird like 1970s yellow. There's nothing fun to do.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000
 People generally don't like buying shoes unless they're like sex in the city or something like that.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 And if you are buying shoes and you want it to be fun, you're not going to a pay less shoe source, right?

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 You're going to like a Gucci store or something like that.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000
 Pay less shoe source is basically the Walmart of shoes.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:04.000
 And so this little boy is trapped inside the break room of a pay less shoe source.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
 But that's not all right. That's not bad enough to end out in this episode.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 The story goes like this. A long time ago, this little boy was brought into pay less shoe source by his mom.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 And he really wanted a pair of shoes there, which I don't understand why she would bring him there if she wasn't going to buy him shoes.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
 Maybe she was just going to buy herself shoes. And he was just along for the ride.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:38.000
 But again, it's not fun to go. Why would you bring someone to a place that they hated if you weren't going, "The shoes are like six blocks.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:44.000
 They're not even expensive shoes. Let's buy one, get one, have off."

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:50.000
 She didn't want to buy him these shoes. She didn't want to buy him a pair of Air Force One knockoffs or whatever.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.000
 He had his little mind wrapped around nukie shoes or DDoS or ReBlock.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 She wouldn't... All the name brands of pay less shoe source. She would not buy one for this little boy.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.000
 So he got so upset, he ran out of the store.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000
 This little boy's last moments play out like this.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 "Mom, mom, please, for the last time, can I buy these shoes?" And in the throes of sorrow, deep heartbreak, because he didn't get a pair of knockoff shoes,

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 he ran into traffic and was promptly hit by a car.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 He didn't get the shoes he wanted. He didn't get the shoes he wanted.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:41.000
 And now his ghost is trapped at a pay less shoe source.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:49.000
 Absolutely terrifying, but that's not all because as I was researching this story, I didn't plan this.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 What a gift this was on my four year anniversary of this show.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000
 As I was researching this, looking into whether or not any of this is true, right?

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000
 Even these simple ghost stories, I try to see if there's other versions of the legends where they come from, stuff like that.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 I found... an old friend.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:14.000
 We haven't talked about this. We have not talked about this website in probably like three, four hundred episodes.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:21.000
 So not everyone is aware of my love affair with the website Backpackerverse.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:34.000
 Backpackerverse is just this insane ghost. It's actually a hiking website that also has an entire section dedicated to horoscopes, astrology, and ghost stories.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.000
 The easiest ghost stories you'll ever hear. I'll put some episodes in the show notes. I love Backpackerverse.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:46.000
 What a treat it was to come back here because Backpackerverse has another spin on this legend.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 This is creepy. We'll wrap it up like this because I don't want you to get too scared before you go to bed.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 Little ghost trapped at a pay less shoe store is that spooky for him.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:03.000
 Check this out though. Apparently, according to Backpackerverse, the boy does not appear as a boy.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000
 Like, he's still boy-sized. This is so weird.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
 And I should say this right now. Backpackerverse has a tendency to make stuff up.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
 They really do have a tendency to make stuff up.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:18.000
 But maybe not in this case. Maybe in this case this is totally true. This is true. It's terrifying.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:28.000
 The little boy in the pay less shoe stores is boy-sized, but he's turning into an old man.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:35.000
 So it's almost as if his body is withering away.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000
 The boy who didn't have a chance to grow up is growing older in the afterlife.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000
 Not just like a little wrinkly old oompa-loompa.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 He looks weathered.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 He's more like a tiny Clint Eastwood.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 And even his clothes look weathered. Like he's been standing out in the elements for 100 years.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 While he's just been in this pay less shoe store for probably about a decade or two.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 In this story, there's a woman named Anna. She worked at a nearby beauty salon.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 She gets off work at the beauty salon and she goes, "You know what? I did a really good job on those people's hair."

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 "Troubletry myself to a pair of shoes and pay less shoe stores. That's how good of a job I did."

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000
 So she walks into pay less shoe stores and they're getting ready to close.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000
 But they know her. "Hey Anna, how you doing?" She's like, "Hey guys."

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:29.000
 She sees the pair of shoes that she wants. She locates the box in her size.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 And she puts the box down on the floor.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 And as she is taking the lid off of the box, this little boy...

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000
 It sounds totally made up now, but I went back and looked at my notes.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:53.000
 I was like, "Okay, anyways, I should probably review my notes before I start recording."

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000
 This sounds fake, but anyways, it's interesting nonetheless.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 She opens the box. She opens up the shoe box and out jumps. Out jumps.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000
 A little boy. A little boy, but he's decayed and rotten.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.000
 He looks like a wrinkly old man who's also just melting away.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:21.000
 Like he has those open sores. She described it as he looked like someone who had been rotting for hundreds of years.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000
 An unpreserved corpse.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:33.000
 And when he jumped out of the box, she said all of his body parts were in the wrong places.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.000
 He was just like a mishmash of arms and legs.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 And her rationale behind this is that when he was hit by the car, he blew up.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000
 He got hit by a speed racer. He blew up.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 And he got completely mangled on the road.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000
 And then his ghost has been spending all this time trying to get the body parts in the right order.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000
 But they can't. And this ghost is slowly rotting away.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 But not rotting away, right? It's still trapped in this decaying form on Earth.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:12.000
 But it's this little boy who's an old man who's all grody and stuff with his arms messed up and his legs messed up.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:19.000
 I find that interesting. Very interesting that the only account I found of that wasn't backpackerverse.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
 The fact that he was all gross and old and all mixed up.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000
 I didn't find that version of the story anywhere else.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000
 So it could be true.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 I would find it very hilarious if ghosts always hopped out of boxes when you're a ghost hunting.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:39.000
 That would have to be... Even if that part's not true, then this is a completely hellish existence for this boy.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:45.000
 Because not only is he a ghost, but he's still aging, but he's not becoming like a dapper young man.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000
 He's just an old wrinkly boy.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000
 And then he's just a mishmash of body parts.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000
 And then he doesn't live in the break room of the palace.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:59.000
 He lives in the shoebox. He lives in the shoebox. That's ten times worse.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:07.000
 But let's put that aside. Even if we get rid of that one, being trapped in a shoe store forever sounds awful.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000
 And it seems like we don't think about the ghosts in these scenarios.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000
 We think about how it impacts us.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000
 Like, "Oh, I don't want to go back in the break room. There might be a spooky old ghost back there."

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000
 "Your boss is the one spreading that rumor? Well, I guess you just got to work through your break then."

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000
 "You don't want to take a break. It's so spooky."

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
 "You're like, "Yeah, I guess."

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000
 "I guess you'll get 15 minutes of free work out of me."

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 We don't think about the ghosts. We don't think about the ghosts.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 We're so selfish when we think about us being scared by the ghosts.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000
 But maybe it's something we do need to keep in mind.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000
 Maybe it's something we do need to keep in mind.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.000
 If you ever think about killing someone, think, "Would this be an appropriate place for this person to hunt?"

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000
 Maybe the next time you're getting ready to kill somebody, take them to Disneyland.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
 You pull the guy out of his car. It's a car jacking in right before you shoot him.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 Say, "You know what, sir? Your wife, your kids, they can get out of the car, but me and you, we're going on a road trip."

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000
 And the guy's terrified. He's driving the whole time. "Can I see my family again?"

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000
 "I don't know. Are they also going to die at Disneyland?"

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 They're like, "What was that part?" You're like, "Oh, nothing."

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000
 And you have him drive you across country. It'd be like a funny road trip movie.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000
 It's like Thelma and Louise, but only one person dies at the end of the movie.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 And you drive all the way out. Every so often he can call his wife and say a couple words before you grab the phone away and go,

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000
 "That's enough for today." And then hang up. And then you take him to Disneyland.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000
 He's trying to signal to the workers at Disneyland with Morse code.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000
 He's blinking at him and they're like, "Sir, do you need some Benetrile? Do you have allergies?"

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.000
 "Nah, he's fine." You're pointing a gun. You're like, "This is a fake gun. This is a prop gun."

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000
 I got from the David Crockett store. They're like, "That's weird. That kind of looks like a 9mm Glock."

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:46.000
 And you're taking him all over Disneyland. You're like, "Where, sir, do you want to hunt forever?

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000
 Do you want to hunt Star Tours? Do you want to hunt the People Mover?"

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000
 He's like, "No, not the People Mover. Please, not the People Mover."

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.000
 And you find that one special place. You take him to the Tiki Room and he just is chilling.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000
 He's finally relaxed. He's finally decided to make peace.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.000
 He wants to be in a room full of animatronic birds forever. And so you shoot him.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:15.000
 And then his ghost is kind of floating around. He goes, "You know, it's kind of peaceful in here."

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.000
 The gunshot was quite painful. And really surprised no one called security. I'm surprised that guy got away.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.000
 But now that I'm a ghost floating around in the Tiki Room, things don't seem too bad.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:32.000
 Sure, his wife and his kids will never see him again. His ghost is forever trapped in this world of animatronics.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:39.000
 But it could be worse. It could always be worse.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:47.000
