 British Swim School. Make a splash.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:41.000
 Ladies and gentlemen, fellow citizens, for too long we have let the red menace invade our homes.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 They have enslaved our men, mated with our women to create monstrous hybrids.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 They have kidnapped our children, they have mutilated our livestock, but no more.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 While our leaders may have sold us out to this hostile invading force we will no longer stand for.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 We know now that it is up to us to save the future.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 These creatures try to overtake us with weapons of war, with plagues, but no more.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 Tonight we take the fight to them.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 And what a fight it would be.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 There will not be a moment of rest. There will be no mercy.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 We will fight them on the red dusty plains.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 We will fight them in the canals.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 We will fight them on the tip of Olympus Mons and reduce it to rubble.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 Fate has chosen us to be the generation to take the war to them.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 We will show them that we are the kings of this solar system.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 We are the lords of this galaxy. We alone are the masters of the universe.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 Tonight everything changes. Tonight we unite with one pride.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 Earth first. Now and forever.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 Earth first.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 Earth first.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 Earth first.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 Prepare my starship. We're headed to Mars.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 Earth first. Earth first.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 Earth first.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 I did not just spend two hours recording two and a half minutes of audio.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 No, I did not just walk around my apartment yelling out "Earth first!"

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 Over and over and over again to try to sit. That was an actual crowd that showed up.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 Can you believe it? And they're here because we have an action-filled episode.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 But first off, let's give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 We have Adam Dunn. Everyone give Adam Dunn a round of applause.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 Earth first. Earth first as he's walking out.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 I totally blew my throat out yelling that.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 But it was worth it. But Adam is ready to go. He already has a space suit on.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 I hope you brought one. I hope you dropped half a million dollars for your own space suit.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 Because we are getting ready to head up to the red planet known as Mars.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 Adam is sitting at the controls of the Dead Rabbit rocket we're all strapped in and...

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 [Exhales]

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 We're headed off to that crimson ball in the sky.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 So we're taking the rocket up to the red planet.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 I'm gonna see how many different ways I can say Mars.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 Because I'm gonna be saying it a lot. The crimson globe.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 That's it. That was nearly two. I think I already said those ones anyways.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
 The burgundy ball. Adam lands us in the middle of Mars.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 It's just vast wasteland as far as I can see.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Now there's been a lot of rumors about Mars.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
 There's obviously like scientific stuff we know like...

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
 That it exists? That it's there? That it's real?

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 There's water on the caps and stuff like that.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 There's long been stories about aliens on Mars.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 Recently a man known as Captain K appeared on the reputable mainstream news website.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 ExoNewsTV.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 Whose tagline is for news... [Laughs]

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 For news that's out of this world!

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 That's when you know you're on a legit news website when you actually have a tagline like that.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 ExoNewsTV was recently interviewing this Captain, Captain K, who served on Mars.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 I bet you didn't know that right? But you didn't know that we actually have military men on Mars right now.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 He did 20 years on Mars.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 His job was to protect the Martian colony there from two indigenous alien races.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 So we're ready to fight. We got all of our guns loaded up to plasma rifles.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 We're headed in with first wave. Just means more Martians for us to kill.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
 We're walking through the desert.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 Now supposedly there is in an insectoid, an indigenous insectoid race on the planet.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 [Sounds of insectoid]

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 You're looking around, you're waiting to see an insect.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 It's just me eating a wetchamacallit, throwing the wrapper on the ground.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 You're like, "Hey dude, you're on the alien planet. Maybe you shouldn't litter.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 Maybe we shouldn't repeat the problems we had before."

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 But wetchamacallits are so good. It's worth littering.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 You're like, "How did you even eat a wetchamacallit?"

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 You're wearing a space helmet.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 Where there's a will, there's a way.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 I'm sticking it into the oxygen vent and just breathing it in.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 He also says that there's an indigenous race of reptilians.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 [Sounds of reptilians]

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 I don't know what I could eat that would make that noise.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 He did 20 years on Mars protecting the Martian colony corporation from these races.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 Now he said as long as you didn't go into their territory, they didn't really attack you.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
 So there was kind of a peace going on for a long time.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
 But for whatever reason, probably just human greed and/or curiosity, or both,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
 they decided to steal and the Mars colony corporation thought,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
 "Hmm, we know there's this ancient alien artifact out in the middle of nowhere.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
 Any place on Mars, let's go get it."

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 So Captain K and over a thousand other soldiers, they got their weapons ready.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 They set off to find this alien relic.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 Hopefully it was an insectoid relic.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 I don't think insectoids get enough love.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 I think insectoid aliens are really cool.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 I wish they would show up in more stories.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000
 But we're approaching this cave where the human insectoid,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 we're gonna say it's an insectoid, he didn't specify what alien race in the article said,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
 the human insectoid battle for the relic took place.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
 Raiders of the Lost Blark?

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 I don't know, doesn't work.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
 Maybe aliens use the word "blark."

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
 We walk into this cave.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
 [whoosh]

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
 Crunch, crunch, crunch.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 That's me walking and eating a bunch of a collet at the same time.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 [mimics sound]

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 And we see a US-issued blaster rifle, an F-97400,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 collecting dust on the ground.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000
 It's kind of unsettling, you think that the humans should have picked up after themselves

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 and not be killed in the first place.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 And as we're continuing our way into this cave,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 we see yet another blaster rifle, a laser pistol, a tectonic grenade.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.000
 We're walking over the debris of a sci-fi battle and we see a valley inside the cave.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000
 It is littered with the corpses of 1,000 of our fellow earthlings.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 Now there's a lot of insectoid corpses as well,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
 but we see often the distance a glimmering relic.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
 It's a little statue, it's a little statue of an insectoid.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 It was not taken by the Mars Colony Corporation.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 According to Captain K, over a thousand men and women died in this battle.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 One of the men died in the battle, and the other two died in the battle.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 The other two died in the battle, and the other two died in the battle.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
 The other two died in the battle, and the other two died in the battle.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 The other two died in the battle, and the other two died in the battle.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 The other two died in the battle, and the other two died in the battle.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 Captain K, over a thousand men and women died in the battle.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 Captain K, over a thousand men and women died in the battle.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
 Captain K, over a thousand men and women died in the battle.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 Captain K, over a thousand men and women died in the battle.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
 Captain K, over a thousand men and women died in the battle.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
 And then military procedure is, if someone drops your medal, you have to pick it up.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 And so as he's leaning down to pick up the medal,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 BOOM!

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
 Blaster shot to the base of the skull.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 It's pretty grim, right? They could have just put a pillow over his head.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 But I would find it hard to believe that they would just be like,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000
 "Oh, you served all this time, and you fought these aliens, and you know all the secret stuff, so here you go.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 Here's your retirement, and also here's a Wi-Fi connection for you. It's ultra fast."

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
 So you can communicate with Exo News TV.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 But that is Captain K's story.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
 We are walking out of this cave. We say goodbye to our fallen earthmen.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
 We're walking back to the Mars Colony.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
 Now, the Mars Colony, this is what I find very fascinating about all of this stuff,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 is you have all of these conflicting stories about what's going on.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
 According to Captain K, it's just a colon.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 I mean, there's just so much people up there, and they're sitting around, and they're trying to figure out

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
 how they can steal, how they can irritate the indigenous alien races.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 But the more common alien conspiracy theory, one that's gaining a lot of traction now,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 is the Slave Colony on Mars.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 Adam Dunn called in that Jason Jalopy.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
 It's been modified for Martian use. It just has a bubble.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 It just has a bubble over the roof now. Everything else is the same.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 It still works like an old Jalopy.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
 Adam's driving us across the desert of Mars,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 and we see a glimmering little domed city off in the distance.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 You can't see what's else, go! So don't try looking!

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 But we can see it where we're at.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000
 Car is driving across the orange oval known as Mars.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 We stop outside of the domed city.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 [Metal shatters]

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
 Door opens up, just an empty hallway in front of us.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
 Keep your guns ready.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 They might have succeeded in stealing something.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 The insectoids may have raided this base.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
 We're walking through this colony.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 Lights flickering.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
 [Metal shatters]

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 There's a creepy rocking chair in the corner,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000
 rocking by itself.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
 Ring around the rosy park.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
 What'd you hear that? What's going on?

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
 Walking through this abandoned base.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
 But it's not really abandoned. I don't know why you say it is abandoned.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 It's not abandoned.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 I'm trying to build a mood that it's creepy.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
 Here's the conspiracy theory.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 There's two twins standing in the corner.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
 Here's the conspiracy theory.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 This is a very common one, but I think I have a new spin on it.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 Back in 2017, there was a man known as Robert Steele.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
 He says that he's a former CIA operative.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 He was actually on the Alex Jones show.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 Now, there's no video of this anymore.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 It might be on one of like Bitshoot or something like that,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 but it's completely gone.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
 But we have a lot of quotes because this was very well covered in the mainstream media.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
 Robert Steele goes on the Alex Jones show and he says that -

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
 let me read you this quote here -

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.000
 "We actually believe there is a colony on Mars that is populated by children

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 who were kidnapped and sentenced to space on a 20-year ride."

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
 Save your questions. Save your questions for the end,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 because I know obviously you're like, "Wait, what?"

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 "We actually believe there is a colony on Mars that is populated by children

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
 who were kidnapped and sentenced to space on a 20-year ride."

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 So that once they get to Mars, they have no alternative but to be slaves to the Mars colony.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
 He then goes on to weave this story that -

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 and this is why it's popping back up in conspiracy theory -

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 that these kids are being taken to Mars to be harvested for their adrenochrome.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
 And then just to kind of be like, have their organs sold as well.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 Again, save your questions till the end.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 So, and Alex Jones says, "Yeah, he doesn't actually say I've heard that story's true,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
 but he has said I've heard that 90% of all NASA missions are secret,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
 that we don't know what payloads are going up and things like that."

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
 Anyways, this is the story.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 So the reason why it's back into conspiracy theory,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
 because it's tied into the whole adrenochrome thing.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 There's a couple big issues with this one.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 First off, why would you send a child to Mars to harvest his organs?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
 Because here's the thing.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
 Then you gotta send him back.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 Unless there's a huge need for human organs on Mars, which there may be.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
 I don't know, I've never been there.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 Maybe you go there, immediately you land, your liver explodes.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 You're like, "Oh, does anyone have a spare liver?"

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 And they're like, "Come this way, sir."

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 There's a creepy rocking chair in the corner you gotta sit in.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000
 Yeah.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
 You want to make sense to take someone on a 20-year journey just to harvest their organs

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 and then be like, "Oh, great, we got to send these back.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
 Hope you don't die for 20 years.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 It's going to take a long time to get these lungs back to you."

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
 The adrenochrome thing we've discussed many times before.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
 But again, that wouldn't make any more sense either.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
 It's like growing grapes in France versus growing grapes in Michigan.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
 The grapes grow better in France.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
 Adrenochrome grows better in Mars?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 I don't know, but it wouldn't make any sense.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
 And then there's another big problem with this.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
 Let's do a math question here.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
 It's a basic math question.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 If you kidnap a kid on Earth and then you fly him for 20 years and drop him off on a planet,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 is he really a kid?

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
 Is he still a child at that point?

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:23.000
 You kidnap the 12-year-old kid and then he's a 32-year-old man on the planet Mars

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
 and you're like, "Yes, I've waited all this time to torture a kid."

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
 And this big strapping dude comes running off the ship, starts beating you up.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
 It doesn't make sense.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
 Also, even by today's basic technology standards, it doesn't take 20 years to get to Mars.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
 It's like a six-month journey.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
 What are they doing? Taking the scenic route?

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 They're like, "Duh-duh-duh-duh."

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
 Kids are like, "Are we there yet? Are we there yet?"

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
 He's like, "I'm going to pull over and harvest your adrenochrome right now if you don't shut up."

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 Kids are like, "Are we there yet?"

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 They're just getting stronger. They're doing push-ups for 20 years.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
 It doesn't make sense.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
 One sentence doesn't make sense, but none of it does.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
 None of it does, but especially...

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
 Anyway, so that's kind of what we're dealing with here.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 Now, the reason why this became mainstream news was that this was done on the Alex Jones show

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
 and there's a lot of crazy stuff said on a lot of conspiracy shows.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
 What triggered this was NASA actually responded to this.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 NASA said, "No."

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
 That was the response. No.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
 There's not a colony on Mars

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
 and there's definitely no kids on Mars.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 And none of it's true.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 At some point they just thought, they're like, "We could go point by point disputing this,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 but I think we beat it on the first point. There's no colony on Mars."

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
 So you had all of these mainstream websites cover it.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
 Mainstream newspapers, space.com, all of this stuff covered it.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
 And the reason why, and it's funny because on the conspiracy theory level,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
 you think, "Oh, they're all covering it because they're all part of the cover-up."

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
 See? That's why they're making a huge push against it.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
 The reason why they're all covering it, because it generates links.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
 For 99% of the conspiracy's out there, human greed is the motivating factor.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
 And this isn't a conspiracy theory.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
 I mean, you could say, "Oh, they're all pushing against it at the same time."

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
 It's because people were clicking on the links, because it's such a bizarre headline

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
 for the register to have shock.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
 NASA denies secret child sex slave cannibal colony on Mars.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
 I guess I left out the sex slave in the cannibal part, but people are going to click on that.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
 People are going to click on that.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
 So you're going to have these claims put out there.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
 Now, I have another conspiracy for this whole thing.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
 I don't actually believe that there's a colony on Mars where this stuff is taking place,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
 but I have another conspiracy theory that you may actually say is a bit darker,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
 because it's far more realistic.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 The idea of a slave colony on Mars is actually fairly old.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 I found an example that we're going to cover in a minute from the year 2015.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
 But it was 2017 when it became mainstream news.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 Yeah, the Alex Jones guest, and then everyone started talking about the slave colony on Mars.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 What's really fascinating about this is when I decided to look into this topic,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 I typed in "Mars slave," and I was going to type in "colony," and it auto-populated to "labor."

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 Mars slave labor.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
 I was like, "Oh, that's weird." Click on it.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 Now, it did bring up a bunch of articles about what we're talking about,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 but it also brought up another set of articles.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 There's accusations made that the leading chocolate bar companies are, for lack of a better term,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
 supporting slave labor.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 They're not funneling money.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 They're not sitting there with a giant cigar being like, "Oh, yes, more slaves, please."

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:47.000
 But because of their industry, is cocoa, and 70% of the world's cocoa comes from West Africa,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 which has a horrible track record when it comes to slavery.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 There are people who believe that the chocolate companies are actually enabling,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
 would probably be a better term for it than supporting, but enabling the slave trade.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
 The chocolate companies say, "Listen, we do our best.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 We try to buy as much as we can from farms.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 South America provides a lot of cocoa, and it doesn't have a slave labor problem."

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 They go, "We do our best to buy from reputable dealers."

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000
 However, so much of it is needed, and there's such a high demand for it,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
 that we can't guarantee on any level that none of it comes from slaves.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 It's real chilling, right?

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
 So these chocolate companies are being dogged with these accusations,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
 and again, they will say, "We're trying to do our best,"

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
 and people are trying to end it, say,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 "Chocolate companies need to put on their labels this was made by slave labor."

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 They need to have a system in place so that people know

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
 that when you go to buy that bag of M&Ms, or that whatchamacallit bar, or that Hershey's, whatever it is,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
 that there will be a warning on it saying, "By buying this, you are supporting slave labor."

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
 I don't know if it's that blunt, but it would be something to that extent.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 The chocolate companies have said, "We provide all that information on our website,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
 and if you want to find out, you can go, we do keep track,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
 and all of our progress that we're doing to work towards this, we keep it on our website."

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 Just in June of this year, the chocolate companies won a lawsuit in Massachusetts,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 saying that because we put it on our website, we don't have to put it on our packaging.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 This is an ongoing issue, but what I thought was really interesting

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 was in May 2017, Mars, the chocolate company,

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:43.000
 released a detailed statement about how they are trying to eliminate the slave labor in their supply chain.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 And two months later, Mars and slave is no longer closely tied to a real-life tragedy.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 It's tied to a wacky conspiracy theory.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 That's actually not a bad idea if you think about it.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:05.000
 If you have a company that is under investigation or has some rumors about it,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 or truth, or truth, right, to find a way to hide your story within conspiracy theories,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 because you can try to mess with the algorithm and the SEO and stuff like that,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:23.000
 but if you can actually create a viral story that you know will live on for years,

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 because conspiracies very rarely die unless there's a date assigned to them.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 They just keep going and going and going.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000
 If you can find a way to attach your real-life controversy into a conspiracy theory

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 and it goes viral, anyone looking for the real-life issue will only find the conspiracy theory.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 I'm not saying that Mars company did this, but it would be a smart idea if they did.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 And think about it, you could have companies have conspiracy theorists on payrolls

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 to the point that the conspiracy theorists may not even know they're working for this massive conglomerate,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
 and they get delivered a document about Mars slave colonies.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 And they're reading it and they're like, "Oh, this is great.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 I can't wait to spread this lunacy across the planet."

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 And then there's a boardroom off in the distance.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
 Just a boardroom. There's no building.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
 It's just a table in the middle of nowhere and a bunch of fat cat CEOs.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
 Everyone at the table is a CEO. It's a weird company.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 And they're like, "Yes, that plan worked."

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
 Good thing I listened to Dead Rabbit Radio to hear that plan.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
 Adam Dunn calling that carbonicopter.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 We're leaving behind this table in the middle of nowhere.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 We're headed back to Mars.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 We left to do the Mars story, to do the story about the Mars Mars.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
 We're leaving behind Earth.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 Once again, we're taking that carbonicopter.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 It's been specially outfitted for outer space travel.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 We're headed back to Mars.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 [imitates a movie]

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 And it's a long journey, so I have a movie for us to watch.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
 That movie is called Spell.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
 This Halloween, prepare yourself for the terrifying suspense thriller Spell,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 starring Omari Hardwick from the TV show Power and Loretta Divine.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
 Marquis, played by Omari Hardwick,

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000
 awakens from a plane crash imprisoned by a mysterious woman practicing hoodoo magic.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 He desperately tries to break free to save his family from the sinister rituals that await.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:22.000
 Spell is premiering at home on all digital platforms October 30th, rated R, from Paramount Pictures.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 [imitates a movie]

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 Carbonicopter is clearing the void between the bright blue ball known as Earth

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 and the dusty magenta circle known as Mars.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
 [imitates a movie]

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 We're landing back at another Martian slave colony.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 It may be the same place. I don't know. I don't know how many there are,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 but this is a different person because as we land here,

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
 this one doesn't have a spooky rocking chair.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 This one doesn't have two little twins in the corner singing lullabies.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 No, this one has...

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 [imitates a movie]

00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 ...door's open up, and majestically standing in front of us is Corey Goode.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 Now, long time Dead Rav radio listeners will recognize that name.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:13.000
 He was in episode 47, and Corey Goode told the story about how the fighting men and women of the US

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 military would go to Antarctica and beat up reptiles and rescue kids.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 I can't... why are you kidnapping kids and taking them to Antarctica?

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 I guess really the question is why are you kidnapping kids?

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 It's not gonna be like, "Oh, you're only taking them across the street? That's fine."

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
 The whole thing's bizarre, but it's even more weird that you would transport them for six months

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 across the ocean, or however long it is, two months.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
 It doesn't matter how many months. I don't know why we're getting stuck on the details.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 Why are you kidnapping kids? Why are you taking them to Antarctica?

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 It's the same. They were eating them. The reptilians were eating them over there.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
 He talked about that. We covered him in episode 47. He's back.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
 Because little did you know, he's like, "Wait, I have another story to make up."

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 Everyone's like, "What? Oh, we are bored of the Antarctica story."

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 He's like, "I know, I know. I wasn't getting a bunch of hits on my website."

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 So luckily, I just remembered, his eyes are shifting side to side,

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000
 I just remembered I also go to Mars, and everyone's like, "Oh, we want to pay attention to you again."

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
 My plan worked, because he's getting a free lifetime supply of Mars chocolate.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
 He's like, "Oh, both my plans worked."

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000
 He went to Mars, guys. So that's why we're on this base. We're meeting him there.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000
 And there we're going to meet Corey Good, Lieutenant Colonel Gonzales.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
 Not his full name. Never gives his full name. Also, just the Lieutenant Colonel.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000
 It's a little unimpressive. I mean, maybe, I don't know, I would expect to see a general or something.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
 Like, I don't know, I'm not in the military. Maybe Lieutenant Colonel's super high up in the ranks.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:43.000
 But like, if someone goes, "Hi, Jason, I'm Lieutenant Colonel," start rolling my eyes in the middle of the sentence.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000
 No, I'm sure it's pretty high up there. Is it higher than a Colonel? Doesn't matter.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000
 I guess you're on Mars. You could be a private on Mars. That would be impressive if it was real.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
 But Corey Good, he did 20 years. There's always 20 years with these guys.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000
 He did 20 years in the Secret Space Program Alliance.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000
 One day, Corey Good, I don't know why I'm jumping to the end of the story.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:10.000
 One day, Corey Good is sitting at home and this blue ball floats into his house.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
 Just another afternoon for Corey Good, right? He's checking his website.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000
 I'm not getting any hits. I probably should come up with another story.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 All of a sudden, blue ball, he's like, "This is it! This will be the new thing I'm going to sell."

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.000
 I mean, tell. He jumps into the blue ball and the blue ball takes him to Lunar Operations Command.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000
 That's a base on the moon. That's where he meets Lieutenant Colonel Gonzales.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000
 And Corey Good's like, "Could I meet like a general or something?"

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.000
 And Lieutenant Colonel Gonzales is like, "No, I'm the highest ranking person in this story."

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
 They then each team up with two intuitive empaths.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
 So there's these two dudes and then apparently two others.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000
 So there's a total of six people. They're taking out. There'll be a math quiz.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000
 And then they hang out with these intuitive empaths and they just are able to tell when people are angry.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000
 Here, I'll give you a tip. It's when the alien's pointing a rifle at you.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000
 You're like, "Oh, you probably could have told me that earlier, intuitive empath."

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
 But so they leave behind the moon and they go to Mars.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
 And it takes them a 30 minutes. The article is very clear to state.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
 They usually takes two or three minutes to get from the moon to Mars.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
 But this time it took them 30 minutes because Mars was on the other side of the sun this time.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.000
 Who cares? The story is made up to begin with.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
 I don't understand what... This is ExoNews as well.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
 I don't understand... There's a whole paragraph explaining that.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.000
 They're like, "Normally this journey only takes..." Who cares? It's made up.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
 It's made of... Don't tell me real life stuff because you're making up...

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000
 Anyway, so apparently, just if you ever need to travel to Mars from the moon

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
 and you're trying to figure out when you should eat lunch,

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
 if it's on the other side of the sun, it's going to take 30 minutes.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
 There you go. Now you know that. Like I said, it's going to be a math episode.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000
 They go to Mars. They get to the base and they meet the base commander and he goes,

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
 "Hey guys, listen, welcome from secret space, whatever name you made up.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000
 Welcome. Welcome to this Mars colony."

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
 Now, I know there's been a lot of accusations of us having slaves here.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
 That's not true. It's misspelled actually. We have a bunch of slides here.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000
 And they see all these kids going down in slides.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
 Cory gets like, "Oh, that's kind of cool." He's like, "Yeah, yeah, it's a translation error."

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
 We don't have slaves here. We do have a bunch of people here though.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:31.000
 We have a ton of humans here, but don't tell them you're from Earth.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 Cory goes like, "What? I'm human, right? Where I was supposed to tell them I'm coming from?"

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:43.000
 Base commander goes, "As far as everyone on this base knows, Earth was destroyed in a massive calamity."

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:49.000
 So, don't tell them that's not true. They've been here for decades.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000
 They're having families and their families are going to have families and so on and so forth.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000
 This is a multi-generational base, but you can't tell them you're from Earth.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
 So Cory, good listen man. This guy's done 20 years in the Solar Warden program.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:09.000
 There's over 900 alien species this man has knowledge of. He's met some of these aliens faced.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
 "Man, what are you talking about dude?" This guy's not going to say nothing.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 So, Cory, good, Lieutenant Gonzalez and their little group are walking around this base.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:25.000
 They run into a group of people and within about three minutes, Cory, good, tells the dude he's from Texas.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
 And a riot breaks out. Eventually, a subway shows up.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000
 Troops quell this riot and was like, "What? Texas is real? I thought that was destroyed. Oh man.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
 I threw away all of my Texas stuff. I'm a big Texas fan apparently.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000
 I'm the only one on Mars because no one else believes me."

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:49.000
 Riot breaks up because Cory, good, who has not one but two certificates you can view online

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 showing that he has certified classes in mass casualty events and the psychology of terrorism.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.000
 You just can't earn those by attending some sort of seminar or taking a class. No.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:07.000
 Well, probably, but he has those. How could he have accidentally told this guy he was from Texas?

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
 Come on, Cory. So what do you think is going to happen now?

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
 He has broken the one rule he was given. He's taken to base commander.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
 Base commander's like, "Over here. Let's go to a PowerPoint presentation."

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:25.000
 So nothing happens. Cory, good, and his group go to a PowerPoint presentation where they're showing

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.000
 about the 900 different intergalactic civilizations that humanity is currently interacting with

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.000
 and how they are using alien tech to merge with human technology.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
 Cory, good, sitting back. He's super bored. He pulls out a laser pointer.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000
 He's like putting it on the screen. They're like, "Cory, that's a real laser."

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
 It's all, "Bzzz." No, it's a hole through the wall. Everyone can't breathe.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:52.000
 Anyways, this article that I'm getting off exonews.com, it's about a power graph telling us about this PowerPoint presentation.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
 It's not as interesting as a PowerPoint presentation.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000
 The PowerPoint presentation doesn't become any more interesting if it's on Mars or not.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
 It's still a slideshow.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000
 But then after the PowerPoint presentation, the base commander tells Cory and Lieutenant Colonel Gonzales,

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
 "Guess what, guys? Look under your seat. Look under your seat."

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000
 They're like, "What? What's under my seat?" There's a little piece of paper.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000
 There's a number on it. They're like, "You guys just won your own family."

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000
 What? What is going on?

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000
 Anyways, so they're told, actually, there's not an Oprah Prize. You get a family and you get a family.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000
 But they are told by the base commander, "You guys have now been assigned a family to take with you."

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:37.000
 So anyways, they go and they find like this pod that has the same number as the piece of paper.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000
 Again, it's a made-up detail. I don't know why I'm repeating such a made-up detail.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:48.000
 But anyways, they go to the pod and inside the pod is a man and his wife.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:54.000
 They're two kids, boy and a girl, the teenagers, and the family has all their bags packed.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
 And Lieutenant Colonel Gonzales is looking at these people and then he goes,

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000
 "Where's the other member of your family?" Apparently he's British now.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000
 And they go, "We don't know what you're talking about. It's only the four of us."

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.000
 And Lieutenant Colonel Gonzales says, "That's not what my empath tells me.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000
 He says that you are hiding a member of your family from us.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
 We want all of you."

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
 Now I know you're thinking the same thing I'm thinking when I was reading the story.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.000
 I thought, "Wait, I thought Lieutenant Colonel Gonzales was a good guy."

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
 Now he's like, "Oh yeah, I know there's five of you where all you..."

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
 He's all sneaking around getting all creepy.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
 I was like, "Dude, what? What are you doing?"

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
 And the family starts freaking out because apparently now telepathy exists in this world.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
 Also, again, that total stranger is asking for your hidden child.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
 That they start freaking out.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
 Base Commander shows up and he's like, "What? Why are you harassing our slaves?

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
 I mean, our totally normal people who are petrified of all authority."

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:01.000
 And so he throws Lieutenant Colonel Gonzales and Corey Good and all the empaths in a jail cell.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000
 Despite the fact that we have alien technology and the ability to exist on Mars,

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000
 you still have rooms with bars on them, right?

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
 Why don't you just shoot them, really?

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 Because apparently they're already talking about Texas.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000
 You're already talking about Texas. You're revealing all these secrets.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000
 They throw them in a jail cell.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:23.000
 There's like a key. There's like a Don Knotts guy with a big ring, a key's on his key chain, and a sleeping dog.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000
 They go sleep in Bulldog in the corner with a space helmet on.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000
 Corey Good says as he's being led into the jail as well,

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000
 he sees all these other cells and everyone looked really sad in them.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000
 That's the same on Earth. Or Mars, I think that doesn't matter.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000
 But so apparently there are bars on these cells, or maybe little windows,

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000
 but still, like why isn't a space cell? Why aren't they being thrown into the Phantom Zone or something like that?

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000
 So they're all trapped in this jail cell. They're on Mars.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000
 Lieutenant Colonel Gonzales is like, "Oh, you know, we're in a lot of trouble now."

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
 One, because my accent changed.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
 And two, because the base commander is like a total totalitarian.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
 He's nuts.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000
 To be fair, if I was Corey Good, I would say this, to be fair,

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
 you shouldn't have been so insistent on finding the fifth hidden member of the family.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
 Ah, I just wanted to complete my collection.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000
 I didn't want to know there was one other one out there.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000
 What? What are you talking about, Lieutenant Colonel?

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:23.000
 Interrupting Corey Good's sentence, a blue orb flies into the jail cell.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000
 Let me read you this actual quote.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.000
 "It wasn't a minute later that we saw our blue indigo orb friends."

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
 That's the best sentence ever.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:41.000
 "Our blue indigo orb friends zipping through the walls of the cell, one for each of us.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:47.000
 They danced around for a couple seconds, and the other SSP personnel who had never traveled this way,

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000
 backed against the wall."

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000
 How big is this cell? It's as big as your imagination, because it's totally made up.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000
 You have six people in a cell.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
 Now you have six human-sized orbs in the cell, and they're dancing.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
 They're doing a little break dance.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000
 They break out some holographic cardboard. They're all spinning around.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
 They're like, "That's why they're backing up against the wall."

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
 It's not because they're like, "What's this amazing technology?"

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
 It's because they're doing B-Boy moves and stuff.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:18.000
 Go Orbeez, go Orbeez, go, go, go Orbeez. They're having this dance party.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
 Everyone else in the cells are just looking out.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000
 These B-Boy blue orbs are dancing. Everyone's clapping.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000
 Everyone in the cells clapping. All the other people are like, "I just want bread."

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:34.000
 So Corey Goode and Team hop in their own individual blue orbs, and they fly to the moon.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:40.000
 Just like Frank Sinatra predicted what happened in his great song, "Slave Colony on Mars."

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:46.000
 And then the article ends with saying, "Listen, guys, we know that there's a problem with slavery on Mars."

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000
 And the space company, whatever this group is called, the SSP, the Secret Space Program,

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
 will stop and nothing to defeat these slavers.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.000
 Now, this article was written in the year 2015, and nothing's been done.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
 You had that article in 2017 about slaves on Mars.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000
 So, yeah, sure, you may have a fleet of spaceships and all this stuff,

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
 but if you can't rescue these dudes on Mars, you already know it's a problem.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000
 You now know that they were slaves, not slides.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.000
 You now know that they're giving out families to people who show up to a PowerPoint presentation.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000
 So what are you guys waiting for? Huh?

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000
 Shouldn't we already be freeing those people slaves on Mars?

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000
 The official explanation, the official imaginary explanation.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:35.000
 The imaginary base commander gave it to the imaginary lunar operations command that we do not have slaves.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000
 This is just a social experiment, bro. It's just a prank. It's just a prank.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000
 We want to see what happens to people when you tell them their planet has been destroyed,

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
 and we take them to another planet.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000
 And Corey Good showed up.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000
 He almost brought the whole colony come crashing down.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000
 When he told the duty was from Texas.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000
 So, shame on you, secret space program.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 We are just trying to figure out what happens when you mentally torture people.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000
 We're not slavers. We're mentally enslavers.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000
 Adding that word in front of it makes it less horrible.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000
 My question is why, if this place exists, why aren't they doing anything about it?

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:17.000
 Why aren't their imaginary starfighters leaving right now to launch,

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
 make-believe missiles to destroy buildings that exist nothing but in the realms of dreams?

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000
 I don't know, but I do know this.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000
 If you want to fight, you can buy a t-shirt.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:33.000
 This isn't an ad-read for one of my t-shirts. No, no, no, no. I'm not that tacky. I'll do that in another episode.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000
 When I was looking for more information about Corey Good and the reptilian resistance,

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.000
 I found a shirt on Amazon that you can buy today that will signal to the world

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
 you are on the right side against the Martian slave colonies.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
 This shirt is a picture of a gray alien head. Yeah, I know.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
 It should be a reptilian head, but that's the least of the problems with this shirt.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:05.000
 It has a gray reptilian head, and across it it says, "Fight for glory. Pride and honor.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000
 Keep struggle for freedom fight."

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000
 I don't know if that's probably speaking alien-speak. That's because in case an alien sees it, they're like,

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:21.000
 "Oh, yes. Keep struggle for freedom fight. Totally understand. Yes, you're on the good guy's side."

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:29.000
 And then underneath it, it says, "The three greatest words any human can say protect the Earth."

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000
 I don't mean that in some environmentalist way. No.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:42.000
 I mean that in laser guns, spaceships, and two knives with brass-knuckle hilts.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000
 Now, out of those three, that'd be the least effective weapon against aliens.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000
 But those are the weapons that are chosen to be poorly photoshopped onto this shirt.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:58.000
 So if you ever want to take on an army of reptilian gray aliens, if you want to keep struggle for freedom fight,

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:06.000
 but all you're bringing into the fight is two brass-knuckles with knives attached to them, buy this shirt, protect the Earth.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:13.000
 And remember, Earth first, now, and forever.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000
