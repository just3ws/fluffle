 British Swim School. Make a splash.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Ladies and gentlemen, fellow citizens, for too long we have let the red menace invade our homes.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 They have enslaved our men, mated with our women to create monstrous hybrids.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 They have kidnapped our children, they have mutilated our livestock, but no more.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 While our leaders may have sold us out to this hostile invading force we will no longer stand for.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 We know now that it is up to us to save the future.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 These creatures try to overtake us with weapons of war, with plagues, but no more.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Tonight we take the fight to them.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 And what a fight it would be.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 There will not be a moment of rest. There will be no mercy.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 We will fight them on the red dusty plains.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 We will fight them in the canals.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 We will fight them on the tip of Olympus Mons and reduce it to rubble.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Fate has chosen us to be the generation to take the war to them.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 We will show them that we are the kings of this solar system.

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 We are the lords of this galaxy. We alone are the masters of the universe.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Tonight everything changes. Tonight we unite with one pride.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Earth first. Now and forever.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Earth first.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Earth first.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Earth first.

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Prepare my starship. We're headed to Mars.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Earth first. Earth first.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Earth first.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 I did not just spend two hours recording two and a half minutes of audio.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 No, I did not just walk around my apartment yelling out "Earth first!"

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Over and over and over again to try to sit. That was an actual crowd that showed up.

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Can you believe it? And they're here because we have an action-filled episode.

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 But first off, let's give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 We have Adam Dunn. Everyone give Adam Dunn a round of applause.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Earth first. Earth first as he's walking out.

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 I totally blew my throat out yelling that.

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 But it was worth it. But Adam is ready to go. He already has a space suit on.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 I hope you brought one. I hope you dropped half a million dollars for your own space suit.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Because we are getting ready to head up to the red planet known as Mars.

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Adam is sitting at the controls of the Dead Rabbit rocket we're all strapped in and...

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 [Exhales]

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 We're headed off to that crimson ball in the sky.

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 So we're taking the rocket up to the red planet.

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 I'm gonna see how many different ways I can say Mars.

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Because I'm gonna be saying it a lot. The crimson globe.

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 That's it. That was nearly two. I think I already said those ones anyways.

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 The burgundy ball. Adam lands us in the middle of Mars.

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 It's just vast wasteland as far as I can see.

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Now there's been a lot of rumors about Mars.

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 There's obviously like scientific stuff we know like...

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 That it exists? That it's there? That it's real?

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 There's water on the caps and stuff like that.

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 There's long been stories about aliens on Mars.

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Recently a man known as Captain K appeared on the reputable mainstream news website.

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 ExoNewsTV.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Whose tagline is for news... [Laughs]

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 For news that's out of this world!

60
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 That's when you know you're on a legit news website when you actually have a tagline like that.

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 ExoNewsTV was recently interviewing this Captain, Captain K, who served on Mars.

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 I bet you didn't know that right? But you didn't know that we actually have military men on Mars right now.

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 He did 20 years on Mars.

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 His job was to protect the Martian colony there from two indigenous alien races.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 So we're ready to fight. We got all of our guns loaded up to plasma rifles.

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 We're headed in with first wave. Just means more Martians for us to kill.

67
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 We're walking through the desert.

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Now supposedly there is in an insectoid, an indigenous insectoid race on the planet.

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 [Sounds of insectoid]

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 You're looking around, you're waiting to see an insect.

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 It's just me eating a wetchamacallit, throwing the wrapper on the ground.

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 You're like, "Hey dude, you're on the alien planet. Maybe you shouldn't litter.

73
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Maybe we shouldn't repeat the problems we had before."

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 But wetchamacallits are so good. It's worth littering.

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 You're like, "How did you even eat a wetchamacallit?"

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 You're wearing a space helmet.

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Where there's a will, there's a way.

78
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 I'm sticking it into the oxygen vent and just breathing it in.

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 He also says that there's an indigenous race of reptilians.

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 [Sounds of reptilians]

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 I don't know what I could eat that would make that noise.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 He did 20 years on Mars protecting the Martian colony corporation from these races.

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Now he said as long as you didn't go into their territory, they didn't really attack you.

84
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 So there was kind of a peace going on for a long time.

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 But for whatever reason, probably just human greed and/or curiosity, or both,

86
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 they decided to steal and the Mars colony corporation thought,

87
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 "Hmm, we know there's this ancient alien artifact out in the middle of nowhere.

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Any place on Mars, let's go get it."

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 So Captain K and over a thousand other soldiers, they got their weapons ready.

90
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 They set off to find this alien relic.

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Hopefully it was an insectoid relic.

92
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 I don't think insectoids get enough love.

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 I think insectoid aliens are really cool.

94
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 I wish they would show up in more stories.

95
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 But we're approaching this cave where the human insectoid,

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 we're gonna say it's an insectoid, he didn't specify what alien race in the article said,

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 the human insectoid battle for the relic took place.

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Raiders of the Lost Blark?

99
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 I don't know, doesn't work.

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Maybe aliens use the word "blark."

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 We walk into this cave.

102
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 [whoosh]

103
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Crunch, crunch, crunch.

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 That's me walking and eating a bunch of a collet at the same time.

105
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 [mimics sound]

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 And we see a US-issued blaster rifle, an F-97400,

107
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 collecting dust on the ground.

108
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 It's kind of unsettling, you think that the humans should have picked up after themselves

109
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 and not be killed in the first place.

110
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 And as we're continuing our way into this cave,

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 we see yet another blaster rifle, a laser pistol, a tectonic grenade.

112
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 We're walking over the debris of a sci-fi battle and we see a valley inside the cave.

113
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 It is littered with the corpses of 1,000 of our fellow earthlings.

114
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Now there's a lot of insectoid corpses as well,

115
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 but we see often the distance a glimmering relic.

116
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 It's a little statue, it's a little statue of an insectoid.

117
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 It was not taken by the Mars Colony Corporation.

118
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 According to Captain K, over a thousand men and women died in this battle.

119
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 One of the men died in the battle, and the other two died in the battle.

120
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 The other two died in the battle, and the other two died in the battle.

121
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 The other two died in the battle, and the other two died in the battle.

122
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 The other two died in the battle, and the other two died in the battle.

123
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 The other two died in the battle, and the other two died in the battle.

124
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Captain K, over a thousand men and women died in the battle.

125
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Captain K, over a thousand men and women died in the battle.

126
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Captain K, over a thousand men and women died in the battle.

127
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 Captain K, over a thousand men and women died in the battle.

128
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 Captain K, over a thousand men and women died in the battle.

129
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 And then military procedure is, if someone drops your medal, you have to pick it up.

130
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 And so as he's leaning down to pick up the medal,

131
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 BOOM!

132
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 Blaster shot to the base of the skull.

133
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 It's pretty grim, right? They could have just put a pillow over his head.

134
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 But I would find it hard to believe that they would just be like,

135
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 "Oh, you served all this time, and you fought these aliens, and you know all the secret stuff, so here you go.

136
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Here's your retirement, and also here's a Wi-Fi connection for you. It's ultra fast."

137
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 So you can communicate with Exo News TV.

138
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 But that is Captain K's story.

139
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 We are walking out of this cave. We say goodbye to our fallen earthmen.

140
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 We're walking back to the Mars Colony.

141
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Now, the Mars Colony, this is what I find very fascinating about all of this stuff,

142
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 is you have all of these conflicting stories about what's going on.

143
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 According to Captain K, it's just a colon.

144
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 I mean, there's just so much people up there, and they're sitting around, and they're trying to figure out

145
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 how they can steal, how they can irritate the indigenous alien races.

146
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 But the more common alien conspiracy theory, one that's gaining a lot of traction now,

147
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 is the Slave Colony on Mars.

148
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Adam Dunn called in that Jason Jalopy.

149
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 It's been modified for Martian use. It just has a bubble.

150
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 It just has a bubble over the roof now. Everything else is the same.

151
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 It still works like an old Jalopy.

152
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 Adam's driving us across the desert of Mars,

153
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 and we see a glimmering little domed city off in the distance.

154
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 You can't see what's else, go! So don't try looking!

155
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 But we can see it where we're at.

156
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Car is driving across the orange oval known as Mars.

157
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 We stop outside of the domed city.

158
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 [Metal shatters]

159
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Door opens up, just an empty hallway in front of us.

160
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Keep your guns ready.

161
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 They might have succeeded in stealing something.

162
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 The insectoids may have raided this base.

163
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 We're walking through this colony.

164
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 Lights flickering.

165
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 [Metal shatters]

166
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 There's a creepy rocking chair in the corner,

167
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 rocking by itself.

168
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Ring around the rosy park.

169
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 What'd you hear that? What's going on?

170
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Walking through this abandoned base.

171
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 But it's not really abandoned. I don't know why you say it is abandoned.

172
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 It's not abandoned.

173
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 I'm trying to build a mood that it's creepy.

174
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Here's the conspiracy theory.

175
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 There's two twins standing in the corner.

176
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 Here's the conspiracy theory.

177
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 This is a very common one, but I think I have a new spin on it.

178
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Back in 2017, there was a man known as Robert Steele.

179
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 He says that he's a former CIA operative.

180
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 He was actually on the Alex Jones show.

181
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 Now, there's no video of this anymore.

182
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 It might be on one of like Bitshoot or something like that,

183
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 but it's completely gone.

184
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 But we have a lot of quotes because this was very well covered in the mainstream media.

185
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Robert Steele goes on the Alex Jones show and he says that -

186
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 let me read you this quote here -

187
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 "We actually believe there is a colony on Mars that is populated by children

188
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 who were kidnapped and sentenced to space on a 20-year ride."

189
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 Save your questions. Save your questions for the end,

190
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 because I know obviously you're like, "Wait, what?"

191
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 "We actually believe there is a colony on Mars that is populated by children

192
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 who were kidnapped and sentenced to space on a 20-year ride."

193
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 So that once they get to Mars, they have no alternative but to be slaves to the Mars colony.

194
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 He then goes on to weave this story that -

195
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 and this is why it's popping back up in conspiracy theory -

196
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 that these kids are being taken to Mars to be harvested for their adrenochrome.

197
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 And then just to kind of be like, have their organs sold as well.

198
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Again, save your questions till the end.

199
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 So, and Alex Jones says, "Yeah, he doesn't actually say I've heard that story's true,

200
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 but he has said I've heard that 90% of all NASA missions are secret,

201
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 that we don't know what payloads are going up and things like that."

202
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 Anyways, this is the story.

203
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 So the reason why it's back into conspiracy theory,

204
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 because it's tied into the whole adrenochrome thing.

205
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 There's a couple big issues with this one.

206
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 First off, why would you send a child to Mars to harvest his organs?

207
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Because here's the thing.

208
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Then you gotta send him back.

209
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 Unless there's a huge need for human organs on Mars, which there may be.

210
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 I don't know, I've never been there.

211
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Maybe you go there, immediately you land, your liver explodes.

212
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 You're like, "Oh, does anyone have a spare liver?"

213
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 And they're like, "Come this way, sir."

214
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 There's a creepy rocking chair in the corner you gotta sit in.

215
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 Yeah.

216
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 You want to make sense to take someone on a 20-year journey just to harvest their organs

217
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 and then be like, "Oh, great, we got to send these back.

218
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 Hope you don't die for 20 years.

219
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 It's going to take a long time to get these lungs back to you."

220
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 The adrenochrome thing we've discussed many times before.

221
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 But again, that wouldn't make any more sense either.

222
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 It's like growing grapes in France versus growing grapes in Michigan.

223
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 The grapes grow better in France.

224
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Adrenochrome grows better in Mars?

225
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 I don't know, but it wouldn't make any sense.

226
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 And then there's another big problem with this.

227
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Let's do a math question here.

228
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 It's a basic math question.

229
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 If you kidnap a kid on Earth and then you fly him for 20 years and drop him off on a planet,

230
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 is he really a kid?

231
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 Is he still a child at that point?

232
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 You kidnap the 12-year-old kid and then he's a 32-year-old man on the planet Mars

233
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 and you're like, "Yes, I've waited all this time to torture a kid."

234
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 And this big strapping dude comes running off the ship, starts beating you up.

235
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 It doesn't make sense.

236
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 Also, even by today's basic technology standards, it doesn't take 20 years to get to Mars.

237
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 It's like a six-month journey.

238
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 What are they doing? Taking the scenic route?

239
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 They're like, "Duh-duh-duh-duh."

240
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 Kids are like, "Are we there yet? Are we there yet?"

241
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 He's like, "I'm going to pull over and harvest your adrenochrome right now if you don't shut up."

242
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 Kids are like, "Are we there yet?"

243
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 They're just getting stronger. They're doing push-ups for 20 years.

244
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 It doesn't make sense.

245
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 One sentence doesn't make sense, but none of it does.

246
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 None of it does, but especially...

247
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Anyway, so that's kind of what we're dealing with here.

248
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Now, the reason why this became mainstream news was that this was done on the Alex Jones show

249
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 and there's a lot of crazy stuff said on a lot of conspiracy shows.

250
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 What triggered this was NASA actually responded to this.

251
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 NASA said, "No."

252
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 That was the response. No.

253
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 There's not a colony on Mars

254
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 and there's definitely no kids on Mars.

255
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 And none of it's true.

256
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 At some point they just thought, they're like, "We could go point by point disputing this,

257
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 but I think we beat it on the first point. There's no colony on Mars."

258
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 So you had all of these mainstream websites cover it.

259
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Mainstream newspapers, space.com, all of this stuff covered it.

260
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 And the reason why, and it's funny because on the conspiracy theory level,

261
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 you think, "Oh, they're all covering it because they're all part of the cover-up."

262
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 See? That's why they're making a huge push against it.

263
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 The reason why they're all covering it, because it generates links.

264
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 For 99% of the conspiracy's out there, human greed is the motivating factor.

265
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 And this isn't a conspiracy theory.

266
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 I mean, you could say, "Oh, they're all pushing against it at the same time."

267
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 It's because people were clicking on the links, because it's such a bizarre headline

268
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 for the register to have shock.

269
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 NASA denies secret child sex slave cannibal colony on Mars.

270
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 I guess I left out the sex slave in the cannibal part, but people are going to click on that.

271
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 People are going to click on that.

272
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 So you're going to have these claims put out there.

273
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Now, I have another conspiracy for this whole thing.

274
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 I don't actually believe that there's a colony on Mars where this stuff is taking place,

275
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 but I have another conspiracy theory that you may actually say is a bit darker,

276
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 because it's far more realistic.

277
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 The idea of a slave colony on Mars is actually fairly old.

278
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 I found an example that we're going to cover in a minute from the year 2015.

279
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 But it was 2017 when it became mainstream news.

280
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Yeah, the Alex Jones guest, and then everyone started talking about the slave colony on Mars.

281
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 What's really fascinating about this is when I decided to look into this topic,

282
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 I typed in "Mars slave," and I was going to type in "colony," and it auto-populated to "labor."

283
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 Mars slave labor.

284
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 I was like, "Oh, that's weird." Click on it.

285
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Now, it did bring up a bunch of articles about what we're talking about,

286
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 but it also brought up another set of articles.

287
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 There's accusations made that the leading chocolate bar companies are, for lack of a better term,

288
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 supporting slave labor.

289
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 They're not funneling money.

290
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 They're not sitting there with a giant cigar being like, "Oh, yes, more slaves, please."

291
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 But because of their industry, is cocoa, and 70% of the world's cocoa comes from West Africa,

292
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 which has a horrible track record when it comes to slavery.

293
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 There are people who believe that the chocolate companies are actually enabling,

294
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 would probably be a better term for it than supporting, but enabling the slave trade.

295
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 The chocolate companies say, "Listen, we do our best.

296
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 We try to buy as much as we can from farms.

297
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 South America provides a lot of cocoa, and it doesn't have a slave labor problem."

298
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 They go, "We do our best to buy from reputable dealers."

299
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 However, so much of it is needed, and there's such a high demand for it,

300
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 that we can't guarantee on any level that none of it comes from slaves.

301
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 It's real chilling, right?

302
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 So these chocolate companies are being dogged with these accusations,

303
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 and again, they will say, "We're trying to do our best,"

304
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 and people are trying to end it, say,

305
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 "Chocolate companies need to put on their labels this was made by slave labor."

306
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 They need to have a system in place so that people know

307
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 that when you go to buy that bag of M&Ms, or that whatchamacallit bar, or that Hershey's, whatever it is,

308
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 that there will be a warning on it saying, "By buying this, you are supporting slave labor."

309
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 I don't know if it's that blunt, but it would be something to that extent.

310
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 The chocolate companies have said, "We provide all that information on our website,

311
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 and if you want to find out, you can go, we do keep track,

312
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 and all of our progress that we're doing to work towards this, we keep it on our website."

313
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 Just in June of this year, the chocolate companies won a lawsuit in Massachusetts,

314
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 saying that because we put it on our website, we don't have to put it on our packaging.

315
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 This is an ongoing issue, but what I thought was really interesting

316
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 was in May 2017, Mars, the chocolate company,

317
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 released a detailed statement about how they are trying to eliminate the slave labor in their supply chain.

318
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 And two months later, Mars and slave is no longer closely tied to a real-life tragedy.

319
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 It's tied to a wacky conspiracy theory.

320
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 That's actually not a bad idea if you think about it.

321
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 If you have a company that is under investigation or has some rumors about it,

322
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 or truth, or truth, right, to find a way to hide your story within conspiracy theories,

323
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 because you can try to mess with the algorithm and the SEO and stuff like that,

324
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 but if you can actually create a viral story that you know will live on for years,

325
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 because conspiracies very rarely die unless there's a date assigned to them.

326
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 They just keep going and going and going.

327
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 If you can find a way to attach your real-life controversy into a conspiracy theory

328
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 and it goes viral, anyone looking for the real-life issue will only find the conspiracy theory.

329
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 I'm not saying that Mars company did this, but it would be a smart idea if they did.

330
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 And think about it, you could have companies have conspiracy theorists on payrolls

331
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 to the point that the conspiracy theorists may not even know they're working for this massive conglomerate,

332
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 and they get delivered a document about Mars slave colonies.

333
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 And they're reading it and they're like, "Oh, this is great.

334
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 I can't wait to spread this lunacy across the planet."

335
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 And then there's a boardroom off in the distance.

336
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Just a boardroom. There's no building.

337
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 It's just a table in the middle of nowhere and a bunch of fat cat CEOs.

338
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 Everyone at the table is a CEO. It's a weird company.

339
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 And they're like, "Yes, that plan worked."

340
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Good thing I listened to Dead Rabbit Radio to hear that plan.

341
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Adam Dunn calling that carbonicopter.

342
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 We're leaving behind this table in the middle of nowhere.

343
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 We're headed back to Mars.

344
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 We left to do the Mars story, to do the story about the Mars Mars.

345
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 We're leaving behind Earth.

346
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 Once again, we're taking that carbonicopter.

347
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 It's been specially outfitted for outer space travel.

348
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 We're headed back to Mars.

349
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 [imitates a movie]

350
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 And it's a long journey, so I have a movie for us to watch.

351
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 That movie is called Spell.

352
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 This Halloween, prepare yourself for the terrifying suspense thriller Spell,

353
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 starring Omari Hardwick from the TV show Power and Loretta Divine.

354
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Marquis, played by Omari Hardwick,

355
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 awakens from a plane crash imprisoned by a mysterious woman practicing hoodoo magic.

356
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 He desperately tries to break free to save his family from the sinister rituals that await.

357
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Spell is premiering at home on all digital platforms October 30th, rated R, from Paramount Pictures.

358
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 [imitates a movie]

359
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 Carbonicopter is clearing the void between the bright blue ball known as Earth

360
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 and the dusty magenta circle known as Mars.

 [imitates a movie]

362
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 We're landing back at another Martian slave colony.

363
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 It may be the same place. I don't know. I don't know how many there are,

364
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 but this is a different person because as we land here,

365
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 this one doesn't have a spooky rocking chair.

366
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 This one doesn't have two little twins in the corner singing lullabies.

367
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 No, this one has...

 [imitates a movie]

369
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 ...door's open up, and majestically standing in front of us is Corey Goode.

370
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 Now, long time Dead Rav radio listeners will recognize that name.

371
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 He was in episode 47, and Corey Goode told the story about how the fighting men and women of the US

372
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 military would go to Antarctica and beat up reptiles and rescue kids.

373
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 I can't... why are you kidnapping kids and taking them to Antarctica?

374
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 I guess really the question is why are you kidnapping kids?

375
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 It's not gonna be like, "Oh, you're only taking them across the street? That's fine."

376
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 The whole thing's bizarre, but it's even more weird that you would transport them for six months

377
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 across the ocean, or however long it is, two months.

378
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 It doesn't matter how many months. I don't know why we're getting stuck on the details.

379
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Why are you kidnapping kids? Why are you taking them to Antarctica?

380
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 It's the same. They were eating them. The reptilians were eating them over there.

381
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 He talked about that. We covered him in episode 47. He's back.

382
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 Because little did you know, he's like, "Wait, I have another story to make up."

383
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 Everyone's like, "What? Oh, we are bored of the Antarctica story."

384
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 He's like, "I know, I know. I wasn't getting a bunch of hits on my website."

385
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 So luckily, I just remembered, his eyes are shifting side to side,

386
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 I just remembered I also go to Mars, and everyone's like, "Oh, we want to pay attention to you again."

387
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 My plan worked, because he's getting a free lifetime supply of Mars chocolate.

388
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 He's like, "Oh, both my plans worked."

389
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 He went to Mars, guys. So that's why we're on this base. We're meeting him there.

390
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 And there we're going to meet Corey Good, Lieutenant Colonel Gonzales.

391
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 Not his full name. Never gives his full name. Also, just the Lieutenant Colonel.

392
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 It's a little unimpressive. I mean, maybe, I don't know, I would expect to see a general or something.

393
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 Like, I don't know, I'm not in the military. Maybe Lieutenant Colonel's super high up in the ranks.

394
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 But like, if someone goes, "Hi, Jason, I'm Lieutenant Colonel," start rolling my eyes in the middle of the sentence.

395
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 No, I'm sure it's pretty high up there. Is it higher than a Colonel? Doesn't matter.

396
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 I guess you're on Mars. You could be a private on Mars. That would be impressive if it was real.

397
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 But Corey Good, he did 20 years. There's always 20 years with these guys.

398
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 He did 20 years in the Secret Space Program Alliance.

399
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 One day, Corey Good, I don't know why I'm jumping to the end of the story.

400
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 One day, Corey Good is sitting at home and this blue ball floats into his house.

401
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 Just another afternoon for Corey Good, right? He's checking his website.

402
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 I'm not getting any hits. I probably should come up with another story.

403
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 All of a sudden, blue ball, he's like, "This is it! This will be the new thing I'm going to sell."

404
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 I mean, tell. He jumps into the blue ball and the blue ball takes him to Lunar Operations Command.

405
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 That's a base on the moon. That's where he meets Lieutenant Colonel Gonzales.

406
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 And Corey Good's like, "Could I meet like a general or something?"

407
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 And Lieutenant Colonel Gonzales is like, "No, I'm the highest ranking person in this story."

408
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 They then each team up with two intuitive empaths.

409
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 So there's these two dudes and then apparently two others.

410
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 So there's a total of six people. They're taking out. There'll be a math quiz.

411
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 And then they hang out with these intuitive empaths and they just are able to tell when people are angry.

412
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Here, I'll give you a tip. It's when the alien's pointing a rifle at you.

413
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 You're like, "Oh, you probably could have told me that earlier, intuitive empath."

414
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 But so they leave behind the moon and they go to Mars.

415
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 And it takes them a 30 minutes. The article is very clear to state.

416
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 They usually takes two or three minutes to get from the moon to Mars.

417
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 But this time it took them 30 minutes because Mars was on the other side of the sun this time.

418
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 Who cares? The story is made up to begin with.

419
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 I don't understand what... This is ExoNews as well.

420
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 I don't understand... There's a whole paragraph explaining that.

421
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 They're like, "Normally this journey only takes..." Who cares? It's made up.

422
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 It's made of... Don't tell me real life stuff because you're making up...

423
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Anyway, so apparently, just if you ever need to travel to Mars from the moon

424
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 and you're trying to figure out when you should eat lunch,

425
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 if it's on the other side of the sun, it's going to take 30 minutes.

426
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 There you go. Now you know that. Like I said, it's going to be a math episode.

427
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 They go to Mars. They get to the base and they meet the base commander and he goes,

428
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 "Hey guys, listen, welcome from secret space, whatever name you made up.

429
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 Welcome. Welcome to this Mars colony."

430
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 Now, I know there's been a lot of accusations of us having slaves here.

431
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 That's not true. It's misspelled actually. We have a bunch of slides here.

432
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 And they see all these kids going down in slides.

433
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Cory gets like, "Oh, that's kind of cool." He's like, "Yeah, yeah, it's a translation error."

434
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 We don't have slaves here. We do have a bunch of people here though.

435
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 We have a ton of humans here, but don't tell them you're from Earth.

436
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Cory goes like, "What? I'm human, right? Where I was supposed to tell them I'm coming from?"

437
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 Base commander goes, "As far as everyone on this base knows, Earth was destroyed in a massive calamity."

438
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 So, don't tell them that's not true. They've been here for decades.

439
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 They're having families and their families are going to have families and so on and so forth.

440
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 This is a multi-generational base, but you can't tell them you're from Earth.

441
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 So Cory, good listen man. This guy's done 20 years in the Solar Warden program.

442
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 There's over 900 alien species this man has knowledge of. He's met some of these aliens faced.

443
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 "Man, what are you talking about dude?" This guy's not going to say nothing.

444
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 So, Cory, good, Lieutenant Gonzalez and their little group are walking around this base.

445
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 They run into a group of people and within about three minutes, Cory, good, tells the dude he's from Texas.

446
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 And a riot breaks out. Eventually, a subway shows up.

447
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 Troops quell this riot and was like, "What? Texas is real? I thought that was destroyed. Oh man.

448
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 I threw away all of my Texas stuff. I'm a big Texas fan apparently.

449
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 I'm the only one on Mars because no one else believes me."

450
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Riot breaks up because Cory, good, who has not one but two certificates you can view online

451
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 showing that he has certified classes in mass casualty events and the psychology of terrorism.

452
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 You just can't earn those by attending some sort of seminar or taking a class. No.

453
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 Well, probably, but he has those. How could he have accidentally told this guy he was from Texas?

454
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 Come on, Cory. So what do you think is going to happen now?

455
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 He has broken the one rule he was given. He's taken to base commander.

456
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 Base commander's like, "Over here. Let's go to a PowerPoint presentation."

457
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 So nothing happens. Cory, good, and his group go to a PowerPoint presentation where they're showing

458
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 about the 900 different intergalactic civilizations that humanity is currently interacting with

459
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 and how they are using alien tech to merge with human technology.

460
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 Cory, good, sitting back. He's super bored. He pulls out a laser pointer.

461
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 He's like putting it on the screen. They're like, "Cory, that's a real laser."

462
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 It's all, "Bzzz." No, it's a hole through the wall. Everyone can't breathe.

463
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 Anyways, this article that I'm getting off exonews.com, it's about a power graph telling us about this PowerPoint presentation.

464
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 It's not as interesting as a PowerPoint presentation.

465
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 The PowerPoint presentation doesn't become any more interesting if it's on Mars or not.

466
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 It's still a slideshow.

467
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 But then after the PowerPoint presentation, the base commander tells Cory and Lieutenant Colonel Gonzales,

468
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 "Guess what, guys? Look under your seat. Look under your seat."

469
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 They're like, "What? What's under my seat?" There's a little piece of paper.

470
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 There's a number on it. They're like, "You guys just won your own family."

471
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 What? What is going on?

472
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 Anyways, so they're told, actually, there's not an Oprah Prize. You get a family and you get a family.

473
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 But they are told by the base commander, "You guys have now been assigned a family to take with you."

474
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 So anyways, they go and they find like this pod that has the same number as the piece of paper.

475
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 Again, it's a made-up detail. I don't know why I'm repeating such a made-up detail.

476
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 But anyways, they go to the pod and inside the pod is a man and his wife.

477
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 They're two kids, boy and a girl, the teenagers, and the family has all their bags packed.

478
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 And Lieutenant Colonel Gonzales is looking at these people and then he goes,

479
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 "Where's the other member of your family?" Apparently he's British now.

480
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 And they go, "We don't know what you're talking about. It's only the four of us."

481
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 And Lieutenant Colonel Gonzales says, "That's not what my empath tells me.

482
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 He says that you are hiding a member of your family from us.

483
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 We want all of you."

484
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 Now I know you're thinking the same thing I'm thinking when I was reading the story.

485
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 I thought, "Wait, I thought Lieutenant Colonel Gonzales was a good guy."

486
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 Now he's like, "Oh yeah, I know there's five of you where all you..."

487
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 He's all sneaking around getting all creepy.

488
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 I was like, "Dude, what? What are you doing?"

489
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 And the family starts freaking out because apparently now telepathy exists in this world.

490
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 Also, again, that total stranger is asking for your hidden child.

491
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 That they start freaking out.

492
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 Base Commander shows up and he's like, "What? Why are you harassing our slaves?

493
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 I mean, our totally normal people who are petrified of all authority."

494
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 And so he throws Lieutenant Colonel Gonzales and Corey Good and all the empaths in a jail cell.

495
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 Despite the fact that we have alien technology and the ability to exist on Mars,

496
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 you still have rooms with bars on them, right?

497
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Why don't you just shoot them, really?

498
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 Because apparently they're already talking about Texas.

499
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 You're already talking about Texas. You're revealing all these secrets.

500
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 They throw them in a jail cell.

501
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 There's like a key. There's like a Don Knotts guy with a big ring, a key's on his key chain, and a sleeping dog.

502
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 They go sleep in Bulldog in the corner with a space helmet on.

503
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 Corey Good says as he's being led into the jail as well,

504
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 he sees all these other cells and everyone looked really sad in them.

505
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 That's the same on Earth. Or Mars, I think that doesn't matter.

506
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 But so apparently there are bars on these cells, or maybe little windows,

507
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 but still, like why isn't a space cell? Why aren't they being thrown into the Phantom Zone or something like that?

508
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 So they're all trapped in this jail cell. They're on Mars.

509
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 Lieutenant Colonel Gonzales is like, "Oh, you know, we're in a lot of trouble now."

510
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 One, because my accent changed.

511
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 And two, because the base commander is like a total totalitarian.

512
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 He's nuts.

513
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 To be fair, if I was Corey Good, I would say this, to be fair,

514
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 you shouldn't have been so insistent on finding the fifth hidden member of the family.

515
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 Ah, I just wanted to complete my collection.

516
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 I didn't want to know there was one other one out there.

517
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 What? What are you talking about, Lieutenant Colonel?

518
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 Interrupting Corey Good's sentence, a blue orb flies into the jail cell.

519
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 Let me read you this actual quote.

520
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 "It wasn't a minute later that we saw our blue indigo orb friends."

521
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 That's the best sentence ever.

522
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 "Our blue indigo orb friends zipping through the walls of the cell, one for each of us.

523
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 They danced around for a couple seconds, and the other SSP personnel who had never traveled this way,

524
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 backed against the wall."

525
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 How big is this cell? It's as big as your imagination, because it's totally made up.

526
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 You have six people in a cell.

527
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 Now you have six human-sized orbs in the cell, and they're dancing.

528
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 They're doing a little break dance.

529
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 They break out some holographic cardboard. They're all spinning around.

530
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 They're like, "That's why they're backing up against the wall."

531
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 It's not because they're like, "What's this amazing technology?"

532
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 It's because they're doing B-Boy moves and stuff.

533
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 Go Orbeez, go Orbeez, go, go, go Orbeez. They're having this dance party.

534
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 Everyone else in the cells are just looking out.

535
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 These B-Boy blue orbs are dancing. Everyone's clapping.

536
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 Everyone in the cells clapping. All the other people are like, "I just want bread."

537
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 So Corey Goode and Team hop in their own individual blue orbs, and they fly to the moon.

538
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 Just like Frank Sinatra predicted what happened in his great song, "Slave Colony on Mars."

539
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 And then the article ends with saying, "Listen, guys, we know that there's a problem with slavery on Mars."

540
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 And the space company, whatever this group is called, the SSP, the Secret Space Program,

541
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 will stop and nothing to defeat these slavers.

542
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 Now, this article was written in the year 2015, and nothing's been done.

543
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 You had that article in 2017 about slaves on Mars.

544
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 So, yeah, sure, you may have a fleet of spaceships and all this stuff,

545
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 but if you can't rescue these dudes on Mars, you already know it's a problem.

546
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 You now know that they were slaves, not slides.

547
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 You now know that they're giving out families to people who show up to a PowerPoint presentation.

548
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 So what are you guys waiting for? Huh?

549
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 Shouldn't we already be freeing those people slaves on Mars?

550
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 The official explanation, the official imaginary explanation.

551
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 The imaginary base commander gave it to the imaginary lunar operations command that we do not have slaves.

552
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 This is just a social experiment, bro. It's just a prank. It's just a prank.

553
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 We want to see what happens to people when you tell them their planet has been destroyed,

554
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 and we take them to another planet.

555
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 And Corey Good showed up.

556
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 He almost brought the whole colony come crashing down.

557
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 When he told the duty was from Texas.

558
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 So, shame on you, secret space program.

559
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 We are just trying to figure out what happens when you mentally torture people.

560
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 We're not slavers. We're mentally enslavers.

561
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 Adding that word in front of it makes it less horrible.

562
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 My question is why, if this place exists, why aren't they doing anything about it?

563
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 Why aren't their imaginary starfighters leaving right now to launch,

564
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 make-believe missiles to destroy buildings that exist nothing but in the realms of dreams?

565
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 I don't know, but I do know this.

566
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 If you want to fight, you can buy a t-shirt.

567
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 This isn't an ad-read for one of my t-shirts. No, no, no, no. I'm not that tacky. I'll do that in another episode.

568
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 When I was looking for more information about Corey Good and the reptilian resistance,

569
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 I found a shirt on Amazon that you can buy today that will signal to the world

570
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 you are on the right side against the Martian slave colonies.

571
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 This shirt is a picture of a gray alien head. Yeah, I know.

572
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 It should be a reptilian head, but that's the least of the problems with this shirt.

573
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 It has a gray reptilian head, and across it it says, "Fight for glory. Pride and honor.

574
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 Keep struggle for freedom fight."

575
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 I don't know if that's probably speaking alien-speak. That's because in case an alien sees it, they're like,

576
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 "Oh, yes. Keep struggle for freedom fight. Totally understand. Yes, you're on the good guy's side."

577
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 And then underneath it, it says, "The three greatest words any human can say protect the Earth."

578
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 I don't mean that in some environmentalist way. No.

579
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 I mean that in laser guns, spaceships, and two knives with brass-knuckle hilts.

580
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
 Now, out of those three, that'd be the least effective weapon against aliens.

581
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 But those are the weapons that are chosen to be poorly photoshopped onto this shirt.

582
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 So if you ever want to take on an army of reptilian gray aliens, if you want to keep struggle for freedom fight,

583
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 but all you're bringing into the fight is two brass-knuckles with knives attached to them, buy this shirt, protect the Earth.

584
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 And remember, Earth first, now, and forever.
