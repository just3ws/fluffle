11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:35,400
 How would you do if you were asleep in one night, catching some z's?

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:42,240
 When all of a sudden, you realized something was watching you.

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,120
 And then we take a look at the story of the puppy named Eddie.

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:51,520
 A curious little guy who's found stranded on the side of the road.

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,320
 But when a family adopts Eddie and brings him home, they have no idea he's going to

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,400
 become a gateway to the world of the dead.

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,400
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

18
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:12,520
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

19
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,520
 I'm your host Jason Garvin, and I'm having a great day.

20
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,880
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

21
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,960
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun out there in the world doing whatever you're

22
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,960
 doing.

23
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,880
 Don't forget it's coming up to the end of season 20 and we are about to take a break.

24
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,440
 I don't think there's going to be any classic episodes this time.

25
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,400
 I know that I always say that we're going to do them.

26
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,440
 There's so much more work.

27
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,160
 I need to do them at the beginning of the season and I say that every time too.

28
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,440
 But we will have more classic episodes for you at some point in the future of Dead Rabbit

29
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,640
 Radio because I do love doing them.

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,640
 I'm just done.

31
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,360
 You know, by the end of the season, I'm so overworked.

32
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:56,320
 And also a quick reminder, March 24th, 6pm in Seaside Organ at the Oregon Ghost Conference.

33
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,400
 I will be giving a presentation.

34
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,920
 Why are there no fat ghosts?

35
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,640
 And I would love to see you guys there.

36
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,600
 It's $15, but that's not just for my speech.

37
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,440
 $15 gives you three days at the Oregon Ghost Convention or Oregon Ghost Conference.

38
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,880
 I guess I should say the name right.

39
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,880
 You're walking around.

40
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,480
 Here's a big sign that says Oregon Ghost Conference.

41
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,640
 You're like, "Oh, Jason said it was the Oregon Ghost Convention."

42
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,720
 So I'm not walking in there.

43
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,880
 Oregon Ghost Conference in Seaside, Oregon, it's three days and lots of fun of people

44
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,400
 talking about the world of the paranormal.

45
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,400
 So I can't wait.

46
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,560
 I'm going to be stopping by a lot of other speeches.

47
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,560
 I want to hear that.

48
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,320
 I might attend a workshop or two.

49
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,040
 And I hope to see you guys there.

50
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,600
 That'll be really cool.

51
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,520
 Someone who's always cool whether or not he goes to the Ghost Conference or the Ghost

52
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:45,760
 Convention walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our newest Patreon supporters.

53
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,920
 And give it up for Lazy A Farms.

54
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,920
 Woohoo!

55
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,920
 Yeah!

56
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,920
 Come on in.

57
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,280
 An entire plot of land, an entire farm is coming into Dead Rabbit Radio Command.

58
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,800
 Lazy A Farms, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

59
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,480
 If you guys can't support the show financially, I totally understand.

60
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,680
 I really do.

61
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,800
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

62
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,600
 That helps out so, so much.

63
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,200
 Lazy A Farms, everyone, let's walk around on his plot of land.

64
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,880
 You're like, Jason, clearly that's a business.

65
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,360
 You understand that a farm itself is not supporting the Patreon.

66
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,360
 I don't know.

67
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,360
 Weird things have happened.

68
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,640
 We're walking around with hoes and pickaxes and we're like tilling the soil.

69
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,240
 A bunch of cows are giving us orders, telling us what to do.

70
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,560
 It's a pretty cool place, Lazy A Farms.

71
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,440
 But while we're doing that, I'm going to go ahead and bury the keys for the Dead Rabbit

72
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,640
 Dune Buggy in the soil.

73
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,400
 Lazy A Farms uses those keys somehow.

74
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
 I don't know.

75
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
 Grow some vines.

76
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,640
 Drive us all the way out of Dead Rabbit Command.

77
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,560
 We're headed out to a little boy's house.

78
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,560
 Ding, ding, ding.

79
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,280
 Ding, ding, ding.

80
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,320
 It's a nice little speedy drive across the world.

81
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,640
 We don't know where the story took place.

82
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,760
 We don't really even have a timeline.

83
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,760
 But it took place in the past.

84
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,080
 It took place sometime between Earth cooling and evolving life on it.

85
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,320
 And today, this was written, posted online anonymously.

86
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,360
 We're going to go in and call the guy Fred.

87
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,160
 And Fred said this story happened when he was eight or nine.

88
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,040
 So we'll figure it minimum 10 years ago.

89
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,440
 I'd probably say it's in that time period, 10 to 15 years ago.

90
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,840
 Fred said that he was spending the weekend with his cousins and having a lot of fun.

91
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,440
 He actually didn't have that having a lot of fun part.

92
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,680
 But you know, I can do a little bit of editorializing.

93
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,680
 I'm sure it wasn't terrible.

94
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,280
 Well actually, not that I think about this story.

95
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,280
 He's kind of terrifying.

96
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,080
 He was spending the weekend with his cousins and he was sleeping on the couch.

97
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,760
 And this was the house of his aunt and uncle and their kids.

98
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,000
 And we'll go ahead and call him Uncle Jack.

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,960
 This is the other named character in the story.

100
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,320
 He goes to the house, Uncle Jack's house.

101
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,640
 The way it was laid out was you had a front door.

102
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,600
 Obviously, he's like, no, he had a climb up sheet rope where you could only enter on

103
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
 the second floor.

104
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,100
 Had a front door.

105
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,160
 And the way that the front door was set up was there was a window at the top of the door

106
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,160
 frame.

107
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:12,720
 And then above it, you have a nice big window to let the sun in.

108
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,520
 And that would not be notable in any house.

109
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,640
 Right, obviously, he's pointing that out for a reason in this story.

110
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,640
 You're like, what?

111
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,640
 That's weird.

112
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,640
 I've been in a dozen houses like that.

113
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,880
 No one's ever been, hey, when you visit, make sure to check out the window above the front

114
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,880
 door.

115
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,880
 He's like, what?

116
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,400
 Is that the best thing about your house?

117
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,480
 They're like, yeah.

118
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,640
 There's a window above the front door.

119
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,960
 So anyways, Fred is spending the weekend here.

120
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,360
 He's sleeping on the couch.

121
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,360
 His eyes are closed.

122
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,160
 His little eight or nine year old eyelids are tightly shut.

123
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,960
 But he sees, well, it's like that weird thing.

124
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,880
 You know when your eyes are closed and someone's shining a light?

125
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,880
 Probably me.

126
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,720
 You're trying to get a nice sleep on top of you with a flashlight.

127
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,280
 I was like, wake up, wake up.

128
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,880
 You know how when you have your eyes closed, but someone turns on the light, even though

129
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,000
 your eyes are closed, you can kind of see the light through your eyelids?

130
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,480
 You're like, before you even wake up, you're kind of annoyed that the light's on.

131
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,480
 It's that.

132
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,480
 That's the sensation he's having.

133
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,240
 His eyes are shut, but he kind of wakes up in the middle of the night because he senses

134
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:15,920
 a light is on a very bright light, a very bright green light, which would be more alarming.

135
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,400
 There should be far more alarming.

136
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,080
 You may think, no, it's not.

137
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,000
 You may be a leprechaun and you're like, oh, my lights are green.

138
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,400
 Imagine if you woke up in the middle of the night and there was, you shut off all the

139
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,280
 lights and all of these scenarios are terrifying.

140
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,760
 I always make up the scariest.

141
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,880
 Imagine all the lights in your house are off.

142
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,280
 You wake up in the middle of the night and you can see underneath the crack of your bedroom

143
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,880
 door that your hall light's on.

144
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,320
 That'd be spooky.

145
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:48,440
 But imagine, you're like, Jason, no, I don't care what color the light is.

146
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,480
 If I shut them all off, I woke up in the middle of the night and it was a strobe light.

147
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,480
 Well, see, that's the thing.

148
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,600
 It'd be scarier because then you'd think aliens are in my hallway.

149
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:03,080
 If it was a green light coming from underneath your doorway, you would go paranormal.

150
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,920
 If there's a red light, you'd go demons.

151
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,120
 You would associate different light with different phenomenon.

152
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,840
 All of them would be equally terrifying.

153
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,080
 But if you were over at your uncle's house, an unfamiliar house, and there was a green

154
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,000
 glowing light, you'd think, oh, maybe someone has a really bright alarm clock.

155
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 Maybe someone's experimenting with radiated rods nearby.

156
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,560
 But whatever it is, whatever's going on, it's annoying.

157
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,040
 And Fred's trying to sleep and he opens his eyes up and he sees, of course, like he thought

158
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,480
 with his eyes closed.

159
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,760
 The entire living room is bathed in a green glow.

160
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,360
 And then he almost immediately realizes the source of the glow.

161
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,960
 It's not a alarm clock.

162
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,960
 It's not radiation.

163
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,960
 Well, it might be radiation.

164
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,480
 I can't really think about it.

165
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:57,920
 But he realizes, like, he looks around and his eyes settle on that window above the front

166
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,320
 door.

167
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,360
 And what he sees is so impossible.

168
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,760
 He goes, I must just be dreaming.

169
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,760
 That's not possible.

170
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:14,500
 I'm going to go back to sleep.

171
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,600
 So he closes his eyes.

172
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,360
 He holds them tight.

173
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,500
 And the green glow is continuing to permeate his eyelids.

174
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:31,760
 And then he begins to get this sensation that he is being watched.

175
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,880
 That tried and true sensation we've all been through where we feel like someone's watching

176
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,000
 him.

177
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,720
 And now he's like, OK, this isn't fake.

178
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,680
 It's impossible.

179
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,400
 But it's real.

180
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,960
 He kind of takes his eyes.

181
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,080
 He's kind of squinting.

182
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,520
 He's kind of, like, barely looking.

183
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,140
 He doesn't want it to know he's awake.

184
00:08:54,140 --> 00:09:01,580
 Fred does not want this thing to know that he is terrified.

185
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:13,020
 What Fred saw when he first opened his eyes was a massive green eyeball floating outside

186
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,620
 the front door window.

187
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,020
 So the front door itself is what?

188
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,880
 We're talking about six, seven feet tall.

189
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,880
 Six feet tall.

190
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,880
 We've bumped our heads all the time.

191
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,640
 It's about seven, eight feet tall, right?

192
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,960
 So this giant eyeball is floating about nine or 10 feet off the ground.

193
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
 It's giant.

194
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,840
 If it was a normal sized eyeball floating 10 feet off the ground, you're like, ah, whatever.

195
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,480
 I'm trying to attack it with a place water.

196
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,480
 But it's giant.

197
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,340
 It's a giant green floating eyeball.

198
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,440
 It's taking up almost the entire window.

199
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,320
 So you imagine it's floating about nine feet off the ground.

200
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:50,940
 And you could say it's maybe four feet in diameter, maybe a little bit bigger than a

201
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,940
 basketball.

202
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,780
 You're like, what basketball do you play with?

203
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,980
 That's actually huge.

204
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,660
 Four feet in diameter would be a massive basketball.

205
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,500
 The globe trotters are like, ah, yeah, it's funny looking, but we'll hurt our backs if

206
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,140
 we try dribbling that thing.

207
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,180
 Big, big eyeball floating.

208
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,500
 And when he first saw, if you saw a giant eyeball, if you woke him in the middle of

209
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,620
 the night, there's a giant eyeball floating outside your house, you would go, I must be

210
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,840
 dreaming, that's impossible.

211
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,600
 If you saw what looked like an intruder, if he had just seen the green glow, he probably

212
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,560
 would have been more curious of what was out there.

213
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,080
 Giant eyeballs don't exist, but when he tried going back to sleep, when he shut his eyes,

214
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,240
 that's when he felt the eyeball was watching him intently.

215
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,760
 And so Fred is laying on this couch and he has his eyes closed like he's pretending to

216
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,080
 sleep, but he's kind of squinting through them because he wants to like double check.

217
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,080
 Is that what I saw?

218
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,200
 Is there really a giant eyeball out there?

219
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:50,940
 And he said, when I was squinting and I'm looking at the eyeball, the eyeball twitched.

220
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:57,340
 It had a physical reaction as if it knew for a fact that Fred was looking at it.

221
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:00,740
 He said it made a physical movement and I felt now that it knew that not only was I

222
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,100
 awake, but I was steady in it.

223
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,860
 I was trying to figure out what it was.

224
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:10,180
 And Fred just begins screaming at the top of his lungs.

225
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,940
 He's being screaming at the top of his lungs.

226
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:18,640
 He starts the middle of the night and his uncle comes storming down the stairs.

227
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,040
 Not like, oh no, I got to protect this blood of mine.

228
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,760
 I got to protect this nephew.

229
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,760
 He's one of the pack.

230
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,760
 No.

231
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,520
 He hears a little boy screaming and he's pissed off, which is fair, right?

232
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:34,120
 You're not going to assume, oh, the burglar must have gotten into my house and is killing,

233
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,120
 killing my nephew.

234
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,440
 You would be running down the stairs being like, great, I have a little kid over here.

235
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,780
 He's in a new house and something scared him.

236
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,060
 The burglar, the burglar.

237
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:47,740
 Yes, he can be scary kids, but as long as he just steals the stuff we don't use anymore,

238
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,740
 everything's okay.

239
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,940
 Uncle Jack comes downstairs and he's actually really upset because he just woke up.

240
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,940
 He was deep asleep.

241
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,960
 All of a sudden he heard this little kid scream and it's not even yours.

242
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:03,020
 And Uncle Jack enters the room and grumpily says, what is it?

243
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:07,520
 And Jack just points at the window and goes, look.

244
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:12,080
 And Uncle Jack follows the finger and looks at the front door and looks at the window

245
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,840
 and takes a step backwards.

246
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,880
 He's startled by what he sees.

247
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,640
 He has a physical reaction to it.

248
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,920
 This wasn't just the nightmare.

249
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,760
 This wasn't just the hallucination or the trick of the light.

250
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,520
 Uncle Jack sees it too and he steps back.

251
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,320
 Uncle Jack's like, what is that?

252
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,420
 And Fred goes, it looks like an eye.

253
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,940
 And it's still just floating there.

254
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:42,100
 Now there's two witnesses who are watching this phenomenon.

255
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:51,220
 And Uncle Jack, to his credit, walks towards the eye.

256
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,820
 I don't know if I would have done that.

257
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,740
 I might have scooped the kid up and ran upstairs and fucked all the torus.

258
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,180
 I don't know.

259
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,180
 Maybe I would have walked towards the eye.

260
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,800
 Maybe I'm braver than I think.

261
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,240
 But Uncle Jack walks towards the eye and he puts his hand on the door handle and he opens

262
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:18,920
 the door up and right when he does that, the eyeball vanishes.

263
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:26,760
 Uncle Jack shuts the door and then we have probably the most realistic conversation that

264
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,520
 can happen in one of these situations.

265
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,040
 We run into it all the time.

266
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,940
 If you're an experiencer of the paranormal, this is something you run into all the time.

267
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,340
 If you're a fan of paranormal, I'm sure you've read accounts like this as well.

268
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:42,980
 Or wondered, hmm, why did they do that?

269
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,340
 Jengrean eye, floating nine feet off the ground, bathing the entire room in green light.

270
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:51,420
 Two witnesses, an adult and a child in two different parts of the room.

271
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,900
 One's much taller, one's laying down.

272
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,860
 It's not a trick of the lights, not a hallucination, not a dream.

273
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,980
 Jengrean eyeball, door opens up, it disappears.

274
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,720
 Fred goes, what was that?

275
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:09,160
 And Uncle Jack's exact quote, what Fred told us he said was, quote, "I don't know.

276
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,080
 It's gone now.

277
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,440
 It's gone now.

278
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,440
 Go to sleep."

279
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,920
 And then Uncle Jack just left.

280
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:25,040
 Uncle Jack just left the living room, walked up the stairs and went back to his bedroom.

281
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,480
 And Fred was like, dude, I can't do that.

282
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,480
 What are you talking about?

283
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,520
 There's Jengrean eyeball out there.

284
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,260
 And he goes, I spent the rest of the night just looking at the window.

285
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,620
 I couldn't go back to sleep.

286
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,180
 He goes, it never showed back up.

287
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:42,060
 And the next morning, when we were sitting around the breakfast table, I asked my uncle,

288
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,060
 what was that?

289
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,060
 Like, what was up with that giant eyeball that was floating in?

290
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,300
 And Uncle Jack goes, I must have just been a trick of the light.

291
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:54,340
 It must have been something 100% explainable.

292
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,580
 It's interesting because when you do look at accounts of the paranormal, people will

293
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:01,000
 do things, but they'll have these extraordinary events and they'll go back to sleep.

294
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,440
 They'll have these extraordinary events.

295
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,320
 And then they continue about their day.

296
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,760
 They'll go shopping and then they'll come home and then they will hit them.

297
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,580
 The terror, the excitement, whatever they actually went through.

298
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,960
 People act in interesting ways and most of the time, it's avoidance.

299
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,440
 Yeah, it's like, that can't be true.

300
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,240
 And that's what Fred did at first too.

301
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,800
 Remember, he saw it.

302
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,180
 He was deep asleep, saw the green light, then saw the eyeball and goes, I must be dreaming.

303
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,220
 That's not real.

304
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,740
 And then the event intensified from there.

305
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,940
 It was the same thing with Uncle Jack.

306
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,940
 He's like, it was nothing.

307
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:42,140
 Like, even though he clearly saw it and he had a physical reaction to it, like he, it

308
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,140
 scared him.

309
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,660
 He stepped backwards.

310
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:49,380
 He was scared and then he walked to it, opened the door and it went away.

311
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,780
 And his first thing was, I don't know what that was, but it's gone.

312
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:55,920
 Go back to sleep.

313
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,920
 It's super interesting, isn't it?

314
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,440
 It would have been one thing if Fred was the only witness.

315
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,440
 Uncle Jack would be like, just go sleep.

316
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,160
 It was a nightmare and Fred could be like it.

317
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,440
 But to this day, I know it was a nightmare.

318
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,680
 No, there were two witnesses.

319
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,280
 And even though the adult saw it, he goes, whatever, whatever, it's probably some eyeball

320
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,840
 from another dimension.

321
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,320
 Just ignore it.

322
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,400
 And then the next day, he'd completely dismissed it.

323
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,440
 He's definitely the, the uncle's not posting online being like, you won't believe what

324
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,440
 happened.

325
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,580
 I was 30 years old and a giant eyeball.

326
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,960
 No, you just went on with his life.

327
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,660
 Maybe he thought about it later.

328
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,500
 Maybe he didn't.

329
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,340
 And what's interesting too is I found when I was looking more into this, there were a

330
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:39,760
 couple of different people who also described giant floating eyeballs.

331
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:44,860
 You'd see other people comment on the story and one girl said she opened up her closet

332
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,940
 once and there was a giant floating eyeball in her closet.

333
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,240
 Another girl said that she would wake up.

334
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,800
 This one was particularly creepy.

335
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,800
 I mean, no, I'm not like a giant eyeball in her closet is anything to sneeze at or outside

336
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
 your house.

337
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,120
 But she goes, this one seems more malicious.

338
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:06,480
 She goes, I would always sleep with my bedroom door kind of cracked open.

339
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:12,680
 And one night I woke up and there was a giant eyeball floating in the hallway of the house

340
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,540
 that also gave off a green glow.

341
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:20,840
 But she said this one floated in such a way that it looked like it was trying to peek

342
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,920
 over the top of the open bedroom door.

343
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,320
 Like it was making an attempt to spy on her.

344
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:34,240
 Like it was kind of like looking around like a pervert in a Walmart dressing room.

345
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,080
 And the reason why I pointed out, you could go, well, Jason, the first eyeball was looking

346
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,680
 at a sleeping eight year old boy.

347
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,880
 I mean, that's pretty perverted too.

348
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:47,860
 When you have paranormal phenomenon, sometimes it is like my experience with the shadow people,

349
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,700
 the shadow men, I'll put it up in the show notes.

350
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,540
 They were completely aloof.

351
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,700
 They didn't care.

352
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,940
 My experiences with them was they did not care that you were there.

353
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,700
 They didn't care that you observed them.

354
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:05,260
 It was basically the same thing as a squirrel sitting on a rock watching the river.

355
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,980
 The river doesn't care.

356
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,240
 It's simply a phenomenon that it neither hates nor loves the squirrels.

357
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,280
 It's simply happening in this place and time and it's being observed by the squirrel.

358
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:22,000
 So an eyeball floating outside of a house could be a neutral phenomenon.

359
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,760
 It didn't like being looked at for sure and it disappeared when the door opened.

360
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,200
 But that's fairly neutral.

361
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:33,720
 The eyeball kind of angling for a better view of a little girl sleeping in her bedroom.

362
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
 That seems creepy.

363
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,740
 To be fair, they're both creepy, but you know what I mean?

364
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:42,860
 One of them, the one floating in the closet, that seems fairly neutral, a neutral phenomenon.

365
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:48,060
 Then you can have helpful paranormal phenomenon, which I think happens so often we don't even

366
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,900
 recognize it.

367
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,460
 Sometimes it's super dramatic and we'll talk about guardian angels, but I think sometimes

368
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:58,100
 it's just you see something, you walk down the road and you see something that makes

369
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,100
 you smile.

370
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:04,060
 You see giant green eyeball being dribbled by the Harlem Globetrotters and you're like,

371
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:10,760
 "I think sometimes good paranormal events are so minor they just kind of lighten our mood."

372
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,520
 You get home and your favorite television show, you didn't miss a minute of it, right?

373
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,600
 When you got home, "Jason, no one does that anymore, you boomer."

374
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,960
 We all watch stuff on streaming.

375
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,960
 You know what I mean?

376
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,600
 I'm sure there are little paranormal things that happen quite often that we just account

377
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,920
 to luck or being like, "Wow, everything just kind of worked out.

378
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:32,320
 I think you could qualify that stuff as good paranormal, evil paranormal stuff obviously,

379
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,420
 you know, murders, people getting chopped up by demons, people falling deeper and deeper

380
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:41,580
 into addictions or depression and completely destroying their lives and the lives of their

381
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,580
 family, all that stuff.

382
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,720
 That would be more of the negative.

383
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,740
 Even I think a spooky ghost floating around your house, they don't, he's like, "I'm sorry

384
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,740
 to make you aeronetic.

385
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,740
 I'm just a spooky ghost.

386
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,780
 You have such high standards, Jason.

387
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:59,540
 I just wanted to float around and be spooky and now I got to take you down to the casino

388
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,480
 and you sit in front of a slot machine for 10 hours, dude.

389
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,560
 You can have just spooky ghosts, spooky noises, things to scare you and then things that actually

390
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,060
 ruin your life.

391
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:14,760
 Yeah, but again, I think it's interesting because the glowing green eye, how malicious

392
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,600
 is it and how widespread is it too?

393
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,240
 It's really interesting when someone comes out and says, "Hey, here's the story I have."

394
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,080
 And then you see other people talk about it.

395
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,520
 Some of them could be made up because they're kind of hanging on to the story, but some

396
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,680
 of them, a story like this, like again, we talk about this all the time, they show where

397
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,680
 to classify it.

398
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,660
 It's not a ghost, it's not a UFO, it's not a cryptid.

399
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,380
 There's dedicated organizations for those.

400
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:41,020
 So if you see an alien kill your dog, like we talked about on Friday and Monday's episode,

401
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,380
 you contact MUFON.

402
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:46,020
 If you see Bigfoot, you contact the Bigfoot Research Group.

403
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:53,140
 If you see a ghost, you contact ghost researchers, but who do you call for a giant green eyeball?

404
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,140
 So who knows how common this is?

405
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,920
 Probably not super common, but it may have happened more than just a few times it was

406
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,920
 posted here.

407
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,720
 And Fred went online by the name FitzyTheArtist.

408
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,720
 That was the name they posted this on.

409
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,160
 I wanted to give them credit for that.

410
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:12,640
 But interesting story, what is the phenomenon and is it going to be watching you tonight?

411
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,080
 Like, I hope so.

412
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,760
 You buy some new underwear, you're like getting all sexy before bed, you're like, "Oh, I have

413
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,880
 that green eye spies on me."

414
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,260
 Lazy A farms will do it and leave all these perverts, leave all these eyeball perverts

415
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,260
 behind.

416
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,980
 The rest of you get on board the world of famous carbonar copter at Lazy A farms.

417
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,780
 I'm going to touch you the keys, catch them in your corn stock.

418
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,740
 We are leaving behind Uncle Jack's house.

419
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:43,780
 Take us all the way out to a road.

420
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,260
 The whole time he's like, "This road is like, no, no, not that road."

421
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,660
 We're going to a specific road.

422
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,940
 We're going to a specific road.

423
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:54,200
 In another story, we don't have a location for or a time.

424
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,000
 And this story might pull on your heartstrings a little bit.

425
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,160
 So if you're currently going through a bout of depression, be warned.

426
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,680
 Also if you love talks, like Jason, what is it?

427
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,280
 Just got done with closing counters of a canine kind of week.

428
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,960
 Let's take a look at this story.

429
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,120
 I find this story beautiful.

430
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,720
 But let's take a look at it.

431
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,720
 It doesn't start off beautiful.

432
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,120
 It starts off quite grim.

433
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,980
 We're going to take a look at Joey's family.

434
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,900
 All these names, except for the dog's name.

435
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,900
 The dog's name is real.

436
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,540
 But all these names we've had to create are supposed to be anonymously.

437
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,940
 Joey tells this story.

438
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:38,740
 He said, "One day my stepdad, Phillip, was driving down the road and he sees a little

439
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,660
 lump on the side of the road."

440
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,780
 A little lump.

441
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,100
 He's like, "Oh, that's my favorite.

442
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,700
 That's my favorite Fergie song."

443
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,580
 He's all humming it as he's walking up to the lump.

444
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,360
 He's like, "My humby, humby, humbs.

445
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,360
 My lumps.

446
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,360
 My lovely lady."

447
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,240
 And then he looks and the lump, it's not a lovely lady lump, although that would be

448
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,240
 disgusting too.

449
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,520
 There's just a boob sitting on the side of the road.

450
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,040
 He's like, "Ah, that's not what I expected either."

451
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:07,200
 What he sees is a puppy.

452
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,840
 But this puppy's not in good shape.

453
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:18,400
 This puppy, because you're my friend, I'm not going to go into detail.

454
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,660
 But apparently what it seemed like, okay, I'm not going to tell you that, just the puppy

455
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,420
 is not in good shape.

456
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:29,500
 And Phillip goes, "Philip's all set in imagining in great detail.

457
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,500
 What could have happened?"

458
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,100
 And he's like, "I'm not going to tell anyone that."

459
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:36,820
 Phillip takes the dog to the vet and he goes, "Hey, this isn't my dog.

460
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,220
 I found him by the side of the road."

461
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,500
 And the vet's like, "Dear God, you know what happened to this dog?"

462
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,500
 And he starts talking about it.

463
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,380
 And Phillip's like, "I don't know.

464
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,340
 Just fix the dog.

465
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,600
 Just fix this dog, please."

466
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,480
 And the vet goes, "We will rebuild this dog."

467
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,480
 And so they did.

468
00:23:53,480 --> 00:24:00,880
 They spent a lot of money, but Eddie was ready to go.

469
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,240
 They were like, "Back to the road, buddy."

470
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,240
 He's like, "Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff."

471
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,680
 And they named this puppy Eddie and Phillip goes, "You know what?

472
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,760
 We did spend a lot of money on this dog.

473
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,760
 Let's take him home.

474
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,360
 Let's consider him an investment.

475
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,920
 I'll write him off for my taxes."

476
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:21,020
 Let's bring good old Eddie home.

477
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:27,340
 So they take Eddie home and at this time Joey is a little boy.

478
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:31,620
 And Joey and Eddie kind of start growing up alongside each other going on little adventures.

479
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,540
 He's like, "You want to go for a walk down the road?"

480
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:38,020
 And he's like, "Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff in."

481
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,020
 And they're like, "What?

482
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,220
 I know you can talk."

483
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,020
 Joey and Eddie are growing up together.

484
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:47,400
 But Eddie, although he loves hanging out with everyone, he is Phillip's dog.

485
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,080
 He loves Phillip so much.

486
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:56,240
 And Joey goes, "We all had our time to sit and pet Eddie, chase him around."

487
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,800
 Eddie is constantly hanging out with Phillip.

488
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:03,320
 And wherever you found Phillip, you found Eddie right next to him.

489
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,680
 It was like a true bond.

490
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,000
 But everyone, it wasn't like he growled at everybody else.

491
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,800
 But you know, Phillip comes home from work and a little puppy's walking next to him.

492
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,020
 He was to have the coal mine too.

493
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,940
 He has a little hat, a little hard hat on.

494
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,260
 His face is all dirty.

495
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,980
 When Phillip comes home from work, Eddie runs up to him, sits in his lap.

496
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,660
 And they sit there and they watch the news together.

497
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,500
 Price is right, whatever.

498
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,500
 And that's just life.

499
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,500
 That's life for Eddie.

500
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,500
 He's found his home.

501
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,660
 He's found his family.

502
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:34,980
 He's found his dad, Phillip.

503
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,540
 Little Eddie loves this family.

504
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:42,180
 And Joey eventually, it's time for him to go to college.

505
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:49,440
 And when Joey is at college, he gets a phone call from his mom saying Eddie passed away

506
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,320
 last night.

507
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:55,800
 And obviously Joey's heart broken, right?

508
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,200
 Like, this was like a member of the family.

509
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,680
 He grew up with Joey.

510
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:04,480
 And in the back of his mind, he's thinking, "Oh my God, what about my stepdad?"

511
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,920
 Like, "It hurts me.

512
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:13,540
 It hurts my heart that Eddie has passed, but I can't imagine what my stepdad's gone through.

513
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:16,100
 Like, it was like, he rescued this puppy.

514
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:19,580
 This puppy was going to die.

515
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,380
 And my dad just happened to pull over and pick him up and not only save his life, but

516
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:27,900
 then bring him home and make him part of our life.

517
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,540
 And Joey says, "This happened so suddenly."

518
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,420
 Him dying and then being buried in the Pet Cemetery.

519
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,880
 He goes, "I felt like I didn't have a chance to say goodbye.

520
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,560
 I definitely didn't get a chance to be with him in his final moments."

521
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:45,520
 And he doesn't say how Eddie died, but you know, probably natural causes.

522
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,680
 I think he would have included if he involved a road.

523
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,920
 But anyways, he just says that Eddie passes away.

524
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,920
 And it all happened so quickly.

525
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:00,080
 He didn't get to say goodbye to Eddie either while he was getting sicker or even after,

526
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,560
 you know, like at the funeral ceremony for the dog and all that stuff.

527
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:08,820
 So he felt that he had lost something when, a piece of the grieving process.

528
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:14,420
 Joey felt like he wasn't, he wasn't part of that, you know.

529
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:22,860
 He said a few months later though, Joey's still in college and he has a dream.

530
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:28,860
 He has a dream that he's standing outside in a fairly unfamiliar place.

531
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:33,700
 He just knows that it's this outside location.

532
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,300
 And there's this trail.

533
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:42,740
 And trotting down the trail is Eddie.

534
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:46,060
 And he sees Eddie come towards him and he's so relieved.

535
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:49,300
 He's like, "Eddie, oh my God, oh, I've missed you so much."

536
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:56,060
 And he looks down and Eddie is a little worse for wear.

537
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,360
 But he's happy.

538
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,660
 His tail is wagging.

539
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:03,520
 He's doing a little puppy dance.

540
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:09,020
 His hair is matted and dirty.

541
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:15,260
 And as Joey is petting Eddie, he realizes that Eddie's flesh is also a little rotten.

542
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:20,740
 I probably, I probably stopped petting him at that point.

543
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,620
 Dream or no dream.

544
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:27,820
 But he realizes like what he's looking at is Eddie is dead, even in the dream.

545
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:33,880
 But Eddie is so happy and so excited it doesn't matter.

546
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,880
 Joey's going to take this moment to be with Eddie just a little bit longer.

547
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,680
 And they begin walking down this trail.

548
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:44,960
 And the whole time Eddie is just wagging his little tail.

549
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,460
 So happy.

550
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:51,400
 He's back with his buddy Joey, his brother Joey.

551
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,960
 And Joey said, "The farther we got down the trail, the more excited Eddie got."

552
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:02,360
 He's started prancing a little bit more, tail wagging even more.

553
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:07,120
 So excited to be on this journey with Joey.

554
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:14,140
 Until eventually they come to this giant wall of mist.

555
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:17,280
 Joey said that it covered the entire horizon.

556
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,280
 You could look both ways.

557
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,900
 It would go on forever.

558
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:25,640
 And when he looked up he saw it reached far past the sky.

559
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:31,120
 The wall of mist was silent, peaceful.

560
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,120
 There was a beauty to this barrier.

561
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:41,760
 But Joey knew that this was the end of the trip.

562
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:50,880
 Eddie walks up to the wall of mist and then turns around and walks back to Joey.

563
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,640
 Joey reaches down to pet Eddie again.

564
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:58,240
 Eddie just licks Joey's hand.

565
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,040
 Joey picks up Eddie.

566
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:04,240
 They do a couple little nose kisses.

567
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,600
 And he sets Eddie back on the ground.

568
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:17,480
 And Eddie begins to whine just a little bit, just for a moment.

569
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:23,880
 Eddie looks back up at Joey, walks back towards the wall of mist.

570
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,680
 And as he gets to the mist he begins doing his little happy dog dance again.

571
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:33,040
 His little prance that Joey had seen so many times before.

572
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:38,680
 In the moments when Eddie was the happiest he would do this little dance.

573
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:45,360
 Eddie walks through the wall of mist to the point that now it's just a silhouette of a

574
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,240
 dog.

575
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:53,680
 All detail has been lost to the fog.

576
00:30:53,680 --> 00:31:01,360
 This little dog is dancing around in the mist and begins jumping up and down as a humanoid

577
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,040
 silhouette shows up.

578
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:14,800
 Joey sees Eddie jump up and down as this shadowy apparition appears next to him.

579
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:19,960
 Joey takes a step forward himself.

580
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:30,800
 He wants to see what's beyond the mist, what's on the other side of this unending wall.

581
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:39,800
 He reaches out and he puts his hand against the mist.

582
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,520
 And his cell phone goes off.

583
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,960
 He wakes up, his cell phone's ringing.

584
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:53,120
 He reaches over, looks at the number, answers the call.

585
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,920
 It's his mother.

586
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,040
 She's sobbing.

587
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:07,400
 Phillip just died of a heart attack.

588
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:15,840
 It's a fascinating on so many levels it has what we expect from a traditional ghost story.

589
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,360
 It has all of these elements in it.

590
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,800
 The idea of dreaming of a dead loved one coming back to visit you one last time.

591
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,960
 Very traditional ghost experience.

592
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,440
 We've had a couple stories this week.

593
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,000
 I didn't plan it this way.

594
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,480
 I definitely didn't plan all the dead dogs in the past two weeks.

595
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:38,480
 But we covered the boss at the work site.

596
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,400
 Nobody knew he died but they saw his ghost.

597
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,800
 The story has that element as well.

598
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:50,040
 The implication is that the humanoid figure on the other side of the mist was Phillip.

599
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,480
 It's never explicitly said but I think that's the implication.

600
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:58,320
 That was this dream and Eddie was going.

601
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,880
 He was excited for multiple reasons to see Joey again but Eddie also was there to walk

602
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,920
 with Phillip in the afterlife.

603
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:15,040
 They were inseparable and now they would be together in paradise.

604
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,520
 This is one of those stories.

605
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,520
 When you look at it, when you look at this person's posting history, they haven't posted

606
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,720
 in a long time.

607
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,880
 But it's not a ton of spooky stories.

608
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,880
 It's not a ton of...

609
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,880
 Actually it's zero.

610
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,880
 This is the only one.

611
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,200
 Otherwise they're just constantly walking around Reddit.

612
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,720
 Every so often they're in a subreddit called "RetKond" which is actually a new version

613
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,720
 of the Mandela effect.

614
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,400
 I've been spending a lot of time on that subreddit.

615
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,200
 There's some interesting stuff coming out of there.

616
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,560
 But you know what I mean?

617
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,520
 He's not on the creepypasta subreddit.

618
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:49,160
 He's not like "and then the next day Eddie returned and he had a watch, a magical watch

619
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,120
 that allowed him to control a UFO.

620
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,640
 He's not constantly adding to the narrative.

621
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:58,160
 It could be made up but it's also possibly true in the world of the paranormal.

622
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,600
 Nothing in the story is out of place.

623
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,760
 For the most part it just seems like a traditional ghost story.

624
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:14,560
 And it's one that I think depending on your point of view is either sweet or sad.

625
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,640
 Because I think you can hear the story and go "well that's just so sad that you know

626
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:22,000
 like Eddie and Philip are dead" or any story involving a dead dog is sad.

627
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,880
 I don't know why you can't get that through your head Jason.

628
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,880
 Listen I love dogs.

629
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,720
 I don't eat dogs.

630
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,000
 I think the story is sweet.

631
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,280
 I think the story is sweet.

632
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:38,640
 I think the story is a reminder that death is not the end.

633
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,360
 I think that's the reason the appeal of a lot of ghost stories.

634
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,520
 I think even when they come back as monsters, they're like "death is not the end and I'm

635
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,880
 gonna haunt you until you're death and then I'm gonna keep haunting you because death

636
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:54,880
 is not the end and I'm gonna bully you in the afterlife as well" you're like "ugh".

637
00:34:54,880 --> 00:35:00,640
 You know what I mean like to know that there's something after this.

638
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,760
 I think it's a sweet.

639
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,880
 I think it's an endearing thought.

640
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:07,880
 I think it's calming in a way.

641
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,000
 And I know there's not everyone's like that.

642
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,480
 Some people go "I think it's more intriguing to think that this is all that there is and

643
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,960
 when you die it's over."

644
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,800
 I mean to each their own.

645
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,160
 But and they may hear this story and they may go "well it's really the story about a

646
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,800
 kid whose dog died and then his stepdad died and everything else was a hallucination.

647
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,240
 Everything else was just a dream."

648
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,560
 Jason this whole thing took place in the dream.

649
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,960
 Like what's the paranormal aspect?

650
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,680
 It's funny now that I say that the only paranormal aspect of the dream is the fact that he knew

651
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:46,040
 well actually okay this is super interesting because this is part of this.

652
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,040
 This show has no script.

653
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,680
 If you guys haven't guessed that, thinking about it this way and I could go on forever

654
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,600
 so we're gonna have to wrap this up because I just thought of this.

655
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:59,160
 There is no element in this story that is paranormal.

656
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,960
 Zero.

657
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,960
 Not saying that it has to be.

658
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,680
 Someone's like "oh no my kid died" I was like "well but did they get killed by a

659
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,680
 ghost?"

660
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,040
 They're like "no" I was like "ah don't tell me about it."

661
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:14,640
 I was reporting on it as a paranormal story and I made all of these.

662
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:21,680
 The way I read it was it was the ghost of Eddie coming back to say goodbye to Joey one

663
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:28,360
 more time and then led Joey to the wall that separates the world of the living and the

664
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:33,480
 world of the dead and on the other side of that wall was now Eddie and then a humanoid

665
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:40,760
 figure appeared who Joey at no point, I'm gonna double check because I don't even know

666
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,600
 if he specifically says "I think that was my stepdad."

667
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,560
 Let me double check that here.

668
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,880
 It says then he turns around again and starts to do that happy dog prance toward the wall

669
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,760
 until he finally passes through it.

670
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,680
 I can sort of see his outline jumping up and down excitedly next to a human shaped figure.

671
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,160
 I jog after Eddie and reach my hand out to touch the wall hoping I'll be able to pass

672
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,160
 through it too.

673
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,040
 That's when my cell phone rings in real life waking me up.

674
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,640
 When I answer it my mom is on the other end crying.

675
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,800
 My stepdad has just died of a heart attack.

676
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,560
 So he never even makes that claim.

677
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:21,400
 And that interesting, the way I read the story was that the dog had come back from the afterlife

678
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:30,240
 to greet, say goodbye to Joey and then Phillip showed up and was on the other side of this

679
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,320
 wall and that's why Eddie was doing such a little happy dance.

680
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,120
 And then Joey wakes up and finds out that his stepdad is just out of a heart attack.

681
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:47,240
 And this is interesting because as a paranormal guy, as a paranormal researcher, I defaulted

682
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:56,840
 to that because it had so many hallmarks of a paranormal story.

683
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,280
 But it wasn't a paranormal story.

684
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,680
 Was it just a dream?

685
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,400
 Could you argue the humanoid figure wasn't him knowing in advance even just by a few

686
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,520
 seconds that his stepdad was going to die?

687
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,480
 Like I'm assuming the stepdad died, the mom wasn't calling him as he was having a heart

688
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,480
 attack.

689
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,280
 I'm assuming the stepdad had died and the ambulance just picked him up and all that stuff and

690
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,480
 then they get the phone call.

691
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,000
 But who knows?

692
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,320
 It's an interesting story now to think about it.

693
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,080
 It may be a paranormal story of ghosts and premonitions of death, even if it's just by

694
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,080
 a couple seconds, a couple minutes before that phone call, right?

695
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,080
 It's still a premonition.

696
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:35,880
 It could be a story of that or it could just be the story of a dream.

697
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,320
 And the humanoid figure on the other side of the wall was not Philip.

698
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,480
 It was just another guardian spirit there with Eddie.

699
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,480
 That's super interesting.

700
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,480
 That's just, I think, looking on that, that's an insight into how I read things, my psyche,

701
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,480
 right?

702
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:55,080
 It was posted, someone asked the question, "What is the most paranormal or unexplainable

703
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,560
 event you have ever witnessed?"

704
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,960
 And people were responding to that question.

705
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,160
 So it wasn't unexplainable.

706
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,320
 You could say it was unexplained.

707
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,560
 You could say it was paranormal.

708
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:11,320
 My view on life after death, which I believe in, if you asked me what exactly is that,

709
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,320
 I don't know.

710
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,840
 Like, I don't know.

711
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,920
 I don't know how it works.

712
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,360
 I don't know if it's reincarnation.

713
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:21,120
 I don't know if it's heaven, like a literal place called heaven, if it's some sort of

714
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,280
 paradise world.

715
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,280
 Who knows?

716
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,780
 I don't know.

717
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:29,420
 But so this story, I read it and I go, "Oh, these are the things that I already think

718
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,420
 about the after."

719
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,160
 There's going to be a lot of dancing dogs.

720
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,720
 That better be.

721
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,960
 Fascinating story, though.

722
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:40,280
 Ghost story, unexplained event, or just simply a dream that I've read.

723
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,800
 Not only did I read too much into it, but I told it in such a way that led it to maybe

724
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,760
 you also going, "Oh, this is about ghosts."

725
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,060
 I think I even said in the beginning, this ghost brings home, opens a portal to the other

726
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,240
 world or whatever it said in the beginning.

727
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,240
 So that's interesting.

728
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,840
 I almost feel like this is a meta commentary.

729
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,880
 How did you experience that story?

730
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:04,400
 Because the whole time you think, "Oh, it's just a dream," or, "Oh, Jason's making a joke

731
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,560
 about dogs on roads again.

732
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,560
 Come on, dude."

733
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,520
 Just tell the story, but fascinating.

734
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,320
 And it shows kind of my view of the world and how I can lead.

735
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:17,280
 Like again, if you weren't predisposed, I don't want to get too meta, but if you weren't

736
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,200
 going to be predisposed to hearing that story and thinking it the way I did, did I tell

737
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,600
 it in such a way that you didn't have an option?

738
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,600
 That's all real fascinating stuff.

739
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,240
 But not as to me, not as fascinating as the story.

740
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,360
 I really love the story of Eddie and Phillip.

741
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:37,320
 And it's a story that love lives on even after death.

742
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,400
 Love does not die with death.

743
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,760
 I truly do believe that.

744
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:48,480
 And so does Eddie.
