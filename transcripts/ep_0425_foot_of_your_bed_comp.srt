1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 A ghost story from Colonial Delaware that proves bullying is universal.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 A truly terrifying story involving a... I don't know.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 And then we take a look at an interesting new theory.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 Is it possible that Donald Trump's space force isn't just the sixth branch of the US military,

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 but an opening shot in the war against aliens today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 I'm a walkie-talkie. Actually, I'm a walkie-talkie.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. We got a lot of stuff to cover today,

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 so we gotta just jump right into this.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 First off, let's give a shout out to our latest Patreon spiritual abortion.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Spiritual? He actually belonged to Patreon a while back,

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 dropped out for a bit, and then came back.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Guys, listen, I know money gets tight. I know there's other stuff going on.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 I don't take it personally when he stopped donating to the Patreon.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 I appreciate every amount of support I get. Patreon or not.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 If you guys can kick down some cash, totally awesome.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 And if you can't, just support the show by getting the word out there.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Helps out a lot. It helps so much spreading the word.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 So spiritual, fire up that carbonicopter, and guys, I hope you guys got your old-timey clothes on.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 We're going back to colonial Delaware.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 So that's, you know, colonial times is when Americans, just like leprechauns,

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 with the big, like, buckles on their shoes, except we were all black and white,

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 and then, like, had the big knee-high socks.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Like, they probably went up further than their knees, right?

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 They probably were, like, thigh-highs.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 And then, I sound a little too excited when I said that, I'm like, "Ooh, I get to wear thigh-high socks."

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Then you got, like, the short pants.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Am I describing a leprechaun at this point?

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Pilgrims dressed like that, too, right?

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 The snazzy lip. Why did they dress like leprechauns?

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Now that I think about it, maybe because they were wishing for religious freedom.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Huh? Ooh. Just came up with that one.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 I don't know if that was a joke or a political statement. We'll just say both.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 So we're dressed like leprechauns, but we're wearing all black.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Women, you look lovely in your eight layers of cloth dress.

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 We're walking-- We have to be innocuous, right?

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 We're walking through Dover, Delaware.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 The year is 1740s, and we're just kind of walking around.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 I just keep going, "Witch! Witch!" I keep pointing at random people.

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 That person's a witch!

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Watching them get carted off.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 [laughs]

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 You're like, "Jason, that's horrible."

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 I'm like, "Yeah, yeah."

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Anyways, so after all the witch trials are done and everyone's found innocent,

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 and I've changed my disguise so no one knows I was accusing them,

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 let's commence with this story.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 In the 1740s, there was a man.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 He was Chief Justice Samuel Chu.

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Now, we don't have a lot of information on him.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 He actually was a real person, and I'm sure if I went to, like, the Dover, Delaware State Library,

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 there's probably, like, a bust of him or something like that.

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Like, I probably could get more information, but the Wikipedia page is pretty sparse,

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 and a lot of the legend, a lot of his stuff is really connected to this legend.

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 But people didn't like-- What's funny is I can't tell if people didn't like him,

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 or if everyone in the town was a jerk.

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Because he's, like, the Chief Justice, so I guess most people don't like judges.

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Most people don't like police officers, stuff like that.

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 So maybe he did. Maybe he was accusing everyone of being witches, and they were all mad at him.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 People would walk by him all the time and go, "Oh, Chu!"

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 And then kind of look at him. Maybe, like, "Get it? Get it? Because your last name's Chu?"

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 And he's like, "What?"

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 "Someone else would be walking down the street."

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 "Uh-huh, Chu! Haha, like, your name!"

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 And that was the joke in town.

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 So, I mean, listen, you may not have a lot of respect for law and order,

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 but openly making fun of a judge probably isn't a smart thing to do.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 I almost got arrested for... What's that thing called when you're messing around in a trial and court?

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Um, not... The order in the court is what they say on television.

71
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 But what do they say... What's it called when you're, like, goofing off?

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Um, they don't tell you, "Hey, you knucklehead! Quit messing around!"

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 It was a murder trial. My cousin was on trial for murder.

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 The, um... Dang it, what's that called?

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Anyways, I was talking to him during the trial, and you're not supposed to do that.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 And so the bailiff, it was me and my cousin, said...

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 We gave him words of encouragement as they were getting ready to, like, get it over.

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Contempt of court! That was it!

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Super emotional time, you know?

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 My cousin, you know, do that I deeply, deeply love and still love to this day is on trial for murder.

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 He... I go, "I love you!" and I say his name, and then my other cousin's like, "Stay strong!"

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 And he says his name, and we're leaving, and the bailiff comes out and he goes,

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 "You guys, we could get you for contempt of court right now."

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 "We can get you for contempt of court right now."

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 If you do that again, you guys are going to jail, and we're just like, whatever.

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 We didn't say whatever to the bailiff. We both kind of turned away and go, whatever.

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 We didn't hear us.

88
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 But then, like, maybe a week or two after my cousin's trial, I got called for jury duty,

89
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 and I got called to that same judge's chamber, and I was like, "Oh, this isn't going to go over well."

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 So I'm... because I stay... I only missed one day of my cousin's trial. He was found guilty.

91
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 He's 17 to life right now, but he's... I was walking into the...

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Walking into her jury room, or her courtroom, and the bailiff stopped.

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 "Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing there?" Because he doesn't know why I'm back.

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 You know, I could be some lunatic or something like that.

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 I showed him my paperwork. I said, "Hey, man, I got called for jury duty like a month ago,"

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 and I was... you know, I knew this was coming. I figured this might happen.

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 And the bailiff's like, "You're not coming in here. Let me go talk."

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 And he comes back, goes, talks to the judge lady, and comes back to me, and he's like,

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 "You're not in this trial?" And I go, "I figured that."

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 And he goes, "Well, go do a civil trial."

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Because they knew there was no way I could really be fair at that moment for a criminal trial,

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 having to do all that stuff. But anyways, you're not gonna...

103
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 That was kind of a side story there, but you're not gonna openly, like...

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 Again, you're gonna go, whatever, and the bailiff could have busted us right there.

105
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 I think it was the first day of trial, and emotions were really high, and the judge was probably like,

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 "Give him a warning, but you can't mouth off in court."

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Now, you also really can't mouth off in the public square, either if I saw that judge or that bailiff,

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 or any buddy just walking down the street a couple weeks later, I can't make fun of them.

109
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 You can, you have the right to, but you're probably gonna get knocked on the head,

110
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 or that, you know, gets at the very least a warning, maybe some trumped-up charges. Who knows?

111
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 So the fact that people were actively... And I think, to me, it seems like the judicial system

112
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 was more strict back then. Back then, they were killing people, 'cause they thought you had sex with a pig.

113
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 We covered that, an ugly pig was born, and they killed the pig and killed this dude. We covered that about a week ago.

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 So, no, I mean, you definitely don't want to be making fun of the, fun of judges, 'cause they'll just be like,

115
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 "Oh, look at this disgusting pig I found. Draws a little mustache on it. It has a mustache, just like you."

116
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 You're like, "No!" So, the fact that everyone in town was making fun of this dude is bizarre, right?

117
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 They're just openly mocking him. Well, he ends up, he gets nominated for Chief Justice in 1741, but he dies just three years later.

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 So, it wasn't a long period of time where he, I guess any amount of time everyone in town making fun of you is too long,

119
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 but 1741 to 1744, he ends up passing away. But, not long afterwards, so you have the green, which is kind of the common area,

120
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 and there's a poplar tree kind of poking out of the ground. That's what trees tend to do, right? They don't hover four feet horizontally.

121
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 It's sprouted, it's grown from a seed. This man is walking by late at night, walking by the poplar tree,

122
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 and he sees the unmistakable image of Judge Chu standing underneath the tree.

123
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 "Race is home," tells his wife. The story spreads through town. "I saw the judge last night."

124
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 "I saw the judge." That sounds like a country song, dude. "I saw the judge last night."

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 "I saw the judge. He gave me 20 years for being too nice to his wife." Okay, that's my country style freestyle.

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 You like that? I don't know if it'll survive the editing process.

127
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Anyways, everyone in town is talking about Judge Chu being underneath his tree. A couple nights later, someone else is walking home late at night.

128
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Judge Chu sitting under the tree. Now, here's the thing. What's spooky is not only--

129
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 It's spooky because there's a ghost, right? But it's a ghost everyone made fun of, to his face.

130
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Like, if a ghost showed up of a guy, it was like, "Oh, that's Jason's ghost." Jason's a really nice guy. He's a pretty cool dude, right?

131
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 My ghost is floating around. People would be like, "Oh, it's going to be a Casper ghost. It's going to be a very friendly guy."

132
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 If Osama be a lotten's ghost is floating through your neighborhood, you're going to be a little more concerned, right?

133
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 You're going to be just a tad bit more concerned than if some goofy podcast host's ghost is floating around.

134
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 But everyone in town made fun of Judge Chu to his face. And how was ghost is showing up?

135
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 They don't know what to do. But Judge Chu knows what to do.

136
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 Remember, this is the common area. This is the center of town. Pretty much to get from point A to point B, you have to pass the commons.

137
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 So, people-- Men start walking down the street late at night. They were doing it before. It wasn't like, "Oh, there's a ghost? I'm going to start walking down the street."

138
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Obviously, these streets were well-traveled. But what started happening is men would be walking down the street and their coattails would be pulled.

139
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Whoa! What the-- Let me take another couple. Whoa!

140
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 They could feel their coattails being pulled. Now that I think about it, pilgrims were like, "Good 200 years before these guys."

141
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 So they're not dressed like leprechauns at this point. Or wait, are they? It doesn't matter. It has nothing to do with the story.

142
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Leprechauns can have coattails, too. The men keep getting their coattails pulled.

143
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Now, at this point, the women must be thinking, "Good thing I'm not a man. Good thing I'm not wearing coattails."

144
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 And that's when the men were like, "Yeah, good thing you're not a man. Just wait till what happens to you."

145
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 Because what was happening to the women was they would be walking around and they would feel a cold grass on their warm flesh.

146
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 Turn around, there'd be nothing there.

147
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 Now, if I had a choice between having an article of my clothing slightly tugged or feeling the icy clinch of death on my bare skin, I'm wearing coattails.

148
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 I'm sure a lot of women were buying jackets with coattails and drawn a little mustache on.

149
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 They're like, "Nope, I'm just a man. I'm gonna go drink a bunch of mead and do a buckle dance with my shoes."

150
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 Because there's no way you'd want to feel that touch on your skin.

151
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 It got so bad and the ghost was seen so often and it was attacking really so many people.

152
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 The town started a curfew.

153
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 It's basically the coronavirus of Dover, Delaware in 1740s.

154
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Because what are you going to do? You're either like, "We can practice social distancing."

155
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 I.E. stay away from the ghost or we can just quarantine ourselves in our house until hopefully the ghost just disappears, right?

156
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Businesses started shutting down when the sun set.

157
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 It became a ghost, a literal ghost town because now it's run by a ghost.

158
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 People started going, "I'm a bar owner. I can't stay shut at night. That's when people drink."

159
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 Because that way they can sneak in and out and no one can see that they're drinking.

160
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 People are like, "We can't live in fear."

161
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 So how do we get rid of an old-timey ghost?

162
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 There's some old British dude popping on his pipe.

163
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 He goes, "I know of a way."

164
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 Also I'm a pirate all of a sudden.

165
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 In the old country, which it's 1744 so all countries are old countries, but I'm talking about Britain.

166
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 We have a tradition.

167
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 It's called a funeral for a ghost.

168
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 They're like, "Stop popping that pipe and just tell the story."

169
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Okay, it's a funeral for a ghost.

170
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 What we do is we hold the most lavish funeral possible so the ghost knows that he is loved.

171
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 And it's time for him to go on.

172
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 So the town does that.

173
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 The town holds this massive festival.

174
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 I don't know if they have games, parlor games.

175
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Don't the dead judge. It's just like an empty booth.

176
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 People are throwing beanbags at it.

177
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 But they had a giant funeral.

178
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 They had all of the foods and the big old casket and everything.

179
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 I guess that makes it sound like it's actually a funeral for a giant, the big old casket.

180
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 It's a regular size casket.

181
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 The point is that the celebration was overly large.

182
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 And everyone wanted to let the judge know.

183
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 No hard feelings.

184
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Please quit damning us to an eternal night of terror.

185
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 We miss you. We love you. We're sorry we made fun of you.

186
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 Let's have a lavish funeral for someone who was a member of the public, public leader.

187
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 And after this funeral, the ghost disappeared.

188
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Men and women could walk down the streets without being attacked by a ghost at least.

189
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 I can't guarantee their safety from any other maniac in town.

190
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 But the ghost was no longer attacking them.

191
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 People would walk by the commons late at night and look at the poplar tree just to see.

192
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 There'd be nothing there.

193
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 And that is the end.

194
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 Or is it?

195
00:13:49,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Because later, when the story of Judge Chu just became a legend, memories of the lavish funeral just became a memory.

196
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 The ghost reappeared under that tree.

197
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 And some say is still there today.

198
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 It's a local legend in Dover, Delaware.

199
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 The ghost of Judge Chu is underneath the poplar tree.

200
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 But the funeral does seem to have satiated his need for tugging on shirts and grabbing women.

201
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 Because he no longer leaves that tree. He no longer assaults people.

202
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 He just stands there and looks at them from the shadows.

203
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Which is terrifying.

204
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 But apparently that funeral made him realize that people really did like him or something.

205
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 I don't actually know what the funeral would have said in his head.

206
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 But it worked. He stopped attacking people.

207
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 But he's still there.

208
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 So a win? I would count that as a win, right?

209
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 Anyways, creepy story.

210
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 I think it's an interesting story because one we always hear stories about like, a ghost gets killed and he comes back for vengeance.

211
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 This guy just got made fun of for three years.

212
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 And then he basically started attacking people as a ghost.

213
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Quite quaint old ghost story.

214
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 So if you live in Dover, Delaware, I dare you tonight to break quarantine.

215
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Watch, I get some sort of federal trouble.

216
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Insighting a riot. Insighting a one-man riot.

217
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 If you live in Dover, Delaware, I implore you.

218
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Allegedly, I'm not actually saying this.

219
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 This is a deep, fake voice thing.

220
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Break quarantine tonight and go sit under the poplar tree.

221
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 But make sure there's six feet between you and the tree itself.

222
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 Or you might find yourself not social distancing from a 400 year old ghost.

223
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 And don't do the math. Just assume that that number's right.

224
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

225
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 Our next story is actually super short.

226
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 That one was a bit longer than I thought it would be, but I really like that one.

227
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 The next one's super short.

228
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 I came about this on that website.

229
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Think about it, docs.com, easily becoming one of my go-to sites.

230
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 This is from the year 1987 and it's taken from a source, a book called The Threat by David Jacobs.

231
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 It's a book about the secret hidden alien agenda.

232
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 This one's gonna send shivers up your spine.

233
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 Definitely didn't mind.

234
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Let's go ahead, spiritual fire up that carbonar copter.

235
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 We are headed out to the Virgin Islands. Pretty nice.

236
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Get a little Mai Tai while I'm down there.

237
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 I've made two Mai Tai references in the past two days.

238
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 I've never had a Mai Tai in my life.

239
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 I know it's some sort of alcoholic drink, but is it like a strawberry daiquiri?

240
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 It's like a fruity drink, right?

241
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 I've never had a Mai Tai.

242
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 Anyways, it's 1987. It's a Virgin Islands where we're hanging out.

243
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 We're gonna land our helicopter.

244
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 There's a young woman. She goes by the name Lily Martinson in this story.

245
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 That's not a real name. That's a pseudonym given to her by the author.

246
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Lily Martinson is spending vacation. It's a beautiful vacation on the Virgin Islands.

247
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 She's hanging out.

248
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 It's nighttime and she's dead asleep.

249
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 But something wakes her up.

250
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Her eyes flood her open in the darkness.

251
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Oh, what?

252
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 And she sees at the foot of her bed her brother.

253
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Now her brother has passed away.

254
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 Her brother is no longer alive at this point.

255
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 And it kind of jolts her awake.

256
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 But she's laying there barely awake.

257
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 And at the foot of her bed she sees her dead brother staring at her, just watching her.

258
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 And she has a feeling of comfort about it.

259
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 A feeling of normalcy like her brother still watching over her.

260
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 She's looking at him. He's looking at her. She falls back asleep.

261
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 That's a very common story. And I'll tell you this right now.

262
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 If that story's happened to you, skip the next couple minutes of this podcast.

263
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 That's a very common story. I've heard that story. I've never had an experience like that.

264
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 I've been visited by loved ones who have passed away in my dreams.

265
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 And I thought that I've heard them shortly after they've passed away and stuff like that.

266
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 And I think a lot of that is just me thinking about them.

267
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 I'll still have dreams where I wake up.

268
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Very, very emotional.

269
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 I've had dreams where I was sobbing in the dreams because I'm seeing people who have passed away.

270
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 But I've never seen someone, but I've known people who have told me.

271
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 And I have a close friend of mine who told me that she woke up and she saw one of her loved ones sitting in the foot of her bed.

272
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 So if you are, and I know she listens to this podcast, so just skip, just fast forward or I'll be with you tomorrow.

273
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 I don't want to say her name, but it's a very common story.

274
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Waking up one of your loved ones is standing at your bed.

275
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 Sometimes they'll have a conversation with you, but sometimes they just stand there.

276
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 So she has this experience. Lily has this experience, right?

277
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Later on in life, she undergoes hypnosis.

278
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 Now, I don't know if she underwent hypnosis to get more information about this thing or just underwent hypnosis just because it was a Tuesday afternoon.

279
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Who knows?

280
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 But I've experienced stuff like this.

281
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 I remember once I was in my apartment, when I was living in Sacramento, I was in an apartment that I truly felt was haunted.

282
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 And I went there with my friend Liz. We had to go pick some stuff up.

283
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 And I had actually pretty much abandoned my apartment at this place.

284
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 I actually have two apartments at the time. It's a long story.

285
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 But anyways, this was an apartment A. I was also living in an apartment. That's a really long story.

286
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 But the point is I had multiple apartments at the time.

287
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 I had to go back to apartment A to get some stuff.

288
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 And I felt it was terrifying. I felt that it was haunted.

289
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 I remember walking in and going. I have to use the bathroom.

290
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 And I go into the bathroom.

291
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 And when I'm like washing my hands, I get this sudden feeling that we got to leave.

292
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 And I remember turning to open the bathroom door that opened out into the hallway and I paused.

293
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 This episode was being real personal. I was getting some personal Jason stories in this one.

294
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 I might have told this one before, but I don't think so.

295
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 And it was probably like 9 or 10 o'clock at night. It wasn't like super spooky or anything.

296
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 I remember I go to leave the bathroom. The bathroom's a wash in that white fluorescent light.

297
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 I turn and I go to turn the knob of the bathroom door.

298
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 And I get this horrible feeling that something's on the other side of the door.

299
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 And I remember pausing, hesitating. Totally sober at this time as well.

300
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 And then I was like, well, I gotta leave, right?

301
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 I can't stay in here. I got my friend hanging out in the living room waiting for me.

302
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 I opened the door and I feel like something kind of hits me with like a gust of wind.

303
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Not physically. Not physically. I didn't actually...

304
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 I just felt a presence in front of me, hallways completely empty.

305
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 And I walked through the hallway and I grabbed Liz and I'm like, we're out, bro. We're out.

306
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Didn't you need to get something? Nope, not anymore. I'll pick it up when the sun's up.

307
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 We left. And it was maybe like three or four weeks later or something like that.

308
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 I was hanging out somewhere. Well, I was probably just hanging out with my friends.

309
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Probably at my non-haunted apartment.

310
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 And I remember sitting there and then all of a sudden I remembered what was in that hallway.

311
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 I remember now when I opened the...

312
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 What I basically have two memories.

313
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 One is the member of me opening the door, feeling some... feeling some malevolent presence and then leaving the room.

314
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 But then I remember I was just sitting there and I remembered instinctively opening the door and seeing...

315
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 There is an episode, you like that, for Cliffhanger.

316
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 There was an episode I did a long time ago about the blue boy.

317
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 I think it was when I was talking about Sacramento or something like that.

318
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 There was this blue boy that was like following me around and I thought it was losing my mind.

319
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 I would kept seeing this. It was a not like a boy with blue pain.

320
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 It was like a mascot for our little league team.

321
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 It was this ghost that was like appearing in the back seat and like harassing me at work and all that stuff.

322
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 I thought I was losing my mind.

323
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 Every skeptic out there believes that I lost my mind and that's fair.

324
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 But remember there was like this 10, maybe 12 year old boy.

325
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 I'm really hard gauging ages. Like you're either just tiny or you're 21.

326
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 Like that's it. You're either 21 years old or you're three.

327
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 It was a boy in the hallway.

328
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 I remember opening the door and there was a boy with no face.

329
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 But it wasn't like all muscle tissue, bloody.

330
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 It was a boy's face with no skin.

331
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 But instead of where you would see like bloody muscle tissue and stuff like that,

332
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 it was kind of like a grayish or a blue, like a dull blue.

333
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 The blue boy that I had seen seemed to be like almost like an outline like how you would picture a ghost.

334
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 This one actually seemed like something different, but it still had the impression of a child with its face ripped off.

335
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 But I don't remember seeing that. That's the weirdest thing.

336
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 Like I didn't open the door and it go boogie dee boogie dee boogie dee and I go, "Ah!"

337
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 I opened the door and I left.

338
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 But then when my memory, basically when my brain was able to make sense of the insanity that my eyes had seen,

339
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 it created what I would consider one of the most horrifying images and that would be a child in distress.

340
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 A child who's been hurt very, very badly.

341
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 I mean, that's something that I think affects people on just a guttural level.

342
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 That would be one of the worst things you can see.

343
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 So whether that was some sort of wraith that actually was a kid who had no face,

344
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 or it was just I made it up, overactive imagination possibly,

345
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 and four weeks later I was just kind of zoning out.

346
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 My brain made it up. That's definitely possible as well.

347
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 It could have been something not groty, it could have been a not disgusting child, but something else taking that form.

348
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 Who knows? Who knows?

349
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 But basically there's like two memories of that.

350
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 One is the actual physical memory that I remember that Liz probably remembers too with me just being like,

351
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 "Go, go, go, go, go!"

352
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 And then almost like you younger kids probably don't know this, but you probably know it.

353
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 But when I was a kid we always had those projections, you know, you'd put on like the film,

354
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 and then you would have like, you had the big projector, not like a movie projector,

355
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 not like a slide projector, but the transparent, you guys know what I'm talking about, right?

356
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 You go, "Jason, you started it off by saying young kids don't know."

357
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 You'd have the big pieces of plastic and you'd put it on a box,

358
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 and then there was a light thing that would show it on a wall,

359
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 and then the teacher would just keep putting the other pieces of plastic on it.

360
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 It was basically like that. It was basically like that thing I can barely explain.

361
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 It was an overlay.

362
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 So I have the real memory, and then there's an overlay of a ghost standing in front of me.

363
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 And obviously the real memory is real. The ghost is debatable.

364
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 It could have been me imagining it and the imagine-

365
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 Because human memory is so fragile. It really is.

366
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Like you can implant false memories pretty quickly.

367
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 So I mean, you've got to be honest about that, right?

368
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Like I've had ghost stories, but most of my ghost stories,

369
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 even the ones I've told in the past, involve other people around us going,

370
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 "What's going on?"

371
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 Some of the ghost stories were just me witnessing it.

372
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 That's definitely, it could be stress, it could be all sorts of stuff, right?

373
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 And I'm at my skeptical age that I'm at. You know, I got to admit that too.

374
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 But did I finish this story? I didn't finish this story yet, did I?

375
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 Okay, okay.

376
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 So the Space Force story is actually going to have to wait till tomorrow.

377
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 I'm out of time. I got to tell this story here.

378
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Let me finish telling the story I originally started telling.

379
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Forgot where I left off. Okay, anyways.

380
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 So she has this experience.

381
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 She's sleeping in her bed. I got to go over the beginning again.

382
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 She's sleeping in her bed. She wakes up.

383
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 Her dead brother is standing at the foot of her bed watching her sleep.

384
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 She finds it comforting that he's still watching over her. She falls asleep.

385
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 A couple years later, she gets hypnotized.

386
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 And the memory is relived.

387
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 But this time, she sees what's really there.

388
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 She's sleeping in her bed on vacation.

389
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 And something wakes her up.

390
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 She looks at the foot of her bed.

391
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 And her brother is standing there watching her.

392
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 But it's not her brother.

393
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 What she sees now when her mind is in a deep state of relaxation

394
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 is a short, bald, gray man with giant eyeballs.

395
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 Just watching her standing at the foot of her bed.

396
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 She just sees her brother. She has no need to panic.

397
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 In fact, she's comforted that this thing is in her room.

398
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 She closes her eyes, falls back to sleep.

399
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Because she goes unconscious again, the hypnosis doesn't reveal

400
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 if the alien did anything after she went back to sleep.

401
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 But now that cherished memory of knowing there is life after death,

402
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 knowing that your loved ones continue to be with you after you pass away,

403
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 was an illusion, was a camouflage created by an alien invader.

404
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 An alien invader in your most vulnerable state when you're asleep.

405
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 I think we can always be afraid of being abducted by aliens,

406
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 or being experimented on by aliens,

407
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 but being fooled by an alien, being tricked by anybody or anything is frustrating.

408
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 But to think that an alien life form could be so callous

409
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 as to take the form of a dead family member.

410
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 First off, the alien would have to know the family member had passed away,

411
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 would have to know what the family member looked like,

412
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 would know it was your family member.

413
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 If I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw her dead brother at the foot of my bed,

414
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 I'd freak out.

415
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 So this alien had tons of information about this woman.

416
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 And used the image of a loved one who had passed away to infiltrate her bedroom.

417
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 That's beyond terrifying.

418
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 That's beyond calculating.

419
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 That's beyond cold.

420
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 There's no empathy there.

421
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 That truly is a sign of how evil aliens can be.

422
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 That's disgusting.

423
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 And the creepiest thing is, what if that accounts for far more ghostly visitations

424
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 than we would like to think?

425
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 You saw your grandmother standing in the kitchen where she always used to stand,

426
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 and then she turns and smiles and then fades away.

427
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 Or when you see the silhouette of your uncle,

428
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 when you smell your sister's perfume in that room she always loved so much,

429
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 these moments can bring us joy.

430
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 And I hope that all of these moments are moments of a loved one reaching out.

431
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 But at least one encounter was something far more sinister.

432
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 It also gives us pause to think.

433
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 All of those encounters, as comforting as they are,

434
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 could simply be a way for us to drop our guard and let an alien life form get close to us.
