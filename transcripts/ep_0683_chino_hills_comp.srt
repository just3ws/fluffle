1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,540
 A ghost story from the old, timey days of North Carolina shivers us to the bone?

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:13,200
 Is it possible that a man in Illinois made a concoction of bananas that could feed the

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,200
 dead?

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,720
 Then we travel to Chino Hills, California to visit a toxic waste dump that may be the

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,360
 home of the pig man today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:34,640
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,360
 I'm your host Jason Garmenter, I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,680
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,480
 I hope you guys have some fun plans for the summer, some fun ways to beat the heat.

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,880
 Tip 1, tip 1 if you want to beat the heat, don't record a podcast in a closet.

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,560
 Don't record a podcast in a closet at 1 in the afternoon.

12
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,320
 It's a terrible idea.

13
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,160
 What a great idea is to give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, writing into

14
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,280
 Dead Rabbit Command on the back of an ancient alligator.

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,280
 It's Peter Palmer.

16
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,440
 Everyone give a round of applause to Peter Palmer.

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,640
 Thank you so much for supporting the show.

18
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,920
 Peter, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

19
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,880
 Just spread the word about the show.

21
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,100
 Talk about it on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, wherever you hang out.

22
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,840
 Talk about the show, help get the word out.

23
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,320
 That is how you can help as well.

24
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:26,880
 Peter, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Carpenter Caboose.

25
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,400
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:37,520
 We are headed out to Gold Hill, North Carolina.

27
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,880
 We're going back to the year 1842.

28
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,720
 Everything sepia toned.

29
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,200
 Everything super old timey.

30
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,800
 The ancient alligator was born.

31
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,480
 It was a tiny little baby alligator back then.

32
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,320
 All of these stories I've chose for today because we're going to look at urban legends

33
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,280
 and see where they came from, what the start of these things were.

34
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,400
 I'm always fascinated by local legends.

35
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,920
 Everyone knows about Bermuda Triangle, but it's these little local ones that always

36
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,920
 fascinate me.

37
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,040
 The ones that are kind of passed down generation after generation.

38
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,840
 We're going to take a look at these.

39
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,760
 The first one we're looking at takes place in Gold Hill, North Carolina.

40
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,440
 Specifically we're going to the Randolph Mine.

41
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,280
 I didn't know this until I started researching this.

42
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,960
 You can go to Research Ghost, you learn a little bit about history as well.

43
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,000
 This region of North Carolina was the original gold rush in America.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,160
 Before gold was found in California, the 49ers as we know them in 1849, when they all showed

45
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,800
 up there, North Carolina was the place to be.

46
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,600
 If you wanted to get muddy, if you wanted to get wet, if you wanted to find gold, the

47
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,800
 last one is the one you really wanted to do.

48
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,200
 You went to this region of North Carolina.

49
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,000
 One of the people who traveled to find their fortune in North Carolina was a man known

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 as Aaron Klein.

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,600
 Aaron Klein and many others traveled to this region of North Carolina and he ends up finding

52
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:58,640
 a job at the Randolph Mine, looking for gold hoping to strike it rich.

53
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,880
 But something set Aaron apart from the other miners in the area.

54
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,680
 He was Jewish.

55
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,680
 He was the son of a rabbi who was like "I don't need any of that salvation, I don't

56
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,680
 need any of that heaven.

57
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,680
 I'm gonna find my heaven on earth."

58
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,120
 And this dad's like "No, that's the opposite of what you're supposed to do."

59
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,320
 "Ah shut up dad."

60
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,120
 So he goes to become a rich man in the mines.

61
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,640
 As I was researching the story, there was a term, I found this story on several websites,

62
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,920
 there was a term that was used over and over again.

63
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:33,160
 They kept saying that Aaron Klein was the victim of quote "antisemitic pranks."

64
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,160
 Unquote.

65
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,960
 Nowadays we just call those hate crimes, right?

66
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,560
 There's no like "Haha, I'm just pranking you bro."

67
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,600
 As you're like being horribly brutalized because of your ethnicity.

68
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,120
 But back then I guess it was just a prank.

69
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,120
 It was just a prank.

70
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,400
 But he didn't love that term.

71
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,080
 He worked in the mine like everyone else, trying to find him some gold.

72
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,440
 But he also found the eye of the owner's daughter Elizabeth.

73
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,160
 She sees Aaron, she falls in love with Aaron, and he falls in love with her.

74
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,120
 And they start to have this whirlwind romance.

75
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,680
 There was one miner in particular who didn't like this at all.

76
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,560
 Who did not like the fact that Aaron Klein and Elizabeth were dating.

77
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,640
 And this was a miner known as Stan Kolka, aka Big Stan.

78
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,040
 And I left out a detail.

79
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,040
 Aaron Klein, you're gonna wish I left this detail out.

80
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,320
 You're gonna wish I left it out.

81
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,000
 Aaron Klein had a little puppy.

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,360
 Little puppy dude that like followed him around everywhere.

83
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,440
 So imagine all the, imagine the story before, but a little puppy next to Aaron Klein the

84
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,640
 whole time.

85
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,960
 So Big Stan does not like the fact that Aaron Klein is getting close to the boss' daughter

86
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,160
 Elizabeth.

87
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,200
 And he made it very well known.

88
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,000
 He did not approve of this relationship.

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,240
 And people were like, who cares if you approve?

90
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,560
 Like, I'm sure we're all a bunch of hate criminals here.

91
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,520
 We're all incredibly racist.

92
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,520
 But love is love.

93
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,520
 Love is love.

94
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,280
 Who cares if they're together?

95
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,120
 Big Stan wanted none of it.

96
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,920
 And he made it very well known.

97
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,320
 He wasn't going to stand for this.

98
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,040
 So one day all the miners, they're doing their daily routine.

99
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,520
 They wake up, they're eating their breakfast, and they walk to Randolph Mine.

100
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,440
 And when they get to the mine, they see Aaron's puppy laying there.

101
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,200
 And they're like, that's weird.

102
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,320
 Like this puppy's always right next to Aaron.

103
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,800
 It's odd for the puppy to be here, but not Aaron.

104
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,800
 Maybe Aaron went into the mine.

105
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,160
 Maybe Aaron wanted an early day to start mining before all the hate crimes started.

106
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,240
 And as they're getting closer to this little puppy laying there, they're like, oh, he must

107
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,840
 be all tired and stuff.

108
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,440
 He must be tired from running from the mob that's chasing his dad.

109
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,960
 But as they're getting closer to the puppy, it's not moving.

110
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,720
 And the miners are like, hey, puppy, do stuff.

111
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,800
 Like start moving around.

112
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,000
 And he's just laying there.

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,920
 These miners all kind of look at each other.

114
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,960
 They get a little bit closer to the puppy.

115
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,440
 And it's dead.

116
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,040
 It's been killed.

117
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:13,800
 Now you can say a lot about racist miner, but they don't like puppies being murdered.

118
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,320
 And then there's something else going on here.

119
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:20,160
 Because while they did have anti-semitic pranks going on towards Aaron, they weren't

120
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,080
 trying to kill him.

121
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,640
 But now they're starting to think something bad has happened.

122
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,840
 Their first suggestion, because they didn't see Aaron when they were walking to the mine.

123
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,280
 They didn't see Aaron early in the morning.

124
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,280
 Now they found his dead puppy.

125
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,280
 They can't find him anywhere.

126
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,760
 So now they're thinking, did he go into the mine and have an accident?

127
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,360
 But why would his dog be dead?

128
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,520
 This doesn't make sense.

129
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,640
 We can't figure it out.

130
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,200
 And they started searching for Aaron.

131
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,080
 They couldn't find him anywhere.

132
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
 They go into the mine.

133
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:50,600
 They're looking at-- it's an 850-foot deep mine with all of these offshoots and everything

134
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,600
 like that.

135
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,040
 They can't find him anywhere.

136
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,280
 Days go by.

137
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,720
 Weeks go by.

138
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,840
 No sign of Aaron cling.

139
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,120
 One morning the miners are getting up to start their day again.

140
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,360
 The miners are walking to the mine and they notice something.

141
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,720
 It's not a dead puppy this time.

142
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,040
 Don't worry guys, it's not a dead puppy.

143
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,440
 There's a glowing light in the mouth of the mine.

144
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,480
 It's just floating there.

145
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,480
 What?

146
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,840
 Intarnation is that.

147
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:29,800
 And as they get closer to the entrance to the mine, they hear the whining of a puppy.

148
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,120
 They have to continue their job, but over time this light kept reappearing in the mouth

149
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:42,080
 of the mine with the sound of a puppy whining.

150
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,240
 Starts to really freak people out and they start to realize, and this was always their

151
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,560
 suspicion, that Aaron didn't just leave town.

152
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,840
 Aaron's not like, "Hold on, I'm done with this town.

153
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,640
 Time to kill my puppy and move on."

154
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,240
 He didn't just disappear.

155
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,920
 Something bad happened to him, which was what they kind of suspected.

156
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,280
 And they kind of suspected that whatever bad thing happened to him happened in the mine

157
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,160
 and that big stand was behind it.

158
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:16,280
 But now that this orb of light is flashing along, making the sounds of a whining puppy,

159
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:22,360
 they're almost sure that this has something to do with the murder of Aaron Klein.

160
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:30,400
 And they also noticed that late at night, when no one else was around, basically when

161
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:38,800
 no one was around, people reported big stand going into the mine himself and digging through

162
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,320
 rubble at the bottom of the mine.

163
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:47,120
 So it was an 850 foot shaft and then when you got to the bottom there were the offshoot

164
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,040
 tunnels in the mine and things like that.

165
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,160
 And he would be in these caverns down there looking for something.

166
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,280
 But it was always late at night.

167
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,120
 He wasn't doing that when other people were around.

168
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,680
 I mean, everyone's always looking for something.

169
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,880
 We were looking for gold.

170
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,160
 But they could tell this guy was looking for something else.

171
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,200
 And then one morning, all of the miners wake up.

172
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,400
 They all sleep in one giant long bed.

173
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:15,360
 They go to the mine shaft and the elevator for the mine is all the way to the bottom.

174
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,360
 That's weird.

175
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,360
 It should be at the top.

176
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,360
 That's what elevators are for.

177
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,800
 They're not just down there and you jump on top of them.

178
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,440
 But they looked down the mine shaft and they saw, this is where it starts to get urban

179
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,920
 legendy, but again, they looked down the mine shaft and they have vision that can see through

180
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:42,160
 the dark for 850 feet on the roof of the elevator was the broken crumpled body of big stand.

181
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:49,320
 He didn't make that noise.

182
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:58,320
 He'd been dead all night.

183
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:22,880
 It's very rare for ghosts to kill people.

184
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,120
 There's been some sort of paranormal activity linked to dead bodies, but actually a ghost,

185
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,080
 like a vengeful spirit, killing their murderer.

186
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,480
 It's very, very, very rare.

187
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,480
 And it's interesting because even when you think of ghost stories, a lot of ghost stories

188
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,480
 are made up.

189
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,560
 A lot of ghost stories are tall tales.

190
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,680
 Even then, it's very rare.

191
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,680
 Very, very rare.

192
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,240
 So right off the bat, I found this story super interesting.

193
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,480
 The implication is that the ghost did kill big stand because the elevator shouldn't have

194
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,800
 been all the way at the bottom.

195
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,800
 So interesting.

196
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,200
 He would have had to activate it himself, let go all the way down and then jump, but

197
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,000
 was the elevator malfunctioning and he fell into, who knows, who knows, but the implication

198
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,600
 is that the ghost did it.

199
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,920
 Not just shoddy workmanship, but Randolph Mine.

200
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,000
 This is an interesting story because on the one hand it feels like an urban legend.

201
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,200
 I could not verify there was a man named Aaron Klein living in that area.

202
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,320
 I couldn't find that this, the mine exists.

203
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,560
 We know that there are certain historical things that exist, but I couldn't find proof

204
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,080
 that Aaron Klein ever existed.

205
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,080
 Doesn't mean that he didn't.

206
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,280
 I just couldn't find.

207
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,800
 We have been able to cover ghost stories on the show before.

208
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,440
 We covered that one about the Haunted Boat in San Francisco.

209
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,680
 We found the boat.

210
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,080
 We found the names of the captain.

211
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,080
 The story was true.

212
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:42,200
 It actually took place in Maine, oddly enough, but sometimes we were really able to drill

213
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,160
 down and find the details and find out that certain details are real.

214
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,320
 They were reported in newspapers of the time.

215
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:55,160
 I couldn't find any historical verification outside of websites like North Carolina Ghost

216
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,320
 and spooky North Carolina stuff like that.

217
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,080
 But at the same time, all the stories were fairly close.

218
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,560
 Some had a little more information.

219
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,640
 The original stories didn't have the name Big Stan or anything like that.

220
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,640
 But they all have the same narrative structure.

221
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,440
 Usually urban legends will be different on different websites.

222
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,820
 And we'll get to that in the ending because we're going to cover an urban legend at the

223
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,820
 end.

224
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,820
 It's all over the place.

225
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,520
 I think this was a really cool place to start one.

226
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,640
 It's a cool ghost story.

227
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
 It's creepy.

228
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,160
 I don't know if nobody likes dead puppies.

229
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,000
 That's interesting because that was an element that I found on one website that I didn't

230
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,560
 see in the other two websites was the puppy.

231
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:43,200
 But you can imagine you have a cave that has a glowing light that does have some sort of

232
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:49,400
 paranormal activity.

233
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,320
 That's usually where urban legends come from.

234
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,560
 Why is this place so creepy?

235
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,560
 Old Man Metagory used to live there.

236
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,280
 Versus someone needs to do something about Old Man Metagory.

237
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,640
 He's bringing down the property values of the neighborhood and then the story goes forward.

238
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,560
 Urban legends backtrack like that.

239
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,240
 So I thought that was a cool way to start off this urban legend episode.

240
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,600
 But Peter Palmer, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

241
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,240
 We're going to leave behind North Carolina.

242
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,080
 We are headed out to Lombard, Illinois.

243
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:23,880
 Now don't hit the time travel button because this story also takes place in the 1800s.

244
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:29,160
 So anywhere between 1801 and 1899, this is where the story takes place.

245
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,240
 I love this story.

246
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,520
 It is a total local urban legend.

247
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,640
 Like you don't get it anymore.

248
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,600
 This is almost like the pure raw.

249
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,800
 This is the wheatgrass version of an urban legend.

250
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,600
 It's just like right out of the ground into your mouth.

251
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,160
 I actually got this sent to me by Liz Wren on TikTok.

252
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,400
 And I wasn't able to find any sources for this.

253
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,400
 I could find nothing about this online.

254
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,800
 Which I'm not saying that to call her a liar at all.

255
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,560
 I'm saying that this is such a pure urban legend.

256
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,320
 It's so local no one's talking about it.

257
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:11,520
 So apparently in Lombard, Illinois, back in the 1800s, somewhere between 1801 and 1899,

258
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,640
 in Lombard, Illinois, there was a doctor who was married to his wife.

259
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,000
 Which is normally how it works, right?

260
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,120
 He's normally not married to the butler.

261
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,120
 He's married to his wife.

262
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,720
 But his wife passes away.

263
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,440
 And he starts to become a bit of a recluse.

264
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,640
 Patients are having to see themselves.

265
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,560
 They're like, "Oh, why am I covered in boils?"

266
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,880
 The doctor's like, "Please just let me lay in bed.

267
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,880
 I'm grieving."

268
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,920
 Final, Lance them myself.

269
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,760
 He only does house calls to his own house.

270
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,760
 You gotta show up here.

271
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,760
 I'm super sick.

272
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,760
 You're throwing up everywhere.

273
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,200
 He's like, "Oh, I'm only grieving even more.

274
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,600
 That was her favorite rug."

275
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,320
 But he starts to get better.

276
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,560
 He starts immensely to get better.

277
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,760
 He starts walking around town.

278
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,760
 He's like, "Hey guys, how you doing?

279
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,760
 They're all dead.

280
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,760
 They're all dead."

281
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,760
 Because he was a local doctor.

282
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,760
 He's like, "What happened here?

283
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,800
 They're like, the black plague came through."

284
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,240
 He's like, "Oh, that's easy to fix nowadays."

285
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,040
 He's walking through town.

286
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,800
 He's much better now.

287
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,640
 And he also has gotten an affinity for chickens.

288
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,280
 He starts buying chickens.

289
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,680
 All the chickens he can find.

290
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,360
 He's going to chicken farms and chicken ranches.

291
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,880
 He's like, "How many chickens you got there?"

292
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,760
 And they're like, "I don't know, 10, 20.

293
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,760
 I'll buy them all."

294
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,760
 Really?

295
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,480
 So he's buying all these chickens and he would take them back to his house.

296
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,040
 And people are like, "That's weird.

297
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,960
 What's he doing with them?"

298
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,280
 I mean, he's probably eating them because that's normally what people do with chickens.

299
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,200
 But no one can eat that many chickens.

300
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,920
 It's not Hulk Hogan.

301
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:38,680
 So what this doctor was doing was he was taking these chickens and he was killing them.

302
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,360
 Which is what you do with chickens.

303
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,800
 That's not the end of the urban legend.

304
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,960
 Did you know people kill chickens?

305
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,040
 You're like, "Ah, you're eating a chicken."

306
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,520
 He's killing these chickens and he's trying to bring them back to life.

307
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:56,680
 So he'd kill them and then he'd electrocute them and he was pouring this homemade medicine

308
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,480
 he made down their beaks.

309
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,280
 He's like, "Take this dead chicken."

310
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,760
 He's electrocuting them.

311
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,000
 He's taking notes on all of this stuff.

312
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,480
 He's like, "Oh man, that one didn't work.

313
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,480
 That one didn't work.

314
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,480
 That one didn't work."

315
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,520
 And he's doing this and then one day he pours the right concoction down a chicken's gullet

316
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:20,600
 and electrocutes it just right.

317
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,320
 The chicken survives.

318
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:31,200
 So now he has houses full of chicken carcasses and one live chicken.

319
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,720
 This chicken had a scar on its throat.

320
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,440
 Now I know what you guys are asking.

321
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,520
 I know you guys are asking the question, how does anyone know this, right?

322
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,880
 Like this is highly detailed urban legend stuff.

323
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,320
 Someone really go in the chicken had a scar on its throat.

324
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,320
 How would you even know?

325
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,520
 I mean, that's like a super, how do you notice that a chicken has a scar?

326
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,520
 It's covered in feathers.

327
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,960
 But anyways, there's this really badass chicken sitting there, a little patch on his eye,

328
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,280
 scar on his throat.

329
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:03,280
 So now that his concoction is perfected, he goes to a cemetery.

330
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,600
 Oh, Margaret, I didn't name you earlier, but this is your name now?

331
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,560
 Digging you out of your grave, you're going to join me once again in the land of the living.

332
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,280
 He digs his wife up and there's nothing left but bones, obviously.

333
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,280
 It took a long time.

334
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,280
 You didn't use a pro tip.

335
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,160
 It's going to take an awful long time to learn how to bring stuff back from the dead.

336
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,360
 So she's been quite decayed.

337
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:28,840
 She's nothing but bones, but he's able to take the skeleton home.

338
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,760
 Okay, this guy's carting the skeleton home.

339
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,480
 Did he carry her as like one giant skeleton or did he just put all the bones in a box?

340
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,840
 I'll assemble you later, Margaret.

341
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,840
 Then takes her home, the thigh bones connected to the hip bone.

342
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,200
 He's singing that whole song that chickens like, "Ahh, why'd you bring me back from

343
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,200
 the dead?"

344
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,080
 This is so annoying.

345
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:55,640
 He reassembles his wife and then decides to, he comes to the conclusion that whatever

346
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,840
 this concoction is that he made to bring people back from the dead probably tastes gross, right?

347
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,320
 I mean, sure, you're destroying the laws of nature.

348
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,800
 You become a necromancer, but it also tastes disgusting.

349
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:14,280
 So he mashes up bananas and he puts it into this concoction and he begins pouring it in

350
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,440
 a skeleton's mouth.

351
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,440
 No tongue, by the way, sir.

352
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,720
 You didn't have to worry about what it tasted like.

353
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,240
 So she's nothing but bones, he's pouring this concoction into her mouth.

354
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,720
 But one day, his son-in-law swings by the house.

355
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,720
 He goes, "You know what?

356
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:33,040
 I'm in the mood for some chicken and I don't have any money, but I know that my father-in-law

357
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,040
 has a bunch of chickens.

358
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,240
 I'm sure there's just like delicious chicken nuggets laying around everywhere."

359
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,080
 He goes to the house, he didn't announce his visit.

360
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,600
 He walks through the front door.

361
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,480
 The doctor's guard chicken let him down, didn't warn him.

362
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:52,280
 When the son-in-law comes into the kitchen, he sees his mother's corpse going "Nuh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh."

363
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:58,360
 Moving its mouth up and down, eyes rolling, eyes rolling in its skull, and the man is

364
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:04,960
 feeding this corpse mashed- what was it?

365
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,800
 Mashed bananas, that was it.

366
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,800
 Mashed bananas.

367
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,840
 And the son-in-law is like, "No!"

368
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:17,920
 And ever since that horrible event, that house has been known as the Banana House in Lombard,

369
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,920
 Illinois.

370
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,080
 So obviously, that story is fake.

371
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,080
 Or is it?

372
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,080
 No, it is.

373
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,080
 It's totally fake.

374
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,080
 I mean, she told me it.

375
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,080
 I'm not saying that Liz Wren doesn't exist.

376
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,840
 She's a fictional character.

377
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,640
 But the story itself is a local legend because none of the details add up.

378
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,520
 And I'm not even including stuff like bringing the dead back to life.

379
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,680
 Because on Dead Rabbit Radio, that's possible, right?

380
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,680
 We've covered enough weird stuff.

381
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,040
 I'm not even talking about stuff like that.

382
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,520
 I'm talking about little details, like the chicken with the scar on its neck, the fact

383
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:53,440
 that how could you feed a skeleton food and then it starts to grow human tissue again?

384
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,800
 Like at a certain point, you may miss your loved ones, but you're not doing them any

385
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,560
 good if they're just gonna be a reanimated skeleton.

386
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,800
 They're basically now just a villain and Jason and the Argonauts.

387
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,720
 Like if they're a skeleton and you figure out a way to bring them back to life, don't

388
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,520
 bring- don't bring a skeleton back to life.

389
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,320
 But you have these details.

390
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,880
 How would you feed a skull this food?

391
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,200
 It doesn't have any taste buds, doesn't have a stomach or anything like that.

392
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,920
 It's just bones.

393
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,840
 But we're in the realm of magic at this point.

394
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,640
 But again, the house is now called the Banana House.

395
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,800
 And I tried looking for this, like Liz, thank you so much for sending this by the way.

396
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,520
 It's very, very entertained by the story.

397
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:35,280
 If we're gonna backtrack this again, what I can almost guarantee is that in Lombard,

398
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,400
 Illinois, there is a house that is either the color of a banana, that's the most likely,

399
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:46,000
 or unlikely, shaped like a banana, or has a banana tree or whatever.

400
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,520
 And it was nicknamed the Banana House.

401
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,360
 And at some point, some kid goes, "Why is it the Banana House?"

402
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,680
 And their older brother goes, "Let me tell you a story," and made this up.

403
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,840
 And that got passed down from the 50s, the 60s, the 70s, and so on, where it's been

404
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,840
 perfected over time.

405
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,320
 And that's how these urban legends grow.

406
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,880
 But we got one more urban legend to look at.

407
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,880
 Peter Palmer.

408
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,960
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the Carbenter Coptre.

409
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,880
 We're leaving behind Lombard, Illinois.

410
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,640
 Got a little chicken passenger in the back seats, sitting there a little scar around his

411
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,640
 neck.

412
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,640
 He gives us a thumbs up.

413
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,480
 We're rescuing you, bro.

414
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,160
 We're leaving behind Lombard, Illinois.

415
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:24,800
 We're headed out to Chino Hills, California.

416
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:29,280
 Maybe a year and a half ago, our resident Bigfoot expert, Bennett, he's recommended a lot of

417
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,280
 stories on this show.

418
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,560
 I don't know what possessed him to do this.

419
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,120
 I don't know why he did this.

420
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,120
 I'm thankful.

421
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,600
 It's really cool, but I never really figured it out.

422
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,840
 He went through all 50 states in the United States.

423
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,840
 He traveled on foot himself.

424
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,680
 He looked for pig man legends in every single state.

425
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:51,680
 We've covered a couple of them, but we have like 43 more of these to go.

426
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,520
 Thank you so much, Bennett, for sending this story over.

427
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,480
 Again, 100% pure urban legend.

428
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,920
 But this one has some government proof behind it.

429
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,320
 Is it truly an urban legend?

430
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,480
 Let's take a look at this.

431
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,200
 Chino Hills, California.

432
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:11,480
 We're walking along the rolling hills of this beautiful landscape.

433
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:15,600
 We see a chain link fence, and I look at you and you look at me and I go, "Pssst."

434
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,600
 Chain link.

435
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,760
 More like chain lame.

436
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:23,040
 You're like Jason, you dork, and you pull out your bolt cutters.

437
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,160
 We cut a hole in the fence.

438
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,480
 We walk through it.

439
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,840
 No chain link fence is going to stop us.

440
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,960
 All those signs, all those warning signs that we see.

441
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,440
 Ah, just don't read those, dude.

442
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,440
 That's lame.

443
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,960
 We're walking along this facility, and we see two kids in the distance playing tag.

444
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,960
 You're it.

445
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,960
 No, you're it.

446
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,120
 It's not really fun to play tag with only two people.

447
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,880
 We are currently at Aerojet Rocketdyne.

448
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,660
 This was a facility built in Chino Hills.

449
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:55,560
 Back in the 1950s, we're walking along this stretch of land.

450
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,160
 Now, this stretch of land is known for quite a few things.

451
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:03,760
 If you were young and you owned a car, but you didn't own your own place, this is where

452
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,840
 you take your girlfriend to go make out with her.

453
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,840
 Out in this air.

454
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,520
 There's nothing more romantic than Aerojet Rocketdyne, baby.

455
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,600
 You could go out there for that.

456
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,360
 You could also go out there if you were up to no good.

457
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,560
 Drug deals, things like that.

458
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:22,680
 It was also a place for exploring, having goonie-esque adventures.

459
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:30,320
 This was also a place of darkness, which actually goes hand in hand with the two activities.

460
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,480
 One, if you're a drug dealer, you don't want to do it at a daycare, right?

461
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,960
 You don't want to do it with a bunch of kids, or like going ring around the rosy as you're

462
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,920
 like spilling your drugs everywhere.

463
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,600
 You want to do it out in a place where people aren't, there's not going to be prying eyes,

464
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,440
 or if someone does see you doing something, they're going to have to admit they were out

465
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,440
 there.

466
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,160
 And then, I've talked about this before on the show, the boo pill.

467
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:58,000
 If you want to get a girl to go out to a location, girls love ghosts.

468
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,400
 Girls love spooky stories.

469
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,080
 So it's not just like, "Hey, Betty, you want to go out to make out hill?"

470
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,400
 "Oh, what type of girl do you think I am, Jason?"

471
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,400
 "Meh."

472
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,720
 Or, "Hey, Betty, do you want to go on a ghost hunt with me?"

473
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,280
 "Woo, you sure are the bee's knees, Jason."

474
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,600
 And then we go, because obviously, if we're going out to make out hill, we're making

475
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,600
 out, right?

476
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,480
 But if we go on a ghost hunt, even if we don't see anything, we end up in the middle

477
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,480
 of nowhere.

478
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,800
 And we're parking the car and I was like, "Oh, Betty, that sure was fun driving around

479
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,360
 for three hours looking for ghosts."

480
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,840
 It sure was, Jason.

481
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,760
 So I know that was a super erotic adventure.

482
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,360
 I know that was theater of the mind, but it does work.

483
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,160
 And it's much better to say, "Hey, baby, you want to go hang out and hunt ghosts and we'll

484
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,800
 be walking around dark places and breaking into houses."

485
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:46,960
 They'll just happen to be a couch, they'll just happen to be mattress there, versus,

486
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,160
 "Let's go get a hotel room."

487
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,400
 It's not in first date type stuff.

488
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,120
 Obviously by the time you've established a relationship, they're most likely going to

489
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,360
 want you to get a hotel room or just clean your bedroom.

490
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,040
 But first date, you take them to a haunted location.

491
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,360
 So that was another reason why this place worked.

492
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,280
 And it's funny, there was actually a quote here in this article I was reading about that

493
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:12,880
 said, "Needless to say, it was an enticing way for guys to get girls to go to a remote

494
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,880
 location."

495
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,520
 So it's not just me coming up with that.

496
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:22,440
 There's other manipulators out there who use the paranormal to get babes.

497
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:28,720
 Anyway, so we're at Aerojet Rocketdyne and in the 1960s, the urban legends really kick

498
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,720
 into full gear.

499
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,720
 Before, it's just a place that you're not supposed to go to.

500
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,760
 There's all these warning signs that's in the middle of nowhere.

501
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,320
 But then this story starts that two kids went missing in the 1960s.

502
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,640
 They just disappeared off the face of the earth.

503
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,840
 Again, that's going to get people excited to go there.

504
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,880
 These legends make you want to go to explore them.

505
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,480
 Two kids disappearing in the 1960s in a part of California.

506
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,120
 I cannot confirm or deny that that happened.

507
00:25:54,120 --> 00:26:01,040
 I wasn't able to connect any missing person cases to Chino Hills specifically, but at

508
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,600
 the same time, that's a huge range.

509
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,520
 Some of the stories say it happened in the 1970s.

510
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,280
 So we're talking a 10 to 20 year gap.

511
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:14,200
 It's very possible that in that time period, two children went missing in the area.

512
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:19,080
 It's possible they got found three days later, but the story of them missing lasted much

513
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,760
 longer than them being found.

514
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,760
 We see that happen a lot investigating stuff on this show.

515
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,080
 But remember, we're here for the pig man.

516
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,480
 We're not here for not looking for some lousy kids.

517
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,160
 We're here for the pig man.

518
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,160
 Bennett sent us over here for the pig man.

519
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:37,240
 This is a really interesting conspiracy theory because when you look up the pig man of Chino

520
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,560
 Hills, everyone's talking about it, but nobody knows anything.

521
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,760
 It's super weird.

522
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,000
 I was looking up on these different articles, I was looking up on Reddit and it's always

523
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,720
 the same couple of things.

524
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,800
 I heard someone told me.

525
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,000
 I remember, but I'm not for sure.

526
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,840
 It's very vague.

527
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:01,240
 Which is interesting because normally urban legends get more constructed over time.

528
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,800
 They very rarely collapse.

529
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,840
 They normally get more intricate.

530
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,280
 But the pig man of Chino Hills is basically this.

531
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:13,560
 There's a pig man living in the area, the wooded area around Aerojet Rocketdyne.

532
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:21,480
 And it's either a crazed farmer wearing the head of a pig or a human who is turned into

533
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,760
 a pig human hybrid.

534
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,640
 One of those is infinitely more scary.

535
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,360
 If a man was running around the pig head, it's kinda gross.

536
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,760
 If a man used to be human and is now turned into a pig, I'm afraid that might happen to

537
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,760
 me too.

538
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,360
 Like is he gonna take me back to his lair and hook me up to some weird device and I

539
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,640
 see a chicken with a scar and I'm like "no you betrayed me!"

540
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:47,280
 And then I'm feeling my organs shift and my hands are turning into little stubby things.

541
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,280
 What are those things called?

542
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,280
 Hooves?

543
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,280
 Mwaah!

544
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,280
 Mwaah!

545
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,480
 That's more terrifying than a man with a pig head chopping me up.

546
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,920
 Even if he was chopping me up super slowly, he's like "tomorrow we'll start on your foot!"

547
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,080
 As I'm already missing a bunch of other limbs.

548
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,080
 Yeah whatever.

549
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,720
 But if I was turning into a pig person, that's way scarier.

550
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:12,560
 So tip down there to the future tellers of the pigmanicino hills legend.

551
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,760
 Stick with the creepy.

552
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,240
 Stick with the Mwaah!

553
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,520
 And then tell your little brother "yeah and then if he gets you late at night, he puts

554
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,960
 a little tube in your belly button and fills you full of grease and fat and fills you full

555
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,840
 with the kidskin tongue grease."

556
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,560
 He's like "hmmm reminds me of McDonald's."

557
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:31,560
 He's like "no no no, it's gross grease and gross fat and he turns you into a piggy."

558
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,560
 So yeah do that.

559
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,760
 If you want to traumatize a kid, make it creepy.

560
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,400
 But anyway, so that's it.

561
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:42,080
 Like when you type in pigmanicino, you're like "jason, seriously?

562
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,960
 You built up this whole story?

563
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:49,280
 You're telling us about all this stuff and making out how you trick women into haunted

564
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,280
 houses?"

565
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,120
 And then you're just going to tell us that.

566
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,440
 Well yeah, it's super interesting.

567
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,480
 That's all we have of the pigman, but that's not all we have about chino hills.

568
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,600
 All we have about pigman is it may be a farmer with a pig head.

569
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:07,800
 It may be a man who is half human half pig and now Jason's added this story that he might

570
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,680
 turn you into a half human half pig.

571
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,880
 Because even if there was just a half human half pig, I could outrun a half human half

572
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,880
 pig.

573
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,680
 Like I probably can't outrun a lot of humans, right?

574
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,680
 I gotta be honest.

575
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:25,160
 I can't outrun a lot of humans, but I could outrun a pig so I'm sure that I could outrun

576
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,160
 a human pig.

577
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,200
 I guess we'll find out tonight when they break into my house and try to turn me into

578
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,200
 a pig.

579
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,440
 I could easily outrun that dude, but if I got caught and he turned me into a pig person

580
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,440
 that would be the worst.

581
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,480
 That would be a horrible nightmare for me.

582
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,560
 But that's not the only reason why we're at chino hills.

583
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:48,400
 Chino Hills also has another urban legend that is far more well known in the area.

584
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,640
 Everyone knows about this story.

585
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,240
 Dads have brought their- there was an article I read this father brought his son up to the

586
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,240
 area.

587
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,240
 Can you see it dad?

588
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,240
 Can I see it?

589
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,920
 Well son, I don't know if it'll be there, but I remember seeing it as a boy myself.

590
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:05,320
 It was a really interesting article that dad was saying when I was young this area was

591
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,400
 so full of mystery and then my son wanted it.

592
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,080
 And he goes, "Whether or not the mystery is real" and this is what's so important about

593
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,080
 urban legends.

594
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:15,880
 He goes, "Whether or not the mystery is real, it was a bonding moment between me and my

595
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,880
 son.

596
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,920
 We got to spin the day walking around.

597
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,840
 We got to spin the day walking around Aerojet Rock and Dine, which is now closed down.

598
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,920
 Now it's much easier to walk around.

599
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,920
 Don't."

600
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:32,440
 We'll get to that in a second, but the other very popular myth, maybe, might be true.

601
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,240
 The green mist of Chino Hills.

602
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:42,280
 So the legend goes in this area, sometimes early in the morning, sometimes late at night,

603
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,560
 when the fog is rolling in and the conditions are just right.

604
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:54,440
 Green mist covers the land.

605
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,440
 It's wrong.

606
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,440
 It's unnatural.

607
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,000
 You shouldn't be seeing this.

608
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,360
 Over the decades, people have reported seeing the green mist of Chino Hills.

609
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,480
 Some people think it's a paranormal event.

610
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,200
 The kids that went missing, they've tied that into either the pig man getting them, or the

611
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,000
 green mist enveloped them and took them away somewhere.

612
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,040
 Some sort of supernatural thing.

613
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,840
 Other people say it's not real at all.

614
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,400
 The green mist is nothing if it's anything.

615
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,280
 It's some sort of optical illusion, but it's probably not even that.

616
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,280
 Local skeptics go, "There's no such thing as a green mist.

617
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,440
 There's no video footage of it.

618
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,600
 There's no photographs of it."

619
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:42,880
 Aerojet Rocket Dine opened in 1954 as a munitions assembly and munitions testing location, which

620
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:49,400
 sounds like a bad idea, but their manufacturing and testing these weapons from 1954 to 1995

621
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:55,800
 and the place got shut down in 1995, they've been cleaning it up ever since.

622
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:02,800
 They're using depleted uranium there, which generally uses an anti-tank, anti-armor shell.

623
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,280
 So not good and shouldn't be a shocker.

624
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,760
 A highly, highly toxic.

625
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,680
 You can say depleted in the first word.

626
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,880
 The second word is still uranium.

627
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,400
 And they were testing it, so they were basically like the doctor in Lombard, Illinois.

628
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,360
 They're like, "Sir, that's too much uranium in that shell.

629
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,960
 Oh well, let's just bury it."

630
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,160
 And then they're trying to make another one.

631
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,440
 Okay, that's just the right amount of uranium.

632
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,200
 So they're testing, they're trying to get the concoctions just right.

633
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,480
 And it's 1954, so when they are like, "What do we do with all this depleted stuff?"

634
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,480
 I don't know.

635
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,800
 Just throw it in the ground, let go first deal with it.

636
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:39,280
 So the theory is that the green mist is real.

637
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:44,360
 It actually is a real phenomenon that people did see back in the 50s and the 60s and it

638
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:49,720
 started to go away because back then they were really, really working with some toxic

639
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,040
 stuff.

640
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:55,400
 Because there's not sightings of the green mist today.

641
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:01,520
 So you would have had it in the 50s and 60s, maybe the 70s, but it starts to peter out.

642
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,080
 But the idea is at some point it was real.

643
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,920
 This green mist would roll across the land.

644
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,480
 And it was radioactive.

645
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,320
 So this may be one of those urban legends that does have a seed of truth in it.

646
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:19,960
 The green mist was real and there are people who have a vested interest in convincing people

647
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,840
 that it's not.

648
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,160
 But let's go ahead and end this urban legend expedition like this.

649
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,320
 Let's put on our conspiracy caps here and wrap it on up.

650
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,040
 What if the two legends are related?

651
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:39,760
 The green mist is a radioactive cloud that was released because the scientists either

652
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:45,000
 didn't know or didn't care what they were dealing with at Aerojet Rocketdyne.

653
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,600
 And there was a local pig farmer in the area who loved his little piggies.

654
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:58,800
 He's petting them and he's like, "Oh, you guys, I'm going to chop you up and I'm going

655
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,800
 to eat you."

656
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,800
 Now you guys are the love of my life and he's hugging them.

657
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,600
 I guess pig farmers don't do that.

658
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,960
 That would make him really bad at their job.

659
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,920
 But he's not a good pig farmer.

660
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,920
 He hugs the pig every night before he goes to bed.

661
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,920
 He has a bunch of them.

662
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,440
 He reads him bedtime stories.

663
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,680
 And when he goes to bed, he doesn't notice the green mist covering his farm.

664
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,000
 When he wakes up, it's always gone.

665
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,920
 He always sees a nice crisp, chino hills morning and he goes out and he feeds the pigs.

666
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,280
 He rides him around for fun.

667
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,280
 Wee!

668
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,200
 I'd be the worst pig farmer.

669
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:36,120
 And then he goes to bed and he never wakes up early enough to see the green mist roll

670
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,000
 again through the farm.

671
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,480
 And every day he goes out there and he's playing with the pigs.

672
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,920
 He does have to sell a couple of them.

673
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,320
 He does have rent to pay.

674
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,040
 But he always gets new piggies and he raises them.

675
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,200
 And he's doing this for years and years.

676
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,440
 He lives alone too.

677
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,520
 It's just him and his pigs.

678
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:59,120
 So it doesn't start to notice the changes to his own skin.

679
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,120
 He's hungrier.

680
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,120
 He's hungry.

681
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:05,200
 He loves eating corn on the cob right out of a bucket.

682
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,240
 The way grandma used to make it, right?

683
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,960
 But every day when that green mist rolls in and it settles on his farm and then he walks

684
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,560
 out there and he's kicking up the radioactive molecules and he's petting his pigs, he's

685
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,840
 transferring pig DNA into his body.

686
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:26,880
 Every time he pets the pig, he becomes a little less human and a little more pig.

687
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,200
 And one day the scientists at Aerojet Rocketdyne are looking through binoculars and they're

688
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,840
 like, "Hey, you know that guy who lives out by that pig farm?

689
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,240
 The least scientist goes, "Don't you have something better to do?

690
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,240
 Don't you have weapons to test?

691
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,240
 Why are you some sicko voyeur?"

692
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,240
 Looking at it, "No, no, no, I know.

693
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,240
 I know.

694
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,800
 I am a sicko voyeur and I'm seeing a psychiatrist for that."

695
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,800
 But look through these binoculars.

696
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,800
 Look over at farmer John over there.

697
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,800
 And the other scientist looks through the binoculars and he sees farmer John's a little

698
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,920
 more hunched over this time.

699
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,920
 His pants don't fit as well.

700
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,560
 He has a curly little tail coming out of his butt.

701
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,480
 The lead scientist goes, "Oh my God.

702
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,160
 Do you think it's possible that he's becoming a human pig?"

703
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,600
 And the other scientist goes, "What other option would there be?"

704
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,680
 So they start thinking.

705
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:18,200
 All this green mist that floats out of our facility every morning.

706
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,040
 Reventing off this radioactive gas.

707
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:26,960
 What if it's turning him into a pig as he's touching pigs all the time?

708
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,320
 So they have to do something about this, right?

709
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,560
 They have to cover up this horrible crime that they've committed.

710
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,560
 They're turning...

711
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,560
 I mean, there's nothing worse.

712
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,320
 You know how many years in prison you can get for turning a human into a pig against his

713
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,560
 will?

714
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,680
 So one night they snatch this guy out of his bed.

715
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,680
 They put him in a giant burlap.

716
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,480
 They wrap him up in a giant pancake, pigs in a blanket, and they drag him.

717
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,960
 This is going totally off the rails.

718
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,440
 It was supposed to be super spooky, but I can't stop making jokes.

719
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,120
 They drag him into the facility.

720
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,440
 Here's the spooky part, okay?

721
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,480
 This is the spooky part.

722
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:04,120
 So the legend of the pigman is real, but it's not a man, half-man, half-pig running around

723
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:08,840
 Chino Hills looking for young people to snatch up.

724
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:13,360
 He's actually a military experiment now.

725
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:19,720
 Half-human, half-pigged, strapped down to a table.

726
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,720
 Scientists injecting syringes into him.

727
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,520
 They're pulling out and they're looking through.

728
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,520
 They're like through a microscope.

729
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:29,080
 This little pig, little pig of me, but it's flown around and the scientists are nodding

730
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,080
 at each other.

731
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,760
 They're like, "Our theories are real."

732
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:37,120
 And then the pig dude is strapped down to the table.

733
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:40,040
 And if you don't think that's spooky, because I'm the only person who thinks turning into

734
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,280
 a pig is spooky, here's the spooky part.

735
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,880
 The radiation made him like super-live-long, made him like not age.

736
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,680
 And in 1995, when they're shutting the place down, one of the scientists goes, "You know

737
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,680
 what?

738
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,960
 I'm sure I'm gonna miss this place as he's putting microscopes in a box."

739
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,960
 Yeah, me too.

740
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,480
 And I think it's kind of weird we have a bunch of microscopes at a place where we test

741
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,480
 the weapons.

742
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,000
 Why did we need all these microscopes?

743
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,040
 I don't know.

744
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,600
 And they're loading stuff up and they go to shut the light off.

745
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,600
 And the scientist goes, "Wait a second.

746
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,160
 I have a feeling like we're forgetting something.

747
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,040
 We've got everything out of this building, right?"

748
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,720
 And the elite scientist is like, "Yeah, there's nothing else.

749
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,280
 I can't think of anything."

750
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:25,520
 But deep underneath Aerojet Rocketdyne, to this day, there's an old, kind farmer still

751
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,000
 strapped to a table.

752
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,720
 Half man, half pig, eternally hungry.

753
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,000
 He can't move.

754
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,520
 He can't break free.

755
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,520
 Or can he?

756
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:48,880
 I guess the implication was that he's gonna break free tonight and get you.

757
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,000
 But he's been strapped down since 1995.

758
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 He's not going anywhere.

759
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,200
 So I think you're safe from the pig man of Chino Hills.

760
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,520
 DeadRabber... or are you?

 DeadRabberRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

765
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,120
 You don't have to listen to it every day.

766
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,840
 I'm glad you listened to it today.

767
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,560
 Have a great one, guys.

768
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:39,040
 Bye.
