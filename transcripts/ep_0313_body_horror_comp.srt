1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 The human body. Everybody has one. At least one.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 They are miracles of science the way they operate, the way they work.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 You can chase down mastodons, or you can simply shake hands with a business partner.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 But what happens when things go wrong? What happens when things get gross?

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Put down that chalupa. It's time to talk about body horror.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 It would be a good idea to not use words I can't pronounce in my intros.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Horror. Like horror movie. I swear that I'm not saying that right.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Horror movie. Anyways, speech impediments. They suck.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Let's go ahead though and say hi to our newest Patreon, IvanM.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Hey Ivan, thanks for supporting this show. It really, really means a lot.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 The support always helps me buy dumb stuff.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Like I finally got Veronica the haunted doll in.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 So she's going to be chilling with me over the weekend.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 She's very, very creepy looking with those creepy little eyes.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 But I'm sure she'll be a doll.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 And she's sitting over there right now as I'm pointing on a podcast. You can't see what I'm doing.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 But we'll keep her for the weekend. Longer than that.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 And I'll let you know if anything weird or wacky happens.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 And if you can't support the Patreon, that's cool too.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Just get the word out about the show. That helps a lot as well.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 So I was looking over my topics that I was thinking about doing.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 And I have had this topic sitting on my computer for probably a couple weeks now.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 And it's simply titled "Spider in Ear".

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 And there were so many times that I was going to throw it in. It was like a three minute long story.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 I'll talk about the spider in the ear. Talk about the spider in the ear.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 And I just was like, "Yeah, it doesn't fit the theme."

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 And so today I was looking at spider in the ear and I go, "A body horror episode."

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Like all these horrible things that can go on with the human body and stuff that's happened.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 And I'm going to cram it all into one episode. That way I just ruin one meal instead of them just popping up randomly.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Through different episodes you're like, "Oh Jason, please stop telling these stories."

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 I'm just going to find some stories like spider in ear.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 And what I found was way more disturbing and gross than spider in ear.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 But let me tell you about spider in ear.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Kansas City, Missouri.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 There's this woman named Susie Torres. Her ear hurts.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 "Ugh, what's going on with my ear?"

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 "She can't reach into it." You're not supposed to reach into it anyways.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 But you can't figure out what it is.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 You guys, I guess I already told you what's in the ear from the topic.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Anyways, skip ahead. She goes to the doctor.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 There's nothing to skip ahead. These are all my notes.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Susie Torres, pain in ear, ghost of doctor, medical assistant.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Both of those words are misspelled by the way.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Medical assistant runs out to get more people.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Not other medical personnel. Just, "Hey you, off the street. Come here. Hey, you're still in groceries. Come in here, guys. Everybody."

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 This is how detailed my notes are.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 That's why people go, "Hey man, you got that detail wrong."

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 I'm literally reading my notes right now.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Ghost of doctor, medical assistant runs out to get more people.

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 More people come in. It's very, very specific, Jason.

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Here's an actual quote.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 "I think you have an insect in there."

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Pulls out a brown recluse.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 All the notes I have are the story. And it's really what the story is.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 They just, she goes out. The medical assistant went out and got doctors.

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Other medical personnel. They came in. They pulled out a brown recluse, which surprisingly didn't bite her.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 My buddy's mom got bit by a brown recluse. They almost had a chopper arm off.

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 It started to rot away. Brown recluses are nasty.

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 But anyways, I was like, "Oh yeah, I've always wanted to tell that story. I think it's super creepy."

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Who doesn't have earaches or unexplained aches and pains?

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 I covered that story a long time ago about the person with the running nose and it turns out their brain was leaking.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 It was cerebral fluid dripping out of their nose all over the Thanksgiving dinner.

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 That was the Thanksgiving special, actually.

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 So I always liked those stories that highlight stuff that happens to everybody,

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 but it turns out to be something absolutely mortifying.

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 So I was like, "Ooh, body horror. Let's do some more body horror stuff."

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Strap in, guys. If you're eating, just put it away.

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Eggs Benedict or eating Benedict Arnold. Put it in both the way.

72
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Put away your time travel device and your cannibalistic appetite. Put it away.

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 We are going first off to Arizona.

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Sunny, sunny Arizona. The state that never sleeps because the sun never sets.

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 The year is 2014 and this woman has Alzheimer's.

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 There's some dark stuff coming too, guys. This woman has Alzheimer's.

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 I should have warned you before I said that.

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 This woman has Alzheimer's and she's sick.

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 And her son's taking care of her.

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 And the doctors are like, "It's so weird because she doesn't have the gene for Alzheimer's."

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 This woman, Doris, she didn't have the gene to get Alzheimer's, but she had Alzheimer's.

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 And the doctors are like, "We'd really like to steady her brain after she dies."

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 "We'd like to have her brain donated because we think the gene may have mutated or something like that."

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 And the son's like, "Yeah, no, that's totally fine. Anything that can help someone else in this position."

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 So when the mother passes away, he goes to donate the body and nobody could take it for whatever reasons.

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 It's really actually hard to donate a body in a lot of places.

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 So there's a place in Arizona called the Biological Resource Center.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 And they said, "We will take your mom's body and what we aren't able to donate or sell will cremate and send back to you."

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 And he's like, "That's perfect." And they've actually done a lot of stuff like this.

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Now, he sends the body out and they end up getting sued.

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 Biological Resource Center ends up getting sued a lot.

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Well, actually, they became a criminal trial because there started to be some suspicions about what this place was up to.

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 So the feds eventually raided the Biological Resource Center in Arizona.

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Kicked down the door.

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 And what they find in this place where people, they had it set up that they would come to your house, take your loved one's body for free.

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 And then to make their money back, they would sell and donate body parts around and what wasn't left.

97
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 It was the same thing with this guy. They would send you back in cremation.

98
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 So you're like, "This is pretty good because I'm not having to be charged for cremation. I'm not having to be charged for the body removal."

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 It's a win-win. Somebody gets like this arm to experiment on.

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 The math scientist poking it with needles. It's alive. And I get the ashes back.

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 So all these suspicions started. The feds kicked down the door of the Biological Resource Center.

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 They find just bodies stacked up. No identification tags. Just torsos.

103
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Just do-do-do-do-do-do. Like Jenga blocks. The guys like trying to pull out an arm.

104
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Things all wobbling. Feds kick down the door. They're like, "That doesn't count. That doesn't count."

105
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Feds made it wobble as the giant wall of torsos falls down.

106
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 They find like a cooler. You know, like you got a little cooler. You put your Bud Lights in.

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 It's a hot summer day in Arizona. Drinking a...

108
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Full of penises. Just full of junk. Literal male junk.

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 The tour de force of this macabre setting. So the FBI agents are in your facility.

110
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Like it's one thing when your apartment's messing and you bring a girl home to your apartment.

111
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 And you're like kind of like kicking the rats underneath your couch.

112
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 You have a truce with them. You're like, "Don't come out when a girl comes."

113
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 They're like, "Okay. Can we make her a dress?" You're like, "Yeah, yeah, fine."

114
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 But she can't see you making it. It's one thing to do that.

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 It's one thing to have a messy apartment and bring your girl home.

116
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 It's something different when there are federal agents in your business.

117
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Your business is messy and your business is body parts.

118
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 But even that, that's bad. That's bad. Cooler, full of penises is bad.

119
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 But somebody took the body of a man, a large man, and chopped the head off.

120
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 They did. They didn't get the body like this. Okay? So they got a human body.

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 They chopped the head off the man, took the head of a small woman, put it on the body,

122
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 sewed it together, had it stand in the corner.

123
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 There's no amount of... You could say, "Oh, listen officer,

124
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 normally we keep our penises in a certain storage area, but there was a power outage.

125
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Had to throw them in a cooler." How do you explain the body with a woman's head?

126
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Like there is no explanation for that.

127
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 So anyways, that dude who ran the place, his name was Stephen Gore, ironically,

128
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 he ends up getting like probation for all of this stuff.

129
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Now he's currently facing a civil lawsuit.

130
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 So you go. What does any of this have to do with Doris, the woman who died of Alzheimer's?

131
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Well, she was donated to this place. Was she the tiny head on the body? No.

132
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Was she one of the torsos stacked up? No.

133
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 What happened to her was, it all came out because the FBI investigated all this stuff.

134
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 The son found out about this. Was that...

135
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Admittedly, I've been thinking about the story. I go, "If it was my mom, how would I feel?"

136
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Versus, "If it was me, it'd be pretty dope, honestly."

137
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 So, and I think, I mean, if it was my mom, I probably...

138
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 I might be a little upset, I don't know, but again, it's kind of badass.

139
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 So what they did, Biological Resource Center, took her body and sewed it to the U.S. military.

140
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 The U.S. military's like, "Yes, we got another corpse."

141
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 They'd take the body out to the middle of nowhere.

142
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 It wasn't middle of nowhere, it was a training ground. They didn't take it out to Kentucky,

143
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 and they're like, "Come on, boys, let's test this."

144
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Take it to a training ground, strap the woman to a chair.

145
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 A 74-year-old woman, they strap it to a chair, put a bomb underneath it,

146
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 *blows air* blow her to pieces.

147
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Now, the reason why they... they wasn't just they were bored,

148
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 they're like, "Man, what are we gonna do? Hey, we got a budget of a couple billion,

149
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 let's go buy some corpses."

150
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 They wanted to see what would happen when an IED hit a human body.

151
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Now, to be fair, I think we're pretty clear on that at this point.

152
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 They blow up, they disintegrate, but they kind of keep doing it for some reason.

153
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 What are you gonna get from that? They're like, "That's weird.

154
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 ISIS has the best bombs against 74-year-old corpses, gentlemen.

155
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 We're losing this war."

156
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Like, you know it's just gonna disintegrate this old lady.

157
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 But anyways, the sun's really upset about it, and he's part of the lawsuit as well.

158
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 He goes, "When I had my mom donated there, I didn't think you guys were gonna blow it up in a chair."

159
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 But again, think about it, you're like, "That's awful, Jason."

160
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 If my mom... here's the thing, if my mom got tied to a chair and blew up in real life,

161
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 it'd be devastated, and I would probably become a vigilante.

162
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 But, if my mom... my mom passes away, heaven forbid, or I pass away,

163
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 or any of my loved ones pass away, and I'm like, "I hope they're in a better place."

164
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Someone's like, "They are, but their body was blown up by the US military."

165
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 I would be like, "Ura."

166
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 And I would just salute.

167
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Because that's dope.

168
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 How many people can say that the US military personally, on purpose, blew them up?

169
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 I mean, I guess millions of people can say that, but still, it would be awesome.

170
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Okay, let's go ahead.

171
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 And if you think, Jason, that's not really body horrific, that's just an old lady being blown to pieces

172
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 in a couple body parts in a cooler.

173
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 We're just getting started, man.

174
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 We are going now to, of course, Florida.

175
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 It's August 2019.

176
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 So, what was that, two months ago?

177
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 Cops sit in the police station, nothing to do, Florida's pretty peaceful place.

178
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 It's like lowest crime rate, nothing ever happens there.

179
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Cops are sitting around, super bored, phone rings.

180
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 "Bring, bring." Apparently they have a phone from the 1980s.

181
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 They pick up the phone, they go, "901, what's your emergency?"

182
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Click, and the person hangs up, and they're like, "Well, you gotta send out some units

183
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 because that's awfully suspicious."

184
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 So some cops go out, they trace the phone call back.

185
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 The cops go out to this house, bang, bang, bang.

186
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 They weren't shooting, they were not, they were knocking on the door.

187
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 They just don't show up at the house and go, "Pfft, someone hung up here.

188
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 Pfft, keep shooting, call for backup."

189
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 They go to the house, knock, knock, knock.

190
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 And door opens up, 74 year old man, a lot of elderly people in this episode.

191
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 74 year old man named Gary Van Ricewick opens the door.

192
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 Looks creepy, he has a mug shot, so you kind of know where this story's going, or do you?

193
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Creepy looking old man. Officers are like, "Sorry to disturb you sir,

194
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 but we got a 911 call hang up from here. Do you mind if we take a look?"

195
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 And the old man's like, "Yes, I do mind."

196
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 I don't know what he sounded like, and I don't know what he said, but he does.

197
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 I'm not gonna make that part of, the old man, he's a hunchbacked, he's like, "Come in, officers."

198
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 We had a 911 call from this house. What's going on?

199
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 And the guy's like, "Listen, man, I don't have a hunchback, and my voice doesn't sound super weird,

200
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 but I do have a unique fetish. I like cutting people's balls off."

201
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 And they're like, "Ugh, gross."

202
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 And, and I didn't, you didn't let me finish officer, I just did it in there.

203
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Did you see that room right there? They're like, "I was wondering where that blood puddle was coming from in the morning."

204
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 He's like, "Yes, there's a man in there, cut his balls off."

205
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 And he won't stop bleeding. The cops are like, "Get out of our way, why'd you have to tell us that old story?"

206
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Cops push him out of the way, walk into the room.

207
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 There's a young man sitting there with a towel in between his legs, just blood everywhere.

208
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 And his balls are sitting in a jar on the dresser.

209
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 So after both police officers get done vomiting, they're taking turns.

210
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 One guy's asking questions, the other guy, "Bleeeeh."

211
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 And he's like, "Okay, my turn, my turn." It's not good cop, bad cop.

212
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 It's throwing up cop, not throwing up cop.

213
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 So anyways, after they get done just eliminating whatever they had left in their stomach,

214
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 they call for medical assistance.

215
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 The dude had to be rushed to the hospital because he was dying. He just was bleeding too much.

216
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 So they arrest Gary, take him downtown, and they go, "What is going on here?"

217
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 And he's like, "Listen, the guy was totally willing to do it. We met on Discord."

218
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Apparently there is, this doesn't surprise me, there's a subculture for getting castrated.

219
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 It's a sexual fetish to be castrated and then whatever.

220
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Then it's like, "I don't understand what the step is after that. Yay, my balls are gone."

221
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 That's a fetish you can only do a single time.

222
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 Most fetishes are like, "Oh, I'm really into feet or boobs or hairs."

223
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 I think we talked about that before. The number one fetish is hair, and the number two fetish are boobs.

224
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Because technically they're not sexual organs, but people are...

225
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 We've sexualized them, but anyway, feet is the third most popular fetish.

226
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 But anyways, most fetishes you can do over and over again. Like a castrate...

227
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 What do you do? Do you fantasize about being castrated?

228
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 And then that's like, whatever, that's disgusting. But then you get castrated and then...

229
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 Do you fantasize about remembering about it? I don't get it. I don't get it at all.

230
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 How that would even work. But anyway, so they get their balls chopped up.

231
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Is the moral of the... The moral is what happens.

232
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 Now, we're back, we're talking to Gary, and he goes, "This isn't my first rodeo."

233
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 And literally, I used to work on a farm and I used to castrate balls.

234
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 So I'm good at it. And they're like, "Apparently not, sir."

235
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 A man almost died and they're like, "Ah, you don't understand. You don't understand the world I come from."

236
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 You don't have the balls. And I mean that literally. Because as long as you... Wait, does that joke make sense?

237
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Anyways, anyways, forget that. Forget that. The officers are just sitting there in blank silence.

238
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 As Gary's trying to figure out if that joke made sense, he's like, "Never mind, never mind."

239
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 I castrated myself, actually. I cut off one of my own balls in 2012. The world was ending.

240
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 I figured what the hay sat down on the bed with a knife. Cut open my net-sec.

241
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 Ball rolled on out. And they go, "Why didn't you chop off the other one?" That was my question.

242
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 Why would you stop there? Maybe he had a fetish for only having one ball?

243
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 He was a big Lance Armstrong fan? I don't know. But... super bizarre. The whole thing's bizarre.

244
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 And then he says, this isn't even the first time that that's happened. And they're like, "What do you mean?"

245
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 He goes, "Oh, a while back I rented a hotel room, met a guy on Discord."

246
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 That's another reason why I'll probably never have another Discord. I met a guy on Discord.

247
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 And he came to my hotel room. I cut his balls off with my knife, with my special knife.

248
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Apparently this guy had a whole... like one of his rooms was like an operating suite.

249
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 He had like a special table, medicines for blood clotting, special knives.

250
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 So he's admitted to doing this twice. His fetish may just be like fantasizing about doing it.

251
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 I have no idea what's going on with this story. But he says, "I did it before."

252
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 And I cut the balls off and he was bleeding. But he just got it and went to the hospital and it got taken care of.

253
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 And here's the important detail. It never got reported. And this happens a lot. This happened with the Jeffrey Dahmer case.

254
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 When one of his victims ran out of the house right into the arms of two police officers and said, "Save me, save me. This guy is nuts."

255
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Jeffrey Dahmer... the kid was like 14 or 15. I think he was 15 or 16.

256
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 But Jeffrey Dahmer, who was late 20s, comes out of the house and goes, "Oh, this is just my gay lover. We're just having a spat."

257
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Dude was handcuffed and naked and bleeding out of the butthole at the time.

258
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Jeffrey Dahmer comes out and he tells the officers, "Hey, this guy... we're just gay lovers. It's just this spat. Don't, you know, sorry. He's a little drunk."

259
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 Obviously underage, naked man in handcuffs with a bleeding butthole.

260
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 The cops let Jeffrey Dahmer take him back into the house, where Jeffrey Dahmer then drills a hole in his brain and tries to make him into sex life.

261
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 The cops have just... they've been devastated by that. But the thing... they said this was the thing.

262
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 We weren't comfortable reporting it because it was all in this gay subculture and we didn't know what was legit and what wasn't.

263
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Like, is this something that gay people normally do? Because the story took place like... and I think it was '88, '89.

264
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 So there's no will and grace. The police officers basically were just like, "We'd rather not deal with this."

265
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 It wasn't like, "Oh, we hate gays and we hope this guy's gonna get eaten."

266
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 They're like, "We don't know what they're into. We don't know what's going on."

267
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 And so they let him go back in. And I think that's what happened this first time. This guy went to a hospital with no testicles

268
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 and the doctors could obviously see that he was castrated and they didn't report it to the authorities.

269
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 They didn't say, "Hey, we have a guy who just came in here who voluntarily had his balls removed.

270
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 You may want to find out who did this because they're practicing medicine without a license."

271
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 This guy almost died and it's most likely he'll try it again. But they didn't report it.

272
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 The doctors were just like, "We don't know what weird fetish you're involved in. We don't want to know.

273
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 We don't want to know if this is normal or what. We're just gonna patch you up and send you on your way."

274
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 And you go, "Well, it's none of the doctors' business. Nowadays in America, maybe it's just in Oregon and California,

275
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 but I'll go to the doctor for a foot when I busted my foot up. I go to the doctor and they ask me,

276
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 "Do I feel safe at home?" And I'm like, "Well, other than the ghost in my closet, that's a little dicey situation,

277
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 but yeah, I feel safe at home." So the doctors do have obligations to ask you about certain things.

278
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 You can go to the doctor for pretty much anything and they'll see if you're a victim of domestic violence.

279
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 I have no problem with that. I think that's totally fine for the doctors to ask.

280
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 And if you think it's another business, you lie. But I mean, it's good that somebody's asking,

281
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 because a lot of times people never even ask those questions.

282
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Guy walks into a hospital, no balls. The cops don't even ask. They can tell it was--

283
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 it's not like he was like, "Oh, I was walking and I tripped and I fell on a lawn mower."

284
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 Like, they know they were removed on purpose. Don't report it.

285
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 Now Gary's in jail for practicing medicine without a license.

286
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 And the funniest part of this whole story is just the idea of dudes sitting around cutting each other's balls off on purpose isn't hilarious.

287
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 It's kind of gross. But Oxygen News, Oprah's main news network, the hard-hitting journalist of Oxygen News,

288
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 who's writing this whole story about-- I got it from a couple different stories, but I'm reading the Oxygen article.

289
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Oxygen True Crimes, what it's called, because nothing says Oprah like serial killers and testicles being removed.

290
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Here is this quote at the end of this article from Oxygen News.

291
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 "This victim has not been named in reports. According to Buzzfeed--" Oh, great. Okay. They're involved in this too.

292
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 "According to Buzzfeed, his testicles were transported with him to the hospital.

293
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 But it's unclear if they have been reattached."

294
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Hopefully not, because what's gonna happen is he's gonna wake up and he's like, "Oh, the nightmare is over," and he looks down.

295
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 He's like, "No! Yes, he's two giant balls!" He's like, "No!"

296
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 He's just gonna get him cut off again. Which, going back to my original thing, it's a fetish you can only do once.

297
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Wouldn't it be awful if a guy kept having them cut off and then put back on and letting them heal and then having them cut off again?

298
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Ugh. Anyways, let's move on to our next-- that would be the ultimate evolution of that fetish.

299
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Castration, attachment, castration fetish. I probably just invented that, so I'm sorry, Universe.

300
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Let's move on to our last one here.

301
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 Our last story. Ivan's like, "Hey, man, I'm really glad that you said thank you to me on your podcast, but next time could you not do one on the episode?"

302
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 That involves castration and moms exploding? Really, really appreciate the show, but pick a different episode next time.

303
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Let's go ahead and move on to our last story. Oh, quick Dead Rabbit Recommends, because this was another-- I was like, this is perfect for this episode.

304
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 You guys have all heard of the Human Centipede, but the Human Centipede's okay, it's a typical low-budget horror movie that all hinges on a gimmick.

305
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 I wouldn't even rank it in the top 100, top 500 horror movies. It's really just kind of a middling horror movie with the great gimmick.

306
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 However, the Human Centipede 2 full sequence is a masterpiece of a horror movie.

307
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 It is so good, and it has just these amazing elements and all these little things just add up to this incredibly creepy narrative.

308
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 The movie is about a security guard who never taught-- I think he might have one line of dialogue in the whole movie.

309
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 He has to sell the whole movie just by how gross and creepy he is.

310
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 He is a security guard who watches the Human Centipede all day long, so he sits in that underground parking lot and that's all he does is watch the Human Centipede.

311
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 He lives with his mom, and he keeps a diary of the Human Centipede, and he's in his mind building his own Human Centipede.

312
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 Tom Six is an amazing horror director, and I really want to see him do like a haunted house movie.

313
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 I really want to see him do like a demon possession movie, because he just has an eye for horror.

314
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 Human Centipede 2 full sequence is a masterpiece of a horror movie.

315
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 There is some controversy about the ending.

316
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 I will tell you this. You got to listen. You got to listen after the ending, and you'll get what I mean.

317
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 The ending isn't the ending you think it is, but it is a great-- I would put Human Centipede full sequence in probably top 20 horror movies of mine.

318
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 I love that movie.

319
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 It's super disgusting and very creepy and disturbing, and even watching the trailer I had to turn away or flinch a couple times because it's really brutal.

320
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Sound design is amazing. Cinematography is amazing. It is great.

321
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 Human Centipede 3 final sequence was okay, but coming off of the second one, nothing can beat that.

322
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 This plot of the third one is a prison warden watches Human Centipede 1 and Human Centipede 2 and decides to make that part of his plan for punishing prisoners.

323
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 And the star of Human Centipede 2, the big gross-looking fat guy, is his assistant at the prison.

324
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 TomSix just does some weird stuff with his movies. He shows up in the third one. It's all bizarre, but Dead Rabbit recommends Human Centipede 2 full sequence.

325
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 True body horror.

326
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 Let's go ahead and move on to our last topic here.

327
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 We're going to end this kind of around the world. A lot of these are medical reports, so we don't have a ton of information about where they happen for privacy reasons.

328
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 I really tried looking. Then I got to the point where as I was looking, photos started to appear and I'm out.

329
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 I'm out.

330
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 So, so let's, these are all kind of around the world. So they've happened, this has happened everywhere. This has happened everywhere, really.

331
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 This dude in New Delhi, we'll start off in New Delhi. So we're in New Delhi, this 30 year old dude and his buddies are hanging out.

332
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Now I don't know if they're drinking, I don't know if they're partying. I don't know how this starts, but at some point this guy sitting there, he's probably like hitting on some chicks.

333
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 He's like, "Hey, hey, what's up girls?" "Yeah, dude, how you doing?" "Yeah, my name's..." Whatever. I don't have a name. I'm mysterious.

334
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 And while he's doing this or whatever action he's taking place, again, I don't know, his buddies go, "You know what would be funny?"

335
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 You see that air tire pump over there? It's not like one that you like stand on and go, "Pfft, pfft," with your hands. It's like a "psshh," like a "pump, pump."

336
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 They go, "Hey, you see that over there?" They're like, "Yeah." "Dude, you see him talking to that girl?" "Yeah, you know what would be really funny if we like put this in his butt hole and turned it on and then he would like jump up and grab his butt and the girls would laugh because they wouldn't know what was going on.

337
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 They're like, "Oh, that'd be hilarious." So they sneak up behind him, "Dude, dude, dude, dude." And he's just like, "Hey, yeah, so yeah, I play soccer. I mean, I play football."

338
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 Wait, in India, do we call it soccer or football? And while he's trying to figure that out, they stick the air pump in his butt hole and for one second, "psshh," they put air up into his butt, "pffh," completely obliterates his rectum.

339
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 It's called rectal blowout. And I had to do all this research on this stuff. What happens is when the air is pushed out of an air pump, it becomes, in a sense, a solid. It has the physics of a solid.

340
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 So it would be like if you stuck a brick up someone's butt hole. And that's what it did. He's like, "Oh, ha ha, falls to the ground. The girls run away." He's like, "Oh, what'd you guys do? What'd you guys do?"

341
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 And they're like, "Oh, we just put this up your butt hole for one second, taken to the hospital." The doctors say, when this happens, they go, "It looks like wounds we see in battlefields."

342
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 He goes, "Some doctors like that's weird. I saw a 74-year-old woman with a similar wound back in training." It completely just shreds your insides.

343
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 He had to end up getting his colon completely removed and now he has like a bag. And I don't know if it's one of those bags that hang out or one of the bags inside. I don't know.

344
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Anyways, he has a bag now. So those friends must feel terrible because they're like, "Hey man, you want to hang out?" He's like, "Yeah, you want to clean my bag, you jerk?"

345
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 And they're like, "Yeah, I'll clean your bag. Sorry about that. They're washing it out, putting a little lice all in it." I don't know how they work.

346
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 Anyways, the point is, is that he has no more colon. So you think that's bad. Your friends stick an air hose up your butt, blow it away. You're alive. You know, that's pretty good.

347
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 A lot of people die from this. There's a video on YouTube in India. It happens a lot in India. It must be either super bored or have a lot of air compressors over there.

348
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 There's this dude working in a factory in India. It might not be on YouTube, but it is on the internet because it was on one of the articles.

349
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 This guy's working in a factory in India and his co-workers are like, "Oh, you know what would be so funny?" And they show him put the nozzle to just the back of his pants but like aims it right for the butthole,

350
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 which is pretty good accuracy. I can't straight up no scope a butthole. Like, I have to... They kind of are in different... They're all in the same place but it's like the size of the butt and everything like that.

351
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 I couldn't do this. But anyways, the boss or the co-worker, I don't remember which one, sticks the... This was an actual air compressor, sticks it against the pants to the dude's butthole, pulls the trigger.

352
00:27:47,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 The guy dies a day later. I mean, it just completely shreds him open. Normally they do die. But it happens a lot. People in Japan, some guy was working in a factory and the workers go, "Hey, wouldn't it be funny if we..."

353
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 And your stomach tends to bloat out. It's like if you put your lips to someone butthole and went, "But your breath was Superman's breath. Just completely destroy you."

354
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 You're like, "Jason, you're just gonna tell stories about people's buttholes being blown up until you say that our radio is the daily..." No, no, no. Well, kind of.

355
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 But a lot of people die. A couple of people get their colons blown out. I want to end it with this. Because I just find this just beyond... I don't know if I find it hilarious or what.

356
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 But anyways, I find it hilarious. This guy... If it happened to me, it wouldn't be very funny. But this guy was working at a gas station. He's a clerk working at a gas station, he's looking at his watch.

357
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 He's like, "Oh man, I can't wait till I get out of here. This sucks." And then all of a sudden some robbers come in. "Give us all your money, give us all your money."

358
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 He's like, "Time slows down." And he's like, looking at everything around. What can he use to fight against these robbers? He's looking. And he's like, "Yeah, I can't really find anything."

359
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 He puts his hands up. The robbers start to come around the corner to get his money. And then he's like, "Oh wait, now I thought of something. My hands!"

360
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 And he starts fighting the robbers, right? And he's like, "Pfft, beating them up. Doing flying jump kicks. Oh, they're flying across the room. Makes a key energy ball. Throws it.

361
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 And the robbers know that they can't get... This isn't a medical journal. Not he wasn't doing flying jump kicks. Or the key energy ball.

362
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 But this story, the meat of the story actually happened. So anyways, he beats off the robber. That's the wrong one.

363
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 He finally finishes off... That's wrong too. He finally stops the robbery in progress, right? And one of the suspects is like running away.

364
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 "I'm out of here." And then the second one, he refused to be beaten. And while our vigilante hero... Is it a vigilante if you're defending yourself? Just a hero.

365
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 While our hero is standing there perfectly still. This is true. The villain, the villain of the story, the robber grabs an air compressor nozzle.

366
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 I guess you knew that was going to figure in here some way. And in one last desperate attempt, he knows he can't get the money at this point.

367
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 The robbery is over. But he can get revenge. He sticks the air compressor up the hero's butthole. Turns it on. Blows the douche right to him.

368
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 And then this guy lives as well. Just completely obliterated as coal. And the doctor said they could see poop floating around in him.

369
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 Completely destroyed the intestines and all that stuff. So anyways, he lived. He lived. He has a bag too.

370
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 I find that story so funny because... Well, funny might not be the right word. But imagine... We've all imagined like...

371
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 Oh no, we're in the building. We're the only ones that aren't... You know what's funny? It used to be terrorists have taken over the building.

372
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 Terrorists have taken over your workplace, your school or whatever, but you are outside of... Not outside the building.

373
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 You're like, "I'm going to Dairy Queen." You're outside of their capture radius. You're like in the bathroom at that time.

374
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 Or you happen to be crawling through the vents. You're like, "It's my break." Crawl through the vents.

375
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 We've all had that fantasy. We've all had that fantasy. Man or woman, I don't care. Young or old. You've had that fantasy about terrorists taking over a place you're at

376
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 and you having to fight your way out and like freeing people and stuff like that. I think now it's turned to mass shooters, honestly.

377
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 I think now it's no longer like the organized Eastern European terrorists. They're like, "Get in the freezer and you happen to be like hiding in the oven of Godfather's Pizza."

378
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 They're walking by. You're like, "Grab one, pull him into the pizza." They're like, "Where did Ivan go?" "Sorry, Ivan..." "Sorry."

379
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 Yes, Ivan M is also now an Eastern European terrorist. There goes that Patreon donation.

380
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 Now I think you're trapped in a mall and some crazy kid comes in in a trench coat with an M1 and is just like, "Pop, pop, pop, pop."

381
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 And you're like hiding in a giant teddy bear and then you jump out and you grab him. So I think it's weird. I think that fantasy has evolved from the terror.

382
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 We're like, "What the hell?" "Oh yeah." Anyways, I think it's so funny because you have these fantasies where it's like it's you and all these armed robbers come in

383
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 and you're like, "Ah, fighting them and picking them up, throwing them down, energy-keyball." Doing all this stuff.

384
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 And never in my wild... There have been times where I've been like, "Oh yeah, dude." And then the terrorists come in and I'm like hitting them in the face of the shotgun

385
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 and I'm like, "Stay down." All that stuff, right? And never in a thousand years. Oh, maybe I would have gotten shot in the shoulder.

386
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 Or maybe I would have even gotten shot and killed, but at the last minute I'm like, "I die, but you lose."

387
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 And I have their detonator and they're like, "No." And I blow them up or whatever. Whatever stupid fantasy.

388
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 And I know I'm not alone, so I know I'm totally fine saying all this stupid stuff. But never in a wild...

389
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 Maybe I'd get shot, maybe I'd get captured and punched in the stomach a couple of times. Maybe I would live, maybe I'd die.

390
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 Never in 43 years of having these hero fantasies of me fighting bad guys that I ever imagined once that Hans Gruber sticks an air compressor up my butt hole.

391
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 Ever. Never would have even occurred to me that at the last minute when I think I have the terrorists on the edge of the building,

392
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 he's like, "You may kill me, but I kill your butt hole." And I shoot him and I'm like, "I wonder what that meant."

393
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 "Ugh!" And then my stomach explodes. The world is weirder than anything you could possibly imagine.

394
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 The fact that you stop a robbery and then the last laugh is 200 cubic feet of air being pushed into your body is bizarre to me.

395
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 Absolutely bizarre. I never would have imagined that. I don't think anyone would have imagined that. The only person who thought of that was that robber who didn't want to be defeated.

396
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 Stuck that air compressor up his butt hole. It's interesting because this story comes from a medical journal, there's no follow-up.

397
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 There's no like article where the police arrested the guy and it turns out that he was a collector of air compressors.

398
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 He knew all about them. His father invented the air compressor. None of that. We don't know if the guy ever got arrested.

399
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 We don't know if the guy's just colon got exploded and the robbers were never identified. Who knows? He could still be out there.

400
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 Next time you're at a gas station pumping gas, that guy could be behind you and he's looking over at that air pump and he's like,

401
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 "If only I could trick him to come a little bit closer." He's like, "Hey, can you come here? Think of my tires flat?"

402
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 And you're like, "Yeah, sir. I'll come over there."

403
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 You feel a little nozzle touch your butt hole. And you're like, "He strikes again. He strikes again."

404
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 So that is basically our body horror episode.

405
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 I wanted to do something different today. I like doing something different on Fridays.

406
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 And today you may be like, "Jason, you just read a bunch of news and then laughed during it."

407
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 And that's true, but it's spooky, spooky Halloween month and there's nothing spookier.

408
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 There's nothing spookier than the madness of another human being.

409
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:13,000
