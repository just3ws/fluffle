00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,240
 Today is David Lynch's birthday, and if you don't know who David Lynch is, you could say he's the godfather of Dead Rabbit Radio.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,000
 Amazing filmmaker.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,500
 And today we're going to take a look at three stories that have a lynching twist.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:21,200
 The first off, we're going to cover a conspiracy theory that actually involves David Lynch himself.

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,800
 A very bizarre piece of information.

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,900
 You may not know, that's why you listen to this podcast.

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:32,200
 Secondly, we're going to take a look at the story of a woman who just tried to enjoy a little evening by herself.

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,700
 Instead she was interrupted by an alien who acts like someone from a Lynch movie.

9
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:42,800
 And then a family is sitting at home eating a meal.

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,500
 Everything is going as it should.

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,800
 But when the sun enters the room holding a shotgun, not only do their lives change,

12
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,200
 but reality does as well. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:03,900
 [Music]

14
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

15
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,900
 I'm your host, Jason Garminer. I'm having a great day.

16
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,900
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

17
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,000
 This is going to be a special episode. It's going to be extra long.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,400
 But it's full of good stuff. It's not filler. It's extra long good stuff.

19
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:26,300
 And speaking of good stuff, great stuff actually, let's give a round of applause to our newest Patreon supporter, Sweet Sweet Golden Goo.

20
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:35,000
 She's actually liquid. She's all like CGI 1990s liquid special effects oozing into Dead Rabbit Command.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,300
 And she's also bringing along with her her beekeeper husband, which I'm assuming now that I say that out loud.

22
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:44,000
 I saw that on the notes. Is she the honey? Is that some weird?

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,600
 Is that some weird thing? He is actually a beekeeper.

24
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,200
 She's the Sweet Sweet Golden Goo. So she's going to form into like a solid human.

25
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:58,300
 And her beekeeper husband is just going to be like, "Ooh, yes. That's why I love bees. That's why I found my wife."

26
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,400
 Sweet Sweet Golden Goo, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

27
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,800
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

28
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,100
 Just helps read the word about the show. Really, really helps out a lot.

29
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,500
 Golden Goo, I'm going to touch you the keys to Jason's Loppy.

30
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,000
 Catch him in your sticky fingers.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,600
 We are going to head on out to a forest in the middle of nowhere.

32
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,300
 [gagging]

33
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,600
 It's vague. Just pick any forest. Just pick any forest you've ever wanted to go to.

34
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,000
 So as you're looking for any forest to drive through, listen, I know we have a lot of stuff to cover.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,800
 This is a jam-packed episode, but I want to start a new segment right now.

36
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,200
 And I think this will be really cool going forward. I think this will be really fun.

37
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,400
 I get a lot of stuff from emails from you guys, and I see this stuff post online,

38
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,400
 of these stupid prophecies that keep popping up all the time.

39
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,800
 And you'll see them for weeks. People are hyping them up on these conspiracy boards.

40
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,200
 They'll set a prophecy. It's like August 21st, 2020.

41
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,700
 It comes, and people are getting worried about it.

42
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,700
 People are like, "Hey, man, I really don't know what to do. What's going on?"

43
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,800
 And then it passes, and no one ever brings it up again.

44
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,200
 And then we see another one pop up.

45
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,300
 Oh, you know December 21st, 2020 is actually December 21st, 2012.

46
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,000
 And people go, "Oh, no."

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,300
 You know what? I'm going to start cataloging these.

48
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:13,200
 I want you guys to send these prophecies to me so we can mark them.

49
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,700
 And there is recorded proof. It's no longer a forum post that's disappearing.

50
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,800
 Prophecy Watch. And this one is timely.

51
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,100
 I've seen this one pop up for weeks.

52
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,200
 Prophecy Watch, the very first one.

53
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,600
 So if you're listening to this episode a couple months from now,

54
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,100
 even if you're listening to the episode today, you're like, "What? People actually believe that?"

55
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:38,700
 This is a real conspiracy that people have been buying into for a couple weeks now.

56
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,900
 On January 20th, 2021.

57
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,500
 So today, what is going to happen?

58
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,400
 Obviously, if you're listening to this, it didn't happen.

59
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,900
 What's going to happen is you are going to go to turn on the television.

60
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,800
 You're like, "I wonder what the Big Bang Theory is up to today."

61
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:59,900
 Click, you turn it on. It's actually going to be something far more entertaining than the Big Bang Theory.

62
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,300
 Military Tribunals.

63
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:07,800
 I'm going to read you this because I can't really sum it up any better than darkoutpost.com.

64
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,700
 On Wednesday, January 20th, imagine military music playing in the background.

65
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,200
 [Singing]

66
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,600
 Starship Trooper theme song.

67
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:21,200
 On Wednesday, 20th January, Inauguration Day, the emergency broadcast system will be activated.

68
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:28,700
 The FCC is telling major networks that their programming will be preempted from 8 a.m. Eastern Standard Time

69
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,900
 for up to 72 hours. If they don't comply, they will be off the air.

70
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:42,400
 10 days of darkness will begin as mass arrests of over 500,000 individuals is expected to happen worldwide.

71
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:49,100
 On the emergency broadcast system, 8 hour videos will be broadcast 3 times a day for 10 days straight.

72
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,000
 Imagine the ratings are going to be great on that.

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,700
 Hey honey, what are you watching?

74
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,500
 The military tribunals are still on?

75
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,700
 Yeah, 10 days of this.

76
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:04,000
 The videos will contain military tribunals filled with confessions of high-profile elite individuals

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,500
 exposed for their crimes against humanity.

78
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,800
 So remember when this doesn't happen.

79
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,600
 Remember when the National Guard doesn't take contri-

80
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,000
 This is the other conspiracy theory.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,100
 The National Guard, when Biden is getting inaugurated, the National Guard is going to arrest him.

82
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:26,800
 And then Space Force, apparently, is going to shut off something.

83
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,900
 Space Force was created to hit a button.

84
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:38,900
 The whole organization, they hit one button and it's going to take over or melt.

85
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,800
 I don't know, maybe Joe Biden's made a wax.

86
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,900
 I don't know.

87
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,400
 And the Marines are going to be underground and in tunnels or something like that.

88
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,600
 I just want you to remember this moment.

89
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,300
 The next time someone makes a prophecy, remember this moment.

90
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,200
 Remember the military tribunals, the Marines are underground.

91
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,200
 They created a military to hit a button.

92
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,100
 All of this stuff.

93
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,300
 And I think this is important.

94
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,900
 We're going to keep doing this prophecy watch.

95
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,800
 Whenever these pop up, I can't say I'll cover everyone because they pop up all the time.

96
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,000
 But when these pop up, I think it's important for us to cover them and to create a record of them.

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,900
 So going forward, we can laugh at these wrong predictions and be less scared when they come up more.

98
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,800
 Because this segment's gone on a lot longer than I thought it was going to.

99
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:30,000
 But I remember when Clinton was leaving office when Bush was coming in, I was petrified.

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,100
 I was like 17, 18 years old.

101
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,400
 I thought Clinton was going to bring the United Nations and he wasn't going to leave.

102
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,600
 That it was going to be this horrible thing.

103
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,100
 I was not a huge fan of Bill Clinton.

104
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,500
 I was a hardcore conspiracy theorist back then.

105
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,600
 And I was scared.

106
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,300
 I was absolutely terrified that these blue helmeted weirdos from France were going to show up in Sacramento.

107
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,500
 I mean, it's stupid now that you think about it.

108
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,100
 But that's why this is important to remember these dumb beliefs.

109
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,100
 So going forward, we have less dumb beliefs.

110
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,700
 Super long segment, important segment though.

111
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,100
 Let's get started with the Lynch stuff.

112
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,500
 I look over in Golden Goo and her beekeeper husband wearing blue helmets.

113
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,800
 I'm like, oh no, the prophecy is true.

114
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,000
 Let's talk about David Lynch.

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,300
 This episode is going to go long, but I love David Lynch.

116
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:20,100
 He's a huge influence on dead rabbit radio wouldn't exist without David Lynch without Twin Peaks.

117
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,300
 Watching Twin Peaks was a huge part of my creative childhood.

118
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,000
 I think I was like 12 or something like that.

119
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,300
 It's totally inappropriate for a 12 year old to watch, but it was a big show.

120
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:35,700
 It was a big show for me and it was all about like paranormal and conspiracies and how you have a normal world.

121
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,500
 I love the idea of the hidden world.

122
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,600
 You have this normal world filled with these beautiful people.

123
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,200
 The show definitely gave me like my type of woman from Twin Peaks.

124
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:53,000
 But then underneath it, you just have this really like seedy underbelly, this criminal element.

125
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:04,300
 And then underneath that you have the world of portals and demons and secret societies and a group of men coming together to fight this eternal evil.

126
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:11,800
 All that stuff that I really dig in both creative fiction and in my life like paranormal and hot waitresses and stuff like that.

127
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,900
 So huge fan.

128
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,700
 Now it's funny because every so often I'll find stories and I'll go, that's very lynchian,

129
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:23,000
 which is that idea you have a normal stable world and underneath it, there's this dark underbelly to it.

130
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,500
 Every so often I'll pick these stories and what's funny is I'm rewatching Twin Peaks for the third time.

131
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,500
 I'm watching it with Sabine.

132
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,800
 She's never seen it knows nothing about it.

133
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,100
 And I've been having dreams about Twin Peaks and it's very rare that I dream about television shows.

134
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,800
 I've maybe had one or two dreams about Deep Space Nine, my favorite television show.

135
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,000
 I think I maybe had one dream about Buffy and I love that show.

136
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,700
 I've had one dream where I was hanging out with the Transformers.

137
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,900
 But since I started watching Twin Peaks, I've had like three or four dreams just in the past month about Twin Peaks.

138
00:08:52,900 --> 00:09:00,100
 I actually woke up this morning and I thought, I have all these stories, these lynchian stories that I've been like,

139
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,400
 that's very lynchy and I have this kind of interesting stuff.

140
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,000
 And it was weird.

141
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,200
 I had a dream last night about Twin Peaks and I thought, I think I'm going to do a David Lynch episode.

142
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,800
 I wonder if there's any reason for, if there's any justification for me to do that.

143
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,400
 And sure enough, no joke.

144
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,600
 I woke up about 3.30 in the morning.

145
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:22,200
 I went to bed super early and I had these ideas for these David Lynch stories that I had been collecting.

146
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,300
 And it's his birthday.

147
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,000
 It's his birthday today, January 20th, 1946.

148
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 So I was like, that's weird.

149
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,400
 Right.

150
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,300
 That's totally weird.

151
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,400
 I woke up the idea to do a David Lynch episode.

152
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,600
 Turns out that it's his birthday.

153
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,300
 Also turns out that it's the day of the military trivenals.

154
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,000
 That's great.

155
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,800
 It's like peanut butter cups coming together, right?

156
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,700
 So let's get started.

157
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:46,100
 That's super long introduction, but I really wanted to set the stage and this is going to be a bonus episode.

158
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:53,000
 Because this man means so much to Dead Rabbit Radio and so much to me and hopefully so much to you guys.

159
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,800
 I think you guys should check out some of his works.

160
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,200
 It's great.

161
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,000
 Golden Goo, take off that blue helmet.

162
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,900
 You're really scaring me.

163
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:04,800
 We are headed out to a forest in the middle of nowhere.

164
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,100
 Yeah.

165
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:12,400
 This first story I have no sources for because I read it on yesterday's episode.

166
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,800
 I talked about how much I love Hollywood gossip.

167
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:19,700
 I read this story on a Hollywood gossip website called blind items.

168
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,000
 I'll put the link to the to it in the show notes, just the website itself.

169
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,500
 It's just Hollywood gossip and it's really dirty Hollywood gossip.

170
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,600
 It's not like you won't believe who Kris Jenner is dating today.

171
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,700
 It's like this celebrity murder five people and no one ever found out.

172
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,100
 It's like really dark and dirty celebrity gossip.

173
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,300
 There is stuff about like Vander Plump rules, reality shows or whatever.

174
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,800
 I don't even know that show is but it pops up all the time.

175
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,200
 I'm assuming it's a bunch of hillbilly murderers.

176
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:54,200
 How often they pop up on there, but there are stuff like, oh, you won't believe that Cardi B is cheating on the weekend or whatever.

177
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,600
 But a lot of it's really like dark and dirty.

178
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,100
 A lot of it actually like is elite conspiracy stuff like that.

179
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,300
 I actually kind of want to do a segment on him.

180
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:13,500
 There's a guy named him that's been dumping or girl that's been dumping information about sex rings and Hollywood.

181
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,800
 So I might do a whole segment on that.

182
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,300
 That's real fascinating, but I love Hollywood gossip and the dirty, the darker, the better for me.

183
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,700
 So I'm on this website a while back and I came across this little piece of conspiracy info.

184
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,000
 So allegedly, we're starting off like this.

185
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,900
 Now we're driving through the dark spooky forest.

186
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:34,000
 Allegedly, Jennifer Lynch, she's not alleged, she does exist.

187
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,700
 Jennifer Lynch is David Lynch's daughter.

188
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,300
 She's a director in her own right.

189
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:43,200
 She wrote The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer, which I read when I was 12.

190
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,400
 And then that was the book that I realized how girls masturbate.

191
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,600
 Again, it's totally not appropriate.

192
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,600
 I remember my older brother bought The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer.

193
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,400
 My parents let us watch the show, but they didn't want us to.

194
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,800
 They knew it was like on the cusp.

195
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:04,500
 It was pretty rough, but my brother bought The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer and then he let me read it.

196
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,100
 Like he read it and he's like, dude, cause he's a huge, he's a bigger, actually a bigger David Lynch fan than I am,

197
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,500
 which is kind of hard, but he gave me the book and I read it and I was like, oh, they use a bathtub.

198
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,300
 They don't, they don't always have to use a bathtub.

199
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:21,000
 But when I was 12, that's how Laura Palmer masturbates in the book.

200
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,800
 And I remember being like, I remember being like, hmm.

201
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,400
 So thank you, David Lynch.

202
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,700
 Thank you, Jennifer Lynch.

203
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,500
 Here's the conspiracy theory, though, without that weird coming of age story.

204
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,300
 And I'm reading through these blind items.

205
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,400
 They're basically anonymous bits of gossip.

206
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,800
 I've talked about them before on this show, but I come across this blind item.

207
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,500
 This has had to be like a year and a half ago.

208
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,000
 It's mighty to have been been longer.

209
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,800
 It might have been before I was doing the show.

210
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,900
 I came across this and it basically said that Jennifer Lynch, this is a legend again.

211
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,100
 Don't don't shoot me.

212
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,800
 Don't shoot me, Jennifer Lynch.

213
00:12:52,800 --> 00:13:02,000
 Jennifer Lynch wants to shoot someone in the head is what this rumor is that this daughter of David Lynch, this director,

214
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,100
 wants to shoot a man in the head on camera.

215
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,300
 She's obsessed with it.

216
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,200
 She's been thinking about it for years and years.

217
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,500
 She was in the bathtub and she's writing that book in the bathroom.

218
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,000
 She's like, oh, you know what I'd really like.

219
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,300
 You know, it really worked much better than a bathtub.

220
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,900
 She wants to shoot someone in the head on camera.

221
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:32,400
 She basically wants to film someone being killed on camera, but it has to be the fetish apparently is he has to be shot in the head.

222
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,000
 It wouldn't like if you fell into a meat grinder.

223
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,900
 She's like looking down.

224
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:39,300
 She's like, that's cool, but it'd be so much better if you got shot in the head.

225
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,400
 A bunch of birds attack him.

226
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,000
 She's like, hmm, it's not good enough.

227
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,200
 He has to be shot on the head.

228
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:50,200
 He has to be shot on camera and it has to be like she doesn't want to watch a video footage.

229
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,300
 Or like war footage of like some Kosovo soldier.

230
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,300
 She wants to see it.

231
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,400
 She wants to film it.

232
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,300
 Again, a legend, a legend.

233
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:02,100
 And so this rumor goes around that she had actually been talking to people.

234
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:10,400
 She'd been planning to shoot a movie that had a scene where a guy gets shot in the head, but they would tell the actor it was totally fake and the gun was safe.

235
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,900
 But the bullet would accidentally be loaded into the gun.

236
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:19,900
 So during the shooting of the movie, she would actually be behind the camera and go and shoot him.

237
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,000
 I mean, and action.

238
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 And then like the top of his skull would go flying off and he'd die and she'd be like, oh my God, oh my God, what happened?

239
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,300
 Did someone put the wrong bullet in there?

240
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,400
 And they're like, you're the one who loaded the gun.

241
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,500
 You bought it from Walmart.

242
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,700
 You brought it to work today.

243
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,700
 She's like, who else had the gun?

244
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,000
 They're like, nobody.

245
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,300
 That's this idea.

246
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,800
 This rumor is going around.

247
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:49,800
 This rumor that one person said and now one of the biggest paranormal podcasts, one of the fastest growing paranormal podcasts in the world.

248
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,400
 Is now repeating this rumor that I read two years ago.

249
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,700
 So what's interesting is I saw that and I immediately was intrigued.

250
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,900
 I mean, huge David Lynch.

251
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,700
 I'm like, David Lynch, I'm a fan of your work and your daughter wants to murder someone.

252
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,700
 He's like, what?

253
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,400
 He also, how's your bathtub at home?

254
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,200
 He's like, what?

255
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,700
 That's even a weirder question.

256
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,900
 Well, going to his house and taking baths.

257
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:16,700
 I read that and I was like, dude, that's super weird.

258
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,300
 Could be true.

259
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:18,900
 I don't know.

260
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,100
 I heard that Cardi B just broke up with a weekend.

261
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,100
 I don't know.

262
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,600
 It's a wacky, wacky world.

263
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,200
 But I read it.

264
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,900
 I had a little, put a little wrinkle in my brain.

265
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,100
 I thought it was interesting.

266
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,400
 Huge David Lynch fan, love all of his stuff, even a serial killer daughter.

267
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,800
 And then I watched the new Twin Peaks.

268
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,000
 So it definitely was, it was pre me watching the new Twin Peaks.

269
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,700
 So I would have had to read this back in like 2016, 2017, maybe because I watched it in 2018.

270
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,000
 But I watch, I go to my brother, I visit him.

271
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,100
 He had the new Twin Peaks and I was like, how is it?

272
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:58,600
 And he's like, I don't get it because I watched the first, he stopped watching after about 16 episodes.

273
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,800
 He goes, I couldn't figure it out.

274
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,700
 And but we, he watched it all again with me.

275
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,600
 It turned my hair gray the night I watched it.

276
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,300
 My mom dropped me off from my brother's house a couple of years ago and I was vacationing.

277
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,900
 And he's like, Hey, you want to watch the new Twin Peaks?

278
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,800
 We watched like the first five or six episodes.

279
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,000
 And then the next morning my mom picks me up and she's like, Oh my God, why is your hair gray?

280
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,100
 I go because I watched six episodes of the new Twin Peaks.

281
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,000
 It's not a joke.

282
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,800
 My hair straight up Leland Palmer turned gray.

283
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,100
 Ish, it's still dark.

284
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:31,700
 Anyways, we're watching the new Twin Peaks show and the whole show, it basically should be called Twin Peaks.

285
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,100
 Everyone's head explodes.

286
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:39,500
 Almost every single person in that show who dies, dies from rather getting shot in the brain

287
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,200
 or a hobo squeezing their head until it pops open.

288
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,100
 That's, there's a few outliers.

289
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,300
 There's the guy whose head is attached to a woman's body.

290
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,600
 And then a couple of people throw up creamed corn until they die.

291
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,100
 Creamed corn and motorwaves until they die.

292
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,500
 But for the most part, their heads explode in some fashion.

293
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:05,700
 I remember watching it and after the fourth person got shot in the brain in a super graphic way.

294
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:09,600
 I actually was like, Hey, Hey, bro, can you pause it first?

295
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,900
 I go, let me tell you this conspiracy theory.

296
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:16,100
 I heard a couple of years ago, my brother pauses it and I was like,

297
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:20,100
 So apparently Jennifer Lynch likes heads exploding.

298
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,600
 So who knows if that conspiracy theory is true?

299
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,800
 Probably not.

300
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:29,600
 But if it is true, I may have actually stopped Jennifer Lynch from murdering somebody on camera.

301
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,700
 So you're welcome.

302
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,700
 You're welcome because you shouldn't do that.

303
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,600
 So there you go.

304
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,900
 Your conspiracy theory.

305
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,500
 I'm actually because this episode is running so long.

306
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:46,500
 We're going to save the David Lynch alien story for another time because honestly out of all the segments,

307
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,600
 I think it was the weakest.

308
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,300
 I think it's an interesting thing, but I want to keep prophecy watching here.

309
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:56,100
 I definitely wanted that Jennifer Lynch story in there because she might be playing it today.

310
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,800
 She's like, Happy birthday dad.

311
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,800
 I'm going to see someone in the head today.

312
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,300
 He's like, please don't.

313
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,500
 And also you're very clean.

314
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,700
 You do take a lot of baths.

315
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,900
 She's like, thank you.

316
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,600
 We're going to save the David Lynch alien story.

317
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,500
 It was just a very surreal alien encounter.

318
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,300
 We'll save that for another time because I really want to spend some time on this last story.

319
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:19,400
 Even though I said the show is going to go long, you don't want it to go too long.

320
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,300
 You don't want to outlast your welcome.

321
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,200
 So as we're standing in the middle of nowhere, I don't know why we're here.

322
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,700
 It's just the forest is spooky and imagine behind any tree Jennifer Lynch could be waiting with a gun.

323
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:34,800
 You hear the sound of roaring bathwater and you know, she, I guess I should clarify too.

324
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,900
 It's not that she just masturbated in the bath.

325
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:37,600
 Okay.

326
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:43,500
 First, I don't know where Jennifer Lynch masturbate, but people are probably like, dude, who cares if she's a note.

327
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,700
 This is what I found out.

328
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,900
 It's not like I didn't know girls weren't mermaids and they couldn't masturbate anywhere.

329
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:55,500
 Apparently girls would straddle the faucet of the bathtub.

330
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:04,200
 So the water would hit them like hit their clitoris and be like, uh, apparently they become a vibrating recliner.

331
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,600
 When they're having sex.

332
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,800
 No, so that I was like, really, you could do that.

333
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,000
 Like I knew I couldn't do that.

334
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 I know the mechanism wouldn't work the same, but in the secret diary of Laura Palmer,

335
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,200
 I eat a secret diary of Jennifer Lynch.

336
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,900
 Laura Palmer masturbates using the water pressure from the faucet.

337
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,300
 And so yeah, there you go.

338
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,000
 You learned something today.

339
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,600
 Maybe you didn't know that.

340
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,500
 I didn't know that when I was 12.

341
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,700
 So it's not that it was just in a bath.

342
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,700
 It's the running water.

343
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,100
 I just felt like I needed to clarify that.

344
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,600
 So Golden Goo is just shaking her head.

345
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,700
 Honey is going everywhere.

346
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,400
 The beekeeper husband's like, hmm, can't wait to be home.

347
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,700
 I'll watch you take a bath.

348
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,900
 Honey, I'll watch you take a bath in honey.

349
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,300
 Honey.

350
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:48,000
 Golden Goo, I'm going to toss you the keys to the carpenter copter.

351
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,900
 We're going to build a little co-pilot thing here.

352
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,100
 So your beekeeper husband can help fly it as well.

353
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,500
 You guys are working as a team and that's awesome.

354
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:01,200
 We are leaving behind the spooky, spooky force before Jennifer Lynch can get ahold of us before she can get her aim ready.

355
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,900
 She has a laser scope on.

356
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,000
 We are headed out to Springville, Utah.

357
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,900
 Now this just happened.

358
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,800
 This absolutely just happened December 23rd, 2020.

359
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:19,200
 It's one of those stories that I read and I go, oh, this is going on a show.

360
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,000
 This is so disturbing.

361
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,800
 I'm talking about this.

362
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,600
 Golden Goo and the beekeeper land the carpenter copter.

363
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,000
 And this little suburban neighborhood.

364
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Very lynchian.

365
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,500
 Looks normal on the outside, but things just aren't right.

366
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,500
 Mike Lopez, he's a 23 year old man.

367
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,700
 He's living with his mom.

368
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,000
 He's actually living with his mom and his two sisters.

369
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,600
 His mother, Victoria Ramirez, is 43 years old.

370
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,400
 And his two sisters are Rosie.

371
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,200
 She's 14 and Donna, who's 17.

372
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,600
 Those names are made up.

373
00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:01,500
 We don't have the names of the girl, but Rosie is the youngest and Donna is the oldest daughter, the middle child.

374
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,500
 And then Mike is the older brother.

375
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,500
 Rosie and Donna and Victoria are sitting around the dining room table just eating.

376
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,800
 Eating food.

377
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,600
 You know what it sounds like.

378
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,800
 I don't need to do a sound effect for that.

379
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,200
 And Mike walks into the room.

380
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,300
 Mike is carrying a brand new shotgun.

381
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,500
 He just purchased that week.

382
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:30,400
 If you were walking into a house and you were used to seeing shotguns, your uncle's always walking around with his shotgun.

383
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,600
 He's like, you know, they're going to start broadcasting that military tribunal.

384
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,500
 Can't wait.

385
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,500
 You want to think anything of it.

386
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:42,100
 Like if your relatives are all constantly walking around with shotguns, you'd be like, oh, they're going out hunting or something like that.

387
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,100
 Hopefully that's all they're doing, right?

388
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,000
 But this was brand new.

389
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 This was new in the house.

390
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,800
 It shouldn't have been there.

391
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,700
 So immediately alarm bells go off.

392
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,400
 Why does this guy have this shotgun?

393
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:58,000
 Now we in that situation would like run or try to fight him for it or pull out our own gun.

394
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,800
 Han Solo him.

395
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:08,100
 But the way this family reacts to this is just the beginning of this absolutely bizarre story.

396
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:13,100
 Mike looks at Rosie, the youngest daughter.

397
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:18,100
 And she nods to him.

398
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,400
 He nods back.

399
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:28,600
 And Rosie calmly gets up out of her seat at the dining room table and locks herself in the nearby bathroom.

400
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:34,800
 Now Donna and Victoria are sitting at this table and here stands Mike with this gun.

401
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:40,100
 Whatever's going on seemed to be preplanned between the two of them.

402
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:51,400
 Donna gets up and follows Rosie to the bathroom and she's standing outside the door when Mike turns to his mother and aims the shotgun at her.

403
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:59,800
 Victoria looks her son right in the eyes and says quote I know you're gonna kill me and I love you.

404
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:08,000
 Mike pulls the trigger once and the shotgun tears through his mother's neck killing her almost instantly.

405
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,700
 At that point Rosie unlocks the bathroom door and walks past her sister Donna.

406
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,000
 Mike is just standing there over the body of their now deceased mother.

407
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,600
 Very, very quick, painless death.

408
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,800
 Rosie walks over and begins to pet her mother's hair.

409
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,800
 She's just leaning over running her fingers through her mother's bloody hair.

410
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:42,200
 Mike grabs his sister and lifts her up, wraps his arms around her and they slowly begin dancing next to the corpse of their mother as a song plays on the radio.

411
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,600
 Donna has no idea what's going on.

412
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:52,600
 She crawls out the bathroom window, escapes into the neighborhood, notifies the police.

413
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,000
 That is a 100% true story.

414
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,300
 That actually happened on December 23rd of 2020.

415
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,800
 We have a witness of that event.

416
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,100
 But the big question isn't did it happen?

417
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,800
 Because we have to ask that on this show sometimes as it made up.

418
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,000
 Was it you know some alien abduction or something like that?

419
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,800
 No, it did happen.

420
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,100
 The question we have in this, the question everyone has in this is why did it happen?

421
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:25,000
 And this is where it becomes less of a, well never becomes less of a true crime story, but the focus moves away from the true crime to something else.

422
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,700
 The police sweep in and they arrest him, they arrest Mike, and they take Rosie into custody.

423
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,400
 She technically hasn't committed a crime yet.

424
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,300
 They don't know.

425
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,100
 They got to figure it out.

426
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:41,300
 But based on what Donna was saying, whatever it was, it seemed pre-planned.

427
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:45,300
 So the police drag Mike into the interrogation room.

428
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,400
 Of course they're going to ask, why'd you do it?

429
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,800
 Mike looks at him.

430
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,500
 Somebody told me to do it.

431
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,600
 I'm so like, you know, is this like, I don't know, some drug deal gone wrong?

432
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,600
 Was this something you had to do to pay someone back to chill money to someone?

433
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,400
 Somebody told me to do it.

434
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,000
 Well, who are you, who's this someone who told you to do it?

435
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,800
 Do you have a name?

436
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,000
 Like what's this?

437
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,900
 Somebody told me to do it is his response.

438
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:19,700
 He leans over to the table and he tells the officers this whole thing, everything, the shooting and this.

439
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,900
 It's deja vu.

440
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,900
 I've done all of this before.

441
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,100
 This, this isn't new.

442
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,600
 They're not really getting anywhere with him.

443
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:33,700
 They had talked to Donna and they go, Hey, so listen, your brother, your brother super creepy.

444
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,200
 We haven't talked to the little sister yet.

445
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,100
 But can you fill us in like he's saying that somebody told him to do this?

446
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:43,100
 You guys owe money to some drug organization or something like that.

447
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:47,000
 Donna goes, listen, he's a big stoner.

448
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,800
 He, there are drugs involved in this.

449
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:55,600
 He's a huge stoner, but I don't think it has anything to do with any sort of drug crime.

450
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,300
 He was just stoned all the time.

451
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,800
 And when they did arrest him, he did have THC in his system.

452
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:06,000
 But there's a lot of people are stoners that don't go around shooting people and then dancing next to the body.

453
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:14,400
 Donnie goes, not only was he a huge pot smoker, but he also would give weed and smoke with his 14 year old sister, Rosie.

454
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:20,600
 And I truly believe that whatever happened, whatever this was is that Rosie knew it was going to happen.

455
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:26,600
 She said, Mike's been getting weirder than normal lately though, like he's a big pothead.

456
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,600
 But recently, I'm talking about how much meditating he's been doing.

457
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,000
 He'll just meditate all the time.

458
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,500
 And he began telling her, he began telling Donna, Donna, it's not just about the smoke and the weed.

459
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,900
 It's not just about meditating.

460
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:48,800
 I can, I can travel through dimensions now.

461
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,300
 I can move through reality.

462
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,200
 You see, that's why I'm meditating.

463
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,500
 And I'm not necessarily just getting high and finding peace.

464
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,900
 I'm moving from reality to reality.

465
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:09,500
 He also being talking to Donna about quote unquote bad people that he'd been meeting and talking to bad people.

466
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:14,200
 So the police at this point are going, OK, now over the spooky stuff, right?

467
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,200
 Never the spooky stuff.

468
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,600
 We got to stop interrogating people at 3am.

469
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,800
 This makes sense.

470
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,500
 He's into weed.

471
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,300
 He's talking about meeting bad people saying somebody told him to do it.

472
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,200
 Now we're back into the land of reality.

473
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,400
 Maybe this was a drug deal gone wrong.

474
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,300
 Maybe she was more involved.

475
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,900
 So the cops are now feel like they're a little bit more back on track.

476
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,400
 Let's go talk to Rosie and see what she knows.

477
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,900
 So they bring in Rosie and the police again at this point don't know if she's an accessory before the fact.

478
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,100
 If she's just in thrall of her older brother, they don't know.

479
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,500
 She could have been the mastermind.

480
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,100
 They don't know someone told him to do it.

481
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,800
 Maybe it was Rosie.

482
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:56,500
 They're talking to Rosie and again, they shouldn't hold these interrogations at 3am because this is where they truly get spooky.

483
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,500
 Rosie says yes, me and my brother have been smoking a lot of weed lately.

484
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,100
 That's true.

485
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:07,300
 But you got to understand we're in danger.

486
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,700
 We're just not safe.

487
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,800
 Cops are looking at each other.

488
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,500
 What are you not safe from?

489
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,000
 We never slept at the same time.

490
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,400
 See, I would sleep and Mike would sit there and watch me sleep.

491
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,900
 And then when it was time for him to sleep,

492
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:31,800
 I would stay up and watch him sleep because if we both slept at the same time,

493
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:36,400
 something bad would happen to us.

494
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:41,400
 Cops are like, "What in the world is going on? What are these people so afraid of?"

495
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:46,500
 They ask Rosie, so your sister said that after your mother got shot,

496
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,700
 you started dancing.

497
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,200
 You started dancing with your brother over the body like,

498
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,900
 "What was going through your head when that happened?"

499
00:28:54,900 --> 00:29:00,800
 And in true horror movie fashion, Rosie just looks at the officers,

500
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:09,300
 smiles, then she began slowly singing the song that her and her brother danced to.

501
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,900
 That was her only response to it.

502
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,500
 Some sort of lullaby from the ring.

503
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,300
 The police officers were like,

504
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:20,600
 "Can we turn on all the lights in the station right now?"

505
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,600
 That was her answer.

506
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:27,800
 She just smiled and then was like, "Shake it off. Shake it off.

507
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,000
 Play is going to hate, hate, hate."

508
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,900
 I don't know what song it was, but any song saying super slow by a accomplice to a murder

509
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,800
 is going to be a rough listen.

510
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:45,500
 She showed no emotion at all during the interview and it doesn't sound like Mike was a font of feelings either.

511
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:50,500
 But this is where we get to all of this stuff kind of being wrapped up in a ball.

512
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,700
 This is an ongoing story, so we'll see what else comes from this.

513
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:58,400
 But when the police ask, "Listen, your mom was shot, you're dancing over the body,

514
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,600
 you're being super creepy by singing the song, please stop."

515
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,100
 What was the meaning of this?

516
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,100
 What was all the cause of this?

517
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,800
 Why would Mike kill your mom?

518
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:12,000
 And that's when Rosie says, "Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

519
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,400
 I didn't mean to creep you guys out."

520
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,100
 That wasn't our mom.

521
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,300
 Police officers are like, "No, no, no, no, no.

522
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,800
 No, you see, that's not my mom.

523
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,700
 That wasn't our mom.

524
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,600
 That was somebody else, but that wasn't our mom.

525
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,000
 So we didn't kill our mother.

526
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,100
 Mike didn't kill his mother.

527
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,300
 I didn't mean to implicate myself.

528
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,200
 I had nothing to do with it.

529
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,500
 I just knew it was going to happen, but that's not our mom.

530
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,400
 So we didn't kill our mother.

531
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,200
 Our mother's alive.

532
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,000
 This was someone else, not our mom.

533
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,500
 This crime happened back on December 23rd,

534
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,600
 but the details are really just coming out now,

535
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,800
 these interviews and all of these things.

536
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,900
 And at this point, there's still no motive as to why they did this.

537
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,700
 But I think as fans of the paranormal,

538
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,900
 and we're looking at this show,

539
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,400
 I think we can kind of figure them out.

540
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,400
 I feel like I should be a police officer in Utah,

541
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,200
 just for this one case, and then I'll retire and get a pension.

542
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,100
 This is my theory.

543
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,800
 I think that Rosie and Mike actually convinced themselves

544
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,700
 that they were not in their home dimension.

545
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,800
 This dimension they're in now, our dimension,

546
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,200
 is not where they're originally from.

547
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,000
 This is what they believe.

548
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,300
 This is what I think they believe.

549
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,900
 And so by shooting the mother in this dimension,

550
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,000
 they technically didn't kill their mother.

551
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,100
 They killed an alternate world version of their mother.

552
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,900
 So as far as their concern,

553
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,500
 it definitely Rosie that their mother is still alive.

554
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,200
 This was somebody else.

555
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,300
 So I think that is part of her reaction to it.

556
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,400
 But everything else is so weird.

557
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,800
 Who are the bad people?

558
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,000
 Are these people demonic?

559
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,800
 Are they some sort of interdimensional beings as well?

560
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,300
 Who told him to do it?

561
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,500
 Is that some sort of, I mean, I think it's mostly delusions.

562
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,400
 I don't think they actually owed money to anyone

563
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,000
 and it was like, kill your mom.

564
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,400
 She didn't seem to be into anything like that.

565
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,700
 And Donna didn't offer any information on that.

566
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,500
 So I think the rational true crime explanation,

567
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,600
 it doesn't fit.

568
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,200
 But they may have actually thought they were moving

569
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,900
 through dimensions and they were meeting these dimensional

570
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,200
 entities that may have convinced them that maybe this was

571
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,300
 the way to get back home.

572
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,600
 Maybe they had traveled too far.

573
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,900
 Maybe she was a dark entity herself and they need to

574
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,100
 cleanse her.

575
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,700
 I think the creepiest part of the whole thing and there's a

576
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:33,600
 lot to contend with on this is the mother's reaction to

577
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,900
 seeing her son with that shotgun.

578
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:40,300
 I know you're going to kill me and I love you.

579
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,400
 And that's an interesting reaction because he Donna

580
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,000
 never said he was threatening.

581
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,100
 She goes, he was getting weirder leading up to this event,

582
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,200
 but she was never like he was chasing us around knives.

583
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,600
 He was talking about killing mom.

584
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,400
 She never made any statements like that,

585
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,600
 but the mother knew it when he just got the shotgun a couple

586
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,500
 days earlier.

587
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,200
 The mother knew when he had that shotgun.

588
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,000
 She looks at him and says, I know you're going to kill me

589
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,200
 and I love you.

590
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,100
 Horrible.

591
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,900
 Horrible.

592
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:13,500
 And truly a lynchian story.

593
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,700
 The family that seemed normal,

594
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,800
 a little bit of drug use,

595
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,500
 but other than that,

596
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,200
 no one saw any warning signs.

597
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,000
 Even people in the house just go,

598
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,400
 ah, he's getting kind of weird.

599
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,200
 But then you have the seedy dark underbelly and underneath

600
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,100
 that you may have something even more.

601
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:34,700
 Demented and demonic influence in the events.

602
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,200
 Now listen,

603
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,300
 I love the idea of dimension hopping.

604
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,100
 I love the idea of alternate realities,

605
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,100
 portals and stuff like that.

606
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,700
 I believe in those things that are possible,

607
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:45,500
 but I think they're unlikely to happen.

608
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,900
 I don't think if you smoke a bunch of weed and meditate,

609
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,000
 you're able to move through realities,

610
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,400
 but Mike most likely convinced his little sister about that.

611
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,700
 Definitely convinced himself of that.

612
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,200
 Figured they needed to kill her.

613
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,600
 I think the tragedy of this other than this loss of life,

614
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,400
 this destruction of this family,

615
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,400
 Rosie may end up facing charges at a certain point,

616
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:11,700
 but at some point reality is going to hit them.

617
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,100
 At some point the drugs are going to wear off,

618
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,800
 the psychosis will be stabilized.

619
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,600
 They'll be sitting in a cold cell somewhere in the system.

620
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:27,900
 And Mike and Rosie will realize they are in their home dimension

621
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,900
 and that they really did kill their own mother.

622
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:35,100
 But I think a darker ending honestly would be this,

623
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,200
 that Mike was right.

624
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,500
 He is from an alternate universe.

625
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,000
 And he found himself in our universe.

626
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,400
 But now he's going to be in prison for the rest of his life.

627
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:48,400
 Not only separated from society,

628
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,200
 because he's locked behind bars,

629
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,600
 but separated from his home reality,

630
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,500
 a reality where his mother still lives

631
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:01,400
 and always wonders where her son disappeared to.

632
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,200
 He was in his room one night and then

633
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,800
 he went missing without a trace.

634
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,000
 She would never think to pick up a joint and meditate

635
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,600
 and travel through the dimensions to find her son.

636
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,800
 But if she did,

637
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,300
 she may find herself in our reality.

638
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,300
 Standing over her own grave,

639
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:28,100
 and if she stands over her own grave on a cold Utah morning,

640
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,800
 she realizes she may have found her son,

641
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:37,400
 but she has lost herself in the madness of the multiverse.
