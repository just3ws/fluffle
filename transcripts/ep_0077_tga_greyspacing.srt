1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
 Have you ever seen the scariest movie ever made?

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,280
 And today we take a look at a phenomenon

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,720
 that may connect the biological self

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,080
 to the realm of the dead today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,660
 (upbeat music)

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:21,400
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,320
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,440
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,280
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,120
 I hope you're having a great day too.

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,520
 I shaved my beard.

12
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,560
 It feels really weird.

13
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,160
 I've had a beard for a year now.

14
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,480
 I've been doing play after play.

15
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,520
 I don't really like changing my look.

16
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,600
 While I'm doing plays, you know,

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,400
 there's this old Native American legend

18
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,800
 and it could just be made up.

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,920
 I don't know, I read it somewhere,

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,080
 but during Vietnam when there were Native American soldiers

21
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,960
 fighting for the US, they always had their long hair.

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,560
 And actually the story doesn't make any sense

23
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,400
 'cause they don't make you shave your head.

24
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,120
 But anyways, the story that I heard was that

25
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,680
 the longer the hair, the more connected you are

26
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,560
 to the spiritual forces of the world.

27
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,200
 And it's basically acts as little antennas for that.

28
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,840
 I'll see if I can find any sources for that.

29
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,080
 I could just be remembering something told me once.

30
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,400
 But I was hearing it in the context of that is why

31
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,480
 there's such a push for black men and women,

32
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,000
 black men to shave their heads

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,020
 and for women to get weaves and not have afros.

34
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,360
 It's because it's basically destroying their antennas.

35
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,640
 It's cutting off their connection to the universe.

36
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,920
 You know, the black community has a lot of conspiracy theories.

37
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,760
 There's a lot of conspiracy theories based around either,

38
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,040
 I mean, rightfully so, them being like subjugated

39
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,920
 and then just kind of weird,

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,920
 I think that's why you hear more about Illuminati rappers

41
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,600
 than you hear about Illuminati folk singers

42
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,680
 or Illuminati cellists.

43
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,160
 It's always like Beyonce and Jay-Z and Kanye West

44
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,440
 and all that stuff and it's never yo-yo ma.

45
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,480
 There's also a lot of like anti-Semitism conspiracy theories

46
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,680
 in the black community too.

47
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,680
 They had that one congressman,

48
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,920
 I think he was a local congressman from DC

49
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,720
 who said the Jews were controlling the weather.

50
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,400
 That was like two years ago.

51
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,880
 That wasn't a long time ago.

52
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,040
 There's just a lot of conspiracy theories

53
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,920
 in the black community.

54
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,080
 And it could just be that I find those easier,

55
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,060
 but I'm wondering how many are actually out there

56
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,080
 in like Asian communities and Hispanic communities

57
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,920
 and things like that.

58
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,520
 But so yeah, I read about people,

59
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,880
 they're the government,

60
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,600
 the government and society wants black people

61
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,440
 to shave their heads so they cut off their bodies

62
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,240
 from the universe.

63
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,840
 And the story was also talking

64
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,720
 about the Native Americans of Vietnam.

65
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,120
 That's a great way to start a show,

66
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,840
 completely vague and I have absolutely no sources for it

67
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,640
 and I will have to now spend time

68
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,520
 after I'm done recording this,

69
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,520
 finding any shred of a link that talks about anything

70
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,160
 that I just said, but I shaved my beard.

71
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,000
 What's the point of that story?

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,520
 So anyways, my face is cold.

73
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,000
 Let's go ahead and get started with the episode.

74
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,320
 Now, the intro where I said,

75
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,040
 "Have you ever seen the scariest movie ever made?"

76
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,840
 I assume that most people would go,

77
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,000
 "Oh, he's going to tell me

78
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,840
 "what the scariest movie ever made was."

79
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,840
 And I'm not actually because that's part of the question.

80
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,520
 I've seen a lot of great horror movies in my life.

81
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,320
 That's my favorite genre to watch.

82
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,520
 And I think that the movies that I think are scary,

83
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,680
 I tend to be the ones that everybody thinks are scary.

84
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,080
 Now, I've never seen the exorcist, for good reason.

85
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,080
 I think I've seen it parodyed so many times

86
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,240
 that I think a lot of the effect has been lost.

87
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,560
 Oh no, she's saying, you know, you'll suck dicks in hell.

88
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,560
 Oh no, her head's spinning around.

89
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,480
 I've seen that done so many times in so many comedies,

90
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,920
 but I think the effect is lost.

91
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,960
 But I had to list off a couple of my favorite horror movies,

92
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,040
 the horror movies that I think work

93
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,720
 on a very visceral, scary level.

94
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,200
 Alien, I saw Alien for the first time a couple of years ago.

95
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,080
 And it terrified me.

96
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,920
 It was a big, I didn't expect it.

97
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,440
 I'd seen Aliens growing up multiple times,

98
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,720
 but Alien is basically a haunted house movie in space.

99
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,440
 It's very, very effective.

100
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,640
 They, these, it's basically Cabin in the Woods.

101
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,400
 These people go to a place,

102
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,740
 they hear like a signal call, they go there.

103
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,920
 And the whole movie shot like a traditional horror movie,

104
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,480
 except, you know, everything's like white and pristine.

105
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,120
 And it's just twist after twist.

106
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,360
 It's totally creepy.

107
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,720
 I didn't know certain elements of the movie.

108
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,040
 I'm not gonna give them away here.

109
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,600
 I obviously knew about the Chess Berster,

110
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,960
 but there is a lot of stuff I didn't know

111
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,400
 about the movie, terrified me.

112
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,240
 Speaking of haunted houses in space, Event Horizon,

113
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,720
 great, great horror movie.

114
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,080
 It again is basically a haunted house.

115
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,280
 It is this isolated thing floating in the middle of nowhere.

116
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,600
 And it's like Cabin in the Woods.

117
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,520
 They have to go out and, Cabin in the Woods,

118
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,320
 I guess I should say too, if you don't know what that is.

119
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,480
 That is basically a, not necessarily a parody.

120
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,920
 It's not a comedy, but it's the only word I can think of.

121
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,360
 It is a send up of every horror movie trope you could think of.

122
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,320
 And the point is, is that all the horror movies we watch

123
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,680
 are actual rituals to prevent the dark gods

124
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,840
 from taking over the planet.

125
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,720
 So they'd have to send out a jock, a virgin, a nerd,

126
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,040
 a stoner.

127
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,900
 These stereotypes would have to be killed off

128
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,520
 by whatever thing they chose to kill them.

129
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,440
 So in a sense, you go to the Cabin and you're like,

130
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,240
 oh, let's read out of this haunted book

131
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,960
 and you read out of it and a ghost would come out.

132
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,880
 But someone else could go to a secluded hotel

133
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,160
 in the middle of nowhere and they go,

134
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,360
 oh, I wonder what happens if I open this music box.

135
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,560
 It's a really interesting movie.

136
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,360
 Cabin in the Woods is a great movie.

137
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,280
 It's not really a scary movie,

138
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,000
 but it really did lay out those tropes in a great way.

139
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 And most of these movies are like people choosing

140
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,880
 the instrument of their own destruction.

141
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,120
 Dawn of the Dead remake, I loved.

142
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,560
 Jack Snyder, it was a, it scared me.

143
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,960
 Night of the Living Dead is one of the scariest movies

144
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,800
 I'd ever seen.

145
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,640
 I saw it when I was 15.

146
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,600
 It was absolutely terrifying.

147
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,440
 I could go on and on about great horror movies

148
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,040
 that I really enjoy and they scared me on a certain level.

149
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,840
 The canal really scared me.

150
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,680
 That's a newer movie.

151
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,840
 I was dating a girl at the time

152
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,600
 and I was like, I can't finish watching this movie.

153
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,720
 Can't finish watching this movie.

154
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,840
 And she said, she ended up watching it.

155
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,000
 And she's like, dude, it's not scary at all.

156
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,160
 So I was like, oh, okay.

157
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,920
 And then I finished it and I was terrified.

158
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,680
 So I mean, you know, it works on different levels,

159
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,560
 but I'm not here 'cause this isn't Dead Rabbit Recommends.

160
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,800
 That'll be coming up in a bit,

161
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,240
 but I'm not here to tell you what is the scariest movie

162
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,160
 I ever saw.

163
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,960
 And I'm not here to discuss like the top 25 scariest movies.

164
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,680
 My question is this.

165
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,320
 Somewhere, I guess it's not a question,

166
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,440
 it's a statement, somewhere out there,

167
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,800
 there is the scariest movie ever made.

168
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,560
 A movie that regardless of your personal beliefs

169
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,400
 or regardless of your particular tastes

170
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,160
 in say, Slasher films versus Ghost films,

171
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,600
 it would scare everybody.

172
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,440
 And it exists somewhere out there.

173
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,080
 A terrifying, chilling film.

174
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,560
 I don't think anyone's ever seen it.

175
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,040
 And so that's gonna sound weird,

176
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,200
 but I was thinking about this.

177
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,120
 Imagine a movie that's so terrifying,

178
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,200
 it basically begins to shut down your brain.

179
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,160
 A movie that uses, 'cause we've heard scary stories

180
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,040
 that are terrifying, you know, that cut across cultures

181
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,000
 and cut across age groups and everyone hears it

182
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,400
 and they're like, oh, that's just kind of a chilling story.

183
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,080
 And there are certain musical cues too

184
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,400
 that are used to great effect in horror movies

185
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,080
 because they do something to the human psyche

186
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,040
 when we hear these certain musical cues.

187
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,560
 It's just like, ugh.

188
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,080
 And that's why you hear them over and over

189
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,720
 and over again throughout the ages.

190
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,720
 But film allows you to combine the two plus the visual.

191
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,760
 You have the storytelling, you have the audio,

192
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,480
 and now you have this visual.

193
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,600
 And I have a theory.

194
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,560
 I think at some point somebody made the scariest movie

195
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,040
 ever made, ever filmed, and it didn't get released.

196
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,560
 This is my conspiracy theory.

197
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,280
 I think at some point somebody made a movie

198
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,480
 that was so terrifying that the people involved in it said,

199
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,280
 we're never gonna release this.

200
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,480
 You could go, Jason, that's ridiculous, but hear me out.

201
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,640
 I think that has been created.

202
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,120
 Something so cold and disturbing and dark

203
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,840
 that just by watching it, it terrifies you.

204
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,040
 You could say something like a Serbian film

205
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,680
 might come close to that.

206
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,680
 But I don't think that, I think that's more of like a human,

207
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,400
 I think that's more of like a human psychological horror

208
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,600
 than kind of what I'm going for.

209
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,200
 And I sat, I came up with this idea a couple years ago

210
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,160
 and I really thought about all the movies that I had seen

211
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,080
 and I'm like, none of the movies I've ever seen

212
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,820
 and I've seen some really crazy things.

213
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,520
 I go, none of the things that I've ever seen

214
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,920
 would really fit that category.

215
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,920
 I obviously watched it and went on with my life

216
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,400
 and wasn't affected by it.

217
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,520
 And in movies, we'll see movies and books

218
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,580
 and things like that that drive you mad when you read them.

219
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,760
 But it does something like that exist in a real world.

220
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,440
 And I started to think about it and I go,

221
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,080
 it probably would fall under a couple different,

222
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,040
 there'd probably be a couple different qualifications

223
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,040
 for this.

224
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,960
 I figured it was probably made in the 60s or early 70s,

225
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,440
 which when film was super experimental

226
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,640
 and they were pushing the boundaries,

227
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,200
 I think it would have been made

228
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,760
 by a completely independent director,

229
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,840
 it probably a first film that we've never,

230
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,880
 this person's never made another movie.

231
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,600
 Now I'm right on the street, very scary movie,

232
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,680
 especially when it first came out.

233
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,160
 I was okay when it came out.

234
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,760
 But when you have a studio behind it

235
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,800
 and they're able to have the marketing team

236
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,240
 and things like that, this movie would have

237
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,220
 none of that stuff.

238
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,880
 This movie is most likely foreign

239
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,480
 and I'm thinking most likely Italy.

240
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,680
 And then my second guess is would be France

241
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,360
 or South America.

242
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,440
 I just have a feeling this movie's out there.

243
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,640
 I have a feeling that there's this movie that was made

244
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,800
 that wasn't meant to be watched.

245
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,600
 I think the people who made it honestly thought

246
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,520
 they were just making another horror movie

247
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,120
 by the combination of the right writer,

248
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,460
 the right director, the right cinematographer.

249
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,680
 It created something that wasn't meant to be watched.

250
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,920
 Now, you could say snuff films and stuff like,

251
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,000
 I'm not talking about that.

252
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,280
 It may have those elements in it,

253
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,880
 but snuff by itself doesn't make a movie more scary.

254
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,320
 It makes it grosser.

255
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,880
 But if you're watching a movie and you're like,

256
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,600
 oh no, that guy who got shot,

257
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,040
 the director really shot him with a gun.

258
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,280
 You'd be like, ugh.

259
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,780
 It doesn't make the movie scarier.

260
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,160
 It just makes the movie more disturbing.

261
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,160
 This movie I think would border on like profane, unholy.

262
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,680
 By simply watching it is like an act against the cosmos.

263
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,960
 Does this movie exist or is this just something

264
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,240
 that I've thought about?

265
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,720
 Like is this just some sort of thought experiment?

266
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,800
 The chances of me talking about on the podcast

267
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,880
 and the chances of someone listening to this podcast

268
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,520
 knowing what I'm talking about, it's infinitesimal.

269
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,880
 This movie that was made may no longer even exist.

270
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,160
 It was probably highly experimental

271
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,160
 and pushed the boundaries of storytelling

272
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,040
 and music composition and directing.

273
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,800
 And here's the question too, if this movie did exist,

274
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,880
 it's almost like a ring video, but a narrative form.

275
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,280
 Maybe not even a narrative.

276
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,000
 On The Office, they had an episode where Gabe

277
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,280
 was a fan of something called Cinema of the Unsettling.

278
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,860
 He said the best film in that movement right now

279
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,960
 was an hour long video of a squirrel with diarrhea.

280
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,320
 And he makes this movie, it's all these intercut shots

281
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,460
 like the ring and it's just all this disturbing stuff

282
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,240
 happening around the office and gross stuff.

283
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,360
 And someone goes, what's it about?

284
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,360
 And he goes, I don't know.

285
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,480
 Maybe the director knew that even a narrative

286
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,320
 provided some comfort.

287
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,120
 It does have to be like an hour plus.

288
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,000
 A short film that's just creepy imagery,

289
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,200
 I don't count that, a film is what I'm talking about.

290
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,560
 If you knew this film existed and you knew that

291
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,640
 the people who made it were like,

292
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,600
 please don't watch this movie.

293
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,600
 It's going to really, really mess with your head.

294
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,360
 Like we made it and we realized that it was such a bad thing

295
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,320
 we never released it.

296
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,360
 Would you watch that movie?

297
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,280
 I think I would watch it if they said,

298
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,880
 listen, it's really, really disturbing

299
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,040
 and you're gonna have nightmares.

300
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,080
 I would be like, okay, I'll give it a shot.

301
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,040
 If they told me that this watching this movie

302
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,800
 will open a portal and it will cause you

303
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,320
 to descend into madness, I don't know.

304
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,880
 I swear it's out there.

305
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,440
 I swear that movie's out there.

306
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,920
 And people will be like, oh, you know what?

307
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,960
 You like "Mungo," oh, watch the "Pokipsy" tapes.

308
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,440
 I'm talking 10 levels below that.

309
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,480
 Oh, watch "Martyrs."

310
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,000
 Again, I'm talking way below that.

311
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,840
 Those still had movie studios behind them

312
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,120
 or movie studios bought them and distributed them.

313
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,600
 August Underground, "Mortem."

314
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
 I'm not talking about that.

315
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,560
 Just keep going down, somewhere down there.

316
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,600
 This movie exists.

317
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,600
 It's probably on some 16 millimeter reel

318
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,600
 in some rich man's collection of just like insane objects.

319
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,920
 Or maybe the government has it.

320
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,480
 I don't know, but I'm sure it's out there.

321
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,540
 I do wanna do, and this is kind of related.

322
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,440
 I do wanna do a "Dead Rabbit" recommends.

323
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,580
 I wanna do more of these, especially during October

324
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,920
 'cause I think a lot of people are looking

325
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,360
 for scary things to watch.

326
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,400
 I was about 16 years old.

327
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,240
 I was playing the Sega Genesis.

328
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,960
 My mom had gone out on a date

329
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,600
 with the man who would eventually become my stepfather.

330
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,360
 I'm up late and I'm playing Sega Genesis.

331
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,600
 My mom doesn't watch horror movies to begin with,

332
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,360
 but I'm sitting there, it's late at night,

333
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,400
 and the door, she comes in the door of the apartment

334
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,640
 and I go, "Hey, mom," and she just stares at me.

335
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,560
 So my mom's just looking at me,

336
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,560
 and then she goes, "Don't ever watch

337
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,340
 "in the mouth of madness."

338
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,700
 Just walked down the hallway to her bedroom,

339
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,180
 and I'm like, "Holy shit, I have to watch this movie now.

340
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,140
 "What the hell?

341
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,060
 "I've never seen a human have a reaction

342
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,540
 "to a movie like that."

343
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,580
 "In the mouth of madness" is one of my favorite horror movies.

344
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,220
 It is, and I've seen, I saw it back then,

345
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,900
 and I've seen it multiple times throughout the years.

346
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,540
 It holds up incredibly well.

347
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,140
 It's John Carpenter's best,

348
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,140
 (sighs)

349
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:49,200
 It's John Carpenter's best film, I'll say it.

350
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,760
 I think it's better than The Thing.

351
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,160
 That's debatable though, we could go back and forth on that.

352
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,440
 It's the story, it's a mystery horror film

353
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,240
 where Sam Neill is an insurance investor,

354
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,720
 insurance investigator,

355
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,160
 and a top horror author goes missing

356
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,600
 a couple weeks before his newest novel

357
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,640
 is supposed to come out in the mouth of madness,

358
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,080
 and Sam Neill is hired to investigate him

359
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,300
 or they have to pay out the insurance claim.

360
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,100
 It's very old school horror,

361
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,500
 Lovecraft type stuff like that,

362
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,540
 where you take a normal person

363
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,460
 and you set them on this mystery,

364
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,980
 you set them on this course

365
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,160
 that is going to take them into this super dark world.

366
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,660
 Sutter Kane is the name of the author.

367
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,420
 What he does is he is basically

368
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,900
 their equivalent of Stephen King.

369
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,520
 He writes these books,

370
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,740
 and they all have to do with eldritch horrors

371
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,780
 and stuff like that, Dark Gods.

372
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,140
 And his latest book coming out

373
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,200
 is In the Mouth of Madness.

374
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,720
 It's the number one book, everyone's reading it,

375
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,560
 and what is going on in the backdrop

376
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,640
 is as Sam Neill is investigating,

377
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,520
 trying to figure out where Sutter Kane is,

378
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,120
 riots are breaking out

379
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,200
 throughout cities across America.

380
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,280
 His fans are basically becoming psychopaths

381
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,320
 and then turning into monsters, basically.

382
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,080
 That is maybe the first 30 minutes of it,

383
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,440
 and it just gets weird from there.

384
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,780
 In the mouth of Madness is effective on so many levels

385
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,620
 because you don't really know anything more

386
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,620
 than the Sam Neill character does.

387
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,060
 I think he's pretty much in every single scene.

388
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,260
 He is you.

389
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,100
 There's no scenes of really people sitting around

390
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,620
 discussing things about him.

391
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,220
 The line between reality and dream is constantly blurred.

392
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,560
 The line between reality and fiction is constantly blurred.

393
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,440
 The movie is incredibly well shot.

394
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,660
 Everything looks creepy.

395
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,060
 Everything feels like a nightmare,

396
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,640
 and all the effects are practical.

397
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,780
 That's one of the things I love about John Carpenter

398
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,060
 is that the creatures look like

399
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,260
 they actually exist in the world.

400
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,620
 I think there's maybe two or three CGI effects

401
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,740
 in the whole movie,

402
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,540
 and you, I can see why it really disturbed my mom.

403
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,020
 There are still scenes from that movie.

404
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,300
 You're driving along at night,

405
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,780
 and you remember that scene in the mouth of Madness.

406
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,740
 It's a great horror film.

407
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,380
 If you have seen it, you know exactly

408
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,220
 what I'm talking about,

409
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,380
 and you're like, "Yeah, that movie was dope."

410
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,220
 If you haven't seen it,

411
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,540
 it is a great way to kick off Halloween month.

412
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,940
 Watch in the mouth of Madness.

413
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,260
 I can't give anything more away

414
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,040
 because to tell you anything more,

415
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,380
 I'd have to explain.

416
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,200
 If I had to explain one scare in the movie,

417
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,140
 I'd have to go on for another 20 minutes to be like,

418
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,600
 and that's what's effective about it.

419
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,680
 There are not so much jump scares

420
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,800
 as they are escalation of the events

421
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,240
 that you've seen before.

422
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,440
 It's not like the Conjuring

423
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,400
 where they're like, "There's a ghost in here.

424
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,540
 "There's a ghost in here."

425
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,380
 Whoa!

426
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,640
 It's like this,

427
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,120
 this, that creepy thing that's happening right now

428
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,320
 is simply an escalation of the previous 20 creepy scenes

429
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,340
 that you've seen.

430
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,660
 So it's constantly growing,

431
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,820
 and you feel that tension,

432
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,060
 and it's just in the mouth of Madness,

433
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,500
 great soundtrack too.

434
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,420
 It's that old school '90s heavy metal.

435
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,420
 I love it.

436
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,340
 I love every minute of it.

437
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,700
 In the mouth of Madness, Dead Rabbit recommends that.

438
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,020
 Okay, so what we're gonna talk about now

439
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,260
 is from the conspiracy iceberg.

440
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:02,260
 This one is TGA gray spacing/paranormal debug.

441
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:06,420
 Generally, the two terms are used

442
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,700
 in conjunction with each other.

443
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,680
 So TGA gray spacing, a lot of times you'll see,

444
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,600
 people go, "What's TGA gray spacing?"

445
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,120
 And people go, "You gotta investigate paranormal debug."

446
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,120
 People say, "Well, what's paranormal debug?"

447
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,120
 And they go, "You have to investigate TGA gray spacing."

448
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,560
 So it was a bunch of circular stuff in the beginning.

449
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,440
 I didn't really know where to start.

450
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,400
 TGA, a lot of people don't know what it stands for.

451
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,360
 Even I'm pretty iffy on it now.

452
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,920
 Dot TGA, which is normally how it's posted,

453
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,960
 is like a graphics file.

454
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,400
 And so people were thinking dot TGA gray spacing

455
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,620
 had to do with hiding information in a photo.

456
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,860
 That's fairly well known.

457
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,580
 You can hide information in photos quite well.

458
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,340
 A lot of times spies will use that.

459
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,260
 They'll post a photo of a girl sniffing a flower.

460
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,420
 But if you have the right software,

461
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,020
 when you download that photo,

462
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,820
 you can access the information on that photo.

463
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,220
 Sometimes it's hidden in the metadata,

464
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,660
 but sometimes it's actually hidden in the photo itself.

465
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,940
 So that's not really conspiracy theory work.

466
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,180
 It's known technology.

467
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:05,500
 And then TGA's also can refer to a lot of acronyms

468
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,060
 of institutions and things like that.

469
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,240
 I was checking all of them out.

470
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,320
 Like Thailand's good associated or therapeutic.

471
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,320
 Therapeutic goods associated was one of them.

472
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,760
 It's some conglomerate or some sort of facility

473
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,600
 or something in Australia.

474
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,440
 It doesn't matter.

475
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,960
 But what was tripping me up was that the two terms

476
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,320
 were constantly being used in conjunction with each other.

477
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,520
 So I started to think, well, TGA gray spacing,

478
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,800
 even though that's quite vague,

479
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,360
 it must have something to do with paranormal.

480
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,800
 Now, this is interesting too,

481
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,880
 because TGA gray spacing,

482
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,720
 this actually showed up on a very, very early version

483
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,920
 of the iceberg.

484
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,220
 I have icebergs, the iceberg meme from quite far back.

485
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,680
 This one actually showed up,

486
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,200
 'cause I've been collecting them at this point.

487
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,600
 Let me pull this up here.

488
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,120
 So this actually showed up on an iceberg in May of 2016.

489
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,240
 Most of the other topics didn't show up until

490
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,020
 January, February of 2017.

491
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,120
 So this was very, very early on the conspiracy theory list.

492
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,420
 TGA gray spacing paranormal debug.

493
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,780
 How are they connected?

494
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,240
 What I had to do,

495
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,160
 and you're gonna have to hold my hand here,

496
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,760
 and we're gonna go on a bit of a journey.

497
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,400
 We're gonna take a leap of faith.

498
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,120
 'Cause at this point, I got my sources,

499
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,900
 but you have faith that this journey's

500
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,580
 going to lead somewhere.

501
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:23,580
 So I believe TGA means thalamogeniculate artery.

502
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,600
 I'm sure there's an easier way to say that.

503
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,600
 It's the part of the brain that helps provide blood

504
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,080
 to the thalamus.

505
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,800
 So the thalamus, what it does,

506
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,060
 thalamus functions as an important relay

507
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,500
 and integrative station for sensory signals

508
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,940
 and motor information,

509
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,340
 passing to all areas of the cerebral cortex

510
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,140
 and then a bunch of other brain stuff.

511
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,220
 It also regulates consciousness, sleep and alertness.

512
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,360
 So basically it is in charge of your sensory organs.

513
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,300
 Everything from touch to sight tastes things like that.

514
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,940
 And it, like I said, regulates consciousness.

515
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,860
 So you're like chasing out of all of the options

516
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,100
 of what TGA can mean.

517
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,700
 Why did you focus on this artery

518
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,760
 that provides blood to this thalamus?

519
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,600
 The other ones I looked at,

520
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,460
 because this has been a heavily requested story,

521
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,400
 people want to know what it is

522
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,840
 because it's been around on the iceberg for so long.

523
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,520
 People thought TGA, like I said, meant the graphical file.

524
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,840
 Some people have thought it meant transient global amnesia.

525
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,440
 But neither of those fit with paranormal debug.

526
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,360
 I think that the TGA gray spacing,

527
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,200
 and we'll get into the gray spacing in a second,

528
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,900
 but the TGA, it's basically providing the water

529
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,200
 to the tree that is the thalamus.

530
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,380
 If that analogy works, it's basically,

531
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,480
 it basically is keeping that part of your brain alive.

532
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,920
 There's other veins that go into that,

533
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,200
 but that is an important one that goes into the thalamus.

534
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,940
 You're like, Jason, you don't know what you're talking about,

535
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,600
 brains and it's fair, fair enough.

536
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,060
 Like I said, hold my hand and go on this journey with me.

537
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,600
 I'm sure there's some brain surgeon out there

538
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,640
 who's like, God, this kid's an idiot.

539
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,560
 But think about it as if the thalamus represents

540
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:08,560
 the consciousness, then the TGA is the thing

541
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,640
 connecting it to the rest of your body,

542
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,780
 providing that your biological functions

543
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,960
 going into your consciousness,

544
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,160
 keeping that part of your life.

545
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,180
 So stay with me, we're going somewhere with this.

546
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,920
 Gray spacing, like I said, a lot of people are like,

547
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,880
 I don't know what that means,

548
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,520
 or that it has to do with the gray spacing of a file,

549
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,720
 maybe it's high stuff.

550
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,240
 This is what took me the longest to find.

551
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,560
 What was the gray spacing?

552
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,840
 And I had settled on the TGA thing,

553
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,560
 'cause I was like, okay, it's related to consciousness

554
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,480
 and sensory organs, and that has a lot to do

555
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,360
 with how we experience the world around us.

556
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,320
 What is gray spacing?

557
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,760
 I finally figured it out.

558
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,040
 I had a thumb through an old book

559
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,640
 and had to get some more clarification

560
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,860
 because it wasn't a book written for people like me.

561
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,320
 It was a book written for people who know,

562
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,120
 three dollar words, gray spacing

563
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,080
 is actually a geographical/social term.

564
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,600
 And what it means is that when a city is growing

565
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,280
 and beginning to absorb the rural communities around it,

566
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,240
 there's this problem.

567
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,200
 On the white side, you have law and order

568
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,240
 and social society.

569
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,680
 And then on the black side,

570
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,520
 you have crime, devastation, and death.

571
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,320
 And that's in any given society.

572
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,760
 The gray spacing is the quasi-legal things

573
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,600
 that happen in between.

574
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,960
 So you have the law saying,

575
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,080
 this is how things absolutely work.

576
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:41,200
 We do not allow anyone to sell cigarettes

577
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,880
 without them being manufactured in a factory

578
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,560
 and sold by a distributor.

579
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,400
 That's the law.

580
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,160
 And then the dark side would be like,

581
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,040
 you know what, we're just gonna grow our own tobacco

582
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,880
 or weed or whatever and we're gonna roll it

583
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,200
 and anyone can smoke it as long as they pay us.

584
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,680
 Where the gray spacing would work in that?

585
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,560
 The gray spacing in that scenario

586
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,080
 would be the liquor store owner

587
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,760
 who buys cartons of cigarettes

588
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,800
 from a distributor like normal,

589
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,680
 but then he allows customers to buy looses.

590
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,960
 He allows customers to come in

591
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,600
 and just buy a single cigarette.

592
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,200
 Technically, it's not allowed,

593
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,080
 but a lot of times the government will turn a blind eye

594
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,160
 to that type of behavior.

595
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,840
 He is following the rules to an extent

596
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,560
 and he's not doing the horrible things,

597
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,520
 he's not creating the bad laws,

598
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,000
 he's just selling looses,

599
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 which technically again is against the law,

600
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,200
 but it's in that gray space.

601
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,200
 The gray spacing in a social element,

602
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,480
 like in the bigger form,

603
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,760
 it means you have laws that are set up for everybody

604
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,120
 and then you have these subjugated communities

605
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,600
 that are kind of pushed into ghettos

606
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,120
 and then they kind of filter through society

607
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,000
 and the gray space is them not being able

608
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,480
 to come completely up into the white,

609
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,600
 into the light side, into the law and order side

610
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,120
 'cause they're still subjugated,

611
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,080
 but they're also not pushed down to the point

612
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,560
 where they're starving to death in the ghettos.

613
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,480
 So that's where that term comes from.

614
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,120
 It's a combination between in cities and social societies,

615
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,880
 you have people who follow and enforce the rules

616
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,760
 and then you have people who break all the rules

617
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,960
 and then you have the people who live

618
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,880
 in that quasi-zone in the middle

619
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,680
 of not necessarily lawlessness, but not necessarily,

620
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,600
 totally accepted as part of society.

621
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,120
 So this is why, so now we have gray spacing,

622
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,640
 we have TGA, paranormal debug,

623
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,080
 I think just plays into that

624
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,440
 and it's gonna play into this explanation as well.

625
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,640
 And I think it's funny 'cause yesterday

626
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,360
 I was talking trash about mediums

627
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,320
 and now I'm gonna give them a little bit of wiggle room.

628
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:43,400
 If science and the physical world around us

629
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,800
 is the law and order,

630
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,120
 it is what we know, it is what is told,

631
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,000
 it is what is enforced to us,

632
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,080
 because if I jump, I don't fly away,

633
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,400
 I am held down by the laws of the universe.

634
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,000
 The black side, the dark side would be

635
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,520
 the removal of those laws 100% completely.

636
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,060
 You, it would be complete universal chaos.

637
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,960
 You would have to remove yourself completely

638
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,640
 from this realm, which is what would happen,

639
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,080
 let's say when you die.

640
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,440
 Your spirit is no longer contained by the laws of physics.

641
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,600
 There is no, doesn't have to worry about gravity

642
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,520
 or light or time or energy or anything like that

643
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:28,320
 because it is the opposite of following the law.

644
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,600
 It no longer has those physical sensations.

645
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,240
 What would be the gray space in that situation?

646
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:38,240
 I think the gray space would be a ghost.

647
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,280
 It is something that is no longer following the laws 100%

648
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,960
 yet it's still, if you're on a three story building,

649
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,240
 it still walks on the floor of that three story building.

650
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,120
 It doesn't fall, it still has tangible things that it does.

651
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,520
 If there is a painting on your wall, complete chaos,

652
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,720
 darkness would mean that painting doesn't exist

653
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,120
 on nine dimensions above where you're standing at

654
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,720
 and law and order would be for me to move that painting.

655
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,440
 I actually have to physically touch it.

656
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,120
 In the gray space, the painting exists in that ghost reality

657
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,640
 but do they actually have to put out their index finger

658
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,120
 and tap it slightly or can they just affect it through

659
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,560
 another means that we don't know about?

660
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,440
 This is, I know you guys are like Jason,

661
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,020
 you're really reaching here.

662
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:32,020
 But what if, what if TGA gray spacing slash paranormal debug

663
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:36,280
 is the explanation for why some people can see

664
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:40,200
 and interact with ghosts and other people have never had

665
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,560
 a paranormal experience their entire life?

666
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,660
 What if it is related to how your thalamus works?

667
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:50,400
 What if it's related to how you receive information?

668
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,640
 Because you, I mean, you could both be looking at a painting

669
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,560
 and I could say that the painting's red and they go

670
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,760
 and you go, no, that painting's pink.

671
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,680
 You could be colorblind, I could not be colorblind.

672
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:03,840
 I could have more colors in my verbal repository.

673
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,840
 I don't know if that's a term,

674
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,240
 but I can look at a painting and go, that's magenta

675
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,040
 and you look at the painting and go, no, that's red.

676
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,160
 I've always thought it was weird.

677
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,000
 The reason why girls know so many colors

678
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,640
 is because they have to know so many colors.

679
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,540
 If you've ever walked down a makeup aisle in your life,

680
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,860
 you will learn a hundred different words for the color red.

681
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:23,180
 Does that mean that women can differentiate color

682
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,600
 better than men can?

683
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,480
 Does it just mean they have a better vocabulary

684
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,640
 for explaining it?

685
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,480
 There's a little off topic,

686
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,000
 but I mean, so the point is, is that what if it's not

687
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,720
 so much about being more spiritual?

688
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,740
 What if it's an actual biological constraint?

689
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,360
 What if some people, what if some people,

690
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,320
 their brain is so highly regulated to the law

691
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,200
 and order, the science side of things,

692
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,960
 that a ghost could walk right by them

693
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,000
 and they would never even see it.

694
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,120
 They wouldn't feel the coldness on their skin.

695
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,040
 They're in that white law and order sign.

696
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,160
 If it doesn't exist in the physical world,

697
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,000
 it doesn't exist and they can't see it

698
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,080
 or feel it or hear it or anything like that.

699
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,160
 Then other people who are more towards the dark side,

700
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,760
 and I'm not saying dark side spiritually,

701
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,480
 but more towards the edge of the reality,

702
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,960
 they see it all the time.

703
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,760
 They go to church and they pray and they feel the tingle

704
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,120
 in their skin as the Holy Spirit envelops them.

705
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,880
 Or they're walking through a creepy house

706
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,400
 and they hear a noise and they turn

707
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,200
 and the person sitting next to them

708
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,960
 has a different brain chemistry.

709
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,000
 They can't hear or see anything at all.

710
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,200
 They could be sitting in the same church,

711
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,800
 listening to the same hymn.

712
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,600
 They could be walking down the same dark hallway.

713
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,240
 They could have had the same life experiences,

714
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,320
 even have the same religion and the same superstitions.

715
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,520
 But the one person's brain is more tuned chemically.

716
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,280
 I'm not talking magic or anything here.

717
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:47,040
 His brain is more tuned to be able to sense those things

718
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,080
 than this person who doesn't.

719
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,840
 I know people all the time who believe in ghosts

720
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,120
 and never seen a ghost before.

721
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,920
 I never had any ghost experience

722
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,440
 until I was 17 years old, believed in my whole life.

723
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,400
 What if that's the debug?

724
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:03,400
 What if there is a way to fix it?

725
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,240
 To make it so you don't see ghosts?

726
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,560
 Maybe there's a way to fix it the other way

727
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,680
 so that you do see more ghosts.

728
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,180
 What if that's the conspiracy?

729
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:15,280
 What if there would be a reason

730
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:20,280
 to switch that switch on and off in people unwillingly?

731
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,760
 What if you could take people who had never seen a ghost

732
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,640
 before and never had a religious experience before

733
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,480
 and adjust them chemically so they see those things?

734
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,680
 Same notion, but the other way.

735
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,400
 What if you were, say, a government

736
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,880
 and you thought too many of your people

737
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,060
 were worshiping a particular religion

738
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,520
 and you introduced some sort of chemical

739
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,440
 into the food supplier, the water supply or whatever,

740
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,440
 to make them less open to seeing those things,

741
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,080
 to feeling those things,

742
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,040
 to feeling the Holy Spirit inside of them.

743
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,160
 What if you could shut that off?

744
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,120
 What if you could debug it?

745
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,240
 You're fixing a program.

746
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,080
 You could go either way.

747
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,200
 You can make your population very scared

748
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,200
 because all of a sudden people

749
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,240
 who had never seen a ghost before

750
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,160
 are seeing ghosts everywhere.

751
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,720
 Or you can make people wake up and go,

752
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,720
 that's weird, I've been to church for the past month

753
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,760
 and just doesn't feel the same.

754
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,720
 I don't feel that connection to God anymore.

755
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,480
 Now, of course, I have no proof of that.

756
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,260
 I have no proof that anyone's actually doing that.

757
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:24,280
 But again, I think it's always interesting

758
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,660
 when there's stuff on this list

759
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:32,180
 that seems like a just a combination of words.

760
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:35,760
 And yes, yes, anyone can stretch anything

761
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,820
 to mean anything.

762
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,640
 But everything did kind of come together.

763
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,920
 It's just a weird thing to think about.

764
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,960
 Is there, would there be a benefit

765
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,960
 to a government or an institution

766
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,080
 to make people more likely or less likely

767
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,200
 to have spiritual experiences?

768
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,840
 I didn't plan it.

769
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,800
 I actually, this is a little bit of serendipity

770
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,160
 'cause I did not plan this when I started the show,

771
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,160
 but it's interesting because that does tie back

772
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,160
 to the whole idea of having people cut their hair

773
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,140
 to cut them off from the spiritual.

774
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,440
 What if they've perfected that?

775
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,440
 And I say they like it's some sort of group,

776
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,520
 but let's just for, you know,

777
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,440
 what if someone has perfected that

778
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,800
 and has figured out a way to cut people off

779
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,240
 from that gray space that shows us

780
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,440
 that there is something else out there.

781
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,080
