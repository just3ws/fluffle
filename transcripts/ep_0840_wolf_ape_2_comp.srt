1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
 A man is sued for slander.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,380
 His crime?

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:11,920
 Watching a once in a lifetime paranormal event and telling the world about it.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,360
 And then we travel to the Fresno Valley in California to take a look at a bizarre cryptid

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:23,360
 that's been described as half wolf, half ape, and is it possible that by studying this

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:29,900
 monster we can finally figure out why we can never prove cryptids exist?

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,900
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:42,840
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,680
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,640
 I hope you guys are having a great day too, I hope you guys have some cool plans for the

11
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,640
 weekend.

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,720
 We got a lot of stuff to cover so we're gonna get started right away.

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,360
 First I'll take a look at this awesome fan art that I got from Chime Chilly.

14
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,920
 Chime Chilly, longtime listener of the show, longtime supporter of the show.

15
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:07,000
 Drew this, it is very ICP reminiscent, it reminds me of one of the jester boxes or joker boxes

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,400
 or whatever from them.

17
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,880
 I do not know if Chime Chilly is a juggalo, but I really do love this artwork, it's quite

18
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,640
 trippy, very very enjoyable.

19
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,680
 Thanks for sending it over Chime.

20
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,960
 And then walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now, let's give it up to one of our

21
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,000
 thanksgiving contributors.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,640
 Give a big round of applause to Turtle Bandit.

23
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,640
 Wooo!

24
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,800
 Walking in super slow.

25
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,000
 Come on in Turtle Bandit, you can make it.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,280
 Turtle, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

27
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,240
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

28
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,200
 Just help spread the word about the show.

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,000
 Tell your friends, tell your family, tell everyone about it.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,320
 That also helps the show grow and I really really appreciate it.

31
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,040
 So as we're framing up this picture, so crazy looking, I'm looking at it on my desktop right

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,040
 now, those eyes are trippy.

33
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,120
 As we're putting that up on the wall, Turtle Bandit, I'm gonna toss you the keys to the

34
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,640
 Dead Rabbit Durgible.

35
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,480
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

36
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:07,560
 We are flying all the way out to Wentworth, England.

37
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,860
 The year is 1687.

38
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,560
 And there's a man known as Captain Barnaby.

39
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,200
 He is just coming home from vacation.

40
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,160
 And he gets back to Wentworth, England and his wife is waiting for him and she goes,

41
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,320
 "Oh Captain!"

42
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,600
 She calls him Captain too, she works on his boat.

43
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,960
 "Oh my loving husband, what have you been doing this whole time?

44
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,920
 You didn't tell me you were going on vacation.

45
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,080
 You left me here alone?"

46
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,160
 No, they start meeting with each other.

47
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,160
 Now he had been gone for a couple months.

48
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,400
 This was in 1687.

49
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,360
 So when you go on vacation, you really go on vacation, he had left behind Wentworth,

50
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:46,320
 England and was vacaying with a couple of his buddies on an island known as Strombole

51
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,480
 over near Sicily.

52
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,480
 And they're catching up on news, right?

53
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,240
 He's just talking about all the great stuff he did on his vacation and she's like, "Well,

54
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,200
 actually he had to do chores and stuff."

55
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:02,320
 And she tells him, "Hey listen, you know our neighbor, Mr. Booty, while you were gone,

56
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,320
 he went for a cab..."

57
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,880
 While you were gone all these months, Mr. Booty died.

58
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:13,360
 And Captain Barnaby sits and looks at his wife and says, "I know.

59
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,880
 I knew he died before you told me."

60
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,680
 This is a really bizarre story.

61
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:26,240
 What it is, it's where we have a paranormal event actually have real world legal consequences

62
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,680
 and I love these kinds of stories.

63
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,760
 We'll get to the meat of the matter right now.

64
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:37,520
 What happened was on May 15th, 1687 on the island of Strombole, which is a volcanic island

65
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,200
 near Sicily, this is a vacation spot.

66
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,520
 A bunch of people are chilling here, boats are always dropping off people, picking up

67
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:50,440
 people and part of this vacation crew during this time was a couple captains, Captain Barnaby,

68
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:55,080
 who's the star of our story, Captain Bristow, Captain Brewer and then a friend of theirs,

69
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,800
 he's just a merchant, he can't boss anyone around, Mr. Vaughn, I guess he can boss his

70
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,960
 employees around.

71
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,560
 And they're all on this island, they're hunting rabbits, there are other people having fun

72
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,360
 on this island, there's a bunch of furries trying to save the rabbits, they're like,

73
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,920
 "No, no, don't you that one, I'm in love with it."

74
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,600
 All this stuff is going on.

75
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:23,320
 But on May 15th, 1687 at 3.44pm, a bizarre event happens that at least 30 witnesses saw.

76
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,400
 And we know that because this is a court case, very, very interesting, that's why we have

77
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,680
 exact date, exact time.

78
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,240
 As a bunch of people are getting ready to disembark from their boats, the three captains and Mr.

79
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,480
 Ball are leaving the island.

80
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,440
 And they have a bunch of people gathered at this pier.

81
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,840
 Someone points out, "Look, look at that, look at that!"

82
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:49,600
 And everyone turns and they see two dudes running, it is said that they ran faster than normal

83
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,000
 human could run, they obviously could tell something supernatural was happening, it

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,560
 wasn't just a friendly little jog, these two guys are running around the island.

85
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,280
 One is being pursued, again, you can obviously look at the first guy and he has a panicked

86
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,440
 look on his face, he's terrified.

87
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,080
 And before anyone can do anything, I smell like they could catch up to these guys either.

88
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,960
 Captain Barnaby is looking at this along with 29 other people and he goes, "What, what,

89
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,440
 that guy in the front, I know him, I know that dude who's being chased.

90
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,360
 That's my neighbor, that's my neighbor back in England, Mr. Booty.

91
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,920
 What's he doing, how did he learn how to run so fast, why is he on this island, what in

92
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,240
 the world is going on?"

93
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:37,160
 But before any of these questions can be answered, in front of all these witnesses, a

94
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:43,880
 portal to hell appears on the island.

95
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,000
 Mr. Booty who is being pursued by what they can only assume is the devil at this point,

96
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,800
 Mr. Booty runs into the portal, he's chased into hell by this devil, but he looks like

97
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,040
 a normal guy, they don't describe him, I don't know if he's wearing like trousers and a little

98
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,480
 bowler hat, they didn't say he was wearing like red pajamas with a trident, they just

99
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:08,480
 assumed this guy's the devil because he just jumps into hell as well.

100
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,360
 The portal closes and everyone's kind of dumbstruck.

101
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:20,000
 Captain Barnaby turns around and addresses the crowd and says, "Hey, that was really

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,360
 weird, I didn't just hallucinate that, my neighbor, Mr. Booty, just ran into hell and

103
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,800
 that must have been the devil chasing him."

104
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,280
 People are like, "Oh, I didn't make the connection, that was the devil."

105
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,280
 Everyone should make a note of this in your journal.

106
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,360
 If you have a diary, if you're going to write in your Dear Diary book tonight, make a note

107
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,360
 of this.

108
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:46,480
 Note the date, because I think we saw something that's a once in a lifetime event, hopefully,

109
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,080
 you don't want to see other people get chased into hell.

110
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,080
 So they do.

111
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,200
 Back then, people who worked on boats were taking journals, I don't know why, I guess

112
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,640
 if you get lost, you're like, "Let's go back a couple pages, pass the slumber party, and

113
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,960
 the list of our crushes, and then that's the directions we should have went on.

114
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,040
 We should have turned left at that floating turtle."

115
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,840
 But they do, they all write this down.

116
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,800
 Now this is taking place on May 15th, 1687.

117
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,920
 This is Captain Barnaby's vacation, he doesn't get home until October.

118
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,080
 Because this is 1687, boats are super slow.

119
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,000
 Captain Barnaby returns to his home in Wentworth, England and his wife's waiting there.

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,040
 She didn't get a vacation.

121
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,160
 And they're talking and she goes, "Hey, I wanted to tell you something too, a bunch

122
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,400
 of stuff happened when you were gone, but it was old timey Victorian stuff, super boring.

123
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,680
 However, Mr. Booty died while you were gone."

124
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,760
 Captain Barnaby goes, "Oh yeah, I knew that.

125
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,760
 I knew that."

126
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,360
 And wife's like, "How could you possibly know that he died?"

127
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,280
 You know, again, there's no wifi, there's not even phones.

128
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:57,440
 He goes, "Well, this might sound a little weird, but luckily 29 other people witnessed

129
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,440
 this.

130
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,720
 When we were on that volcanic island, Stromboli, we saw Mr. Booty get chased into hell by the

131
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,520
 devil himself."

132
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,760
 So she starts going around town being like, "Hey, your husband might have a lot of money,

133
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,600
 but my husband saw into hell."

134
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,600
 And they're like, "What?

135
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,200
 That's a horrible thing to brag about."

136
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,960
 And she begins telling everyone in town that my husband and a bunch of other people saw

137
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,800
 Mr. Booty run into hell.

138
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,360
 And really the key isn't that my husband has some sort of infernal site, it's that Mr.

139
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,760
 Booty was a bad person.

140
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,880
 You see, the Booties and the Barnabies weren't the best of neighbors.

141
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,480
 They didn't really like each other, right?

142
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,240
 Mrs. Barnaby goes around town and starts telling everyone, "Mr. Booty's in hell.

143
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,240
 My husband saw it.

144
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,240
 This proof.

145
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,520
 Mr. Booty was a bad neighbor.

146
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,040
 He actually got chased into hell by the devil himself."

147
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,040
 That's how bad he was.

148
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,120
 He didn't even send out some demon after him.

149
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:53,520
 Well, of course, this gets back to Mrs. Booty and she doesn't like this, right?

150
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,520
 She doesn't like the fact that people are saying her husband went into, not only went

151
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,640
 into hell, but there's proof, right?

152
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,280
 It's not like you go like you were a bad neighbor, they probably went to hell.

153
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:11,040
 They're saying, "I physically saw him travel through a portal into eternal damnation."

154
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,520
 It's true, he went into hell.

155
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:19,080
 So Mrs. Booty sues Captain Barnaby for slander.

156
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,880
 This actually went to court.

157
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,320
 We actually have a little outline of the court proceeding.

158
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,160
 And this is so interesting.

159
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,080
 She's suing for slander because her argument is they're saying my husband went to hell.

160
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,000
 That's slander against his good name, my good name.

161
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,240
 The great name of Booty shall not be besmirched.

162
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,400
 We actually have a record of the judge's ruling in this case.

163
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:48,760
 The judge looked at all the evidence, which included all of these journals, which included

164
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,400
 witnesses coming to the court and saying, "Yeah, I know it sounds super weird, but on this

165
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:59,560
 date at this time, a portal to hell opened up and Mr. Booty ran into it chased by the

166
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,160
 devil himself."

167
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:11,560
 The official ruling was, "It's not slander because it's true."

168
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,560
 The judge ruled in favor of Captain Barnaby, and this is what he said regarding this quote,

169
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,800
 "Lord have mercy upon me and grant I may never see what you have seen.

170
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:33,080
 One, two, or three may be mistaken, but thirty never can be mistaken."

171
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:38,520
 So it was all of the eyewitnesses that made him go, "This must be true.

172
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,760
 This story must have actually happened because why would thirty people?

173
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,320
 Sure, you have four people who are friends, right?

174
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,520
 The four of them said, "Oh, I saw Mr. Booty running to hell."

175
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,520
 They probably would have lost.

176
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,360
 They probably would have seemed like a slanderous statement, but you had people working on the

177
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,360
 boats, you had people on vacation, you don't know any of these people involved.

178
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:02,040
 They're also seeing a fiery portal appear and this dude run into it.

179
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:08,280
 It's interesting because we know now about mass hallucinations, we know now about mass

180
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,840
 hysteria.

181
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:17,040
 I don't think that you could make that argument nowadays because thirty people can be mistaken.

182
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,720
 You can have a mass UFO sighting and it's really just a cloud or one of those weird

183
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,320
 things, that optical illusion where it looks like a city is floating in the sky and it

184
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,400
 has to do with a bunch of science stuff.

185
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,440
 I don't remember exactly how it works, but there can be mass hallucinations, we understand

186
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,440
 that.

187
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,440
 But it's really, really interesting when the world of the paranormal does collide with

188
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,840
 the legal world, a world that is based on keeping records and being impartial, well

189
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,920
 as impartial as it can be.

190
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:52,160
 Because the guys like Lord have mercy, obviously the judge also believes in the religious precepts

191
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,360
 of hell and there's a heaven and a god and stuff like that.

192
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,880
 But I think that's a fair ruling.

193
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:05,880
 I mean, if there's thirty witnesses and twenty six of them are not connected to the guys

194
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,200
 who might just want to say bad things about this guy, is it slander?

195
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,480
 No, they're saying we actually saw this.

196
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,000
 We actually saw a guy get chased into hell, which opens up a whole other can.

197
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,480
 I mean we focus so much on the legal part of this, it's easy to forget that a portal

198
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,440
 to hell opened up on earth and the devil chased a man into it.

199
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,200
 What did Mr. Booty do that was so wrong that the devil's like "Ugh, okay, what's on my

200
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,640
 schedule for today?"

201
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:39,120
 Reign and eternal torment, try to corrupt the souls of man, oh I have a 344 appointment

202
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,080
 with a Mr. Booty, I gotta get up there and take care of that one myself.

203
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,000
 Who knows, like you have the legal proceeding side of it and then you just have the weird

204
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 paranormal event.

205
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,400
 And Matt, I mean I gotta say, like Mr. Booty has to be a little proud, right?

206
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:58,560
 That he got the devil off of his throne to chase him in there.

207
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,800
 But I think that he's probably being tortured and hell, I don't think he's like "Oh, I'm

208
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,640
 a superstar down here, it's bad."

209
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,000
 But yeah, what an interesting story and to lose that court case as well.

210
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,440
 So then, she basically, so then I mean it was proven in the court of law, her husband

211
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,440
 ran into hell.

212
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:22,000
 She tried to get the rumors dismissed, all she did was get them written into English

213
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,960
 law and then hundreds of years later we could talk about it and still laugh at the last

214
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,240
 name of Booty.

215
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,680
 Turtle Bandit, let's go ahead and talk to the keys of the carbonic hopter, we're gonna

216
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:39,320
 leave behind this courtroom in England with their powdered wigs and their grieving widows.

217
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:47,080
 We are headed all the way out to Fresno Valley, California.

218
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:52,800
 We're in Fresno Valley, California and we're camping one night.

219
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:59,400
 We're cooking hot dogs over the fire, watching shooting stars travel across the sky.

220
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:05,920
 Oh, it's time to turn in I say, as you realize they only brought one tent and one sleeping

221
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:14,920
 bag and as we are cuddled up in the sleeping bag, we hear outside the tent, "Oooooh, heeheeheeheehee."

222
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,200
 Like what, that's weird.

223
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,200
 "Oooooh, heeheeheeheehee."

224
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:27,200
 And I go, "Hmm, hold me closer as I tell you this story."

225
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,040
 That sounds, the first part sounds like a traditional wolf sound.

226
00:14:31,040 --> 00:15:01,040
 "Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

227
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,160
 That's exactly what you think it is, well maybe not, maybe you think it's an ape body

228
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,200
 with a wolf head, but you'd be wrong, you'd be wrong.

229
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,360
 It is the opposite, it's a wolf body with an ape head.

230
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,240
 And apparently these creatures run all around the Fresno Valley area.

231
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,680
 And you go, "Jason, I've lived in Fresno Valley my entire life, I've never seen a wolf

232
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,680
 head."

233
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,040
 First off, why are you listening to my show?

234
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,560
 You denier, you science denier.

235
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,680
 Secondly, I've never heard of these guys either.

236
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:35,600
 Now I don't live in the Fresno Valley, but I've never heard of these guys either, so

237
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,880
 I won't fault you, I won't make you stop listening to my show if you've never heard

238
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,400
 them and that's one thing I love about the show, is finding out about all these new

239
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,400
 cryptids.

240
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,720
 I found out about this one from Dead Robber Radio's favorite super soldier, Kevin Whiskey.

241
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:55,000
 We talked about him on Monday's episode, where we were covering a wolf, a dog, what

242
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 was it?

243
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,800
 It was a dog in Watts California that had the face of a woman and it could talk and

244
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,160
 it had a pimp.

245
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,160
 Great story.

246
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,320
 If you missed Monday's episode, check it out, I'll put it in the show notes.

247
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:10,640
 But there was another version of the lady-faced dog of Watts California that Kevin Whiskey

248
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,000
 said that it didn't have the face of a woman, it had the face of an ape.

249
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,320
 And he goes, "It's possibly that it was a wolf ape from Fresno Valley."

250
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,080
 And I go, "What in the world is that?

251
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,520
 You just can't go, 'Well maybe it's this, I don't know what this is.'"

252
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:29,000
 I looked it up, "This is a cryptid that's been cited a lot in the area.

253
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,560
 This world is so fascinating and so weird and wonderful and we're never gonna run out

254
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,560
 of stories."

255
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,600
 Like, that's another thing I love about this show.

256
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,920
 It's this six foot long wolf with the face of an ape.

257
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:48,120
 Sometimes instead of having little wolf paws, it has human hands and feet.

258
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,080
 You were just making stuff up.

259
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,600
 Wait, what is this?

260
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,040
 How does it have human hands and feet?

261
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,680
 If it's a monkey face and a wolf body.

262
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,240
 Science, what are you, science denier?

263
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,760
 Why are you listening to my show?

264
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,680
 Go deny science somewhere else.

265
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,880
 Sometimes it has a baboon's face rather than just an ape.

266
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,600
 See, at that point you're really just squabbling over details.

267
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,360
 If this cryptid is chasing me and I'm like, "Oh no, it's a wolf ape."

268
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,960
 And someone's like, "Actually that's a baboon wolf."

269
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,640
 I'm pushing you towards the beast.

270
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,160
 That's just really trying to get into the weeds of this thing.

271
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,280
 And this creature is incredibly vicious.

272
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,120
 We've come across a lot of cryptids that kind of leave you alone.

273
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,440
 Me bigfoot just want to enjoy nature.

274
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,800
 Pfft, lame.

275
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,280
 This one wants to eat you.

276
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,880
 And that's why we're in the sleeping bag together.

277
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,200
 Hold me closer as I'm rubbing my scent on you.

278
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,640
 I'll chase you first.

279
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,080
 Now you smell like two delicious humans.

280
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,240
 This wolf ape, as it's moving through the wilderness of Fresno Valley, they say a lot

281
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:55,080
 of times it makes coughing sounds.

282
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,080
 Which is gross, right?

283
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,080
 I'd much rather it have a fearsome howl.

284
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,000
 Truth be told, Jason, you mean that howl and that monkey noise wasn't even real?

285
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,680
 Well, no, that wasn't a little bit of artistic license.

286
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:12,320
 But if I started the story off with some gross creature coughing in the distance, you would

287
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,960
 have denied the science and I would have had to kick you out of the show even earlier.

288
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,120
 So it makes, I'm allowed to lie.

289
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,880
 Basically, I'm allowed to lie.

290
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:27,160
 This wolf makes this disgusting coughing sound and it's always foaming at the mouth.

291
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,240
 So there is no furry that wants to bang this thing, right?

292
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,240
 It's super gross.

293
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,880
 It's constantly hacking up a lung.

294
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,440
 It's foaming at the mouth.

295
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,400
 And some witnesses have specified it.

296
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,120
 They go, it's not just coughing.

297
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,400
 You guys say it's coughing.

298
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,240
 That's not what it sounds like.

299
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,240
 They described it.

300
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,080
 Apparently multiple people have described it.

301
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,160
 This is disgusting, dude.

302
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:52,040
 Multiple people has described it as the sound of a pig squealing.

303
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,720
 I'm not even going to try to imitate these sounds because it's so nauseating sounding.

304
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:03,480
 A pig squealing and at the same time, someone throwing up.

305
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,440
 Now I'm going to do the sound.

306
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,920
 That's not a pig.

307
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,920
 What's a pig?

308
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,640
 Well, I know it's a squealing pig.

309
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,120
 Squill, squeal, squeal.

310
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,040
 Squill, squeal, squeal.

311
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,040
 And then we have to layer this on.

312
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,040
 We're going to put it in surround sound.

313
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,040
 Squill, squeal, squeal.

314
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,040
 Squill, squeal, squeal.

315
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,040
 Squill, squeal, squeal.

316
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,040
 Squill, squeal, squeal.

317
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,040
 Squill, squeal, squeal.

318
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,040
 Squill, squeal, squeal.

319
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,040
 Okay, that was...

320
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:33,240
 Anyways, I will continue.

321
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,440
 I'm not saying I know everything about cryptids, right?

322
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,440
 I keep saying I've never heard of this.

323
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,960
 I've never heard of them.

324
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,040
 I'm just shocked at the stuff I haven't heard because I've researched this for so long and

325
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,640
 I love learning new stuff.

326
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,640
 I love finding out about stuff I didn't know.

327
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:53,440
 Apparently there's a ton of sightings of these things, including a celebrity sighting.

328
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,040
 Ansel Adams, world famous for your life that your celebrity you imagined, Brad Pitt, was

329
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,920
 writing one of these into a movie set.

330
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,360
 Ansel Adams, world famous photographer.

331
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,240
 If you've ever walked into a dentist's office, you've seen one of his photos.

332
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,480
 Ansel Adams was taking some pictures in Yosemite.

333
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,960
 He's like, "Oh, another giant rock.

334
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,720
 Ansel looked great on someone's office wall.

335
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,720
 Click."

336
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,960
 He was taking pictures in Yosemite and a pack of wolf apes laid siege to his tent.

337
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,240
 Oh no, and he's like probably swinging his camera at them.

338
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,160
 Get back, get back you monstrosities.

339
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,200
 They're foaming at their mouth coming towards him.

340
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,560
 He actually hid in his tent and they left.

341
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:39,480
 Wait a second, did she say these things are super fierce?

342
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,360
 They're laying siege to his campsite and all he does is he goes zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt

343
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:43,360
 zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt zzzt z

344
00:20:43,360 --> 00:21:09,600
 Zip

345
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:16,760
 Cryptids Wolf apes Never seen before

346
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,520
 Man who's known for doing one thing in his life.

347
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,760
 Maybe he's a loving father and husband, I don't know.

348
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,800
 But Ansel Adams is known for one thing.

349
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,760
 Taking pictures.

350
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:33,480
 I think he would have at least stuck the camera out of the tent to get a blurry shot of a

351
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,360
 tail or something.

352
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,840
 You're not, at the very least, right?

353
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,200
 Maybe he'd get a dynamic group shot of all four of them howling at the moon.

354
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,520
 I don't think this story is true just because of that.

355
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,320
 UFO sighting, someone looks up and goes, "Whoa, look it, there's UFO."

356
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,760
 UFO sighting and Steven Spielberg is there.

357
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,280
 I'm pretty sure he's going to get it on camera, right?

358
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,520
 I'm pretty sure he's going to have the wherewithal to be like, "I've made a bunch of movies

359
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,200
 about this, maybe I should record proof."

360
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,440
 So the fact that Ansel Adams was there and didn't take a picture, I find, you're like

361
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:11,360
 "Jason, that's the part you find unbelievable about that, that a guy didn't take a photo?"

362
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,000
 Then, okay, so yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe that part didn't happen, right?

363
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,440
 Because it does sound a little dubious.

364
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,440
 Maybe that didn't happen.

365
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,600
 What about this undated, unsourced story?

366
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,600
 This is cool though.

367
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:28,920
 Apparently in Fresno Valley, there was a single room schoolhouse there.

368
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:35,320
 And so somewhere in this entire place, there was a single room schoolhouse and a wolf ape

369
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,760
 walked into school and was like going, "Ahh, doing all that noises.

370
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,760
 I don't want to do it again because it hurts my voice."

371
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:47,160
 And the kids actually had to build a barrier of desks to keep the wolf ape from eating

372
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,160
 them.

373
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:53,720
 And the teacher valiantly hid in the closet while all the kids were actually trying to

374
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,320
 keep away from this thing.

375
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:02,560
 And the wolf ape was so vicious that they had to build, the kids had to build like a,

376
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,240
 you're like, "Jason, these stories are clearly made up.

377
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,160
 Why are you even talking about this?"

378
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,840
 These kids had to build a staircase out of their desks and then they climbed up in the

379
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,880
 rafters of this old timey schoolhouse and the wolf ape just kind of walked around on

380
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,080
 the ground for a little bit.

381
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,440
 And it was a school for photography.

382
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,640
 These students were all learning how to use a camera.

383
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:38,160
 The wolf ape leaves.

384
00:23:38,160 --> 00:24:07,160
 And

385
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:35,240
 the

386
00:24:35,240 --> 00:25:04,200
 kids

387
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:30,520
 were

388
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:56,840
 just

389
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:25,160
 going

390
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:54,960
 to

391
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:24,760
 do

392
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,560
 this.

393
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,960
 It's clearly fake.

394
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,960
 That's why it's not more popular.

395
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,720
 None of this stuff makes any sense.

396
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,400
 It's funny because when we look at encounters of Bigfoot, right, a lot of times like the

397
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,680
 early ones, as we saw someone in the woods, we smelled something in the woods, we sensed

398
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:49,080
 something in the woods, the Bigfoot mythos was very, very kind of on the back burner.

399
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,600
 It was just a bunch of outdoorsy weirdos who believed in it.

400
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,400
 I'm talking about modern Bigfoot, right?

401
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:04,600
 Until the Patterson Gimlin tape came out and then you could show someone Bigfoot moving

402
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,600
 around.

403
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,640
 Now whether or not that video is fake, you could still now put an image to Bigfoot.

404
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,160
 The fact is that that image is so iconic.

405
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,960
 If you just show an outline of that, you go with this Bigfoot, right?

406
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,480
 That walk and the Bigfeet.

407
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:24,360
 The Wolfape, I mean other than that really, there would be about as much evidence showing

408
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,520
 that Bigfoot exists to a Wolfape existing.

409
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,640
 Every piece of hair they send off to the lab turns out to be something else.

410
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:36,040
 And sure they take plaster cast of Bigfeet in the woods and that could be Bigfoot's

411
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,040
 feet.

412
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,080
 But this guy either has human feet, right?

413
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,160
 So you would just see regular human feet in the mud or Wolfpaw feet.

414
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,920
 He's not walking around rubbing his face in the mud and you could go, "This is clearly

415
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,200
 the face of a baboon and we're in California.

416
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,640
 How else could this be here other than the Wolfape?"

417
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,040
 But what I found really interesting about this story, and let's wrap it up like this,

418
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:03,840
 is that here we have a possible clue as to why we never do get real concrete proof of

419
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,920
 cryptids.

420
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:11,120
 What if they protect their own?

421
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,320
 Now we've always had this thing, like Bigfoot experts will always say that the reason why

422
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,680
 we don't find dead Bigfoot is because they bury their dead.

423
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:23,840
 Unless we want to dig up the entire Pacific Northwest, we'll never find a dead Bigfoot.

424
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,480
 They bury their dead.

425
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,920
 What if that is something universal to cryptids in a sense?

426
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:37,000
 That when you kill a cryptid, you get killed.

427
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,520
 They come after you.

428
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,520
 They take you down.

429
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,360
 Now this guy sold it to the Freak Show so technically there might be some...

430
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:50,240
 Look up from the 1950s to today if any Freak Show owners have ever been badly mutilated.

431
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:56,040
 But think about it, let's say that you do get concrete evidence that a cryptid exists

432
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,040
 before you can expo...

433
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,040
 Because that's what we're all waiting for, right?

434
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,800
 We already believe in a lot of these things, but wouldn't it be nice to know that they

435
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,800
 exist?

436
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,400
 To me, actually, believing is enough.

437
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:11,920
 To me, for me to believe in this Bigfoot phenomenon or this Wolfape phenomenon, for

438
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,920
 me to believe that's enough.

439
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,520
 I don't really have to prove it to anyone else.

440
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,720
 But it would be a nice little cherry on top, right?

441
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,360
 It would be a nice little fur-covered cherry on top.

442
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,360
 If you could prove Bigfoot existed, but again, I just like the stories.

443
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,880
 I believe in these things.

444
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,880
 It doesn't matter if other people don't believe in them.

445
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,440
 But what if you find hair and it's actually deer hair or you find a footprint and it's

446
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,280
 just a human footprint?

447
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,320
 Shaquille O'Neal was walking through the woods that day.

448
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,360
 Nothing happens.

449
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:44,720
 But if you find actual Bigfoot hair, if you shoot and kill a Wolfape, and now you have

450
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:51,680
 proof that these things exist, if there's not some sort of...

451
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,920
 Reckoning coming.

452
00:30:54,920 --> 00:31:00,560
 Because I believe if cryptids exist, they do not exist in the natural world that we

453
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,560
 think of.

454
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:10,000
 But the Wolfape has a birth life and death cycle like a normal creature would on Earth.

455
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,960
 I don't believe that they're raring their young and they're teaching them how to walk.

456
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:18,240
 I think cryptids by their very nature, and this includes Bigfoot, has a supernatural

457
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,560
 element to it.

458
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:26,080
 I don't believe if Bigfoot exists, I do not believe he is a biological creature through

459
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,920
 and through like a gorilla or like an orangutan or something like that.

460
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,600
 There's just zero evidence of that.

461
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,480
 I will believe that Bigfoot exists, yes.

462
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,120
 But the idea of him just being a real life creature that we've never stumbled across,

463
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,640
 there's just no evidence for that.

464
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,640
 Interdimensional?

465
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,640
 Sure.

466
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,240
 Alien, flying UFOs, we've done episodes on all of this stuff.

467
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,600
 Humans turning into Bigfoot, we've done episodes on that too.

468
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:58,640
 I believe in all that stuff, there's more evidence for that type of stuff because the

469
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:04,040
 lack of evidence of Bigfoot being a biological creature that we've just never discovered

470
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:10,280
 in the Pacific Northwest for the past 400 years, there's just nothing, there's nothing

471
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,480
 that we've been able to prove.

472
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,480
 Like you know what I mean?

473
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,880
 The lack of evidence is so outstanding in that.

474
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,080
 But if Bigfoot's a supernatural creature that takes a biological form, yes.

475
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,680
 And if it's a supernatural creature that takes a biological form, can't it also commit supernatural

476
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,880
 acts?

477
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:39,480
 The wolf ape being in the same vein, this wild cryptid is not a biological creature,

478
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,520
 but is a creature that has one foot in the real world and one foot in the supernatural

479
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,920
 world.

480
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:55,840
 So when you shoot one and display it in your church and then sell it, there is a supernatural

481
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,600
 reckoning for that.

482
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,640
 You're murdered, you're brutally murdered.

483
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,940
 Now whether or not a bunch of wolf apes actually descended upon this dude's house, Ansel Adams

484
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:10,080
 leading the charge, he's like "I was one of them all along, my photos were just to make

485
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,440
 money to feed my wolf ape family."

486
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,360
 Or it was a demonic force that ripped him apart?

487
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,360
 I don't know.

488
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,360
 I'm not a forensic investigator, I'm just the guy who tells you science stuff.

489
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,600
 That could be why we never get proof of these things.

490
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,920
 Because the people who find the proof die.

491
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,720
 Or disappear.

492
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,880
 Right?

493
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:41,480
 Imagine all of these missing 411 cases, someone walking through the woods and he comes across

494
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,400
 a box that's Bigfoot's most treasured items and he's looking through and he's like "Whoa,

495
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,240
 this is actual proof of Bigfoot.

496
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,440
 There's a bunch of selfies and there's some acorns.

497
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,240
 I don't know what that would be proof of Bigfoot, but maybe, maybe they will be."

498
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,280
 And there's this whole tuft of hair, baby's first Bigfoot hair.

499
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,560
 You have all this proof and you're like "I can prove that Bigfoot exists."

500
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,400
 And then you turn around and Bigfoot's standing there with his arms crossed and he's like

501
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,400
 "Uh-uh-uh."

502
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:09,680
 I mean technically it's as bad for leaving his treasured possessions out behind his mulberry

503
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,680
 bush.

504
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:16,760
 But what if the reason why we can't find proof of cryptids is because cryptids kill

505
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,440
 the people who find proof.

506
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,320
 If it's fake proof, if it's not the real thing, you survive.

507
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:28,600
 If it's real proof, you disappear, you die, brutally murdered, no one knows what happens

508
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,920
 to you, any combination of those.

509
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,920
 And so all we keep getting is the fake evidence.

510
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:43,160
 It'd be the same thing if you had a mafia and you had 9 out of 10 people going "Oh,

511
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:49,160
 that's not the mafia, that guy, he just likes waving guns around and he eats Italian food

512
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,160
 a lot."

513
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,360
 And then you have one guy that goes "No, actually I'm pretty sure that guy's the mafia."

514
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,440
 He did on Valentine's Day drive by and shoot a bunch of people.

515
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,800
 That dude who has the proof of the mafia who's saying that stuff, he's going to be gone.

516
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,360
 They're going to take care of him in the most stereotypical way ever.

517
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,240
 Seamant shoes, most likely.

518
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,120
 And then you just have the 9 people left going "Ah, nah, he's a good guy."

519
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,120
 That could be a clue.

520
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:16,320
 The people who are looking for a bigfoot aren't finding him and they remain alive and they

521
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,960
 keep saying "Well, I didn't find them today, but I'll keep looking."

522
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,480
 But the people who do find him don't get to tell us that story.

523
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:30,520
 Or they present us with evidence and then they quickly go missing afterwards.

524
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:34,240
 That may be a clue because the thing is, is we've been searching for these cryptids for

525
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,240
 so long.

526
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:40,240
 And not just cryptids, it's just proof of supernatural stuff in general.

527
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:46,520
 Either there is no evidence at all, these things don't exist at all, or they exist and

528
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:52,560
 they're very, very hard to prove, or they exist and there is an active force keeping

529
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,720
 us from proving they exist.

530
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:00,420
 I'm not talking about skeptics in the scientific community, I'm talking about a supernatural

531
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:14,000
 force that to maintain the natural order will strike down anyone who knows too much.

532
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,680
 So before you go on your next ghost hunt, or go hang out on the wood with your buddies

533
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:24,420
 with one tent and one sleeping bang, looking for a bigfoot, looking for a wolf ape, or

534
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:30,080
 whatever local cryptid like the goat man or the villains of Hunchyville, be very careful

535
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:35,940
 because you might actually find proof that these things exist.

536
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:40,340
 But will you live long enough to tell the rest of the world what you've found?

537
00:36:40,340 --> 00:37:08,740
 the truth.

538
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:27,620
 the truth.

539
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,200
 (upbeat music)
