1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
 When a young American man meets a beautiful Swedish girl, he learns she has some serious

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,360
 mental problems.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:13,840
 But when he leaves Sweden, he quickly realizes that whatever was causing her emotional anguish

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,680
 has followed him home.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,080
 And then we travel to an abandoned town in Spain.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:29,800
 What was once a thriving bronze age community that lasted thousands of years now lays empty.

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:36,840
 And the terrifying events in this area were so bad, they actually renamed the city.

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,680
 To this day they call this settlement "The Devil's Door" today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:53,280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,280
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,080
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:01,160
 I hope you guys had a great week and I actually did get tested for Covid and I didn't have

13
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,160
 it.

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,160
 So I know we talked about that on the last episode but I'm doing good.

15
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,160
 I'm still actually sick.

16
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,880
 Whatever it is, I still have the flu or something like that but it's not Covid and I know a

17
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,640
 lot of you guys were worried and I appreciate all the work.

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,280
 I appreciate all the emotional energy you expended on me.

19
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,160
 Speaking of spending, but this is money spending, let's go ahead and introduce our newest Patreon

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,600
 supporter, walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

21
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,600
 Give it up for Max Sinclair.

22
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,520
 I won't give a big round of applause for Max Sinclair.

23
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,520
 Give him a big old hug.

24
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,920
 Max, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

25
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,640
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

26
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,600
 Just help spread the word about the show.

27
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,000
 Help grow the show.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,320
 Really helps out a lot.

29
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,520
 Tell your friends, tell your family.

30
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,520
 Help the show grow.

31
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,520
 Really appreciate that as well.

32
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,640
 Max, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

33
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,360
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

34
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,360
 We are headed all the way out to Sweden.

35
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,120
 The reason why we're in Sweden is that there is this guy.

36
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,120
 We don't have his name.

37
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,120
 He didn't give us his real name.

38
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,520
 You understand as the story progresses, you're like, "I wouldn't want people to know I was

39
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,520
 involved in this either."

40
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,200
 But there's this American dude.

41
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,960
 We're going to call him Jesse.

42
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,040
 So Jesse travels to Sweden for the summer.

43
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,960
 He's like, "See you later, Chicago.

44
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,040
 I'm coming to like snowy mountains and Donald Duck cartoons as far as the eye can see."

45
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,800
 And so he's walking around Sweden.

46
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,040
 He's like waving at people.

47
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,040
 Who is that weird?

48
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,040
 Who is that weird?

49
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,040
 Hey everyone.

50
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,200
 I'm from America.

51
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,760
 So Jesse is an American man.

52
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,920
 He's 20 years old.

53
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,000
 And it's time for him to kind of break out.

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,640
 You know, kind of start like living life as an adult.

55
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,080
 And 20 is still really young.

56
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,960
 But he's going to go and he's going to do the whole thing where he's kind of traveling

57
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,520
 and meeting people and expanding his horizons.

58
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,760
 It's always good to do that.

59
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,760
 So he ends up in Sweden.

60
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,240
 He's just going to be there for the summer.

61
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:50,360
 And while he's in Sweden, he meets this beautiful young woman.

62
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,880
 Now, he's never had a girlfriend before, which is going to complicate things because as you

63
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,520
 get older and you've dated a lot of people, you're really good at observing things.

64
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,240
 And you go, "Okay, those things that I don't like, but I can deal with them.

65
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,640
 And those things are deal breakers, but I can deal with them.

66
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,240
 But this is why she's going to break up with me."

67
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,160
 And you can kind of see all these things.

68
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:15,640
 You can also tell really early on, because you have a lot of experience, the crazy ones,

69
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,040
 things they say and things they do.

70
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,000
 So you bail really quick, right?

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,600
 Because there is way more fish in the sea, right?

72
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,840
 You cut your losses.

73
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,880
 But when you're 20 years old, when I was in 20 years old as well, you don't have that

74
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,760
 instinct.

75
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,120
 So you will just go, "Oh, maybe all girls are like this.

76
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,880
 Maybe all girls are mildly psychotic."

77
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,000
 Jesse meets this girl.

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,120
 We'll call her Amanda.

79
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,840
 She's the Swedish girl.

80
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,280
 And one thing he picks up on pretty quickly is she's really cool.

81
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,640
 She's awesome to hang out with.

82
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,760
 She's hot.

83
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,240
 And she has a lot of emotional issues, which again, that's common.

84
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,120
 It's part of being human.

85
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,840
 But her emotional issues require her to take medication to regulate her moods.

86
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,520
 Because the times where he saw her not take her medication, they're like watching a movie

87
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,120
 and he's like, "Uh, honey, this movie's kind of long.

88
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,320
 Should you go and take your medicine?"

89
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,800
 And she's like, "Nah, I'm on the edge of my seat."

90
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,200
 And then what would happen if she's not taking her medication, she would have become extremely

91
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,520
 violent.

92
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,920
 So I don't know if it was like she took a pill a day or a pill a week, or if she's

93
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,840
 taking like three pills an hour.

94
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,120
 But it was enough that he could tell that when she didn't take it, she would explode

95
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,900
 at these violent reactions.

96
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,360
 Anyways, he stays with her, his first girlfriend.

97
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,840
 He stays with her.

98
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:35,840
 When they're sleeping together, he notices that at night she would go "mmmmmmmmmmmm" and

99
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,760
 she would like roll around in the bed.

100
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,880
 He would just be kind of like laying there and just like, "Do I go to work tomorrow?

101
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,320
 I got a job in Sweden for some reason on my summer vacation."

102
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,400
 "Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm" she's making these noises.

103
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,400
 And he said she looked like she was tormented.

104
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,000
 It wasn't just she was kind of rolling around because her back hurt.

105
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,140
 She was like, "Ugh, I need my medicine, I need my medicine."

106
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,140
 In the middle of the night.

107
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,440
 Now he's like, "Oh, great."

108
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,440
 And she's gibberish-ing.

109
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,040
 Well, actually, she's speaking Swedish, but he doesn't understand Swedish.

110
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,980
 So he just hears her going "Arfie, darfie, darf!"

111
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,980
 And he doesn't know what it is.

112
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,320
 He has no idea what she's saying.

113
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,760
 Now when she wakes up the next morning, he's like, "Hey, you were like muttering in your

114
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,240
 sleep and you like looked tormented and you were like scratching to the air and also you

115
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,240
 took all the blankets.

116
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,240
 That's rude."

117
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,040
 And she'd be like, "I don't have- I don't remember that.

118
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,760
 Like I do remember not- I do remember taking all the blankets.

119
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,560
 I remember being extra warm, but I don't know what I was saying."

120
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,400
 And she would scratch at herself in her sleep.

121
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,680
 So she'd wake up with scratches everywhere.

122
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,040
 She sounded angry in her sleep and all this stuff.

123
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,280
 Now he goes in general.

124
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,280
 She just seemed haunted.

125
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:45,120
 Like despite all the medication she has to take to regulate her moods, despite the fact

126
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,240
 that she's scratching herself in the sleep and speaking in this strange language, she

127
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,680
 just in general seemed haunted.

128
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,960
 Her eyes were always- she always looked tired behind her eyes.

129
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:01,960
 And when she wasn't scratching herself or doing all this other crazy stuff, she was

130
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,320
 an artist and she would draw these sexually violent paintings.

131
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,200
 And you're like, "Chasin, why is this guy still with her?

132
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,080
 And why is he admitting to being with her in the first place?"

133
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,080
 I know, I know.

134
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,480
 But this is a really interesting story because for all the times I've been like, "See ya.

135
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,360
 Maybe if I had stayed around a little bit longer, this would have happened to me."

136
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,200
 I'm not saying I want this to happen to me, but as a paranormal researcher, it would

137
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
 have been interesting.

138
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,640
 So he stays with her.

139
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,840
 But you know, only for the summer, right?

140
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,280
 I guess there was a time limit on it.

141
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,760
 But he said, you know, "I'll come back next summer."

142
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,360
 There's this first girlfriend that's really kind of romantic except for all of the insanity.

143
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:44,360
 So he flies back to America and then it really starts.

144
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,720
 He'd be in his bed all by himself.

145
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,000
 He's like, "Oh, the whole blanket's just for me."

146
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,440
 And right before falling asleep, he would hear a feminine voice whisper.

147
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,520
 He'd open his eyes up and look around the darkness of his room and there'd be obviously

148
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,960
 no one in there.

149
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,200
 But right before he fell asleep, he would hear these feminine whispers and he said,

150
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,560
 "I could triangulate it."

151
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,680
 Like it wasn't like right next to my ear.

152
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,280
 It was somewhere in the room.

153
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,560
 I could actually look into the darkness and go, "It came from over there."

154
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,720
 This happened continuously.

155
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,000
 And then eventually he started to see what was making the voice.

156
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,080
 He'd open his eyes and he'd see standing in the corner of his room a woman standing there.

157
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,720
 Now I know what you're thinking.

158
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,720
 Was she hot?

159
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
 No.

160
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
 I'm out there.

161
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,760
 I just jumped in the gun.

162
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,320
 She was not attractive at all.

163
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,040
 She was gray, but not like a gray alien because even gray aliens can be kind of cute.

164
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,560
 She had gray bumpy skin with long, wet black hair.

165
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,520
 She would just stand there in the darkness totally nude.

166
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,160
 She had fat limbs with fat fingers.

167
00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,400
 Just imagine like a fat, stumpy woman with gray, bumpy skin and black hair.

168
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,120
 And right there, that's bad enough, right?

169
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,800
 You lost me at the gray bumps.

170
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,760
 Anything else I could probably have worked with.

171
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:14,440
 But then her face, she didn't have one.

172
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,360
 Her eyes were gone.

173
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,560
 It was like just skin over where the eye sockets would be.

174
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,760
 So just gray, bumpy skin, modeled, wet hair.

175
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:29,200
 And then her mouth was the Pac-Man mouth.

176
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:34,760
 And it would just open and close, open and close.

177
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,880
 Super gross, dude.

178
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,920
 That's a really demonic looking creature.

179
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:43,160
 Like if you picture that, if you picture all those pieces, that's very, very disturbing.

180
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,760
 Again, I just wanted to do those details would be bad enough.

181
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:52,160
 But it's this lumpy, gross woman with no eyeballs and a Pac-Man mouth.

182
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,400
 And we haven't even gotten to the gross stuff.

183
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,200
 That's just what she looked like.

184
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,600
 He would be laying there in bed and he'd been hearing these whispers for a long time.

185
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,080
 Now he sees this gray, bumpy woman start to walk towards him.

186
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,840
 She's completely nude.

187
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,160
 And the bumps go all the way down, by the way.

188
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,200
 She's completely nude and he would be totally paralyzed.

189
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,480
 I mean, you can chalk this up to sleep paralysis, but there's a lot of other stuff that's going

190
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,480
 on.

191
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,320
 She would be completely paralyzed and she would walk through the darkness to him.

192
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:30,920
 And then she would grab his arm and use it to masturbate herself.

193
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:36,760
 Like she was sliding his fingers into her is how he put it.

194
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,520
 And that's awful, right?

195
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,520
 That's horrifying.

196
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,200
 I can't, I mean, we've had ghost sexually assaulting people.

197
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,160
 Normally, it's the physical sensation like you're waking up in bed and you feel the pressure

198
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,600
 on top of you, which again can be chalked up to sleep paralysis.

199
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:58,600
 Sometimes it can be demonic or poltergeist activity, but normally you don't see it.

200
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,120
 This one, he's looking, and he's totally paralyzed.

201
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,280
 He's looking at this woman, her big old Pac-Man mouth, and she's using his fingers to get

202
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,280
 off.

203
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,440
 Happy Monday, happy Monday episode, by the way.

204
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:18,600
 And sometimes he would wake up in the middle of the night and how would you know?

205
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,360
 I would not sleep.

206
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,440
 There's very few reasons in my life why I would start doing methamphetamines.

207
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,440
 This is one of them.

208
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,800
 If I had a choice between getting addicted to meth or seeing this when I went to bed,

209
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,560
 give me the meth.

210
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,360
 So sometimes though, he would be like, "Oh man, he doesn't want to go to sleep, but he's

211
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,360
 super tired.

212
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,360
 He has a big exam tomorrow."

213
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,920
 So he's like, "Oh, I'm going to get some shut-eye."

214
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:45,320
 He knows he's going to be awake for at least two hours doing this horrible act.

215
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,520
 But sometimes she wouldn't do that.

216
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,240
 He'd be like, "Oh, good."

217
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,320
 Maybe she didn't show up.

218
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,640
 I can actually fall asleep.

219
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,680
 And he would wake up just in the middle of the night and she would be standing over him

220
00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:00,480
 and she'd be masturbating herself while staring at him.

221
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,680
 This is terrifying.

222
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,160
 I was reading the story and I'm thinking, "I haven't come across anything like this.

223
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,160
 Sex with ghosts?"

224
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,360
 Yeah, demonic rape?

225
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:14,680
 Yeah, but watching it, I can't recall a story where they actually see this.

226
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,840
 A couple months later, this went on for a couple months and then it just ended one night.

227
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,600
 Just disappeared.

228
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,000
 Never saw her again.

229
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,080
 And what's interesting is he starts to make the connection.

230
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,080
 Wait a second.

231
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,360
 I used to hang out with this girl, a really hot girl.

232
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,360
 We dated for a bit.

233
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,840
 She was nuts.

234
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,920
 She had trouble sleeping.

235
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,760
 She drew all this sexually violent art and I left her and then I'm seeing this stuff

236
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,640
 at night, this sexually violent spirit.

237
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,280
 Maybe there's a connection between the two.

238
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,240
 Actually thinks like I might have caught it from her.

239
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,720
 Well he ends up going back next year, next summer.

240
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,360
 He wants to go see that girl again, whatever her name was, Amanda, whatever her name was.

241
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,680
 He flies out there to Sweden.

242
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,600
 She's fine.

243
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,200
 She's doing much, much better.

244
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,480
 She doesn't have to take all the medication she used to take.

245
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,360
 She sleeps better.

246
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,760
 Her life is returning to normal.

247
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,760
 Really very interesting paranormal account.

248
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,040
 It does have some of the stuff we see in Ghost Lore, like Suck You By type of things like

249
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,040
 that.

250
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,240
 But this is almost like it's communicable.

251
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,640
 This spirit, I mean we take the story, if it's true, again, we're in the world of the

252
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,080
 paranormal so this could be true.

253
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,400
 The spirit is attached to her.

254
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,400
 It's tormenting her.

255
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,920
 It's causing all of her mental anguish.

256
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,040
 And it's doubling the activity at night and then it attached to him and fed off this brand

257
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,440
 new energy.

258
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,000
 And she got better because of it.

259
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,320
 It was almost like this curse that was being passed on.

260
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,080
 Of course you can make connections to movies like It Follows or the Ring, you know, this

261
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,800
 spirit, this curse that follows from person to person.

262
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,400
 But still, a very, very fascinating and creepy story.

263
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,080
 And then you have to think, why did it leave him?

264
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,080
 Why did it leave him?

265
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,440
 Did it find someone else to go to?

266
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,240
 Did he not have the energy that she wanted?

267
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,200
 Was it not able to feed as much off him that it was on her?

268
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,200
 Who knows?

269
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,960
 But apparently it left her and it left him.

270
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,400
 So it may still be out there.

271
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,120
 And it's funny, as I was prepping the story I started to think, what if this is one of

272
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,040
 those, I should have said this at the beginning of the segment, what if this is one of those

273
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,080
 stories that when I tell it, it spreads out?

274
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,640
 Because I've done that a couple of times.

275
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,680
 I've covered stuff about cursed spirits.

276
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,240
 I'll put one of those episodes in the show notes.

277
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,680
 You're like, please don't Jason, I don't want to hear a cursed episode.

278
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,880
 What if this is one of those stories?

279
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,560
 By describing her, by telling you it, it puts it into your bedroom.

280
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,560
 I hope not.

281
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,080
 I don't know what.

282
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,400
 But creepy story, I have to say I read this story probably about a week or two ago and

283
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,800
 I prepped these stories and I haven't seen anything in my house like that.

284
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:55,120
 So I'm not super worried that it's a curse, but still really fascinating, creepy ghost story.

285
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,800
 And then I started thinking, what if it wasn't necessarily a demon?

286
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,480
 What if it wasn't the separate spirit?

287
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,800
 What if it was her?

288
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,280
 What if it was her mental anguish?

289
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:11,200
 It was like a bio location, her astral projecting over to him because she loved him too.

290
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,360
 But it was all of the evil and the darkness out of her.

291
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:20,280
 So she almost exercised herself, like her possessiveness and her jealousy and all these

292
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,280
 negative emotions, all these dark emotions left her body to be with him and then they

293
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,960
 dissipated and now they're both better people for it.

294
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,360
 I mean, I don't know if he's necessarily a better person when they end up happily married

295
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,440
 and have kids and their kids go, Daddy, our monster is real.

296
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,880
 He's going to look at his hand.

297
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,040
 He's going to look at his hand and he goes, yeah, they're real.

298
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,720
 They are real.

299
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,080
 Max and Claire, let's go ahead and touch the keys of the carpenter.

300
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,280
 He was taking a nap that whole time.

301
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,760
 He's like, what did I miss?

302
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,080
 Max, go wash your hands and then I'm going to touch the keys of the carpenter.

303
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,520
 We are leaving behind Sweden.

304
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,600
 We're headed all the way out to Ocate.

305
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:09,480
 How would you like to be featured on an episode of Dead Rabbit Radio?

306
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:15,160
 All I need is for you to record yourself chanting Earth First, Earth First, Earth First and

307
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:19,120
 email it to deadrabbitradio@gmail.com.

308
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,960
 Send me that and I will insert it into an episode.

309
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,960
 I'm fine choosing.

310
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,960
 I'll just make some random episode.

311
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,080
 It'll be about like haunted houses or something.

312
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,320
 I know I'm doing a remaster of my Earth First episode.

313
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,200
 I'm going to put that in the show notes, but I want everyone to record themselves chanting

314
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,200
 it.

315
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,200
 Email it to me at deadrabbitradio@gmail.com and put in the email that I have permission

316
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,280
 to use your voice.

317
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,040
 Together, we will rise up and we'll defeat the Martian menace.

318
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,960
 You have until Valentine's Day, February 14th to submit your entry.

319
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:52,280
 Earth First.

320
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,720
 Before we get out there, I want to do a really quick Dead Rabbit Recommends.

321
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,000
 I watched this awesome movie the other day.

322
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,840
 It's available on Hulu, so you can watch it for free.

323
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,000
 It's one of those movies that I don't really want to tell you much about because part of

324
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,200
 it is the journey.

325
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,400
 It's called We Have to Do Something.

326
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,880
 We Have to Do Something and it's the story of a family.

327
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,880
 It's like a mom and dad, brother and a sister.

328
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,080
 There's this huge tornado and they get locked inside this bunker.

329
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,920
 It was like this outdoor bathroom spa area that they built in their house.

330
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,520
 They run into it because it's the safest place for the tornado and a tree falls in front

331
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,520
 of the door.

332
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,200
 The entire movie takes place in this one room.

333
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,080
 There's a couple of flashbacks, but the plot is all in this one room.

334
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,520
 If you know anything about me, I love movies.

335
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,520
 I don't know what it is.

336
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,040
 I love single location films.

337
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,040
 They are hands down to me the hardest movies to pull off.

338
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,920
 When you can do it, phenomenal stuff.

339
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:51,040
 When we look at movies like Cube, when we look at movies like Resolution, when we look

340
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:57,040
 at these movies that only take place in one location, they can either suck or they are

341
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,640
 some of the best movies I've ever seen.

342
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,640
 Coherence.

343
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,080
 Oh my God, coherence.

344
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,040
 So you have these movies.

345
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,400
 And this is a movie about this family trapped in this room.

346
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:13,880
 And the question is, was this a natural disaster or is it the end of the world?

347
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,720
 It's so interesting.

348
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,720
 I feel like anything else I say about it, because I knew nothing going in and part of it is

349
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,720
 the mystery.

350
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,440
 The flashbacks are setting up, other stuff that I never would have expected.

351
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:32,560
 So it's a really good, really tightly made horror movie with one of the saddest death

352
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,240
 scenes I've seen in a long time.

353
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,720
 In a really, really long time.

354
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,440
 Not like Iron Man getting poked in the brain or whatever like that.

355
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,000
 This is such a mournful death scene.

356
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,640
 You feel it.

357
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,640
 You feel it.

358
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,800
 Sorry to all the Iron Man fans out there, but it's so such a dark death scene.

359
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,800
 Really, really good movie.

360
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,800
 Really, really good acting.

361
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,320
 Great plot.

362
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,920
 We have to do something.

363
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,920
 Check it out.

364
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,920
 Dead Rabbit recommends we have to do something.

365
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,400
 It's free on Hulu.

366
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,040
 Max, I want you to land this carbonicopter right here.

367
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,800
 We're flying over this little place in Spain.

368
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,320
 We see it's a lot of rubble and there's kind of like this big white tower that remains of

369
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,840
 a chapel maybe.

370
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,800
 From the carbonicopter down right here, and we get out, we're walking around all slow

371
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,840
 motion all dramatic.

372
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,720
 We're walking around the town of Ocate.

373
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,720
 This is in the county of Trevino in northern Spain.

374
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,560
 This is a city where legend and truth collide.

375
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:37,480
 And maybe, maybe, something much, much darker than we could ever imagine.

376
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,160
 Now this is Basque territory.

377
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,880
 Spain was controlled by the Basque people for thousands of years.

378
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,920
 And this settlement has been around since the Bronze Age.

379
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,480
 And from basically, basically from then, basically from cavemen going, "Oh, what's this?

380
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,880
 I can make a hammer out of this.

381
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,880
 Smash your brain."

382
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,280
 To the 1300s.

383
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,160
 This was a populated area.

384
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,600
 The hills are uneven, so there's not a lot of farmland, but they found a way to make it

385
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,600
 work.

386
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,720
 They did a lot of sheep herding, they did a lot of cattle herding.

387
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,360
 And it actually was along a very popular trade route.

388
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,040
 And back then it wasn't called Ocate.

389
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,800
 This town was called Gogate, which meant "Upper Town."

390
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,600
 And the Basque language, it meant "Upper Town," because it's on this hill.

391
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,760
 It's on this big, nice hill, and there's all these other hills.

392
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:33,120
 But they changed the name of it to Ocate, because Ocate, depending on the definition,

393
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,320
 means "the secret door."

394
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,360
 And people started going, "Well, okay, there's kind of a hard find on the map if you change

395
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,360
 the name."

396
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,680
 Why'd you change it to the secret door?

397
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:52,800
 Because this place started to become rumored to be a pathway to a dark dimension.

398
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:59,200
 Now this isn't something that paranormal researchers have called Ocate, that some guy

399
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,800
 renamed as some sort of creepypasta.

400
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,800
 No.

401
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,960
 And this is known as one of the most mysterious places in all through Spain.

402
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,000
 This is a huge tourist attraction.

403
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,120
 People come out to look around at these rocks, to look at these pillars, because of the stories

404
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,240
 that this settlement is actually a portal to another dimension.

405
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,600
 There's other versions of the name, depending on the translation.

406
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,320
 Sometimes it's called Diabolos de Ocate, which means "the secret door of the devil."

407
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,200
 Sometimes it's called Oxate, which is the Wolves' door.

408
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,320
 So there's doors all around.

409
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,480
 None of these are good doors, by the way.

410
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,720
 So when we look back at this language change, you ask the question, "Why did they change

411
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,820
 it?"

412
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,680
 Because they were scared.

413
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:47,440
 From the Bronze Age until the 13th century, this was a settled area.

414
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,480
 And then everyone left.

415
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,440
 Now people go, "They left because of the trade route."

416
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,120
 There's a trade route that used to go by there, and it stopped going by there.

417
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,240
 This stuff happens in America.

418
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,360
 That's what causes ghost towns, highways that are built so people stop going to this town.

419
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,840
 That's true.

420
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,840
 That's true.

421
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,560
 I would ask, "Why did they change the route?"

422
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,560
 As well.

423
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:15,280
 But anyway, so from the 1300s to the 1500s, this settlement was completely abandoned.

424
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,760
 The trade route had moved, and people had heard the stories.

425
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,360
 That is not a good place to go.

426
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,120
 We call it the "secret door," or the "devil's door," or the "wolf's door."

427
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,080
 But in the 1500s, the city springs back to life.

428
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,080
 People move up there.

429
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,880
 You had, I think it was at a certain point, like 26 people living there.

430
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,360
 It wasn't a bustling metropolis, but you had a lot of families there.

431
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,120
 You had a lot of laborers there.

432
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,640
 And at this point, it was all footpaths.

433
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,320
 The main road had kind of broken down.

434
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,800
 You would take your wagon only so far, and then you'd have to walk up the hill to get

435
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,800
 there.

436
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,280
 So in the 1500s, it is resettled.

437
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,120
 It's forward to the year 1860.

438
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:00,880
 Smallpox ravages the community of Oakate.

439
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,880
 They get through it.

440
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,840
 They lose a couple of people, but they get through it.

441
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,360
 1864, Typhus strikes the town of Oakate.

442
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,360
 Not doing too good.

443
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,040
 You just survived smallpox.

444
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,480
 Now Typhus is coming around.

445
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,640
 1779, cholera strikes this city.

446
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,240
 This is old timey stuff, right?

447
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,680
 People weren't washing their hands.

448
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,560
 People were sleeping with sheep, not sexually, but just using them as big old pillows.

449
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,360
 The point is, is like, they weren't the cleanest of people.

450
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,360
 I don't know.

451
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,360
 I can say that I'm Basque.

452
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,960
 I can say how dirty they were back in 1860, because I'm Basque.

453
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,680
 But, and I don't know if it's scientifically true, but I imagine they were less clean back

454
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,680
 then.

455
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,680
 People were less clean back then.

456
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,680
 Civil war, and you got shot.

457
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,080
 You're like, "Ah, I'm just going to walk around until I die.

458
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,600
 I can't clean this bullet out."

459
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:57,200
 So you have these three viruses, these three horrible plagues hit the city, the plagues

460
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,880
 hit cities today.

461
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,120
 What made this weird was that none of the surrounding towns had any problem with these

462
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,080
 three diseases.

463
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,080
 So that was weird.

464
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,080
 That was a weird part of it.

465
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,240
 So it started making people, again, very superstitious about living here.

466
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,160
 They'd heard the stories as well.

467
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,440
 So the town, again, the people who survived all three of those plagues, they move away.

468
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:27,280
 By 1930, there's only four people living in that town, and today, completely abandoned.

469
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,400
 And that would have been it, right?

470
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,040
 It would have been all the legends.

471
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,400
 It would have been, and really no one was going to tell the legends they all left or

472
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,400
 died of these diseases.

473
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,120
 But what happened was in 1981, the story became national attention again, because there is

474
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,960
 a man named Prudencio Lugurusa.

475
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:52,040
 And Prudencio was at O'Cait one day, and he saw a UFO in the sky.

476
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:56,240
 He took a photo of it, and there was a Spanish magazine called Unknown World, and they published

477
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,240
 this photo.

478
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,520
 So he publishes this photograph in this UFO magazine, and I'll put it in the show notes.

479
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,640
 The photograph is weird.

480
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,520
 Like I looked at it a couple of times, and I was like, "Is this it, or is this like

481
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,520
 some weird drawing?"

482
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:11,360
 It doesn't look like a traditional UFO, but it really took off in the Spanish UFO community.

483
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,040
 And you had people who had heard the legends.

484
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:18,400
 They knew that this place was called the secret door, or the wolf's door.

485
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,640
 This town was known to be weird, and now you have a UFO sighting there.

486
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:29,840
 And Prudencio, this photograph skyrocketed him to the top of the paranormal research

487
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,840
 charts.

488
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:35,040
 In Spain, he ended up quitting his job and becoming a paranormal researcher full time.

489
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,680
 Isn't that the dream, guys?

490
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,040
 Isn't that really the dream?

491
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,480
 He starts dropping some knowledge about this town.

492
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,680
 Now I don't know how much of this is true, a lot of people say it's not true at all,

493
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,800
 but this is dope.

494
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
 This is dope.

495
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,760
 This is what he says he uncovered.

496
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,760
 He's written a book about this.

497
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,760
 It's in Spanish, unfortunately.

498
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,760
 I can't read it.

499
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:56,680
 I mean, it's fortunate for Spanish speakers, but sounds fascinating.

500
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,360
 He goes on to tell the story of the history of O'Cait.

501
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:04,840
 He said back in the 13th century, back when the city first became abandoned.

502
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,840
 This is what happened.

503
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,840
 This is what he said he uncovered.

504
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,560
 "Bleep, blop, lorp.

505
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,240
 Get the thrusters working!"

506
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,000
 One of the aliens said in the spaceship, "I can't.

507
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 They're offline.

508
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 They're offline!"

509
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:26,360
 Another one said, "Sparks are shooting up in the gray alien space."

510
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,520
 A UFO crashed into the town.

511
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,640
 And everyone was out.

512
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,640
 Everyone left.

513
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,080
 And these aliens crawled out of the wreckage of the ship.

514
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:44,040
 Some of them were still alive, and they buried their fallen comrades, their fellow explorers,

515
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:50,040
 left their home who knows how long ago and has now been buried on an alien planet.

516
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,800
 And while the aliens were there, they're like, "We've got to figure out a way to send a

517
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:57,360
 message back or get this ship fixed because this place is a total mudball.

518
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,560
 I'm pretty sure Colorado is going to kill us."

519
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:06,800
 And while these aliens were in this town of O'Cait, the Knights Templar find out about

520
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,160
 them.

521
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:16,040
 So these dudes, these Knights Templar decide to take out the demons that have conquered

522
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,400
 the town.

523
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:24,440
 And there is a battle between these alien survivors and the Knights Templar.

524
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,640
 And eventually, the aliens win.

525
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,280
 They actually push back the Knights.

526
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,920
 They take the town for themselves.

527
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,480
 And they remain there for 34 years.

528
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:42,680
 They put up a permanent settlement for themselves until a UFO showed up, came out of the sky

529
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:47,920
 one day, rescued them.

530
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:52,240
 Now that's one of those stories that whether or not that story is true, that's a dope

531
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,240
 story.

532
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,320
 There's no one else saying anything like this but him.

533
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,320
 Or is there?

534
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,320
 This is really, really interesting.

535
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,320
 I love this story.

536
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,280
 I just found out about it literally yesterday.

537
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,840
 I did a bunch of researching on it.

538
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,760
 And people go, "We think he's making it up.

539
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,040
 We think the photograph might have been a cloud.

540
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,040
 Might have been a UFO."

541
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,040
 We don't know.

542
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,040
 But no one else is saying anything about these aliens crashing.

543
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,640
 But I kept digging into this stuff.

544
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,800
 I kept digging into this stuff.

545
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,800
 Check this out.

546
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:21,160
 The area has a long history of people just vanishing.

547
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,240
 Just gone.

548
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,560
 You also have other stories of people seeing UFOs.

549
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:32,160
 In fact, there is someone who saw UFO before Prudencio even came to town.

550
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:36,520
 In 1978, there was a man named Angel Resniz.

551
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:42,120
 Angel saw a white light emerge from the city, break into three, and then shoot off towards

552
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,600
 a nearby mountain range.

553
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:51,160
 What's interesting about that one is that he saw them come out of, in the middle of

554
00:27:51,160 --> 00:28:00,800
 Okate, there is a giant sarcophagi, a giant tomb that's empty.

555
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,920
 It's just sitting there.

556
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,800
 No one knows who was in it before.

557
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,960
 I don't even know if they know when it was built.

558
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,920
 There's this sarcophagi that's empty.

559
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,440
 And that's where he saw the white light come out of, split into three and flying in the

560
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,160
 mountains.

561
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:23,160
 So is that where the aliens had buried their dead?

562
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,560
 Really really interesting detail.

563
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,560
 And it took me a while to find that.

564
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:31,680
 Like I was reading a report after report and I read multiple reports about this guy Angel

565
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,680
 seeing UFOs.

566
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,720
 Angel seeing UFOs and finally I got to report and they specified they came out of an empty

567
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,720
 grave.

568
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:43,520
 Very very interesting detail because it matches up to Prudencio's account.

569
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,360
 Even today people still see UFOs there.

570
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,480
 Like I said this is one of the most mysterious sites in Spain.

571
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,720
 There's a lot of tourists coming here.

572
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:56,600
 But they had a guy back in 1987, there was a paranormal researcher there with a group.

573
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,960
 And they were looking for the gateway.

574
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,720
 Is the gateway where UFOs are going?

575
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,440
 Is the gateway where the devil's at?

576
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,920
 Is the gateway where people are disappearing to?

577
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,520
 Or is it just a fun day trip for paranormal researchers or everything combined right?

578
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,120
 That's one of the beautiful things about being a paranormal researcher.

579
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,600
 We tend to have pretty open minds.

580
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,040
 Like sometimes it can be so open our brain falls out but it's also fun to just go out

581
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,760
 there and explore these things and think about these ideas.

582
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:27,840
 Well it wasn't super fun for this guy because in 1987 this paranormal researcher went out

583
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,280
 there with the group and they were looking around and at one point during the visit he's

584
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,720
 like hey guys I gotta go take care of something I'll see you later.

585
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:40,120
 And they found him later dead in his car.

586
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,720
 He killed himself with carbon monoxide poisoning.

587
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:52,040
 In 1988 another paranormal investigator, Mikhail Kolmerno, saw two men in black walking around

588
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,040
 O'Cait.

589
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,800
 But these just weren't any men in black.

590
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,480
 This was an agent K and J.

591
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:04,560
 These guys were 10 feet tall dressed in black suits.

592
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,760
 He's a paranormal researcher.

593
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,640
 He's there to see the weird and the odd and the unexplainable.

594
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,360
 He said I was so scared.

595
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,360
 I couldn't move.

596
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,680
 He goes I was sitting in my car and they walked by.

597
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,440
 Because I couldn't, I couldn't move.

598
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,720
 I couldn't function.

599
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,880
 Someone who's trained themselves to look at this type of phenomenon paralyzed him with

600
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,000
 fear.

601
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,320
 So in O'Cait a town that was renamed, it was originally a very descriptive name, Gogate.

602
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,320
 High town.

603
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,200
 It's on the top of this hill.

604
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,160
 But after hundreds of years of experiences lost to time, like we don't know what happened

605
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,860
 between Bronze Age and the 1300s.

606
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:48,600
 But in that time period is when they changed the name to O'Cait.

607
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,640
 Enough stuff was going on that people started calling it Diablo's Day O'Cait.

608
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,640
 Or Oxtate.

609
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,680
 They changed the name of the city because it was so spooky.

610
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:03,560
 So mysterious something was wrong they even knew it back then.

611
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,920
 And today we have UFOs.

612
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,880
 Disappearances.

613
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:16,040
 These legends still exist but what type of location would it be without ghosts?

614
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,360
 This is so scary.

615
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,040
 This is so scary.

616
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:28,760
 If you go to the town of O'Cait there's a chance you will hear a young girl's voice

617
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,840
 telling you to leave.

618
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,120
 Get out.

619
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,960
 That's pretty common in Ghost Lore, right?

620
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,200
 That's something we see in horror movies.

621
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,040
 But there's another voice in the town.

622
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,680
 Nobody knows who it belongs to.

623
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,520
 Nobody knows how long the voice has been there.

624
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:53,880
 But sometimes when you're in the town of O'Cait you'll hear the sorrowful wails of a woman.

625
00:31:53,880 --> 00:32:02,680
 You'll hear her voice hoarse and raw from years, decades, maybe centuries of calling

626
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,840
 out.

627
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,720
 We don't know who she is.

628
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:13,200
 We don't know how long she's been trapped there but she always says the same thing.

629
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,000
 Why?

630
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,160
 Why is the door still open?

631
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,760
 What secrets lie within the town of O'Cait?

632
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:30,480
 Where does the darkness lead on the other side of the devil's door?

633
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,280
 She may never know, but we do know a few people have found out what's on the other side of

634
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,920
 that door.

635
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:44,600
 And the only voice that can penetrate the night and reach back to our realm, our physical

636
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:51,120
 world, is a voice pleading with us to close the door.

637
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:58,560
 It may guarantee that her soul is forever trapped in this living hell, but maybe she's

638
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:24,960
 trying to prevent someone else from walking through the devil's door.

639
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:49,880
