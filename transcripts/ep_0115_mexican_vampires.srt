1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Just one story today, but it's a good one.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 We're going to talk about a small town in Mexico that during the 60s had a real life vampire problem today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 I'm having a great day.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 I hope you're having a great day too.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 This, for the next couple foreseeable episodes, because I have a lot more work.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 I've said this before, I have three jobs and I'm having to do some changing around and things like that.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 So, for the next couple episodes at least, maybe a little bit longer.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 The episodes are going to be a little bit shorter.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Some of them, the stories are going to be shorter.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 So, I don't have to dig through tons of research.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 And some of them, the actual episode length will be shorter.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 But I still want to make sure I get out an episode a day.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 And I don't want to sacrifice quality.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 I don't want to sacrifice consistency with, what's the other thing?

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Oh, with not being on schedule.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Like, I'd rather have an episode out every day that's a little bit shorter than say, I'm only going to release three episodes this week.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 So, I wanted to go ahead and put that out there.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 The quality's the quality.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 The quality's the quality.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 I mean, come on guys, you've been listening to it long enough.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 You're like quality.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 What?

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 He has a nice mic.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 That's his quality.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 And he can edit out deep breathing.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 That's the quality.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 So, but for the next couple days at least, maybe the next week or two,

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 unlikely it'll be that long, but I just need to kind of get used to these changes at work.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 But we'll keep putting out episodes every day.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 So, let's go ahead and get started with the first and really only story tonight.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Our feature story, I have no idea how this has not been made into a movie.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 This is an absolutely insane.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 I just found out about this the other day.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Balls Out Bazaar story.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 So, I'm going to add a little narrative flourish to it.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 I'm going to create a character for us to kind of follow around in the beginning because it gets a little windy.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 But the details and the facts of the story are 100% true.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Check the links below.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 They're there.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 May.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 It's 1963.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 It's May.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 We're in Mexico.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 There's a police station in the town of Villagran and our fictional hero, Roberto, is sitting in there, police station.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Let's say it's 10 o'clock at night.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Smoking a cigarette, drinking coffee.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 One of his fellow officers, Luis Martinez, is sitting there drinking coffee too.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 There's a couple of cops milling about.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 The sergeant's like, "Why aren't you guys clearing these cases?

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Do you know what's going on here?

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 You, you, in my office right now.

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 I'll have your badge."

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 And you're, you know, it's basically an 80s movie.

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 And Roberto is sitting there and Luis is sitting there and all of a sudden this 14 year old boy burst through the front door, dripping sweat, can't catch his breath.

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 [breathing heavily]

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 And Luis is like, "Yo, what's up, dude?

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 What's going on?"

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 And the boy goes, "I ran.

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 I ran all the way from Yorba Buenae.

62
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 I think that's how you pronounce it."

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 The boy's like, "I don't remember how to pronounce the name of my own city."

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Now Luis knows that Yorba Buenae is 14 miles away.

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 This kid's 14 years old, so he didn't take a car.

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 He was sprinted.

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 And Luis is like, "You ran all the way.

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 You ran 14 miles."

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 He's like, "Nearest police station, nearest cops."

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Luis is like, "Okay, what's going on, kid?"

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 The kid finally starts to catch his breath and goes, "Vampires."

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 He knew the X-Files music, but a couple of the cops kind of start laughing.

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Luis kind of turns around, you know, kids probably drunk, maybe walked by some crazy party, but you know, they're like, "Okay, kid, okay."

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 "Why don't you go into the back of the police station, get some sleep.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 I'll take you back to the town tomorrow."

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 And the boy's like, "I'll show you where they're at.

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 I'll show you exactly where I saw the vampires."

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Luis is like, "Yeah, sure, sure."

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 And Roberto kind of laughs.

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Our fictional character in this, so we have a distinct narrative.

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Kind of laughs and is drinking coffee, read of the newspaper.

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 And the next morning Luis and the young boy, whose name was Sebastian Guerrero, jump into Luis's Jeep, I'm assuming, and police Jeep.

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Do they have like police cars in like wilderness areas?

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Like, that's totally off topic anyway.

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 So they hop into his police Jeep, presumably, I'm assuming, and they drive off.

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 And then, you know, the day just goes on, as normal.

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Next morning, Roberto shows up to work.

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 Luis isn't there.

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Roberto's like, "Hey, where's Luis?"

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 And they're like, "Oh, he didn't come in.

91
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 He's probably out at a bar drinking late last night.

92
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 He'll probably wander in any moment."

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Roberto's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, probably, probably."

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Next day, Roberto pulls up to the police station, doesn't see Luis's car in the parking lot.

95
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 He's Jeep.

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Walks in and he goes, "Hey, Luis calling sick?"

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Other officers are like, "We don't know. We haven't seen him in a couple days."

98
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 We really haven't seen him since he went back to Yoruba Buena.

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Buena? Buena? And he just accepted the pronunciation's wrong.

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 We haven't seen him since he went back to Yoruba.

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 I'm glad how the people in the country can't even pronounce the names of the places in their own country.

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 Anyways, Roberto's like, "He's still not back."

103
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 And they're like, "No. Everyone's getting nervous at this point."

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 The next day, Roberto, it's been, what, three or four days now?

105
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 I've even lost track of my own fictional timeline.

106
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 Trust me, the details are real.

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Roberto shows up to the next day.

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 There's still no sign of Luis.

109
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 His car's not on the parking lot.

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 But what Roberto does see is Mexican army troops pulling up in their Jeeps

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 and his fellow police officers putting on their vests,

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 which they probably didn't have back then because it's 1963, they're suiting up.

113
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 And they go, "We're going to Yoruba Buena."

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 We're going to that place we can't pronounce Roberto.

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Roberto's like, "Okay."

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 [imitates the sound of the car]

117
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Now, okay, total that, okay.

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Roberto is fictional. I gotta keep saying that so I'm not throwing you off.

119
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 But the details are so bizarre.

120
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 I needed someone to kind of start that up.

121
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Now we're going back in time one year.

122
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 We're back in the year of 1962, Yoruba Buena.

123
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 There are these two brothers named the Hernandez brothers,

124
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 and they were conmen.

125
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 They were conmen all their lives.

126
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 But they were small conmen.

127
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 And one day they decided for whatever reason.

128
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 They said, "You know what we need to do if we really want to live a life of comfort?

129
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 We need to start a cult."

130
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 They're like, "Yeah, dude, that's a great idea. How do we do that?"

131
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 It's kind of molded around for a while tossing around.

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 They found the town of Yoruba Buena.

133
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 They weren't from there. They're from the big city.

134
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 And they went to this town, and it was a very impoverished town,

135
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 and they showed up and they've uneducated illiterate people for the most part.

136
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 If you're from there, I apologize.

137
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 That's from the articles I read I haven't been there.

138
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 It's not my recommendation of the town.

139
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 These two brothers show up and they tell.

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 It's almost like this weird flimflam,

141
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Pete's dragon type of like, huxterism,

142
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 where these two guys show up in a town and they're like,

143
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 "We are prophets from the exiled Incan gods."

144
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 And people are like, "What?"

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 I'm assuming they were wearing costumes.

146
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 I don't think they showed up in like flip-flops.

147
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 But they're like, "We are prophets from the exiled Incan gods

148
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 in the mountain ranges surrounding this town.

149
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 There are caves."

150
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 And in those caves, the Incan gods left their gold,

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 but they protect that gold.

152
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 They're living in those caves.

153
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Now, we can help you find that gold if you worship us.

154
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Now, I don't think their act took hold right away.

155
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 I don't think people are like, "Well, golly, that sounds like a great plan.

156
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Let's do that."

157
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 I think they kind of wormed their way into the community,

158
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 but they did eventually start to get followers.

159
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Now, this is one of those things where it was like step one,

160
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 step two, step three profit.

161
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 Like they didn't really profit pun intended,

162
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 but they didn't really plan it out.

163
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 So they get these, start to get some of these villagers under their thrall.

164
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 And they're like, "Well, you know, like what do we do now?"

165
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 And first they're like, "You must pay us tribute. You must worship us."

166
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 So that starts to happen.

167
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 These people do start to worship them.

168
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 And again, they didn't just show up.

169
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 The people aren't so stupid.

170
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 They jumped off the back of a truck and said, "We're gods."

171
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 And everyone started giving them apples.

172
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 But they were conmen.

173
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 They knew how to manipulate people.

174
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 But they started to get these, some of the villagers were starting to pray to them

175
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 as they were these prophets.

176
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 They were getting like food and stuff like that.

177
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 It's not like they had a ton of money, but they were getting some resources.

178
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 These two guys said, "You know what we should do? We should start banging the chicks."

179
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 And they're like, "Oh yeah, that's a great idea."

180
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 So then they're like, "If you want to be part of, if you want some of that ink and that sweet, sweet ink and gold,

181
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 you gotta have sex with us hot, hot Spanish chicks."

182
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 And the girls are like, "Uh, okay. There's not much else to do around here."

183
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 It's 1962. What's on television?

184
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Oh wait, we don't have a television. We're in the middle.

185
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 We're like the most poverty-stricken region of Mexico.

186
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 So then that's not enough for them. They go, "You know what? Okay, so we're banging all these hot chicks

187
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 and that's cool and all."

188
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 This is weird leafin' logic. We're banging all these hot chicks and that's cool and all,

189
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 but you know what? I've always really wanted to do, brother.

190
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Other brothers are like, "What?" He's like, "I wanted to bang dudes."

191
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 So then, for whatever reason, they start banging dudes too.

192
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 They start saying, "If you want to get some of this sweet, sweet ink and gold, you guy have to start having sex with us."

193
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 "You have to start having sex with me." What? Anyways, I guess you're never happy with what you have.

194
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 So now they're banging both the chicks and the dudes.

195
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 The cold actually gets bigger at this point, surprisingly.

196
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 And they start having these huge drug-fueled orgies, which again, I guess it's something to do on a Saturday night in Yerba Buena.

197
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 But now, people are like, "You know what? I'm tired of getting banged up in the mountains and not getting none of them sweet, sweet ink and gold."

198
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 So people start saying, "This is all a fraud." Like, "Yeah, we've given you a couple apples and you've given us a couple of STDs, but where's the gold?"

199
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 And so, members start to say, "Let's quit. Let's quit." And they start to leave.

200
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 The Hernandez brothers know that their gimmick is almost up.

201
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 The Hernandez brothers come up with another thing they need to do.

202
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 It is, we are going to find a goddess.

203
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 So they go to the nearby town of Monterey and they meet a prostitute and her pimp, the prostitute's name is Magdalena.

204
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Or is it Magdalena? It's Magdalena.

205
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 So the prostitute's name is Magdalena Solis.

206
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 I personally love the name Magdalena. I don't like how you can shorten it to Mag.

207
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Look, that's gross. But Magdalena, I think, is a beautiful name.

208
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Magdalena Solis was a prostitute. She was a prostitute, like, as a young teen.

209
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 And her brother pimped her out, so not coming from the best background. It's an understatement.

210
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Anyway, so he, the Hernandez brothers meets Magdalena Solis and her brother, Solis? Solis?

211
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 We'll say Solis, because it actually kind of plays into her type of character.

212
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 And they go, "Hey, listen, we're running this, we got this great scam going at this podunk little hillbilly town out here in Mexico."

213
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 But we need someone to play a goddess. And maybe a god.

214
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 I think they might have thrown the brother a bone or something like that, but most of the story centers around Magdalena.

215
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 And they're like, "You can be this, you're just going to pretend, pretend to be in the operative word, that you're the reincarnation, or you're an avatar of this Incant God,

216
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 and we're going to be living in that with the, we're going to have unlimited apples. We'll have so many apples."

217
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 I don't know where they grow out there, but we're going to have unlimited apples.

218
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 These people are just going to give us apples, give us food, give us all this stuff, and if you're into it, you can bang them.

219
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 And Magdalena Solace is like, "Okay, that works. I think this will work."

220
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 So they go up back to Yoruba Buenay, and one time they're having a ceremony up in the caves, like they normally do, and they, and the people, again, the villagers are kind of like, "Ah, not another orgy. Ugh."

221
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 "When's the gold coming?" So they're very dissatisfied. I'm sure there was a couple of them who were like, "It's orgy night!"

222
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 But they're doing their thing, and all of a sudden a smoke bomb goes off, and the people are like, "What? What? Ugh. What's going on?"

223
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 And out of the smoke steps Magdalena in full goddess clothing, like beads and stuff.

224
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 And she declares herself to be the goddess Kotlaku.

225
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 Now, I've read articles in there like, "Well, Kotlaku was actually an Aztec goddess, and how did they not get caught?"

226
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 Well, I guess the people there are too... Nobody cares. Like, if I'm standing there, and I've already been on a bunch of these drug-fueled orgies, and all of a sudden someone pops up and says they're Chuckie Cheese out of the smoke,

227
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 I'm not going to be like, "Chuckie Cheese, that's official." I'm just going to be like, "I'm going to accept it as true," because I've already done so many other insane things.

228
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 But anyways, Kotlaku is an Aztec god that she chose. Magdalena says, "I'll be Kotlaku. I'll be this goddess." This reincarnation of the goddess.

229
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Little did the Hernandez brothers know that Kotlaku is known for her human sacrifices and blood drinking.

230
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 So, the people now are totally on board. They're like, "Whoa, we actually saw this god. The gold must be here." The Hernandez brothers were telling the truth the whole time.

231
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 I don't think they went by Hernandez brothers, but, you know, they accepted the prophet's teachings.

232
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 And they continue on with the drug-fueled orgies and stuff like that. They've now bought themselves more time.

233
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Little Misses at Magdalena starts to believe she starts to have a mental breakdown and she starts to believe she truly is the goddess Kotlaku.

234
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 She is no longer an act. Her brother and Hernandez brothers, it's still just a con game, but to her, it's, "She is this god."

235
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 So, the orgies start to get darker. Not--they didn't turn the lights down.

236
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 They start to--she starts to incorporate elements of BDSM--beadings, whippings, pain, 'cause that's what got her off.

237
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 So, you have these villagers who before would just go up for like a good porking with their neighbor, but now they're like getting like beat up as their goddess is laughing at them.

238
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 So, now people are like, "It's--we--if there's any truth to this, you need to show us the gold now 'cause I'm tired of showing up and getting kicked in the nut sack because you think it turns you on."

239
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 And two of the members were--I don't know if those were their exact words, but two of the members said, "We're done."

240
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Where they're up in the cave and these two people are like, "There's been no results. We don't believe this stuff. We're done."

241
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 And Kotlaku, Magdalena, points at them and says, "Non-believers, get them."

242
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And the two men were lynched. They were beat up and then hung by their neighbors, by the fellow villagers.

243
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 And at that point, the drug-fueled orgies became basically drug and blood-fueled orgies.

244
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 People--there's bloodletting, people are getting poked and stabbed and bleeding and having--just this violent sex.

245
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 And then Magdalena goes, "Because I'm this goddess, the only way that--" 'Cause I'm actually this goddess and this isn't an act.

246
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 The only way I can stay young is to drink human blood. So anytime anyone started to say, "I don't know about this," or whatever,

247
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 or, you know, there's not enough apples at this orgy, I'm out, they were sacrificed.

248
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 But the two first two dudes just got hung and you're like, "Well, okay, that's a bad way to get hung in an orgy."

249
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 I'm sorry, I don't know why I told that joke.

250
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 The first two dudes were just hung. The rest of them had to go through the ceremony that Magdalena had created.

251
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 See, she's just absolutely nuts at this time. They were beat up, then they were burned, they were set on fire, they were cut,

252
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 maimed, which generally has to do with body parts being removed or your face being, you know, you don't really maim people on the chest.

253
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 It's usually like you're cutting their eyes out, actually, you can maim them while they're still alive, this stuff.

254
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 And then the coup de gras is they would remove your heart while you are still alive as well.

255
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 And then they would just let you bleed to death. There was no literal coup de gras, they just let you bleed out,

256
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 they rip your heart out, show it to you a bit if you still have your eyeballs.

257
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 Hold it up to your ear if you don't, and then they just let you bleed out.

258
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 And she would take the blood in a chalice and she would drink it and she would give it to her brother,

259
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 and then the Hernandez brothers would drink some, they'd put a little chicken blood in there, I don't know why,

260
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 they'd water it down as pure human blood. And then the villagers, the dudes' neighbors that they just murdered would then have to drink out of this chalice.

261
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 Eight known victims. And there's possibly more, and we don't know, because what happened next was 14-year-old Sebastian Guerrero one night,

262
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 here's a bunch of noise up in the caves, thinks, "Whoa, that must be a cool party going on up there!"

263
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 One of them watching one of them spooky movies, like "Creature from the Black Lagoon" because it's 1962!

264
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 So he climbs up and he looks in a cave and he sees blood everywhere, heart being removed from a guy,

265
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 Magdalena holding up a chalice of human blood and drinking it.

266
00:17:51,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 And he then, like I said, runs 14 miles, gets to the police station at Villa Grande, runs through the door.

267
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 Roberto, the Mexican army, the police are descending into the town of Yerba Buenay.

268
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 People just start scattering, because they know the jig is up.

269
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 One of their Hernandez brothers gets killed in a shootout with the military.

270
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 And the reason why they brought the military is because they did not know what was going on.

271
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 All they know is one of their officers and a little boy left and never returned.

272
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 And they were like, "There might actually be vampires out here, we don't know."

273
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 They descend upon the town, shoot out with one of the brothers, they kill him.

274
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 The other brother actually gets killed by another sect member who that day made his move.

275
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 He knew it was a gimmick and he was trying to blackmail his way into the group.

276
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 He would have gotten his heart ripped out if none of this had happened, this other sect member.

277
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Magdalena and her brother, they were found stoned out of their mind while all this is going on.

278
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 A copious amount of marijuana and they were both just blitzed.

279
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 And they were just stoned out of their mind, probably watching like Mighty Mouse or something.

280
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Cops come in.

281
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 They did end up finding six bodies hidden in the caves and that's why they think there was not really more than that.

282
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 And they did find the body of Sebastian Guerrero and the body of Luis Martinez, the cop.

283
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 His heart had been ripped out.

284
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 So he had gone through the ritual, he most likely had his heart ripped out while he was still alive.

285
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 And then with, you know, they still had a bunch of followers.

286
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 They had a gun battle up in the mountains.

287
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 The army had to flush them out of the caves and a bunch of the cult members got killed trying to guard the insurance of their gods.

288
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 And then the ones that did get arrested, they all got sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murders.

289
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Actually, everyone only got sentenced for the two murders of the cop and the kid.

290
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 Magdalena and her brother ended up getting sentenced for 50 years.

291
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 And at this point, I looked it up.

292
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 Magdalena would be free, but she'd also be 80 years old, so I'm not worried about her.

293
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 However, I did think about this, too.

294
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 What if she's drinking of human blood that she's immortal?

295
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 What if she's still a 30-ish something looking prostitute walking the streets of Mexico looking for another group of worshipers?

296
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Yeah, probably not.

297
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 But I do think she probably just died in prison because, I mean, 50 years is a long time to be in prison.

298
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 When I was reading the story, I was like, "This is the plot to Resident Evil 4."

299
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 I mean, this is this crazy cult taking over town and slowly corrupting everybody.

300
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 And I think it's funny because, one, I've never heard of the story.

301
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 It's completely cinematic. It actually has a narrative arc.

302
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 They don't need to make up Roberto. That was just easier for the podcast.

303
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 But it has this narrative arc and there's backstabbing and these weird twists and turns.

304
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 But also, I would like to see... You can make a thriller based on this story,

305
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 but I would like to see a comedy based on the guy who lives in this town who's not part of the cult.

306
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 That would be hilarious movie.

307
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 Well, I mean, without all the heart removal, but you have a guy who's just like a heart...

308
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 He's basically like a Hank Hill type guy living in this town,

309
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 and everyone in the town starts to join this blood and drug-fueled sex cult.

310
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 It ends up sacrificing people and drinking blood and you'd be like, "Dag, nab it. Why won't those kids just keep it down at night?"

311
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 And people are like, "Ah, my soul! My soul!"

312
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 And he's trying to fix his car and he's shaking his fist.

313
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 And he's mowing his lawn. There's human bones getting kicked out of his lawnmower and he's like,

314
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 "Oh, damn vandals. They need to stay out of here."

315
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 That would be a great... That would be a great comedy.

316
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 I guess there's no hero in that. I guess you have basically the anti-hero as, like,

317
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 the honorary dad and then you just have a bunch of murderers running around.

318
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 But yeah, so work on that Hollywood.

319
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 Make a comedy about a guy who lives in a town full of murderous, murderous cult members

320
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 and base it on a real story. That will make a million dollars. I'd watch it, at least.

321
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Nah, but I know what you're thinking.

322
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 Yeah, sure, you wrapped up the story well.

323
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 You told that story amazingly well, Jay. Cineolium is pronounced 30% of it.

324
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 What a great, chilling story, but what happened to Roberto?

325
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 What happened to our fictional hero cop?

326
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 In this true life event, something surely he has a wrap up to the story, right?

327
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 He does, actually.

328
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 He actually was one of the first men out. He was there to avenge the death of his partner

329
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 at the hands of these cult members.

330
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 When he found out that the main people were all arrested or dead already

331
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 and he saw the villagers pour into the caves up in the hills, he was the first one.

332
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 He saw a horse in the field and he's like, "I'm getting on that horse."

333
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 And they're like, "Dude, we have vehicles. You don't have to get on it."

334
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 He gets on the horse and he rides up to the caves.

335
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Guns blazing.

336
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 [Horses blazing]

337
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Villagers, oh, falling. One villager's like, "I was a part of the cult. I was a part of the cult."

338
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 He just happened to be going for his daily jog that day.

339
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 Roberto didn't care.

340
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 [Horses blazing]

341
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 Two gun in a mall.

342
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 But what happens is he gets up there.

343
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 There's a bunch of cult members.

344
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 [Horses blazing]

345
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 They're shooting at him. He's like, "Ah, horse. Get scared from all the bullets. Throw them off."

346
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 [Horses blazing]

347
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 What's a horse noise?

348
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 [Horses blazing]

349
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Quality entertainment here, ladies and gentlemen.

350
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Roberto falls into the dust and he's getting pinned down by gunfire.

351
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 [Gunfire]

352
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 And he's shooting back.

353
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 [Gunfire]

354
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 But he's just outgunned.

355
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 The rest of the army's still like getting into their jeeps to get up to the mountain.

356
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 He shouldn't have taken the horse up here.

357
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 He realizes his mistake, but his heart was so full of hatred towards these horrible vampire people

358
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 that he wanted to have their blood instead.

359
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 So, pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft

360
00:23:49,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 So that's terrible. I'm probably gonna edit that out if you hear it. It's just because I was too tired to edit it out.

361
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 He knows that he is going to face his end, but then he hears something.

362
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 [Horses blazing]

363
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 He looks around.

364
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Can't see.

365
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 He's not coming from the cave.

366
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 [Horses blazing]

367
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 The cult members are like, "Shh!"

368
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 They're like slinking back into the cave.

369
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 I'm glad they've become basically literal vampires at this point.

370
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 Anyways, they're like, "Sunlight, sunlight!"

371
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 [Horses blazing]

372
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 And Roberto is like, "I don't know what that noise is, but I have a feeling it's salvation."

373
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 On deep into the cave, the creatures of the night begin to approach him again.

374
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 Get him. Eat him.

375
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 And he turns to where he now hears the noise coming from.

376
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 And it is salvation.

377
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 The carpenter copters slowly, slowly starts to come down to the mountain.

378
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 Many guns blazing.

379
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 [Horses blazing]

380
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Just villagers getting killed left and right.

381
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 [Horses blazing]

382
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 Just lighting them up with a minigun.

383
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Now, yes, this story takes place in 1963.

384
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 I was born in 1976.

385
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 So in this story, I'm like a little fetus.

386
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 I'm like, "Imbionic fluid is pouring out of the sides of the helicopter."

387
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 The villagers are like slipping on it like home alone.

388
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 They're like, "Ugh!"

389
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 Anyways, people who are new to this podcast are like, "I'm never listening to another episode again."

390
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 Like, you had me with the story, but this is nonsense.

391
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 But if you're a fan of the show, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, all the, all the antibiotic fluids coming out of the helicopter.

392
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 "Get in if you want to live!"

393
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 Fetus Jason yells to Roberto, and Roberto's running to the helicopter,

394
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 dodging the bullets that I was shooting past him, jumps into the helicopter.

395
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 That's the helicopter noise it should have made earlier, actually.

396
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 The helicopter takes off, goes into the sunset.

397
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 I saved our fictional character from fictional death.

398
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 Carbenter copter to the rescue.

399
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 Okay.

400
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 So, yes, so that's where we're at.

401
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 So yes, but everything else is true.

402
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 Everything else in that story was true except for the last three minutes.

403
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
