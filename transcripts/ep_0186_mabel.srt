1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
 And island that can make Mexico richer goes missing?

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,440
 And then we delve back into the vault of Jason Carpenter's personal stories, where I tell you

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:18,240
 the one about me, the Scientologist girl, and possibly seeing proof of an afterlife today on

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:29,840
 Dead Rabbit Radio. Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,760
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too.

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,840
 So we're gonna go ahead and jump right into this. This is the Friday episode, this is the

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,200
 episode before the weekend. I guess that's kind of implied by the Friday episode part, but I hope

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,520
 you guys have a great weekend, but we've got some good stuff for you here today. Now the first story

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,200
 is actually from the conspiracy iceberg. It's about middle tier, and again, a lot of stuff in

10
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,000
 the middle tier, there's definitely something behind it. It's not just word soup, I actually now have

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,880
 come, I've come to the conclusion now that I think most of them do have something connected to it,

12
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,440
 even if it's kind of lame. But this one's really interesting, so this is on the conspiracy iceberg,

13
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:16,720
 and it's listed as Isle Bermeja. Bermeja? Bermeja? It's in Mexico, so I think the J is an H,

14
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,440
 and I think the Isle is probably even spelled differently. Here I have it written down as

15
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:32,240
 Isla, so what is that? Isla Bermeja? Okay, Isla Bermeja. The beautiful Mexican island, now it

16
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,240
 doesn't exist, and this is where the controversy comes from, because this island, we'll just call

17
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,200
 it the Isle from here on out to spare you guys me saying the name over and over again, the Isle

18
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,200
 that is listed on the map, which is on tons of maps over the course of 200 years that originally

19
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,680
 it shows up on maps as early as the 1500s, but around the time of the 1700s doesn't show up on

20
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:03,360
 maps anymore. So the reason why this is important to Mexico is because this island is farther off

21
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,880
 the coast, and it allows Mexico to expand its borders. The reason why that's important is because

22
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:14,720
 Gulf of Mexico has massive oil reserves, and the far, I think it's like a two, you have up to 200

23
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,960
 miles from your furthest border to where you can drill for oil. That was a treaty that America

24
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:27,040
 and Mexico came up with. So if they can say, well this island is 43 miles away from the Yucatan,

25
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,400
 they've now extended their oil drilling range 43 miles, and then America goes, what island?

26
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,480
 Point to the map, they go this one, and they're like, dude, that map is turning to dust. You can't

27
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,640
 even touch it, you're wearing those special gloves, and we're in a room that has nothing but UV light.

28
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:49,600
 Show me a modern map that has this island on it, and they're like, uh, okay, be right back.

29
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,800
 They've been searching for this island for a while now. I think it really became an issue

30
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,320
 because what happened was, it's not on modern maps, but it's on the older maps, and in Mexico,

31
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,920
 in the Mexican government, when they were looking at the oil rights and stuff like that,

32
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,800
 some historian or someone came to them and says, hey, there's this island that allows us to push

33
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,880
 off further. Maybe we should just get photographs of the island and we can extend our borders.

34
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,640
 So they started sending out planes and boats and stuff like that, and they can't find the island,

35
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,200
 and they're going off of these old, tiny maps. They're like in the boat, and they're holding it,

36
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,600
 and it's like in plexiglass, and they're just like scanning it, covering it up with an umbrella,

37
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,720
 so the sunlight doesn't hit it, and they're like, dude, we could have just taken a photocopy. Shut up.

38
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:36,800
 Try not to get it wet, this 300-year-old map. But they can't find it, and America says it doesn't

39
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,480
 exist. America actually says it never existed, and we'll get to that in a second. But the Mexican

40
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,760
 government is still trying to find this island, because again, it's worth a lot of money if they

41
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,520
 do. So these are the theories. The first off that the island existed at one point, there was a massive

42
00:03:53,520 --> 00:04:00,080
 earthquake, and it fell apart. Just like a cookie. Crumbles like a cookie into the ocean. That's the

43
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:08,160
 end of it. The other one that I saw was global warming, and then the other theory that Mexico has

44
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,760
 is that the dastardly government of the United States of America bombed the island out of existence.

45
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,520
 Now, that's a popular conspiracy theory among the people who are looking into this,

46
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,800
 that the island existed and America just blew it up. The pushback on that, and other researchers

47
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,760
 have said this, because a lot of time and money is, even though like this is a very obscure conspiracy

48
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,760
 theory for most people, a lot of time and money have been put into finding this island, because

49
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,560
 it's worth millions of dollars if they can prove it exists. The pushback to America blowing it up,

50
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,360
 they'd say, "Well, they could have, but they would have had to do it fairly recently." So for

51
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,960
 them to be able to blow up an island without the government of Mexico knowing would be kind of hard

52
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,280
 to pull off. It'd be kind of hard to pull off. So what could it actually be? Did the island actually

53
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,320
 existed sometime and it was destroyed, or that it was destroyed naturally, or was destroyed by the

54
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,080
 US government? Is it some sort of bizarre Mandela effect where everybody doesn't remember the island

55
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,240
 being there except the Mexican government? Is this there? Is this Mexico's Berenstein-Barris

56
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:17,280
 incident? What's interesting is when I was reading about this, there is a very kind of mundane answer

57
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,960
 to this, but it's weird because it opens up in other cannaworms. One of the theories is that the

58
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,840
 island did never existed at any point in time, and the reason why it was written on the maps

59
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,880
 was to confuse your enemies. If they saw a little island in the corner of your map, they could go,

60
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,720
 "Oh, we could land there, we could drop troops, or we can put spies there, or this is where they'll

61
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,560
 have that," and then the island doesn't exist at all. They said there was actually common for

62
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,640
 cartographers. You're surprised I could pronounce that word. People were saying that back then

63
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:55,120
 cartographers would actually make fake places, make fake islands, make fake ravines, or whatever,

64
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,000
 to confuse your enemies. Now, it's not really helpful if all you have, if you're lost at sea,

65
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,920
 and all you have is a map, and you think, "Oh man, I'm almost there," and then there's nothing there.

66
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:09,760
 But for the most part, the maps would actually work in deceiving other people, other governments,

67
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:15,280
 not your stranded sailors, but other people where your territory was. And what's interesting about

68
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,200
 it is we actually still do that today in the most common way, but for a different reason.

69
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:27,040
 You ever see those like Rand McNally maps, and they also have those books. I remember when I was a

70
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:34,080
 pizza delivery driver, we had those books of maps, and I don't know if GPS people do it, but I'm

71
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,320
 pretty sure they do it as well. They put fake roads in their maps. I know for certain that the

72
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:46,560
 printed map books have fake roads in them, and I'm pretty sure GPS also will insert a fake road

73
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:53,600
 here and there, and the answer is really simple, of why. It's copyright protection. Maps themselves,

74
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:59,920
 geographical locations cannot have a copyright on them. And what was happening was people were

75
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:05,200
 companies were putting all this time and money into creating these maps of local areas, and then

76
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,680
 another company would simply, not like photocopy, the copy, they didn't just run it off on a black

77
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,080
 and white Xerox, but they were copying the maps and then releasing them saying, "Oh no, this is my

78
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,120
 book," and I didn't put any of the money into building the map in the first place. So map

79
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,720
 companies started putting in fake roads, fake courts, little areas that don't exist that you

80
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,080
 wouldn't notice at all if you lived in that neighborhood, but the person who made the map

81
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,800
 would go, "That's not, that is a fake street. I made that street up. That street doesn't exist."

82
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,480
 But let's put those two things together now. We know that we do it today for copyright reasons.

83
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,000
 They put in fake streets, and I think the reason why they still do that with GPS software, because

84
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,960
 it's the same problem. Someone could just take all the data from one GPS company and put it in

85
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,560
 another. A map company is what I mean. Not necessarily GPS, but you know they have like the

86
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,960
 Google Maps and stuff like that. Those fake roads that are there, I imagine it playing out like

87
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:09,280
 this in this weird sort of way. A man has a house on a street. He's lived there all of his life.

88
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:18,960
 He goes to work, raises his kids, all of that stuff. And then one day he realizes that the street

89
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:26,960
 that he spent his entire life living on doesn't exist. It never existed. It was a little line

90
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:35,760
 drawn by a map maker for copyright protection. How would you reconcile that? He would have proof

91
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,880
 in the form of a map saying, "No, my street is here." I mean, I know this gets into horror movie

92
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:49,440
 territory, but is it possible that by just through the power of thought and will, by drawing this

93
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:56,640
 map and putting this little island on here, that so many people are searching for, that's never been

94
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,600
 found and never been recorded being cited other than on those maps, is it possible that someday

95
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:10,160
 that island will be found? And there will be people on it who wondered, "What are you guys so worried

96
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,840
 about? We've always been here. We went to Mexico all the time and we met you. Why are you guys

97
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:23,360
 looking so confused?" Now, of course, horror movie scenario. Twilight Zonish. But I think when you

98
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,120
 start messing with reality like that, when you start putting stuff into reality that shouldn't

99
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,680
 be there, that's not supposed to be there for simple reasons, who knows what can result from that?

100
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,760
 Who knows what can result from that? But let's go ahead and move on to our next story. Now,

101
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,360
 our next story also has a bit to do with the power of the mind. So, for our next story, like I said,

102
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,240
 we're going to go back into the vault of my personal experiences. This one's always been a

103
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:55,440
 little weird to me and I've never known really where to place it in the Partheon of, is it Partheon

104
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:04,960
 or Pantheon? Anyways, in the big building of Jason experiences, but a little way to begin it. So,

105
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:11,280
 my dad was a Southern Baptist minister as I was growing up and he was also going to college to be

106
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:16,240
 a minister as well. So, it's like you can preach at individual churches, but like for the Southern

107
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,320
 Baptist, there was like you got ordained and then you could do this whole college thing. So,

108
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,040
 he had to learn like Latin and Greek and Hebrew. He was got fluent in that. He had to learn all

109
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,000
 about biblical history and philosophy and counseling and stuff like that. He had to go on and get his

110
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,800
 bachelor's degree and his doctorate and all that stuff. But at the time, I was about seven years

111
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:41,200
 old in the story, so that's going to place us around 1983, 1984. My dad was also a chaplain,

112
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,120
 because he was preaching at a church. He was going to school and you still ministers don't make a lot

113
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,600
 of money. He also had a job working at a hospital as a chaplain. Now, I remember once when I was a

114
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:00,160
 kid, my dad said, "Hey, Jason, come with me to this thing I got to do at the hospital." And I

115
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,120
 don't remember why. I don't know if we didn't have a babysitter or what was going on. But for

116
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,120
 whatever reason, I go with my dad. Maybe I just want to spend time with my dad. Me and my dad,

117
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,720
 he was a big sports guy. He did really into sports and I wasn't. So, it was maybe he was a bonding.

118
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,160
 It was definitely a bonding experience. So, he takes me to the hospital and he's like, "Here,

119
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,720
 go in this room with this nice doctor and he'll put on this snuggie coat for you." And I'm like,

120
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,520
 "No, daddy, no." He's like, "Luck him in." But no, no, no. So, he takes me to the hospital. And I

121
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:34,080
 don't remember the exact sequence of events of how he got here. I do remember being a little kid.

122
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:39,360
 And basically, to jump to where this... because I'm not going to say, "And then I went to a

123
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,760
 vending machine." That's so to sure was good. Co-classic. Like, I mean, it was a bunch of mundane

124
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:50,160
 stuff. But the way it happens is I end up in a room. My dad is there giving... not giving last

125
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,760
 rights, because that's not what Southern Baptists do. But he was basically counseling this man who

126
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,880
 was dying. And he was like in hospice for a while and stuff like that. And the man's family was there.

127
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,320
 And I don't know what he was dying of, but it was something that they could predict. And he was

128
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,400
 basically, it was his last night on earth. And I remember I was standing in the room,

129
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:15,040
 this little chubby boy. And there was probably maybe like eight or nine other people in there

130
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,480
 that are his family members, plus my father. And I was the youngest. Everyone else was an adult.

131
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,040
 The man who was dying was much, much older. So his kids are all older. Things like that.

132
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,400
 And so I remember at one point, my dad says, "I'm going to have some private words with him."

133
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:36,880
 So if you... everyone could step out for a second. So we all kind of shuffled out into the hallway

134
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,520
 of the hospital. And I'm standing out there in the hallway and everyone's just kind of milling

135
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:47,120
 about talking. And I remember specifically, this is where my memory really picks up. I'm leaning

136
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:54,400
 against the wall of the hallway. And standing next to me is his adult son, who was probably a brown

137
00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:01,120
 my age, maybe a little younger now. So he might have been like late 30s, early 40s, maybe. I didn't

138
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,240
 ask him for his ID, but I'm sitting there. I'm standing there with my back against the wall.

139
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,320
 And he's standing there back against the wall too. And basically we were both sons. We were both

140
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:21,440
 sons there with our father. And we start chit-chatting. Just, you know, did you watch Transformers?

141
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,080
 No, I don't know exactly what we were talking about, but it was just like a casual conversation in the

142
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:32,320
 midst of what was going on. And that went on for a couple minutes. And then my dad came out of the

143
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:40,560
 hospital room and he goes, "It's time." And everyone shuffles back in and I stay exactly where I'm

144
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:46,000
 standing with my back against the wall. And my dad goes, he pokes his head back out of the hospital

145
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,600
 room and goes, "I want you to see this." So he leads me in the hospital room. They shut the door.

146
00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:00,800
 And there I am, seven years old, watching this family sob around a man I never met before.

147
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:08,640
 And him just going, "It's okay. It's okay. I'm going to heaven, guys. I'll see you there. Don't cry.

148
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,040
 It's okay. It's okay."

149
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:20,720
 So that was the first time I'd ever seen anybody die. But it wasn't the last. And the story I'm

150
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,080
 about to tell you wasn't the last either. But it leads into an interesting event.

151
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,040
 So now we're going to jump ahead. I believe in this story, I think probably like 19 or 20,

152
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:42,320
 19 or 20. I used to gasoline was like 99 cents a gallon. So I love being alone. I love solitude.

153
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:50,080
 I believe there's a reason why every major religion and most philosophies give great weight

154
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:56,160
 to isolation and being alone. So many of them, when their great leaders go out to discover these

155
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,440
 things, they walk into the wilderness by themselves. There is something very, very powerful about

156
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:07,680
 being alone, which humans don't like and makes them nervous. We're social species. So when we are

157
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,680
 removed from the group, it makes us nervous. But I love it. I love being alone. Gasoline was 99

158
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,200
 cents a gallon. I used to just fill up my gas tank and drive around Sacramento three, four hours a

159
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:26,640
 night. I loved it. I was driving down Hazel Avenue. If you know the area, if you don't, that's fine. But

160
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:31,120
 if you want to reconstruct the events this night, I was driving down Hazel Avenue. I was going through

161
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,520
 leaving Citrus Heights, going through Gold River and was headed towards Rancho Cordova. There's just

162
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:41,440
 straight shot and it's all suburban areas out here. It was probably like two in the morning.

163
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:49,520
 I'm driving down the road and I see smoke in the middle of an island that's separating

164
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,960
 northbound and southbound. If you ever come across the car accident, it doesn't look like ordinary

165
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:01,680
 smoke. It almost has this weird, it doesn't look like billowing smoke like out of a house. So it's

166
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,040
 like basically this weird sort of like mixture of like maybe steam or when an airbag goes off,

167
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,960
 it gives off this big like like this powder type thing. But I'm driving down the road and I see

168
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:18,080
 basically it's almost like a mist type of thing unless the car is straight up on fire. Driving

169
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:25,760
 down the road, I see a car that is facing sideways. So the headlights are headed towards the northbound

170
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:31,200
 side and the tail end is headed towards the southbound side and the car is impacted into a tree on

171
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:38,080
 the island. This is before a lot of people had cell phones. I definitely didn't have one. I pull

172
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:43,920
 over, I hop out of my car. At that point, there are two other people there. It's dead at night.

173
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,880
 Pull over, I hop out of my car to see if I can help anybody. I'm walking up to the car.

174
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,960
 There's this black sporty car, maybe a Honda or something like that. I walk, I see two people

175
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:00,480
 over by the driver's side and they're talking to the driver and the car, the front end is just

176
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:06,160
 mashed. So what happens, they were coming down, looked and then they jumped onto the island,

177
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,680
 hit the tree and then spun a bit and that's why it was facing weird. I see two people talking to

178
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:16,400
 the driver and so I'm walking around to check on the passenger and as I'm walking over there,

179
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,200
 I can hear the driver going, "Oh my god, I can't move. I can't move. I can't move."

180
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:28,080
 Screaming and I walk over there and the two people in the car, there are two young women,

181
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,960
 younger than, older than I was then, but younger than I am now. I would assume, I would say maybe

182
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:40,880
 like 26, 27, somewhere around there, mid 20s. I get to the passenger side and I look and I can see

183
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,480
 the driver and she is just, her head, her body is, she's still sitting up, she still has a

184
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,920
 seatbelt on so she's not slumped over, but she's not moving her arms. She's just screaming at the

185
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:56,960
 top of her lungs, "I can't move. I can't move." I had more pressing concerns because she's screaming,

186
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,640
 she has two people trying to calm her down. They can't touch her because they don't know what happened.

187
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:06,080
 The car's not on fire so it's not a rush. I think one of them ran off to go get a pay phone

188
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,800
 to call the inevitable ambulance that's coming, but I'm standing now at the passenger seat

189
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,920
 and I'm looking in and there is a young woman, both women dressed up for the clubs,

190
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:22,480
 out having a good time, hair done up, everything like that. I'm looking at the woman in the passenger

191
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,400
 seat and her head, she's looking at me. Her head is leaned over and she's like looking out the

192
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:35,600
 passenger window and she's not moving either, but I'm looking at her right in her eyes. I'm watching

193
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:47,360
 her and she's just staring and then she's gone. When you see somebody die, people go, "It's like

194
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:53,600
 shutting off a light bulb." No, it's not because you can turn the light bulb on. It's like if you

195
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:59,360
 shut off a light bulb and it turned into a peach. It becomes something completely different and you

196
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,800
 can just look at it and you go, "Oh, they're dead." They're completely different than how they were

197
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:10,080
 before. It's the most bizarre thing in the world because it's not just like something being shut

198
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:16,960
 off, it's like something being turned into complete inanimate matter and can never be turned back

199
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:23,600
 into what it was. I stood up right when I realized she was dead. I just kind of stood up and looked

200
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,480
 at her and I realized there's nothing I can do for her. She just died. I know for a fact that she

201
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:35,200
 had just died. Eventually another car pulls up even before the ambulance and these guys get out who

202
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,040
 were with them at the club. They were either friends or they were dancing with these girls or

203
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:45,680
 whatever and this one dude is in complete hysterics and he's like, "Oh my god, oh my god. She has kids.

204
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:51,040
 She has a husband at home. This can't be happening. This is totally freaking me out." Now I had to

205
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:57,520
 calm him down because he's not helping the situation at all. He's just totally freaking out. I'm

206
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,120
 like, "Dude, it's okay. No, the ambulance is going to come. They're going to be dead." I knew the one

207
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,360
 woman was already dead. That woman looked like she was paralyzed but she just got a lie to people

208
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,480
 a lot of times in these situations. "Oh no, it's fine, man. Don't worry, but now it's cool. She'll

209
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,120
 see her kids again. They'll come visit her at the hospital. It'll be no big deal. Just flat

210
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,880
 out lying to this dude." Ambulance shows up. I think the fire department showed up as well.

211
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,360
 They had to pull the door open and all that stuff. I got out of there because at that point,

212
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,680
 once I start seeing the emergency personnel show up, I was like, "I'm just an obstacle. I'm going to

213
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:34,560
 get out of here." Now I didn't go there and say, "No, I'm going to watch this woman die." It's weird

214
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:41,200
 to think that that woman, her entire life, 26 years of life, boyfriends, husband, kids, went out that

215
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:49,280
 night clubbing. And the last thing she sees is some just stranger that she's never met before

216
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:56,240
 standing outside her window. That was always very weird to me. We had never met before that and I

217
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:05,680
 was the last human being that she ever looked at. But that aside, that bizarre set of circumstances

218
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,320
 aside, there's a dramatic event, but at the same time it wasn't the first time I'd seen somebody

219
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,800
 die. It wasn't even the first time I'd seen someone grievously injured. I was like, "Okay." But it did,

220
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:24,320
 I think that last thought about how I was the last person, that kind of upset me a little bit.

221
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:32,240
 Because it's just a bizarre set of circumstances. Just to look at someone in the eyes, it was very

222
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,880
 unsettling. So fast forward a couple months. I was hanging out with this girl when I went to

223
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,080
 American River College. And I'll call her Mabel, because she looked like one of the backup dancers

224
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,280
 in that Goldfinger video Mabel. She's really cool. A really good friend of mine. She was a

225
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,480
 Scientologist. And her parents were Scientologists. And they had the books and they took the courses

226
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,600
 and things like that. Now, I had gone to the Scientology, what do they call it, the church,

227
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:05,040
 once to watch some orientation video. I was like, "Whatever. I'm always willing to look into other

228
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:11,120
 belief systems. They didn't really speak to me." But Mabel was really into it. And I was her friend.

229
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:16,080
 And they were having an auditing workshop. And she wanted me to come with her, because I guess if

230
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:21,200
 you brought someone who wasn't a Scientology to this auditing workshop, it was free or something

231
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,520
 like that. So I was like, "Yeah, sure." They had free breath fix. They had croissants and stuff

232
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,120
 like that. And I was like, "Yeah, sure. It's a fun way to spend the afternoon helping my friend out."

233
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,440
 We go to the auditing workshop. Now, a quick overview of auditing. And if you're a Scientologist,

234
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,080
 you may go, "No, no, no. That's totally off base. It has these other steps." But basically,

235
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:44,800
 in a nutshell, is you talk about a horrible experience or any experience you went through.

236
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:51,200
 And then the person has you, then the auditor has you do it again and again and again and again,

237
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,640
 each time in more detail. And basically, you're, it's almost like a self-hypnosis, or you're basically

238
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,600
 like working it through to the point where you're like remembering how many ashes were coming off

239
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:07,360
 the cigarette butt in this memory. When you're in the church, I believe they use the emeters during

240
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,680
 this part, but this one we weren't doing in any emeter. She was just there to get practice on how

241
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:16,800
 to audit. So we're sitting there and we're listening to the presentation. I mean a bunch of croissants.

242
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,000
 And then they're like getting their workbooks together. And I'm still eating some croissants.

243
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,920
 It wasn't on keto back then. And after I'm full of butter and flaky bread, it's time to start.

244
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:31,280
 It's time to break up. So Mabel's like, "Hey, let's do this. Like I'm super excited." So what

245
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,800
 memory do you want to work on? And I'm like, I don't know. I mean, I remember loving those

246
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,840
 croissants I just ate, but I don't think that's going to work. I don't know. And I remember

247
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,760
 sitting there for a while and I was thinking, "What's a memory that I've had that's fairly dramatic,

248
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:56,880
 but not too crazy?" And my mind went to that car accident. So again, you go through the story over

249
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,560
 and over again. And basically, you're cleansing your... I don't want to get too much into the

250
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:09,040
 Scientology terms. So basically, I'll break it down into generic terms. You're cleansing your soul

251
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:13,200
 of these bad memories by putting yourself there and living through them a couple of times. And it's

252
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,480
 like you're basically washing yourself of the memory. They do something similar to that in

253
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:24,000
 psychotherapy or psychology, where it's called immersion therapy, where you just kind of keep

254
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,640
 going over it until eventually you're like, "That's not that bad." They'll do that for war veterans.

255
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,520
 They'll have super realistic FPS shooters where you're not shooting people. You're walking through

256
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:41,600
 populated areas. And it is a valuable form of therapy in the right hands. And Mabel, this was

257
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:49,200
 her very first time auditing. And I chose as her first time auditing a horrific event that involved

258
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,600
 the death of a young mother and another woman most likely being paralyzed from the neck down for

259
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:59,600
 the rest of her life. So we're sitting there and she goes, "Tell the story." And I told the story

260
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,640
 pretty much how I exactly told it to you. I mean, obviously not exactly, but the same sequence of

261
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,800
 events. And I tell her the whole story. It takes maybe like 10 minutes like I did. And she goes,

262
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:16,720
 "Okay, now tell it to me again with more detail." And that's why the story does have a lot of details

263
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,760
 even now when I told it, was because I remember a lot of the details that I remembered back then.

264
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,960
 And I'm like, I remember, but I did remember additional stuff. I was like, I do remember

265
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,560
 like the crunch of my boots on the ground, the mist, the mist coming out of the car. That was

266
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:36,320
 something that I remembered through the auditing because I was focusing on the event over and over

267
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:42,400
 again. I remember my boots hitting the ground. I remember it being a bit cold. I remember that

268
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,000
 she was wearing a short skirt. Like it was definitely a clubbing skirt. The driver had on

269
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,160
 like an electric blue top, a tight top. The passenger had a tight mini skirt on, black top.

270
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:59,360
 I'm remembering all of these details that pop out, that didn't pop out the first time I had told the

271
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:05,280
 story. And she goes, "Okay, tell it to me again." And basically I'm reliving this event over and

272
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:10,240
 over again with the first time auditor. And she, I don't think, is picking up that I'm starting to

273
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,000
 get a little distressed because I'm putting myself back in the situation over and over again.

274
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,640
 But what, the reason why this story is on Dead Rabbit Radio, there was one last time I told that

275
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,040
 story to the auditor. And she goes, "And every time you have to start from the beginning." And

276
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:29,040
 she goes, "Okay, do it again." I'd probably already done it like four or five times at this point.

277
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:36,000
 She goes, "Okay, tell me the story again with more detail." And so this time I'm super concentrating

278
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,520
 on every single detail. Stuff that I missed the first four or five times. I'm trying to relive

279
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:47,520
 that event in such a realistic form that I'm remembering things I didn't remember four times

280
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:54,160
 earlier telling it. And I walk her through the sequence of events just like I did you. The

281
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:59,920
 debit card laying on the ground from the purse flying out the window, those really minor details.

282
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:06,400
 And when I get to the part where I walk to the car and I'm staring at her and she's staring at me

283
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:16,000
 and I'm watching her and she's watching me, I see what could only be described to me. So I remember

284
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,360
 I'm back in this moment. I've put myself, when you're, first you tell the story, but then since

285
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:27,920
 you're looking for details, you're mentally going back to that moment. I walk to the car, I turn

286
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:32,000
 around, I'm looking at her, she's looking at me, the woman screaming, the people are talking. And

287
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:40,560
 for a brief second, for a brief, brief second, what I see is her soul leave her body.

288
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:52,400
 Now, not only that, what I remember seeing through this auditing process was I'm looking at her,

289
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:59,360
 she's looking at me, a translucent blue version of her. This is going to sound ridiculous, but a

290
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:07,600
 translucent blue version of her lifted itself slightly out of her body, began banging on the

291
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:14,960
 window in panic, and then shot into the sky. And then I stood up and knew she was dead.

292
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:22,720
 And I sat there, I didn't tell her that. I didn't tell Mabel that. She goes, I'm telling the story

293
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,040
 again, and I get to the part where I go, I look in the window, and then I open my eyes and I said,

294
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,800
 I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to do this anymore. She goes, are you okay? I was

295
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:37,680
 like, I don't want to do this anymore. I appreciate your time, and I think that you have your skills

296
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,680
 doing this auditing thing, but I don't want to tell that story again. I don't want to tell that story

297
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:46,320
 again. I was distressed. We didn't leave, we stayed. I got some more croissants, because there was

298
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:52,960
 like an after-workout shit thing, but I was a little disturbed by that. And then I told her later

299
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,120
 on, a couple days later, I told her what I saw, and I said, I don't want to do that. I don't want

300
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:03,040
 to do that again. And she said, she apologized. She goes, I should have told you to pick something

301
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,880
 better, because again, it was my first time, and it was your first time. I should have asked you

302
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:13,120
 to pick like a spanking or something like that. Is that why I knew she was dead?

303
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:19,040
 Did I, see the thing is like now with that story, that

304
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,280
 her ghost coming out, looking at, her ghost comes out of her body, her soul, whatever you

305
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:30,320
 want to call it, comes out of her body. It looks exactly like her, but it's like a blue translucent

306
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:36,320
 figure. I see her fist bang on the window super fast, and then she's shot up into the sky.

307
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:44,320
 And then I stand up. So that part of the memory has become ingrained with the factual version of

308
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,920
 the story now. I can't remember one without remembering the other. It's an interesting note,

309
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:56,480
 because is that what I saw? Is it when people say, like I said, it's like watching, it's like

310
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,360
 watching someone flick a switch and a light bulb turns into a basketball, like it, you can't,

311
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:07,760
 you obviously know that person is dead. Is that what we are seeing? Are we actually seeing their

312
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,640
 ghosts, their soul, leave their body? And the only reason why I put that connection, because I relived

313
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,240
 that experience so many times, was it just my imagination that was making it up? Because I'm

314
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,480
 clothed, basically I'm in this traumatic event over and over and over again, and my brain wants it

315
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,360
 to end, so it inserts something so terrifying for me to remember that makes the experience end?

316
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:36,000
 I don't know. It's always puzzled me. My, I'll tell you right now, my instinct is that it's my

317
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,400
 imagination. Because really, as much as I believe in a lot of this stuff, and I have fun talking about

318
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:50,080
 all of it, I'm very, very skeptical about a good chunk of it. And I am even skeptical about stuff

319
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:57,040
 like that. Because there has been stuff that I've experienced in real time that I've looked into

320
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,280
 and go, oh maybe I was just going crazy or something like that. This one doesn't even have the benefit

321
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:05,920
 of being real time. This one has the benefit of me looking back on it and remembering an incident

322
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:13,520
 that I didn't see. But did I see it and my mind didn't register it? Did I see it and my mind didn't

323
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:21,200
 want to comprehend it? Do we all see it when people die? And because we don't focus back on it and

324
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:28,800
 meditate on it, we don't notice it? I don't know. And that's why this has always been one of those

325
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:36,320
 weird stories of my paranormal life. Because it doesn't fit into the normal, oh I saw a ghost,

326
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:42,320
 or I saw something that I thought was a ghost and it turned out to be my scented garbage bags.

327
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:48,720
 This is kind of right in the middle there. I did see the woman pass away. I didn't know when she

328
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,320
 had passed away. I understood that sequence of events. But then there's this added detail where

329
00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:03,120
 under intense questioning, a new detail emerged that leads it more to the paranormal. But this is

330
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,960
 the biggest question I have from this whole story. And this is how we're going to end this week out.

331
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:17,120
 If it was her soul, this beautiful blue translucent soul, leaving her body to go up,

332
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:25,280
 which is traditionally known as heaven, why was she in a state of panic?
