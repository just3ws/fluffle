1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
 A woman realizes her nine-year-old son is missing and her worst nightmare begins.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:13,420
 A Russian man gets a mysterious message on his iPhone, causing him to change his life

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,500
 forever.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,620
 And then I'm gonna tell you a personal story.

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,880
 Something that happened to me on my birthday seven years ago.

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,660
 It changed me profoundly.

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,560
 It filled me with a sense of permanent fear.

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,800
 It was the night I met an angel.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,280
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:41,080
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,080
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,080
 I'm having a great day.

13
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,280
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,480
 I'm recording this episode on October 3rd, but it is officially my birthday episode October

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,480
 4th.

16
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,480
 Joker comes out.

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,760
 I've probably already seen that by the time you're listening to this maybe.

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,760
 And October 7th.

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,280
 New season of The Walking Dead.

20
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,040
 Tell me that is not an amazing Jason-filled weekend.

21
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,160
 I also got a birthday card from my mom.

22
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,400
 I'm gonna open this real quick.

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,240
 I'm gonna open it today early.

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,560
 It says, "Happy birthday son."

25
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,560
 Real original mom.

26
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,560
 Thanks.

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,560
 That's at the top.

28
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,160
 "Can't look at you without feeling a surge of pride."

29
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,800
 She put a little exclamation point there.

30
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,880
 "Can't hear your voice without smiling."

31
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,360
 She actually listens to the podcast now.

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,360
 She'll listen to one episode.

33
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,360
 I'll get into that later.

34
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,240
 "Can't remember you growing up years without a little tug at the heartstrings."

35
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,680
 "Can't let your birthday go by without reminding you how very much you're loved."

36
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,080
 My mom likes to underline words that are like special.

37
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,880
 And then, "I love you son very much.

38
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,080
 Praying God's best for you.

39
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,080
 Love always mom.

40
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,080
 Happy birthday.

41
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,080
 Enjoy your special day."

42
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,360
 And then she sent me some kizash.

43
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,360
 Mabola.

44
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,920
 Thanks mom.

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,080
 You listen to this episode?

46
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,080
 I don't know.

47
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,400
 She listened to the military episode, the military special.

48
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,200
 And she said, "Yeah, it was really interesting.

49
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,520
 It was really funny, but I didn't like that comment you made about the Joker doing something

50
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,880
 in a cake."

51
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,240
 Because I talked about the Joker with masturbate in someone's cake.

52
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,040
 She goes, "Yeah, I didn't really like that part because I'm a mom."

53
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,040
 But I love you mom.

54
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,480
 Thank you so much for your birthday wishes.

55
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,960
 I always appreciate it.

56
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,080
 So let's go ahead and move on to our first story.

57
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,560
 This episode is probably going to be long because it's birthday special.

58
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,400
 So first off, let's hop in the carpenter car.

59
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,800
 All of these stories today, I'm going to say this too before we get started.

60
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,040
 All of my stories today, I personally choose them.

61
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,640
 And I always personally choose them.

62
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,720
 But these ones, I think, give me a sense of joy and excitement.

63
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,440
 So let's start off with the story of a missing child.

64
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,360
 So we're going to hop in the carpenter copter.

65
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,520
 We are flying out to St. Cloud in Minnesota.

66
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,920
 It's September 21st.

67
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,960
 We're flying over this giant race.

68
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,600
 It's giant 5K, 10K race.

69
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,840
 So it does both.

70
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,200
 But you have the 5K, which is the shorter track, and then you can keep running and going on

71
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,200
 the 10K.

72
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,080
 And then we're flying over in our helicopter.

73
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,360
 People are getting blown away by the rotor blades.

74
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,720
 Last night I had a dream there was a horrible plane crash.

75
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,480
 And I found a foot from the wreckage.

76
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,360
 And then I found a computer that could convince you to kill yourself.

77
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
 It was really weird.

78
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,080
 The computer would communicate with you by playing songs.

79
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,320
 It's kind of like Bumblebee, but you could just look at the track file for the song,

80
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,720
 like Blame It on the Rain.

81
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,800
 And you'd be like, well, the weather's not that bad.

82
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,800
 It was weird.

83
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,240
 And we were trying to hide the computer from the government because if the government

84
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,120
 didn't got it, they would make people kill themselves with it.

85
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,120
 I don't remember.

86
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,760
 But anyways, if there's a plane crash soon, stay away from computers.

87
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,320
 We're flying over the 5K.

88
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,760
 And we're watching this thing.

89
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,920
 Now there's this little boy.

90
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,480
 It's creepy that we're watching this dude.

91
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,480
 Let's land.

92
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,480
 We land and we get out.

93
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,480
 We're standing in the crowd.

94
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,600
 There's this nine-year-old kid named Cade Lovell.

95
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,440
 And he runs all the time.

96
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,680
 He runs home.

97
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,240
 He runs to school.

98
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,240
 He runs around the house.

99
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,240
 He just runs.

100
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,800
 He's a runner, right?

101
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,400
 And so he's like, mommy, mommy.

102
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
 I want to do the 5K.

103
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
 And she's like, yeah, sure.

104
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,680
 Last year, you actually won the 5K, remember?

105
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,680
 And he's like, yippee.

106
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,200
 So he's this little jock kid, right?

107
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,400
 And so he wants to run the 5K.

108
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,960
 And the mom's totally fine with it.

109
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,080
 But you got like thousands-- or it's St. Cloud, Minnesota.

110
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,480
 You got hundreds of people here, right?

111
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,040
 And the 5K starts.

112
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,440
 And Cade Lovell takes off running with all the other competitors.

113
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,960
 And the mom's waiting at the finish line for him.

114
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,600
 She's like, has this orange tang and a camera or cell phone instead because it's the year

115
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,840
 2019?

116
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,120
 And she sees a bunch of slow kids.

117
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,280
 Now comparatively slow kids.

118
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,880
 But she's seen a bunch of kids come and she's like, that's weird.

119
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,880
 Where's Cade?

120
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,520
 He's like the fastest of all these guys.

121
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,360
 And it wasn't just kids running the 5K.

122
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,720
 She's seen elderly people across the finish line before her son.

123
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,520
 So she starts to get worried, like any mom would.

124
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,240
 She's like, bear attack?

125
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,960
 Wasp attack?

126
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,000
 What happened to this kid?

127
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,800
 Or more likely, he just fell and stripped his knee?

128
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,440
 Or more sinisterly, that somebody took him?

129
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,160
 So she begins trying to ask people, hey, have you seen Cade?

130
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,160
 Have you seen my son?

131
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,120
 Have you seen like a nine year old boy run around?

132
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,360
 Nobody has seen the kid.

133
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,000
 She basically starts running through the craft.

134
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,040
 She grabs a runner's number and puts it on her chest, starts running the 5K.

135
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,360
 She's like, Cade, Cade.

136
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,800
 And eventually the race officials begin putting out the word, hey, we're missing a nine year

137
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,800
 old kid.

138
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,960
 So everyone's looking for this kid.

139
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,280
 And that's when it gets back to the mom.

140
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,000
 We think we just saw your kid, but he's in the 10K.

141
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 Mom's like, what?

142
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,920
 He's only supposed to run the 5K.

143
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,640
 So she goes to the 10K finish line.

144
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,440
 She figures there must have been some sort of mistake.

145
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:28,680
 She goes to the 10K finish line and she sees her son running all by himself and she's like,

146
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,680
 poor Cade.

147
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,680
 Like he totally would have won that 5K, but look, he got blown away by all those adults.

148
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,440
 He's running all by himself.

149
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,440
 Super sweaty dude.

150
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,960
 He's all a panicked across his finish line.

151
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,440
 And the judges are like, congratulations to Cade, winner of the 10K.

152
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,520
 He actually was a minute ahead of every other runner in the 10K.

153
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,080
 And so the mom finally was asked him, hey, what happened to you?

154
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,720
 Like how'd you start running the 10K?

155
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,720
 I was super worried.

156
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,520
 And he's like, yeah, I was worried too.

157
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,480
 What happened was I was coming up to the corner where you're supposed to get away from.

158
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,600
 So it starts off the same, but at a certain corner it becomes a 5K.

159
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,240
 And if you keep going straight, it becomes the 10K.

160
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,080
 And as I was running, some woman kept going, keep going, keep going, keep going.

161
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,920
 And she was pointing ahead and she was like an official volunteer.

162
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,260
 She had on like the neon yellow shirt that they give out.

163
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,080
 She's pointing ahead, keep going, keep going.

164
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,160
 And he goes, I got confused where I was supposed to go.

165
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,600
 So I just kept going.

166
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,840
 And then I won the 10K.

167
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,920
 I love that story.

168
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,920
 I love that story.

169
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,920
 I don't know.

170
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,360
 I think the first off, I think it's hilarious that a kid can be that easily confused.

171
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,720
 And then smoke everyone.

172
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,080
 Oh, and the reason why he beat all the adults, I also thought this detail was hilarious.

173
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,560
 The reason why he was running so fast, because he was scared.

174
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,360
 He was scared because he didn't know where he was supposed to be.

175
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,360
 And he knew his man.

176
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,560
 He said this in a couple of interviews.

177
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,520
 My mom gets really mad when she gets scared.

178
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,120
 And I figured if I'm scared, my mom must be terrified.

179
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,240
 So if I don't get back real quick, my mom's just going to get madder and madder and madder.

180
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,760
 So he just started smoking these adults, dude.

181
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,880
 Running as fast as he can.

182
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,240
 He ended up, his time was 48 minutes, 17 seconds.

183
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,920
 And he's just like straight up Terminator running after a truck full of Sarah Connors.

184
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,160
 And he gets the finish line and she gives him a big old hug.

185
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,520
 And then he went home and took a bath.

186
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,160
 I don't know why they included that in the article.

187
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,680
 And sat on the couch or something like that.

188
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,120
 And then he started running with his friends.

189
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,280
 So that's the story of Cade Lovell.

190
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,280
 I love that story.

191
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,280
 I thought it was hilarious.

192
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,160
 This next story is another story I just came across.

193
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,280
 That's the story of a man receiving a, true story, of a man receiving a mysterious message

194
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,400
 on his iPhone.

195
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,000
 This story is currently being litigated in court.

196
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,920
 Well, it's currently about to be heard by the court.

197
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,920
 Let's hop back in.

198
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,280
 Let's hop into Dead Rabbit Durgible for this time.

199
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,640
 So we're going to take a slow leisurely journey over to Russia.

200
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,720
 Mother Russia.

201
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,240
 And there we meet a man named D. Razmilov.

202
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,360
 We'll just call him D for short.

203
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,120
 And that's actually all I have is just an initial.

204
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,000
 He's currently suing Apple.

205
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,200
 He walks in the courtroom.

206
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
 Dun dun.

207
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
 Dun dun.

208
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
 Dun dun.

209
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
 Dun dun.

210
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
 Dun dun.

211
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,200
 But you know, it's so funny.

212
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,120
 The other day I was looking through the newspaper and I saw the TV guide listings and I'm looking

213
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,520
 at all the shows and I was like, I miss TV.

214
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,800
 Like I miss actually like turning on a TV and having it play shows and advertisements.

215
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
 It's really weird.

216
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,680
 I have a sense of, because I don't watch my TV.

217
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,560
 The reception out here sucks even for a Nintendo and I'm not going to pay for cable.

218
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,480
 But I remember just so much of my childhood and adulthood really.

219
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:41,040
 Just getting home from work, turning on the TV and just having it play and watching shows.

220
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:45,440
 Like even shows like Two Broke Girls or just like garbage sitcoms.

221
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,440
 I miss.

222
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,560
 I miss that stuff.

223
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,640
 It's super bizarre because nowadays I'll just be like, oh I want to watch a horror movie.

224
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,560
 I'll just like find something online or watch it on Netflix or something like that.

225
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,360
 Like before you just turn on the TV and then you'd like be reading a book and you'd look

226
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,400
 up and you're like, whoa, Fallen's Plane starring Denzel Washington.

227
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,400
 This is dope.

228
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,840
 And then you'll watch it for about an hour and a half and then you'll go back to reading

229
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,840
 a book.

230
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,840
 Yeah, I miss that.

231
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,840
 It's really, it's a weird nostalgic thing.

232
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,000
 Anyways, so that was the People's Court song.

233
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,960
 That's why I got into that one.

234
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:21,400
 The D walks into a court in Russia and he goes and he says, your honor, here's my case.

235
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
 I want to present to you guys.

236
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,720
 And the judge puts on his little glasses, his little reading glasses, picks up the paperwork

237
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,080
 and he looks at it and he goes, is this serious?

238
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,080
 Like is this true?

239
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,960
 You know, this is a joke, right?

240
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,420
 And he's like, nope, no it is not, sir.

241
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:40,480
 So what happened was Dee bought an Apple iPhone and that was his first mistake.

242
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,160
 His second mistake was he downloaded a cryptocurrency app.

243
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,560
 So he downloads an app onto his phone that was approved by the Apple store, by the iOS

244
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,080
 store, whatever it's called.

245
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,800
 And he's using the cryptocurrency app and he gets a message and it says that he's, it

246
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,640
 says that he's received, this is 100% true.

247
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,960
 I was looking for it and I'm like, is this from Prov?

248
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,960
 There is something?

249
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,280
 No, they are actual, there's a court filing on this.

250
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:14,360
 This guy gets a app and he gets a down message on the app sending him 69 gay coins.

251
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,920
 That's the actual terminology.

252
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,920
 It's not that they were coins that happened to be gay.

253
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,560
 It was like, you know, you have bit bucks or what's the real one that people always freak

254
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,240
 out because it's not worth anything anymore.

255
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,680
 The opposite thing, the stuff, it's by the, invented by the Japanese guy who doesn't exist.

256
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,320
 Everyone always talks about it.

257
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,080
 It's a leading Bitcoin, Bitcoin.

258
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,560
 So anyways, he gets these gay coins, just one word, gay coins, right?

259
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:42,960
 And there's an English message included with the 69 gay coins that he got and it says,

260
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,360
 do not judge, do not try.

261
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,040
 I have no idea what that could mean.

262
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,400
 Honestly, I've tried thinking about it, but, and this is plausible the way he came up with

263
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,520
 it, but he saw that as meaning, don't knock it till you try it.

264
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,640
 So like, don't judge it until you try it.

265
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,000
 Just the terminology so where do not judge, comma, do not try.

266
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,480
 So apparently Yoda is sending out gay coins from a gay bar in Dagobah.

267
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,600
 So anyways, Yoda send that out.

268
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,040
 Dee gets this message, don't knock it till you try it.

269
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,800
 So this is what, imagine you get that message.

270
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:22,280
 If you got this stuff, if you got 69 gay coins from an anonymous user, hey, and all they

271
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,320
 said was don't knock until you try it, what would you do?

272
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,720
 I would go, these coins, my first assumption would be these coins must be for some other

273
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,080
 sort of app saying, hey, don't hate the game until you try it.

274
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,920
 Try out gay quest.

275
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,200
 Put in a gay coin and you get like an extra man on gay quest or something like that.

276
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,840
 I would assume it was something like that.

277
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:47,560
 Dee here said, I thought, this is an actual quote, I thought indeed, how can I judge something

278
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:53,840
 without trying it and decided to try same sex relationships.

279
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:59,960
 So this guy is suing Apple because he says that Apple made him gay.

280
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,960
 Here's another quote from him.

281
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:07,000
 "I can say after the passage of two months that I mired an intimacy with a member of

282
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,440
 my own sex and can't get out.

283
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,320
 I have a steady boyfriend and I don't know how to explain it to my parents.

284
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,800
 After receiving the aforementioned message, my life has changed for the worse and will

285
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,400
 never be normal again."

286
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,000
 So he gets this message, he gets a gay coin, he gets 69 gay coins and a message saying,

287
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,560
 don't knock until you try it.

288
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,240
 He then goes, yeah, sure, why not?

289
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,400
 He goes out and starts blowing dudes.

290
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
 What?

291
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,200
 That's such a huge leap of logic.

292
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,360
 Then we fast forward two months.

293
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,560
 He apparently likes it.

294
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,760
 Because it for two months has a boyfriend, which is very, very quick time to settle down

295
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,440
 dude, you gotta play the field for a bit.

296
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,400
 Get some message, two months later he has a boyfriend he can't break up with.

297
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,600
 He can't break up with his dude.

298
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,240
 He's keeping this lifestyle from his parents.

299
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:01,600
 I'm assuming he's keeping his boyfriend in the dark about this lawsuit and then he goes,

300
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,400
 my life is totally screwed up, I will never be normal again.

301
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,760
 And I can almost guarantee after he filed this paperwork with the court he went back

302
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,480
 home to his boyfriend.

303
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,440
 So he's making choices to stay with this guy and I wonder if he still has 69 gay coins

304
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,120
 in his account.

305
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:25,680
 So apparently some people are so easily persuaded that if I showed them a picture of a balloon

306
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,320
 and said don't knock until you try it, they will bang the balloon.

307
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,040
 And of course it's easy to say this guy was probably gay or had gay leanings before he

308
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,160
 got the app.

309
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,520
 But who knows.

310
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,600
 I think I could see someone going yeah you're right, don't knock until you try it.

311
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,560
 And then going out for a weekend and banging a couple dudes and being like yeah it was

312
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,800
 okay but it wasn't really for me.

313
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,480
 Versus you're dating another man and then you go I need to sue Apple.

314
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,880
 The whole story is hilarious to me.

315
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,360
 And you could say maybe the app did brain wash him, maybe there is some computer conspiracy

316
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,520
 around here that Apple wants to turn people gay, maybe.

317
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:06,160
 But my favorite part of this story, he's suing them for pushing him towards homosexuality,

318
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,160
 suing them for moral suffering and harm to mental health.

319
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,240
 He's suing Apple for 1 million rubles.

320
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:19,000
 Which in real money is $15,300.

321
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,400
 So first off, how much is your sexuality worth to you?

322
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:29,240
 Like if somebody forced you to change who you're attracted to, is that truly only worth $15,000?

323
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:35,640
 But also, how busted does your economy have to be?

324
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:44,200
 How absolutely ruined is your monetary system that 1 million of your money equals the same

325
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,880
 amount that an 18 year old kid working in McDonald's for a year makes?

326
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,880
 How bad is your economy?

327
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:54,280
 Because when you read 1 million rubles, think about how much room that would take up in

328
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,280
 your house.

329
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:00,320
 Versus the kid I order a Big Mac from and he can't even get my order right.

330
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,800
 I did not know Russia's economy was that bad.

331
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,120
 Someone's like I'm a millionaire whenever I read it now about these Russian oligarchs,

332
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,160
 these Russian billionaires I'm thinking, they probably make as much money as like a contractor

333
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,160
 in America.

334
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,200
 But anyways, the moral of this story, the moral of the first story was if someone keeps

335
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,200
 telling you keep going, keep going, you can do it.

336
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,440
 Don't stop, stop.

337
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,760
 Because if you don't, if you keep going where they want you to go, your mom's going to

338
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,760
 be mad at you.

339
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,760
 That's the moral of the first story.

340
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,240
 The moral of this story is 1.

341
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,240
 Leave Russia because their economy sucks.

342
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,240
 2.

343
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,640
 Be careful what apps you open because there may actually be a secret app out there that

344
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,120
 can change your sexuality.

345
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,920
 And if they do, you'll only get $15,000 for pain and suffering or in Russia's case 1

346
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,920
 million rubles.

347
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,960
 Let's go ahead and you know what?

348
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,160
 And actually I want to go ahead and do a Dead Rabbit Recommends right now.

349
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,360
 Now I'm only going to be able to get away with this one on my birthday.

350
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,360
 I know that.

351
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,960
 It is a horror movie in a sense and you guys are going to be like I'm never watching that

352
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,960
 Jason.

353
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,960
 I'm never going to watch that.

354
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:05,680
 A couple years ago, Disney Channel made a movie called Disney's Zombies.

355
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,880
 I watched a lot of that stuff.

356
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,880
 I watched a lot of it back when I was a babysitter.

357
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,480
 I watched Sweet Life of Zack and Cody and really got into that.

358
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,800
 I remember once, I think I told you guys the story, I went on a date with a Mormon girl,

359
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,480
 but the dad wouldn't let us actually go on a date the first couple times so I would just

360
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,560
 go over to her house and her mom would make me cookies and we'd sit on her couch and we'd

361
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,880
 watch television with the dad.

362
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,640
 I'm in my 20s at this point.

363
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,640
 I'm like 24, 25.

364
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,520
 I think she was like 19 or something like that.

365
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:37,480
 But anyways, the point is, is that I remember the first time I went over there and I sit

366
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,360
 on the couch and the dad's like you know, you guys can't go out.

367
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,960
 You guys got to sit down and watch television with me.

368
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,960
 I was like yeah, fine, whatever.

369
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,960
 I'm eating cookies.

370
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,960
 I really don't care what we're doing.

371
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
 I'm sitting there.

372
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,760
 I'm eating cookies and they put on this Disney Channel.

373
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,720
 I think he was doing this to like get rid of me.

374
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,520
 He turns on the Disney Channel because they were Mormons.

375
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,280
 So they had like 15 kids.

376
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,640
 They put on the Disney Channel and there was a bunch of other little kids running around

377
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:04,840
 and he turns it on and I'm watching it and within five minutes I was laughing so hard.

378
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,840
 I don't remember what the movie was.

379
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,880
 It was something to do.

380
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,440
 It wasn't a switching body one.

381
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,440
 I don't know.

382
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,200
 It was some scientific gadget that had been created.

383
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,200
 I was laughing so hard I was spitting cookies out of my mouth.

384
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:22,280
 I thought it was hilarious and I remember after the date I said hey, I got to go and I remember

385
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:26,520
 watching more Disney Channel movies after that and a lot of them are actually pretty

386
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,840
 funny.

387
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,880
 Most of them are kind of weak but a lot of them are pretty funny.

388
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,160
 One with the kids who built this machine that allowed them to go back in time and they were

389
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
 driving.

390
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,440
 They wore the clock stoppers.

391
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,840
 They would wear these special suits to hide their identity and they'd go back in time

392
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,920
 to prevent kids from getting embarrassed.

393
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,600
 It was interesting because they were basically vigilantes but it's in a high school and it's

394
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,760
 a Disney Channel movie so instead of fighting crime they're fighting kids getting spaghetti

395
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,760
 on their dress.

396
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,760
 It really well put together a story and I've watched a lot of those.

397
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:04,200
 So I was excited and I love zombies and I enjoyed Disney Channel movies so I was like

398
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,120
 this is going to be a train wreck.

399
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,400
 Descendants I don't like.

400
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,840
 I don't like a lot of the newer stuff but this movie is going to stink.

401
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,520
 So if it's a musical about zombies and humans going to high school together.

402
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,520
 Train wreck.

403
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,520
 I'm going to get it in.

404
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,360
 It might be one of the most bizarre movies I've ever seen.

405
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,320
 Like structurally it's weird.

406
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,920
 You have what's weird about it is you can it's well it's a well made movie.

407
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:37,160
 There's like and I have a low bar for that but there are things like establishing shots

408
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,240
 and you're introducing characters in the right order because I watch a lot of bad movies

409
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,440
 so you notice when that stuff is missing.

410
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,400
 Characters have clear motivations but what's interesting is that character will start off

411
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:53,400
 with their character arc and then they will come to a realization and then they'll make

412
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,440
 a different decision than you would have made.

413
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,240
 And that happens constantly so you don't understand why the characters are doing what they're

414
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,600
 doing but when you step back and make sense for the character everyone comes to a cross

415
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,360
 road in their life and if someone was watching you and they'd go oh that's weird I would

416
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,520
 have made a different decision but we're so used to seeing the right decision made especially

417
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:19,920
 in a movie especially my main characters that it would be like if Luke saw Aunt Baru and

418
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,800
 Uncle Owen burned and he's like eh and just walked away and you would have a different

419
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,920
 movie at that point.

420
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,680
 You would have them go no no no you gotta come back and he's like nah I'm fine and then

421
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,000
 he would be a true reluctant hero.

422
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,360
 That's this movie like in a nutshell it's it's basically a basically a post-racial society

423
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,680
 where all ethnicities get along but humans hate zombies and zombies are very leery of

424
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,680
 humans.

425
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,360
 And all zombies by the way there's references throughout the movie to them eating people,

426
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,760
 eating people's brains that you know I don't trust zombies one of them ate my uncle or bit

427
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,240
 my uncle's ear off and stuff like that.

428
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,440
 Zombies live in a ghetto, the humans live in this beautiful pastel colored neighborhood,

429
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:04,560
 it's musical numbers galore and then subplots that involve things like allegory for steroid

430
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:09,640
 use which is completely goes into the weirdest direction possible.

431
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:17,600
 There's an illusion to like a school shooter slash school bombing that totally just goes

432
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,760
 in a bizarre direction.

433
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,520
 The Disney Channel movie by the way gotta keep reminding you of that.

434
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,200
 Absolutely bizarre and then by the end of the movie I remember watching the end I've

435
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,760
 only watched it once I think the magic will leave me if I watch it a second time because

436
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:35,600
 I've watched it and I just like I have no idea I felt like I was stoned watching it.

437
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,620
 And when it ended the credits are rolling and I'm like what just happened like nothing

438
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,680
 happened the way I thought it was going to happen.

439
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,200
 Even the ending dance number I was like what?

440
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,080
 Absolutely mind boggling great great movie.

441
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,600
 So if you're looking for something it's horror because there's zombies and it would be scary

442
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,040
 if you were six.

443
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,360
 If you're looking for an unusual movie to watch this weekend see if you can track down

444
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,040
 Disney zombies you can get it on DBT but it's just a really bizarre movie.

445
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:08,360
 And I don't you know the couple of the other movies I've recommended are kind of like

446
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,800
 those quiet horror movies you just kind of want to watch alone.

447
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:15,000
 You don't want to watch deep down with a bunch of buddies because it's just kind of a weird

448
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 solo movie.

449
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,600
 That's what this movie is too.

450
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,080
 This isn't a movie you want to put on in the background at a party.

451
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,880
 If you really want to appreciate it you kind of want to put it on and watch it because

452
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,280
 so you can put like just weird dialogue choices.

453
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,360
 It's just so bizarre.

454
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,800
 There's a black coach who and I don't want to keep talking about it but there's this

455
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:36,840
 black football coach the main zombie Zed wants to join the football team black football coach

456
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,520
 and when they're talking about him joining the football team and they show the coach

457
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,360
 I go oh it's going to be a thing like I understand the struggle like my uncle tried to get in

458
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:50,320
 and my great grandpa tried to get into Louisville and you and you couldn't couldn't play but

459
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,320
 I understand.

460
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,840
 No the coach is like I don't break barriers I follow trends I'm not going to take a chance

461
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,160
 on anybody I'm not that type of guy.

462
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:04,560
 So he actually acknowledges in a way the remember the Titan story he acknowledges that it would

463
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,840
 be groundbreaking for him to have someone of a different race on his team but he's flat

464
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,440
 out refusing to do it.

465
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,000
 It would have been one thing if he says no son you're not good enough you got to get

466
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,920
 better but he acknowledges the fact that there is like racial animosity between humans and

467
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,280
 zombies and that's why he won't put him on the team.

468
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,680
 And you had a black coach delivering those lines and I'm like what is going on with this

469
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,280
 movie.

470
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,200
 So bizarre I don't like to use the word post-racial a lot but that's almost the only way you can

471
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,200
 describe the setting for this movie it's absolutely bizarre.

472
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,680
 Again he didn't have to acknowledge the race and I wouldn't have even thought twice about

473
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:44,280
 it but the fact that he started saying no you're a different race so I won't put you

474
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:49,440
 on my team even though I'm a different ethnicity and I used to not be able to even be in a

475
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,600
 school I'm not going to break barriers that's not the type of guy I am.

476
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,920
 And then the zombie starts doing basically steroids and the coach lets him on the team.

477
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,040
 Absolutely bizarre movie.

478
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,920
 Absolutely bizarre movie.

479
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,840
 And actively defends him from investigation.

480
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,320
 So weird man.

481
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,000
 Okay let's go ahead though and move on to a story.

482
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,880
 A story that I actually mentioned I mentioned it quite a few episodes ago I think it was

483
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,520
 like season 4 finale something like that.

484
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,280
 And I actually was planning on saving this one until the end of the show.

485
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,360
 I thought you know what I'm not going to tell this story until I cancel the show or until

486
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,360
 the show ends.

487
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,080
 But then I thought about it and I thought this is actually the perfect time for a couple

488
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,080
 reasons.

489
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,880
 One it happened on my birthday.

490
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,000
 Two it happened seven years ago on my birthday and with the whole time reset conspiracy that

491
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,400
 we talked about a couple episodes ago which is hilarious now that it's passed people online

492
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,200
 are like how come my life didn't reset because it was fake dude like you have to get a mental

493
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,440
 filter for this stuff.

494
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:50,280
 But I thought it's been seven years it's on my it's story takes place on my birthday.

495
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,560
 Let me tell you the story I had moved up the previous year so we're in Hood River in the

496
00:23:54,560 --> 00:24:00,520
 sleepy little town of Hood River Oregon I moved up here in October of 2011 it is now October

497
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:06,440
 2012 and I'm up in my bedroom looking down at Wasco Street the creepiest street in the

498
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:12,520
 world and I'm just I like I do a lot of birthday stuff by myself like this year this year I'm

499
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,280
 going out to go see Joker I did get a couple of my local buddies Ir Bardo he listens to

500
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,120
 the show and then my buddy Jacob we're all going to go see Joker.

501
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,960
 But a lot of times I spend birthday I spend a lot of time by myself and I do I really

502
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:30,200
 enjoy it and so that birthday I was spending by myself at night and I am super excited

503
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:36,960
 because I saw that the new horror movie VHS is on television and I was like that's weird

504
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,760
 I didn't even know that movie was released yet but it was on like Shutter or it was on

505
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:45,880
 some horror channel so it's like oh that's awesome so I'm going to watch VHS I'm going

506
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,480
 to stay up I'm going to goof around online then go to sleep probably like 2-3 in the

507
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:56,000
 morning and so I'm sitting in my big comfy recliner and I turn on television it's probably

508
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,720
 like 9 or 10 o'clock at this point I turn on television I start watching VHS I was really

509
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,360
 really into this horror anthology movie I used to watch a ton of horror movies a ton

510
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,880
 of them I'm watching it and I watch the first segment I go oh that's pretty good it's about

511
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,080
 like a vampire succubus or something like that and then I'm watching the second segment

512
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:18,560
 and it's about these honeymooners this young couple who are on a road trip and there's

513
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:26,160
 this mysterious woman following them and then they murder the boyfriend and it turns out

514
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,960
 the two girls are lesbians and that's kind of the end of the horror story but I'm watching

515
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,800
 it and this point is probably like 9.30 10.30 I don't remember when it started but I'm watching

516
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:40,320
 it and they get to the scene where the man sleeping in bed and it's all like first person

517
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,720
 camcorder this short story and they plunge the knife right into the dude's neck and he's

518
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:52,640
 like blood's dribbling out and it's just this long shot and I remember being unusually

519
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,880
 disgusted and disturbed by that now here's the thing there if you've been on the internet

520
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,720
 long enough and if you're probably in a certain age range you've seen I hate to bring this

521
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,800
 up because you guys probably be like damn it Jason I forgot about the video most of

522
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,520
 us have seen that video though of that Chechny and soldier getting stabbed in the neck with

523
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,000
 by the Russian it's a real video with dudes laying on the ground and the guy sticks the

524
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,880
 knife right in his neck blood gushes out the VHS killing looked pretty similar a lot of

525
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,120
 times special effects people will steady snuff not snuff videos but steady videos of people

526
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:28,600
 actually night but I don't think I'd seen that video years ago and it was like ew and

527
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,720
 then just went on to whatever I was doing eating spaghettios and watching Chippinels

528
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,960
 Rescue Rangers whatever it was and I think if anyone's spend any large amount of time

529
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,680
 on the internet eventually they come across gross stuff like that other than just answering

530
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,200
 their email and going to Facebook if you're ever like just clicking on news articles and

531
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,160
 stuff you see people get smashed into cars and get chewed up by escalators and all sorts

532
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:54,000
 of stuff so fall down elevators all that so anyways I'm watching VHS though and I see

533
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,800
 that scene and I really disgusted me and I didn't really I just felt like that's that

534
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:05,360
 was too much it's too much I think I was 36 if I'm so it's I'm gonna be 43 so seven years

535
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,720
 ago would be yeah it'd be 36 and I was like what like I thought it was weird that I had

536
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,440
 that type reaction to it but I shut the movie off shut the movie off and I said I kind of

537
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,200
 fiddled around on my computer stop watching him so this all happened on October 4th this

538
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,700
 story this story here happened on October 4th so my birthday and so I end up going to

539
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:33,160
 sleep and around 4 or 5 in the morning I don't even know if I could classify a time to this

540
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:39,440
 right I'm laying in my recliner and I wake up now what's interesting about the story

541
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,240
 and to be fair this would be something I would use to debunk anyone telling a story like

542
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:50,160
 this there is no proof that I'm actually awake could 100% be a dream however the stuff that

543
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:55,000
 happens after it makes me question that I'm sleeping in my recliner as I usually do a

544
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,640
 sleep on couches and recliners and I'm sleeping on my side and I wake up I'm looking out my

545
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:05,400
 bedroom window into the dark street of wasco and I see in the middle of the street so probably

546
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:12,660
 a good I don't know 40-50 feet away I see a little glowing light probably about 2 inches

547
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:17,400
 tall it was like maybe a little maybe about 4 inches tall because I'm kind of making it

548
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,280
 with my hand it was like this glowing ball of light and I could perceive something in

549
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:27,520
 the light like a figure a figurine so at this point I think I'm still dreaming and in real

550
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,720
 life I was like oh I must be dreaming this isn't real and I see this little light start

551
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:37,560
 to get closer and move very very slowly towards me but what was weird out of this is there

552
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:43,240
 multiple weird details but as it's moving closer to me it doesn't change size so if

553
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,320
 it's something's really 4 inches and it's 40 feet away as it's getting closer and closer

554
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:52,320
 to you it will get bigger that's just the way vision works and distance but as it got

555
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,320
 closer and closer to me it stayed 4 inches tall I'm just laying there with my eyes open

556
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:02,280
 looking at this thing it's floating closer and closer and closer and closer to me and

557
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:10,920
 then and right when it gets to basically outside my window it goes and I'm standing in this

558
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:18,240
 white room it was I was I don't even know if I was standing I was just in a white room

559
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:26,480
 and I just heard this and standing there it's so weird I can't even use terms like in front

560
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:34,160
 of me just you were aware of this was an angel it was how I would perceive an angel it was

561
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:39,520
 a blonde haired woman in white robes now I should have explained this part of the beginning

562
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,080
 because some of you guys know this and some of you guys know the reason why I brought

563
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,240
 up the angel story a long time ago I was talking about where I was fighting shadow people or

564
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:52,120
 something like that and what I did and it was this I don't know how I came up with this

565
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:56,440
 idea or why even thought it would work but apparently it did it's I think that was the

566
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:02,440
 demon the shadow people was it the demons around us no it wasn't that episode sorry guys should

567
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,560
 be more prepared but anyways go back just listen every episode it's ever have a radio

568
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:12,360
 you'll find it I talked about where I took a part of my soul and like it sounds so cringy

569
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,080
 when I talk about it but basically like removed a little piece of my soul and made it into

570
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:21,120
 a like a thought weapon like a psychic weapon because I figured if my soul is indestructible

571
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,800
 and blessed by God then therefore anything from my soul should also be the same so if

572
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:31,400
 I can meditate on taking a piece of my soul out and turning it into a weapon a sword then

573
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,040
 it would basically be the equivalent of punching someone with your soul or stabbing someone

574
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,600
 with your soul so I did that when I was in my early 20s and I also did the same thing

575
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,720
 and made myself like a little shield because I was I used to be ten toes deep into hunting

576
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,320
 ghosts trying to summon demons and punch them in the face and all sorts of just nonsense

577
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,040
 right not that hunting ghosts is nonsense but thinking that you can summon a demon and

578
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:58,560
 then kick into the nuts is the height of stupidity but anyways so I I encountered shadow people

579
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,240
 and all sorts of monsters and gobble and stuff like that so I figured I needed some sort

580
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,800
 of defenses so I took a little piece of my soul and meditated on it and did work on it

581
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,160
 and all that stuff and over the course of weeks I made this thought sword it wasn't

582
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,240
 real it didn't actually exist I wasn't walking around with a hill time like at the ren fair

583
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:20,360
 this was something that I made out of my my atolpa weapon and I had a shield too so that

584
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:25,520
 existed and I always would use that it was basically I guess another it'll be like a

585
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,880
 security blanket it was very very odd deep very odd thing it does sound very cringy when

586
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:37,480
 I talk about it but let's jump back to the present I'm standing in this white room I'm

587
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:46,160
 in a white room there's this angel in front of me and she's holding a toy wooden sword

588
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:54,760
 and a toy wooden shield and then she gives them to me and she takes the sword and shield

589
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:01,720
 that I made so as she's handing me this toy sword and this toy shield made of wood she's

590
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:07,600
 taking away these things that I had made 14 15 years ago out of meditating and visualizing

591
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,080
 a piece of my soul coming out and forging it and doing all of this work she takes those

592
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:18,040
 from me and gives me the toys of a child pretending to be a war and she basically takes like two

593
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:25,760
 chunks of my soul and then she's right next to my ear and she's standing there and she

594
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:41,000
 whispers into my ear I can hear and then I'm laying there on my recliner and the sun's

595
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,280
 coming up I remember I told that story to Lana and she goes what did the angel say and I

596
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:51,320
 go I don't know I don't remember I tried remembering immediately what the angel was

597
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:55,720
 saying to me whispering in my ear I have no idea and I've gone over that event a lot and

598
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,920
 you're like well that's weird Jason just had a dream we're just getting started well we're

599
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,680
 almost near the end we're not just getting started but I've tried figuring out what that

600
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:07,800
 encounter meant over the years it terrified me so much I didn't want to be alone on my

601
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:13,120
 next few birthdays I was afraid it was going to come back and you go Jason what's so terrifying

602
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:20,920
 about that well ever since then I've had this really weird thing where I've become people

603
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:26,560
 who know me especially when I was younger knew I'm fairly empathetic but nowadays it's

604
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:32,480
 almost paralyzing sometimes when I'm reading the news I kind of mentioned this in the military

605
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,080
 episode when I was talking about the ISIS soldiers getting blown away I said guys listen

606
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,720
 I know these people have families and mothers and fathers who love them and first loves

607
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,120
 and stuff like that but they're bad guys and then I go on to proceed how the British dude

608
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:48,800
 just blows their heads off with a shotgun I cannot read any sort of news account or hear

609
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:54,600
 any sort of story or even watch a fictional horror movie or action movie or whatever without

610
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:59,200
 completely empathizing with every single person in that movie and that's not a superpower

611
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,080
 other people can do it but for me since that encounter it's become tenfold when I read

612
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,000
 an article about somebody getting killed whether or not they are the bad guy like let's take

613
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,920
 those ISIS soldiers for example and I had that comment and it sounded like a throwaway

614
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:20,360
 comment but that kid his mom was cradling I can picture all of this stuff the mom cradling

615
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:24,960
 the little baby boy him getting his feelings hurt at school one day and kind of throwing

616
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,520
 rocks against the car and then someone out getting in trouble his first kiss his first

617
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:36,680
 love when he feels the sun on his face his favorite comic book and then bam shotgun

618
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:41,960
 to the head as he's trying to build a suicide vest that happens to me all the time I'm not

619
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:47,360
 visualizing and I'm not hallucinating but I just my my empathetic feelings are an overload

620
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,720
 right now so the point where even when I watch like an action movie and terminators just

621
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,560
 like gunning down security guards I'm like oh my god they have families those people

622
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:00,960
 had lives just like mine they had hopes and dreams and aspirations they had first loves

623
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,600
 and breakups and they sat in the living room crying in the dark one night with spaghetti

624
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:09,920
 or stains on their shirt every human goes through those things it's a super bizarre but I've

625
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:17,720
 also been instilled with a sense of dread and fear that I've never had before in my life

626
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,600
 have I don't want to say no fear there were certain things I feared I wasn't a fan of heights

627
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:26,000
 I wasn't a fan of water but I would go into rough neighborhoods and start trouble and

628
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,800
 I wouldn't have a problem someone says you got a problem I say yeah you like I had no

629
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:39,040
 problem being an open jerk and courting danger at any point in my life until that after that

630
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:45,200
 I have become a different person less reckless and and people could go well that's a good

631
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:51,120
 thing you're maturing but to me it feels like such a core part of my identity is gone because

632
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:56,240
 I used to just not care at all when I keep saying fearful I don't really think that's

633
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:02,720
 right fearful and being less reckless are good things my anxiety attacks are have been sky

634
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:08,080
 high since then like anxiety attacks I've never had before have been happening since this

635
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:13,800
 encounter like I just feel like I'm constantly under threat from something I wake up basically

636
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:19,440
 with an anxiety attack and for the most part it hasn't gone away since so when I say fearful

637
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,840
 I'm meaning more like that I'm not scared of the spooky spooky why I'm scared of the

638
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:29,320
 spooky spooky woods but it's not like a fearfulness like a Scooby-Doo it's more of just like this

639
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:36,880
 every muscle in my body is constantly tightened waiting for something that won't come so it's

640
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:44,160
 more anxiety than fearfulness and it's not a good level of oh I'm gonna be careful it's more like

641
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,760
 I have to be careful otherwise I can die at any moment it's that level of anxiety slash fear

642
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:55,520
 primal fear not spooky spooky fear now it's possible that this is all just stuff that's

643
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,080
 normal with growing up and since I'm growing up for the first time this is something everyone goes

644
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:07,200
 through but it feels like such a core part of my identity was lost that night and an additional part

645
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:15,680
 was added on i.e. just being too tuned into people I talk a lot and when I say oh yeah I read a lot

646
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,760
 of true crime I used to read a lot of true crime that's the reason why I stopped I just couldn't

647
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,440
 I couldn't enjoy it anymore because I'm reading about these victims and I can't help

648
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:30,000
 but seeing every point in their life it's sucked all the entertainment value out of people being

649
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:37,120
 murdered for me and it's funny because I always wondered what the symbolism was of me getting the

650
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:43,120
 toy sword and the toy shield and it's funny because I know what it is I know I knew what it was then

651
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,480
 and I always tried finding an alternative answer because I don't like the answer and that's the

652
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,960
 funny thing a lot of times when we analyze stuff we have to be honest with the answers we get

653
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:56,720
 the reason why those things were taken for assuming any of this is real again assuming it's totally

654
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,480
 not a dream and it just happened it happened at a time where I had this big awakening and I was

655
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:09,680
 turning 36 and I assuming any of this is real I was given those items and taken the the the sword

656
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,840
 and shield that I made were taken away from me and I was giving these toy sword and shield

657
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:21,920
 for one of two reasons actually I've always I've always thought maybe it's because God is saying

658
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,320
 that I don't need any of these fancy weapons any of these fancy thought forms to fight

659
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:35,920
 demons or monsters that God's power over darkness is strong enough that even a toy sword and shield

660
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:41,520
 can destroy them you don't need this mega blade that you built out of your soul that's the answer

661
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:47,600
 I want to believe but I don't think that's what it meant I think I think that what that shield and

662
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:57,760
 sword represent is you're a little boy you're a very very little boy and if you think that you're

663
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:04,560
 ready for what's coming you deserve little boy toys if you think in any way shape or form you're

664
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:12,160
 ready for challenges that may await you with these things that you built with your brain if you think

665
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:18,400
 any of these things will do you any good you're a dumb little child who deserves dumb little toys

666
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:26,800
 you know I want to say this too this isn't an ARG this isn't a fake narrative that I'm building

667
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:32,480
 up over the course of the seasons or anything like that I want to be clear on that as far as that

668
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,360
 story is that story ended that night there is no follow-up where I see like a dark shadow in the

669
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:42,080
 corner and he's like you think you're ready for me none of that like all of these stories are

670
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:46,880
 fairly self-contained I don't want you to think oh great he's building up to some big narrative that

671
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,880
 at the end if we donate to his patreon you can fight gall orth or whatever no these are all just

672
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:58,160
 kind of independent moments in my life but I but I think that that's why I got the toy sword and

673
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:05,040
 shield that I think I think of myself as kind of this big bad warrior guy but I'm just a little boy

674
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,480
 and it's funny because that's the first time I've said that out loud and now that I think about it

675
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:15,600
 that would make me fearful if I thought I was this big bad rough street fighter tumbler dude

676
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:22,800
 because I've gotten in a few scrapes but none of that is there's nothing that has happened in my

677
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:28,320
 life that's preparing me for what may come in the future and that would make you fearful actually

678
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:34,480
 I never thought about that having being told that you're not ready would make you fearful so I wonder

679
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,560
 if those two things were connected yeah never really made that connection because I've only told

680
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:43,680
 this story to maybe like three people told it to Lana I told it to Jenny I think maybe only two people

681
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:49,040
 if it was a dream it was a life-changing dream and people have those and people may say Jason

682
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:54,080
 you're actually a better person now because you're less reckless I'm definitely a different person

683
00:40:54,080 --> 00:41:02,560
 than I was October 3rd 2012 to October 4th 2012 I'm different my thought patterns are different

684
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,560
 the way I look at the world is different the way I look at myself is different

685
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:13,360
 could just be a normal factor of aging could be that I was visited by an angel

686
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:18,080
 and other people I have encounters with angels near-death experiences and stuff like that I've

687
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:21,520
 thought yeah what if I had a near-death experience what if I had a heart attack or something and

688
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,600
 this was my second chance I don't know people's personalities tend to change after near-death

689
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:30,720
 experiences but other people have told me stories I've read stories about people seeing angels and

690
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:37,280
 their lives changing for the better but I don't really look at it as the better I just feel different

691
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:43,200
 the empathy is almost crippling people will tell me a horrible story and to them they're like

692
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,280
 isn't that awful and I'm like yeah that's the worst story I've ever heard in my life I don't

693
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,720
 tell them that because I know people tell horrible stories because they have to get it off their chest

694
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:55,120
 but I don't go oh my god why'd you tell me that horrible horrible story but it just

695
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:01,360
 affects me where as before I totally would have forgotten about it again might be a normal thing

696
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:09,040
 of aging the being less reckless is most likely a normal form of aging the angel visit could have

697
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:13,280
 just been a dream but all three of those things have oh and I forgot to tell you the actually

698
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:18,400
 there's one more piece here we'll end on this this could easily be debunked as well but I've

699
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:25,920
 tried very very hard to debunk this part so I said I was watching VHS on my birthday and I go

700
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:32,800
 that's weird didn't come out yet VHS it was released on video on demand on august 22nd okay

701
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:40,000
 it was released at theaters for a limited run on october 5th according to the internet it was

702
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:46,880
 never shown on cable television unless you did your video on demand it was not shown it wasn't

703
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:52,960
 even released until the next day now to be fair they could have been some special run on shutter

704
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,720
 they wanted to show it the day before and got permission but that is not listed at all that

705
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:02,560
 I could find on the internet so to make this whole story even weirder I watched a movie on a cable

706
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:09,120
 channel the day before it was released at the movie theater and it wasn't I didn't do video on

707
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:16,640
 demand it was on shutter it was on just a station I turned on the tv and I watched it I almost forgot

708
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:24,880
 that detail again it's just a whole weird thing so happy birthday Jason seven years after meeting

709
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:30,160
 an angel I gotta admit I gotta admit my birthday still make me a little nervous

710
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:35,200
 because I don't know what's going to happen if it comes back
