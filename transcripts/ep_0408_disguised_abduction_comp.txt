 You steal a man's iPad.
 You find horrible images.
 What do you do next?
 And then we take a look at two stories.
 The implications are chilling.
 Is it possible that human beings aren't simply being abducted by aliens,
 but we're being lured to areas to make it easier for them to get us today on Dead Rabbit Radio?
 [Music]
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.
 I'm here. I was Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.
 You're like, Jason, I can tell you're sick.
 I can tell. I've been listening to the show for a long time.
 I can tell when you're sick.
 Yes. Yes. There's a lot of episodes where I've gotten sick
 and I always get allergies this time of year.
 It's nothing to panic about.
 The problem is, when I lay sleeping on my back,
 it all gets into my esophagei.
 Because I'm a dude, so I have an esophagei.
 Women have an esophagus. I bet you didn't know that.
 And it just gets all gooey inside there.
 So I'm miserable.
 But that doesn't mean I'm not having a great day,
 because I am having a great day.
 Just have a little bit of a head cold.
 I went outside for a little bit, man.
 I did some steppin'. I got on a stair.
 I just walked up and down it 120 times.
 And just staying moving.
 I think I'm going to do a home workout routine,
 because I'm self-isolating.
 I'm self-isolating here.
 So here's where we're at right now.
 Not talk about me. This isn't Jason's video blog,
 or vlog, is what you kids call it.
 This is Dead Rav Radio, where we talk about crazy stuff.
 So let's go ahead.
 That was a tour. That might have been the worst segue I've ever done.
 But whatever.
 So let's go ahead.
 I was supposed to talk about this story yesterday,
 and I ran out of time for it.
 But I've actually, this is a story that I've kind of...
 I've told variations of this story throughout the years.
 It's not like I made it up.
 It's not Goldilocks and the Three Bears,
 and I'm slowly refining it.
 This happens every so often.
 And each time you get different results from the people involved in it.
 But recently, let's hop on board the Jason Jalopy.
 We're driving up. The borders are closed.
 Let's hop on board the Carvener Coptor.
 We're going to Canada. We're going to Regina.
 That's in the Saskatchewan province.
 In Canada.
 It's February 23rd, 2020.
 So like just a couple of weeks ago,
 Dude walks into a police station.
 And he's sweating.
 "Oh my God, you don't have the coronavirus, do you?"
 And he's like, "What? No, that's not news yet.
 It's only February 23rd."
 The cops are like, "Oh yeah, yeah. We're not taking it seriously over here yet."
 And the dude's coughing on him.
 Touching all their paperwork.
 He goes, "So, officers, I have a problem.
 It's not a respiratory illness. I have another problem.
 I'm being extorted."
 The cops are like, "Oh, you've piqued our interest."
 You know, a lot of times, police work.
 It's boring.
 Traffic stuff. And then you got domestic disputes,
 which is like super dangerous work.
 And you know, it's just a bunch of boring stuff.
 You want to be driving around in cars,
 shooting bad guys.
 But this isn't that. You're not driving around shooting people.
 But it's something different than
 this guy's playing really loud rock music.
 Can he tell him to stop? This guy comes in and says,
 "I'm being extorted. I'm being blackmailed."
 Police officers go, "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
 Police officers go, "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
 It's like my Kindle. I'll never know what happened to Bella and Edward.
 Jeremy goes, "Oh, no, no, no. It's none of that stuff."
 It's full of child porn.
 It's just full of a bunch of child porn is all.
 And she's threatening to release the child porn
 to all of my friends and family
 if I don't pay her X amount of dollars.
 And so the cops go,
 "Okay, yeah, that's a whole extortion.
 Whoa, blackmail. That's like the worst crime
 we've ever heard of. We actually have a division
 dedicated to just stopping blackmail.
 Why don't you come into this room
 and log on to this computer here
 and show us the emails she's sending you."
 And they're like, "Oh, I'm so glad I thought you guys
 were going to be mad about all the child porn."
 And they're like, "No, no, no, what? No way, dude.
 Here's your email."
 And they're like, "I'm so glad I thought you guys
 were going to be mad about all the child porn."
 And they're like, "No, no, no, what?
 No way, dude. Here, just go ahead
 and log into this official police computer."
 Yeah, go ahead. Okay, get the camera right here.
 So we show your face
 and fingers at the same time, type in your password.
 Okay, good, good.
 He pulls up these emails from this woman
 saying, "Hi, I sold your iPad
 and I found all the child porn on it.
 Pay me X amount of dollars
 or I'm going to release all the child porn."
 And in the email were photos
 from his iPad of child porn.
 And the officers go,
 "Oh, are those the photos
 that are from your iPad?"
 And he's like, "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, those are from my iPad."
 And, "Okay, sir, you're under arrest.
 Why under arrest?
 Because you have put child porn on your iPad."
 He just told us that, "Oh, dang, now it.
 I thought you guys took extortion work seriously."
 Well, the cops did
 because then they pretended to be the guy
 they emailed her, the person who stole the iPad,
 and said, "Hey, I got the money.
 Where do you want to meet?
 I'll pay you the money."
 And the woman goes, "Oh, that's so perfect.
 I'm so tired of having to email people child porn."
 She meets up in the middle of the park.
 Cops arrest her.
 The one dude gets charged with child porn,
 which is obviously a horrible thing
 to get charged with. It's a horrible thing to do.
 She gets charged with extortion
 and distributing child porn
 because she emailed it to him.
 So the reason why
 I've told the variations
 of the story throughout because
 there's a heartwarming version of the story
 that I've always loved to tell.
 And this is that. There's an old story.
 This old story. Some kids
 broke into this dude's house,
 checked all of his stuff,
 stole his laptop, stole a bunch of his stuff,
 left. And then when they were
 back at their little hideout, back at their
 where the footclan hangs out,
 it's like an arcade and a skate ramp
 and all this stuff. The teenagers are using
 his stuff. They turn on his laptop full of child porn.
 They call the police and say,
 "Listen, dude, we broke into this dude's house.
 We stole all of this stuff,
 but..." And we admit to all that,
 "But this is super gross."
 And the cops took the computer
 and didn't charge the kids. And the dude went to prison
 for like 20 years, because there was like a ton of it
 on there. There really doesn't even have to be a lot.
 Any small amount can get you a serious time.
 But I always liked that story. That's what you should...
 First off, don't break into people's houses.
 But if you ever have a hankering to like
 smash a window and steal something, and you
 happen to find this stuff, don't then try to
 blackmail the guy. Just turn it over to the cops.
 Like what was her best case
 scenario? That she was going to meet a guy
 and he was going to give her like $10,000
 or something like that. She was going to give him back this
 iPad. And then she would know
 that this guy, this grody dude
 is walking away with his collection of
 child porn. And she's like,
 "Ha ha ha! I got all this money!"
 That's blood money right there.
 But anyways, they're both facing
 massive charges and all that stuff.
 Gross, if that ever happens to you,
 not that your child porn collection
 gets stolen, but if you ever like
 stumble across someone else's stuff, turn it over to the police.
 So there we go.
 A story of two gross people
 running into each other. She should have just
 turned it in. She would have been a hero.
 But instead she's a zero. Just like him
 in jail. Don't do drugs.
 You know, this, I mentioned
 a couple episodes back. I said,
 "This is an episode of Bad Transitions."
 A couple episodes back, I said,
 "If this show's too dark for you
 because everything else is going on, I don't mind
 if you skip a couple of episodes
 or stop listening to podcasts all together and come back later,
 or whatever."
 You're under no obligation to listen to me.
 I really enjoy it, and I really enjoy spending the time with you guys.
 But I also wanted to give a shout out to another
 podcast that I listen to.
 It's called the Black Heart Cinema Podcast.
 It's a group of dudes who do, they talk about movies.
 And they basically do about one movie and episode,
 some episodes they've done two.
 It's one of those things that, one of the things I like about the podcast is,
 they talk about the movie,
 but you can tell they have a passion
 for film in general.
 Because first off, they did an episode about,
 this also set them apart.
 They reviewed a porno movie, so that obviously
 set them apart.
 Recently though, they did an episode that they
 gave a shout out to me. I want to return the favor.
 For the movie, "Triple X," starring Vin Diesel.
 And as they're talking about it, you can tell
 they have a passion for film because they just start going,
 talking about like 90's,
 early 2000 action movies in general.
 They started talking about the genre and how it changed.
 And we saw that
 change from "Triple X" to
 the new James Bond versions
 in the comparison. These guys know their stuff,
 is what I'm saying. Some people can just
 sit and talk about movies, read an IMDB
 page and call it a podcast. That's not these guys.
 They actually seem to have a passion for it
 and a knowledge about the movie. So I recommend you guys
 check them out. Also, dude, they need some
 subscriber love. Right now, they got 15
 subscribers over there. They got 66
 episodes out, so they've been putting in
 work, it comes out every week. They've been doing
 it for a long time. Let's get them some subscriber
 love over there, Black Heart Cinema
 Podcast. They're on
 EveryWaryListener Podcast and YouTube as well.
 Now, I want, let's
 move on to our next topic. Our next topic involves
 two different stories. And I'm going to tell you up
 front that this is
 a, this is something similar we've
 covered before. So I don't want to feel like
 I'm ever repeating myself, but this is
 similar to something we've talked about
 before. But I think it's important. It's more
 information involving a phenomenon that
 I mentioned a long, long time ago.
 But let's go ahead and strap
 in here. The first story
 we're going to look at, I don't have
 a location for, I just have a month.
 So, take with a grain
 of salt is what I'm saying. That's, that's
 might be the least amount of
 information I have for a story.
 But it's been backed up by other stories
 that I've told in the past and another story I'm going to tell this
 episode, so we're going to go with it. It's January,
 it's 1989, at night
 there's a husband and wife. And
 they're sitting at home just kind of doing their own thing
 reading the newspaper, wife's cooking dinner,
 or let's not be sexist, maybe the man
 is cooking dinner and the
 woman is baking.
 So, anyways, they're doing their own thing and
 they both get, they both
 get a hankering
 to go to a movie. So they're standing
 in the kitchen, he's cooking, she's
 getting her cookies ready, and they look
 at each other and they go, let's go see a movie.
 Now it's 1989, so what are they, what are they
 watching? They're watching the Deep Six,
 what is that, Deep Star Six?
 It's 1989, what's at the theater? Terminator
 2 hadn't come out yet. They
 decide to go see Deep Star Six.
 So, they get dressed up, they're going
 to cosplayers, they dress up in underwater
 suits, and they get into their car, and they
 drive to the
 movie theater, and they watch Deep Star Six, and they're like
 "Eh, I was okay."
 You know, a decent creature feature,
 I guess.
 You know what you're going to do. So,
 they walk out of the theater, they get in their car,
 they leave the theater,
 driving around town
 at night. A town that they live in, by the way,
 they didn't travel 500 miles
 to go see Deep Star Six opening night in Hollywood.
 A town that they live
 in, driving around at night.
 And they're trying to get home,
 right, that's what you do after a movie.
 You drive, and they're coming down the street,
 and there's construction set up,
 like a roadway block, and they're like
 "Oh, that's..." They must have started
 building something in the two hours
 we were watching the sci-fi
 cinematic masterpiece
 Deep Star Six
 Do-it-you-turn, start driving the other way.
 Coming down another road,
 flashing yellow lights,
 road crew equipment there. No people!
 Just the
 barricades in the road.
 What? That's weird.
 They start to realize
 that everywhere they turn
 there's construction.
 But there's no one actually
 doing anything there. They also begin
 to realize they don't remember
 how to get home.
 They're driving around
 for hours.
 And then finally they get home.
 A weird night, obviously.
 They get home, they're like
 "The movie was mediocre, the most exciting part
 was the fact that the city seemed
 to surround us, but we're home."
 And as years went on
 they'd always kind of be like
 "That was so weird, remember when we went to go see Deep Star Six?"
 Apparently this episode
 is a plug for that movie.
 And they go "Yeah, it's so weird."
 But I don't remember
 everything was blocked off and they'd be like
 "Yeah, I just have a hard time
 really remembering anything about the movie."
 Except for the lukewarm performances
 of George Clooney's cousin. And I think Clint Howard
 was in it too. And she's like "What?"
 He's like "I don't know, I don't know. I'm having
 vague memories about Deep Star Six now as well."
 Years later they decide
 to get hypnotized. Now this makes
 sense because
 we have hypnotism, regression
 stuff like that. It's always been
 in vogue, at least since the 70's
 80's. I remember when I was a kid a lot of people
 were doing it. Not a bunch of kids. Kids were like
 "What do you want to do for your birthday party, Billy?"
 "Pass life regression!"
 You have sort of a clown that's hypnotized
 me and like "You used to be a monk."
 But it was in, when I was
 a kid I would see people on television
 talking about getting hypnotized and stuff like that.
 Hence the name of Biggie's hit song.
 So
 they decide to do the hypnotism thing.
 And this is what they remember
 now something more concrete about that night.
 They left a movie theater.
 They drove to a church parking lot.
 They remember that.
 They remember
 a flying saucer
 hovering above them in this empty church parking lot.
 They have flashes
 of gray aliens reaching out to them.
 Of being pinned down
 to medical tables.
 Of painful procedures
 of painful procedures.
 And
 they notice something later as well.
 In the real world, outside of their memories.
 The wife
 she used to have a blood clotting disease.
 It's now gone.
 Now you're going Jason, that story is kind of ridiculous.
 You don't have a place.
 You don't have names of people.
 You're missing key parts of information.
 You can't even tell us the town it took place.
 That's fair.
 And you think
 if you got abducted by aliens
 or you went to see deep star 6
 she got lost. You don't know where you're at.
 You get home. And then
 between that and getting hypnotized
 she didn't realize that her blood clotting disease was gone.
 I mean I don't think you feel it.
 I don't think you're like oh the clots.
 The clots they hurt. I don't think it works that way.
 But if she was a hemophiliac
 and her blood didn't clot
 did she not get caught. It's suspicious.
 But it's an interesting story. Because if you will remember
 long time ago
 and I tried to remember
 in what episode it was I couldn't.
 I talked about a thing called disguised abduction.
 It was a short story
 where a woman got in a car crash
 and
 she had a hard time remembering
 which will happen after a car crash.
 But there was like a car crash or she saw a car crash
 and she couldn't
 drive around it or something like that.
 I vaguely have memories of it. I don't know if the aliens got to it too.
 But the point is that there was a weird
 I think it was a car. That was it.
 She was driving on the road and there was a car crash
 but there was nobody in any of the cars
 and she was like this is weird.
 And she was kind of like looking around the car crash
 and then eventually after a period of time she drives away.
 And then she had
 she remembered
 through hypnosis there was a UFO
 the car crash was completely made up.
 There was a UFO that abducted her
 and experimented on her. And the theory was
 was that
 the aliens we've always heard this
 story of like false memories
 and it's kind of the idea that
 you get abducted
 and then you get put back on earth and you're like
 oh I don't remember all of this horrible stuff.
 It turns out the aliens may actually
 be able to
 create completely false memories
 in you. Not you go to bed
 you wake up you don't remember being abducted.
 You go to work
 and you go into the bathroom stall
 you get abducted and then you remember
 the rest of your day at work.
 So when you wake up at home
 this morning you're like oh that was weird.
 Of course then there's other people there
 and be like dude where'd you go you went to the bathroom stall you disappeared
 for like 10 hours. You walk in here you're all sweaty
 you've something sticking out your butt you obviously got anal probed
 what? Oh I didn't even notice that.
 But if you were in a
 solo environment or like in this case
 husband and wife together
 both going out and
 that's the other creepy thing.
 But we'll get to that in a second.
 We'll get to that in a second. Let's take a look at another one of these stories.
 February 11th
 1989
 Levittown Long Island this is 9pm
 we're getting some more information on this one.
 There are these two
 musicians in their apartment who I can only
 assume are the Beastie Boys
 hanging out in their apartment in Levittown
 I think they're in the Bronx it doesn't matter.
 These two guys these two musicians
 were fighting for their right
 to party making music
 in this apartment. I'm sure the neighbors
 loved these guys I'm sure they were totally awesome.
 And they start to hear
 weird noises. Noises
 that are weird because they're not making them.
 Someone else is being annoyingly loud.
 And both dudes run to the window
 and they look and they see four
 military helicopters
 cut across the night sky.
 In the four helicopters are not flying
 in a line they're flying in formation.
 They're flying in a box.
 And in the middle of
 the helicopters
 is what they describe as a massive
 shiny vehicle.
 Saucer shaped?
 We don't know.
 But definitely not
 human.
 Not identifiably human.
 These two dudes look at each other.
 Whoa dude. They run
 they get in their car and they begin driving through
 the city of Long Island. That's a city right?
 They're driving through
 the area known as Long Island
 Levittown. And they're looking up
 through their windows and they can see the four helicopters
 and the
 metal ship flying in formation with them.
 They start to get on the expressway
 and then all of a sudden
 the four helicopters
 break formation and start to fly away.
 The metal ship becomes a flaming
 ball.
 And then both of them black out.
 The next thing they know
 they're turning onto a bridge.
 What?
 What was that? I don't know. You saw that right?
 Yeah, yeah, the helicopters and the
 shiny vehicle. There's multi-colored
 lights flashing all around it. Yeah, it was
 weird. And turned to fireball.
 You say, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, but weren't we just on the expressway?"
 Now they're just silently
 they're not silently they're talking but now
 they're driving across this bridge
 in Long Island.
 Later on, months, years later, we don't know
 but later on one of the young men
 remembers
 things.
 He remembers
 being in a room
 with gray aliens.
 And he remembers seeing
 hieroglyphics everywhere.
 The hieroglyphic motif
 is, I'm starting to see
 is very common
 in alien lore. Now I don't,
 I am not a proponent of ancient aliens.
 I will say this.
 I think it's possible that aliens have visited
 us in the past.
 I don't believe that all of our
 great wonders are because of aliens. I
 believe that humans
 are so uniquely advanced.
 We built the pyramids. We built
 these temples. We built all
 of these things without any alien
 intervention. So
 I don't think they're necessarily Egyptian hieroglyphics.
 A lot of times people say they're hieroglyphics
 and then when I did that story recently about the scientists
 Deep Prasad
 he said they were hieroglyphic. Look,
 if I saw weird symbols
 that seemed to be showing
 some sort of, like a guy
 walking, I would describe it as hieroglyphic.
 It doesn't mean that it's actually hieroglyphic.
 Deep Prasad said
 it reminded him of hieroglyphics.
 Deep Prasad is a quantum
 scientist. He has the language
 for these type of things. If I just saw him and said
 they're hieroglyphics, I don't necessarily think aliens
 were messing around with the Egyptians
 helping to build temples. Because if that was
 true, hieroglyphics is a really, really
 primitive way to write things.
 So if the aliens were coming down
 and teaching the Egyptians how to write, they sucked
 at that. I think what we're
 seeing is their language.
 Well, now I'm kind of knocking the aliens language too,
 but maybe they do have a sucky language.
 Or maybe the best way we can look at it
 is a hieroglyphic. And really
 it's this super advanced thing. I don't know. But anyways,
 Egyptian hieroglyphics aren't the most
 advanced writing form on the planet.
 I don't... they're not
 even in my top ten personally. And I'm a big
 writing dude.
 I love cursive.
 Whatever the steady... stenography.
 No, that's not it. Doesn't matter.
 The point is, is that both of these stories,
 and the story I told in an earlier episode,
 have some chilling things
 going on. One, it's the idea that
 you can be abducted
 and you're given
 this memory that
 halfway makes sense.
 That's weird. It's almost like...
 and it makes sense from an alien point of
 view. If the alien is trying to
 replicate the human experience, but doesn't understand
 the human experience,
 it just says,
 "Oh, we need to keep... we need to fill
 your brain with memories for a while."
 And we know humans drive down
 roads,
 so we're going to put
 barricade... but see, that doesn't make sense.
 Like, as a human, you'd be like, "Why are there all these barricades here?"
 If a human was going
 to implant false memories in somebody else,
 you would go, "Oh, they're dry...
 We'll have them driving down the road,
 and then we'll make them remember taking a turn
 off and going to the old place they used to make out,
 and they drive out there for a while, and they...
 they make out or whatever, and then they come back.
 Apparently, I'm the pervert.
 I'm putting in perverted stuff.
 I'm like, "Oh, yeah." Then he was kissing his cat.
 "Ooh, he loves it." They're like, "Jason,
 quit putting in gross false memories."
 My point is that a human
 could come up with better ones, and alien would just be like,
 "Oh, bunch of stuff,
 a bunch of random stuff to keep you from getting
 home. Here's your false memories."
 With the two musicians,
 they didn't necessarily have a false memory,
 but they... actually,
 that's the second part that makes it creepy.
 Both of these groups of people,
 they were lured out of their houses.
 The couple at home
 going, "You know what? Let's go see a movie."
 And they drive to the...
 They had no... who wants to see
 Deep Star 6 in the theater?
 Really. I don't know if that's exactly
 what they saw, but the story
 goes they were just standing there
 and they go, "Let's go see a movie."
 Like, it popped in both their head at the same time.
 They drive out to watch the movie
 when they go to go home. They're trapped.
 And then eventually they have
 these memories of being abducted.
 With these two young men,
 they already saw Deep Star 6.
 They don't care about that. What's going to get
 two young dudes out of the apartment?
 You could have had a bunch of curvy. You could have some gray aliens
 wearing wigs and like tight dresses.
 Like a Bugs Bunny cartoon. They're like, "Hey boys!"
 Or...
 Because I've done this. If there's a bunch
 of cop cars flying by, I will
 follow them. Not anymore, because I walk.
 But I used to have a car. I used to follow
 cop cars all the time. I always used to...
 police helicopters searching the area to go out to the area.
 Just hang out.
 See what's going on.
 With Sacramento too, so that happened a lot.
 But that's going to get you out of your house.
 You see four military helicopters
 escorting a UFO. That's way better than a police chase.
 You're going to go out there.
 And you have to think
 they're seeing it.
 But this was never reported in the mainstream
 media.
 So that makes me think no one else
 in the city is seeing this thing.
 It was unique to them.
 And it wanted to get them to a location
 where it could abduct them.
 So not only
 is it possible that people are being abducted
 and never even
 knowing about it.
 They're just that time you went for a walk.
 And it's not like you walked out
 your house. The next thing you know
 you were standing in the middle of Virginia
 wearing a raincoat. You're like, "Well, what?"
 You walk out of your house. You're walking down the street.
 You see a cat. You're like, "Oh, look at this.
 Cool little cat." You walk a couple more feet.
 You see a squirrel. You're like, "Oh, that's cool."
 Then you walk a few more feet and you see the squirrel
 riding the cat.
 What?
 And then you... that what?
 Did I just see that? And then you turn the corner
 and you go back home.
 And in that time period
 was basically an al...
 you get abducted and an alien going,
 "Well, we have to account for these 10 minutes
 that we have this due."
 And cowboys ride horses
 and squirrels look like cowboys
 apparently to an alien.
 Let's make them ride a cat. That's normal, right?
 So you have to think
 about all those times you've ever seen...
 What if the actually seen a UFO
 is the anomaly that's being put
 in your brain? Everyone's being abducted.
 But that's not
 the only scary part about this, because I covered
 that on a past episode. The scary part is
 is that you can actually be taken out
 of your safe space
 by your own
 "free will"
 to get you in a better position to be abducted.
 Both of these stories involved people going to places
 they wouldn't have been going at that moment.
 Both of them
 either seeing something or sensing something
 to get them to leave that place.
 That's scary.
 That's scary. Because
 it didn't seem weird to any of them.
 Well, the UFO flying over town was weird,
 but their own instinct to follow it
 was normal.
 That's creepy. Because I think
 the thing that we can count on is
 if we're ever in a position
 where our lives are in jeopardy,
 we can make rational decisions.
 But what if that's simply not true?
 What if you could be safe at your home
 and then go,
 "You know what? I want ice cream."
 "I have ice cream in my freezer,
 but I want a particular type of ice cream
 and it's across town at this particular
 ice cream shop."
 You're driving over there,
 you get abducted.
 Creepy.
 But then let's take it to 11.
 The aliens
 are ready to make their move.
 Whatever their overall goal is,
 the aliens are ready
 to make their move against humanity.
 What will any of our technology matter?
 What will any of our military matter?
 If they can simply
 trick us
 into walking outside,
 we may want
 an Independence Day war with the aliens
 to take our planet back,
 but when the moment comes,
 we may all just walk outside.
 Because that's what we want to do
 in that moment.
 Or at least
 that's what we think
 we want to do.
