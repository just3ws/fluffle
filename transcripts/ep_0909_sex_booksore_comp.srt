1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,880
 Tom Hanks, actor, comedian, and Illuminati operative who was killed in Guantanamo Bay

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,840
 just last year, has a clone walking around.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,440
 That's why he's been in a bunch of movies since he died.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,320
 He has a clone walking around, but does the Illuminati have even darker plans for this

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,960
 doppelganger of America's favorite actor?

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:33,960
 And then we take a look at two terrifying yet erotic stories of love from beyond the grave.

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:41,360
 Is it possible that even the dead want to boink today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:51,960
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,040
 I'm your host Jason Marviner, I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,680
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,760
 It's the official beginning of season 19.

12
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,640
 We had that crazy breaking story last week about the Georgia Guidestones and I could not

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,240
 wait to tell it to you.

14
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,800
 What a crazy story and it's developing.

15
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,480
 Developing story, we'll see if any more news comes out of that, but right now someone coming

16
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,140
 out of something, I'm sure he's coming out of somewhere, give it up for one of our newest

17
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,080
 Patreon supporters, everyone on your feet for Dyspozy.

18
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,080
 Woohoo!

19
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,600
 Yeah, come on in Dyspozy.

20
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,120
 I just imagine like a big ol' garbage disposal walking in, eating everything up.

21
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,480
 Dyspozy, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

22
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,280
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it, trust me I do.

23
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,440
 Just help spread the word about the show that really, really helps out a lot.

24
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,840
 Now Dyspozy, let's go ahead and we're gonna give you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

25
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,520
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

26
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,640
 We're gonna drive all the way out to a secret Illuminati party.

27
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:56,120
 I hope you guys are armed because we're going into enemy territory.

28
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,960
 Driving on out there.

29
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,400
 Now I brought an Illuminum Baseball bat, I probably should have brought more if we're

30
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,720
 going up against the Illuminati.

31
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,080
 We're driving on out to this Illuminati party, we're gonna have to make sure that we're

32
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,080
 in disguise.

33
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,560
 We're gonna dress up like some big weirdo freaks from Eyes Wide Shut.

34
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,400
 And we pull up and it happens to be at Lady Gaga's house and we're walking in and everyone's

35
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,680
 sitting back, they're chilling and they're injecting Adrenaline Chrome straight into their

36
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,680
 neck.

37
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,760
 This is a really intense start to season 19 and we have like little syringes full of

38
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,040
 Kool-Aid, we're just pretending right because we're not really gonna do Adrenaline Chrome.

39
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,480
 You're like Jason, don't inject Kool-Aid in your veins, I'm like too late.

40
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,720
 I have instant diabetes.

41
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,080
 So after I'm on dialysis for the next two weeks, we go back to Lady Gaga's house, we're

42
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,560
 walking around this Illuminati party and the reason why we're here is because breaking

43
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,960
 news from the world of the Dark Outpost.

44
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,720
 The Dark Outpost is a website we've covered a lot on this show, it's hosted by a man known

45
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,360
 as David Zublik and he tells us the truth that the lamestream media is trying to hide

46
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,360
 from us.

47
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,600
 The first truth is don't inject Kool-Aid in your veins.

48
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:18,480
 And secondly, that Tom Hanks, actor, comedian, has he ever directed anything?

49
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,680
 I don't know.

50
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,240
 But anyways, actor, comedian, director, question mark.

51
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,760
 He is a top player in this Illuminati game trying to take over the world but we don't

52
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,120
 have to worry about this so much, right?

53
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,920
 Because as you guys all know, it's been almost a year since I exposed the truth that Tom

54
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,520
 Hanks was caught for all of his nefarious crimes against humanity and was killed at

55
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,520
 Guantanamo Bay.

56
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,600
 We did that episode, it was like episode 700 or something like that.

57
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,440
 I'll put it in the show notes and close call with that one, right?

58
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,720
 I mean, who wants a freak like Tom Hanks walking around?

59
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,480
 Well, I wasn't thinking very clearly.

60
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,400
 I was thinking like a normal person that when the military executes someone at Guantanamo

61
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,360
 Bay, they're dead.

62
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,280
 But the Illuminati apparently has a cloning facility underground and luckily, luckily

63
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,800
 they had a clone of Tom Hanks.

64
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,680
 And that's why you see him in movies nowadays.

65
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,680
 Remember this whole thing?

66
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,160
 I guess I have to do a little bit of a review on this.

67
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,560
 He was Tom Hanks, actor, comedian, director.

68
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,200
 And then he went to Australia to shoot a movie and he caught COVID.

69
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,640
 And then this whole conspiracy theory started that he was acting.

70
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,640
 You guys remember this?

71
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,080
 You see that he was actually under house arrest because he was shooting these TikTok videos.

72
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,240
 He asked COVID, he's trying to do, he's trying to floss, he's coughing.

73
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,640
 And in the background of all these videos, there was a door and people go, wait, that

74
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,440
 door only opens one way.

75
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,960
 That's not a door of a hotel room.

76
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,680
 That is the door of a prison cell in Guantanamo Bay.

77
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,680
 Do you guys remember?

78
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,360
 This is what I love about conspiracy theories is they blow up.

79
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,580
 They're super popular.

80
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,360
 You see them everywhere and then like two weeks later, they're gone.

81
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,920
 And people pretend that they never happen.

82
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,440
 Tom Hanks once had a little bit more legs, but there was that whole thing.

83
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,120
 Ellen had like the ankle bracelet she was under house arrest.

84
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,120
 We were all under house arrest.

85
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,320
 The whole world was locked down due to COVID.

86
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,560
 But anyways, they said, look it, he's clearly in a prison cell, not a hotel room, which

87
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,200
 is a great advertisement for whatever hotel he was staying in.

88
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,160
 But that whole thing.

89
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,500
 And then the theory just kept on going that he didn't have COVID, that that was actually

90
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:39,540
 an excuse so he could go to this military tribunal in Guantanamo Bay.

91
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:44,420
 And I was thinking, why would the military be like, listen, we're going to execute you

92
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,420
 in three days.

93
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,140
 You have to make 11 TikToks before then.

94
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,140
 So we have this cover story.

95
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,380
 But anyways, so that was how this whole Tom Hanks thing started off.

96
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:57,340
 I think Isaac Cappy was the first person to say, Tom Hanks is a pedophile when Isaac Cappy

97
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,960
 listed a bunch of people, Seth Green and all these guys.

98
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,520
 I've talked about this before on the episodes.

99
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,840
 I'll put it in the show notes, but quick overview.

100
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,520
 So he got dragged in all this, the very next movie he did, he was accused of being a pedophile

101
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,000
 who was kidnapping kids and injecting Adrenaline Chrome to extract Adrenaline Chrome from the

102
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,360
 frightened children to inject into his own body.

103
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,000
 The very next movie he did, the very next movie he did, the movie he was in Australia

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,320
 shooting was a Western about he had to protect this young girl from these people who were

105
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,980
 trying to kidnap her.

106
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:33,260
 And it was so interesting to think that's weird that the conspiracy theorists are pushing

107
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,780
 so hard on this Illuminati Adrenaline Chrome thing.

108
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,980
 And the next movie he comes out, he's trying to protect a child and nobody talked about

109
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,980
 it.

110
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,980
 It was the weirdest thing.

111
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:45,020
 Like they didn't even go look and he's hiding in plain sight.

112
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,780
 This clearly in this Western movie underneath this cowboy hat, there's a bunch of Adrenaline

113
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,780
 Chrome vials.

114
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:55,140
 Anyways, then he went on to make Elvis and all that stuff, but he didn't.

115
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,980
 It was his clone.

116
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,600
 It's his clone actually walking around it right now.

117
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,920
 As Tom Hanks was being led up to the gallows, they were going to execute him and he said,

118
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,000
 his last words were, "This doesn't matter.

119
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,160
 There are a ton of us out there."

120
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,160
 And they hung him.

121
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,040
 And I think at that point everyone thought he meant like there's a lot of Illuminati

122
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,600
 agents left out there.

123
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,600
 No.

124
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,680
 He actually meant that there's a bunch of, he doesn't want his actual last words by

125
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,680
 the way.

126
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,680
 He's still alive.

127
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,920
 But if you accept the conspiracy theory, he was referring to his army of clones because

128
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,780
 if you do have cloning technology, you're not going to clone a bunch of world leaders.

129
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,340
 You're going to clone 80 Tom Hanks.

130
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,260
 You have all these Tom Hanks and everything like that.

131
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,300
 So another one has been released from the cloning.

132
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,140
 But that's not news, right?

133
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,020
 That's pretty much a given in the world of conspiracy theory.

134
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:51,020
 The reason why we're talking about it right now is because this clone is dying.

135
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,340
 And this was actually the plan.

136
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,700
 So apparently according to David Zublik, this is what the story is.

137
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:01,680
 Tom Hanks is, this is, this is so, if you know what I said was insane before we haven't

138
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,240
 even started yet.

139
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,920
 Tom Hanks clone walked out of the cloning facility and the Illuminati put a switch in

140
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,520
 him so he will die at a certain point.

141
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:20,400
 And what happened was Tom Hanks died before the whole Australia thing apparently.

142
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,240
 And then it was Tom Hanks clone.

143
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,020
 They did a little bit of like retroactively retconning.

144
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,340
 That's the term they kind of retconned the story.

145
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:34,140
 Tom Hanks clone was when he stepped out of the cloning machine already had COVID.

146
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,800
 He already had COVID and that was part of the plan.

147
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:43,540
 So the clone met Tom Hanks wife Rita Wilson, I think is her name.

148
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:47,780
 And Wilson, he said she's dating a volleyball.

149
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:52,060
 He comes out of the cloning machine with COVID, which doesn't sound like a really good plan,

150
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,320
 but he comes out coughing everywhere.

151
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,040
 The scientists were like, ah, and then they go, oh, clone Hanks, we need to give you a

152
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,160
 vaccine for that disease that we gave you.

153
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:09,840
 And when he got the COVID vaccine, then people often email me and they go, how come your

154
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,840
 show is not bigger?

155
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,360
 How come YouTube is constantly limiting your stuff?

156
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,960
 It's probably because I talk about stuff like this.

157
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,680
 It's probably because I don't talk about, there's conspiracy theories, there's mainstream

158
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,260
 conspiracy theories, and then there's this.

159
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,580
 Tom Hanks clone came out with COVID.

160
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:30,740
 They gave him the COVID vaccine, which gave him Parkinson's disease.

161
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,940
 So that's where we're at right now.

162
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:40,900
 Tom Hanks' clone has Parkinson's and for proof, David Zublick shows a video of Tom

163
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:47,860
 Hanks on stage like doing this comedy routine and he's shaking from a video tape of Tom

164
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,040
 Hanks kind of shaking on camera.

165
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,320
 He got, he concocted this whole story that Tom Hanks clone has Parkinson's and he got

166
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,080
 it from the COVID vaccine and all, what?

167
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:05,000
 But he apparently he really was shaking because apparently Tom Hanks said, yeah, sorry about

168
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,160
 shaking, sorry about shaking during that.

169
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,880
 I guess he has diabetes and he go, and he's had diabetes for like 20 years.

170
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,640
 I actually have to look this up right when people make these insane statements.

171
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,160
 Okay, let's look it up.

172
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,980
 Apparently he does have diabetes and apparently he said it wasn't really taking the right

173
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,500
 medication I needed to be.

174
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,500
 So that's why I'm shaking.

175
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,780
 I don't actually have Parkinson's and I'm not a clone.

176
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,500
 The reporters are like, what?

177
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,820
 We didn't even ask anything about the clone and the clone walks up to him, starts strangling

178
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,580
 him, coughing in their face.

179
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,060
 So that is the story of Tom Hanks clone.

180
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,380
 But again, that's not even the weirdest thing.

181
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,300
 I talk a lot about dark outposts and real raw news.

182
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,140
 And the thing is, is that when I'm talking about these things and I'm reading them and

183
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:55,120
 I'm laughing, I really don't think you're getting the essence and really what, how seriously

184
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,680
 people take this stuff.

185
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,200
 Real raw news is another website like Dark Outpost.

186
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,080
 Real raw news is a blog.

187
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,440
 Dark Outpost is a daily show.

188
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,240
 It's like three to four hours each day.

189
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,480
 David Zublik will go on these rants basically.

190
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,180
 And so I'm telling the story and I'm laughing and I'm joking and seeing stuff about the

191
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,700
 COVID vaccine that I'll get the show taken off of YouTube.

192
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:27,540
 I think it, I want to play a clip for you of David Zublik, the way that he talks about

193
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:32,900
 this stuff because it shows how sincere and how much these people believe in it.

194
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:39,420
 And the, both of these real raw news and dark outposts have huge audiences, huge audiences.

195
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,400
 We're talking 80 to 100,000 people, right?

196
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,120
 A huge scope of people.

197
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,840
 Real raw news makes about $5,000 a month just through donations.

198
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,920
 Minimum $5,000 a month just through donations.

199
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,720
 And I don't know how much money Dark Outpost is making, but I want to play you this clip.

200
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,320
 Now the set up for this clip is that some of you guys may know if you're of a certain

201
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,920
 age, there was an old television show called Buzzing Buddies.

202
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,720
 It was Tom Hanks' first big show.

203
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,720
 I liked it.

204
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,720
 I thought it was funny.

205
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:18,300
 Tom Hanks and his co-star Peter Scolari are dudes who, their house gets knocked down by

206
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,780
 a construction crew.

207
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:24,100
 And so they have to live at a women's dormitory.

208
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,140
 So they're not homeless and they dress up like women, but then they like fall in love

209
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,140
 with some of the girls.

210
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:32,260
 So each episode they're like changing clothes between women and men, women and men.

211
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,340
 And great theme song by Billy Joel.

212
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,340
 I love it.

213
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:40,280
 So we have this show called Buzzing Buddies and they truly were Buzzing Buddies because

214
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,700
 I'm about to play you this clip.

215
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,960
 When Tom Hanks was arrested, Peter Scolari got all of his devices confiscated.

216
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,600
 I guess they were at the same airport.

217
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,560
 I said, "That's a whole other story."

218
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,940
 But anyways, when Tom Hanks got arrested, Peter Scolari was there.

219
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,620
 They took his electronic devices but let him go.

220
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,640
 And then when they were going through his electronic, Peter Scolari's electronic devices,

221
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,460
 they had to re-arrest them because they found this video footage.

222
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:12,220
 This is a clip from the Dark Outpost where David Zublik is telling you what they found

223
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,740
 on this footage.

224
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:20,780
 One video, our source said, depicted a collaborative criminal venture, garbed in drag, Hanks in

225
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:27,040
 a red evening gown and heels, and Scolari sporting a floral ensemble.

226
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:33,580
 The sadistic duo stood above a young child who was strapped face down to a metal gurney.

227
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:42,180
 Pretending to be acupuncturists, they jabbed holes on the child's back and looked like

228
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,380
 pores on a sponge.

229
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,780
 The loud of the child screamed.

230
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:50,840
 The deeper they pushed the steel quills into his back.

231
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:55,360
 They stuck the kid for 30 minutes, according to military sources, which had his back look

232
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,300
 like a slice of Swiss cheese.

233
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:03,820
 Then Scolari smothered the child's face with a pillow and apparently snuffed the life

234
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,380
 out of him.

235
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:12,460
 But even that act of cruelty did not satisfy the devious duo's barbarous cravings.

236
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:20,260
 For a coup de gras, Hanks held a silent pistol to the kid's head, shouting, "Life ain't

237
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,940
 like a box of chocolates.

238
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,660
 It's like a bag of shit."

239
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:31,600
 As he squeezed the trigger and blew out the child's brains, a red pink mist filled the

240
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,080
 lens field of view in this horrific video.

241
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,400
 So I mean there's a lot of questions with this one, right?

242
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,760
 There's a lot of questions with this one.

243
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,560
 First off, I don't know if I should go point to point or just get to the big one, just

244
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,560
 get to the ending.

245
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,800
 I find it really weird that Peter Scolari, first off, I'm not gonna wear this tape even

246
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,440
 exist and obviously doesn't.

247
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,780
 But you listen to how sincere he is, right?

248
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,580
 How he's like, "Yeah, yeah."

249
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,340
 And then this happened.

250
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,820
 He's actually recounting something he saw.

251
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,060
 It almost sounds like "Buzzing Buddies" creepypasta.

252
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:10,820
 It almost sounds like this actually was Squidward's suicide from 1982.

253
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:17,540
 But you have this, you have Peter Scolari and Tom Hanks dressed up in dresses and then

254
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,660
 they're pretending to be acupuncturists.

255
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:25,280
 And I think, I mean listen, I'm not a zoomer, I don't know what kids are into these days.

256
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,120
 I think he would probably recognize that that was Tom Hanks.

257
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,560
 I don't think Tom Hanks could be disguised as anybody.

258
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,200
 He's been around for decades now at this point, well him and his clone.

259
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,000
 But the boy, like, how did they disguise themselves as acupuncturists?

260
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,120
 Acupuncturists just look like normal people, right?

261
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,960
 So anyways, and they're poking holes in his back and they make it look like a sponge.

262
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:52,780
 It's just so gross to the way that he's like, "Mmm, yeah, sponge."

263
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,740
 It's like he's a little, David you're a little too into it.

264
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,460
 You're a little too into recounting that story.

265
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:02,660
 But you have him turn this kid into a sponge and they're like, "Hey kid, look, you're

266
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,660
 a SpongeBob SquarePants."

267
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,900
 He gets like, "No, I always wanted to be Patrick."

268
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:11,220
 The story really lingers on the boy's torment, which is super creepy.

269
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,940
 Right, super creepy.

270
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:18,480
 And then obviously the coup de gras, the quote, right?

271
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,880
 The quote.

272
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,360
 Life isn't like a box of chocolates.

273
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,520
 It's like a bag of shit.

274
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:32,600
 Of course, I had to play this for my Patreon's on the Patreon Discord before we ran it.

275
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:39,000
 And one of them, Caspine Montague, said, "Did he do other Tom Hanks quotes?"

276
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,400
 Which I don't know.

277
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,980
 I mean, there might be other videos out there of him quoting other movies.

278
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,260
 What else would be quotable?

279
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,980
 You got a friend in me?

280
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,980
 No.

281
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,780
 And blows the kid's head off.

282
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,780
 What other?

283
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,780
 That's not even really good.

284
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,100
 Peter Scholar, he's like, "Well, that was a lame one.

285
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,540
 I don't even know any Tom."

286
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,420
 You thought you were in the burbs?

287
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,420
 You're actually...

288
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,900
 Pshh, you're the kid?

289
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,460
 I don't really know that many Tom Hanks quotes.

290
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,060
 Saving Ryan wouldn't...

291
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,060
 Whatever.

292
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,060
 Okay, we're done.

293
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:13,440
 The kindness is that I love that Tom Hanks, before he kills people, he quotes his own

294
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,440
 movies.

295
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,160
 And he doesn't have that many quotable movies.

296
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,760
 At least Arnold Schwarzenegger would have all these one-liners and stuff like that.

297
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,640
 How come Arnold Schwarzenegger's never been in...

298
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,960
 That's actually a very interesting question.

299
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,640
 Arnold Schwarzenegger, human orc?

300
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,360
 A man who's like six foot three and nothing but solid muscle even though he's like in

301
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,360
 his seventies now.

302
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,560
 How come he's never accused?

303
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,000
 He did inject steroids.

304
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,540
 We know that he injected stuff into his body and he was a successful political candidate.

305
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,540
 Taught movies are...

306
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,900
 How come he's never been accused of doing a terranochrome?

307
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:50,780
 How come it's always these skinny little wimps like Tom Hanks and Seth Green?

308
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:54,780
 But anyways, that is the story of Tom Hanks' clone.

309
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,740
 That's the story of Tom Hanks and how he murders people.

310
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:02,060
 But more importantly, that's the story of how these people take this stuff.

311
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:06,060
 We're joking about it and stuff like you're like, "Yeah, Jason, you joked about killing

312
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,920
 kids for about 20 minutes."

313
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,200
 But I think it's so creepy when they talk about it, when real raw news and darkout

314
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,320
 books talk about it, this is the tone of voice.

315
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,960
 This is super serious.

316
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,320
 Again, Patreon Discord, we were talking about it.

317
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:24,520
 Rudy Jazz said, "Do you think that they actually believe this stuff?"

318
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,240
 And I do think David Zublik believes this.

319
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,800
 I do think David Zublik, when he was reading this, actually believed that this happened.

320
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:37,960
 And he's spreading that message to tens of thousands, hundred thousand people a day.

321
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,260
 Creepy stuff because listen, I know there are people who don't like Tom Hanks.

322
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,100
 I know there are people who believe that to be successful in Hollywood, you have to do

323
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,660
 all these deals with the devil, the lulunati stuff.

324
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,180
 And that's one thing, right?

325
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,180
 We can discuss that.

326
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:54,020
 But to think that Tom Hanks is actually walking around quoting movies and shooting kids in

327
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,080
 the head, that's a totally different thing.

328
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,740
 We can have a discussion to be famous in the world.

329
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:03,240
 You have to make a deal with the God of the world, aka Satan.

330
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,800
 We'll have that discussion.

331
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,120
 But if someone goes, "No, no, no, I honestly believe that Tom Hanks, Tom Hanks' clone,

332
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,960
 is walking around coughing COVID on everybody."

333
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,600
 And the reason why he was cloned, because the original Tom Hanks was shooting people,

334
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:21,800
 shooting children while he was quoting his own movie, that's just so insane.

335
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,800
 That is insane.

336
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,040
 I'll still have a conversation with you about it because it's so insane to find an entertaining.

337
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,920
 But that's a bridge too far.

338
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,300
 It really is.

339
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,620
 That really, really is.

340
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:36,980
 So, disposies, like why did I have to be on this episode?

341
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,380
 Trust me, disposies, it gets worse.

342
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,820
 They actually feel bad.

343
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,980
 Usually when I have an episode like this, I usually don't have a new Patreon.

344
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,620
 I have someone who's already been a member of the Patreon for a while.

345
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,140
 Disposies, let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the Carvenercopter.

346
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,680
 We are leaving behind Lady Gaga's house.

347
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,780
 We're headed all the way out.

348
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,260
 Actually it's probably in the same area.

349
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,260
 To Los Angeles, California.

350
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:05,040
 I've been doing it before I even started this segment, I guess I should say.

351
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,640
 This segment is not appropriate for young children.

352
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:15,120
 It's not like the last segment was appropriate either, but I forgot to say that.

353
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,480
 But this segment, definitely not appropriate for young children because we're going to

354
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,720
 be talking about sex.

355
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,440
 We're going to be talking about what Salt and Pepper was always trying to get us to

356
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,600
 discuss sex.

357
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:37,020
 Not just sex, as in biological sex, but the question is, do ghosts want to have sex?

358
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:41,500
 It's kind of an interesting question because ghosts are constantly all kind of the idea

359
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:46,340
 with ghosts is that they come down and maybe it's unfinished business.

360
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,340
 That's why they're here.

361
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:51,300
 There was some sort of horrific event and they're like, "Soul is trapped here" or

362
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,740
 it's an emotional recording of the event.

363
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:59,680
 One of the big factors in being a biological creature is to reproduce.

364
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:04,040
 Even if you're not actively dating or actively trying to have children, people are always

365
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:10,280
 engaged in some sort of sexual activity, sexual thought, what have you.

366
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,560
 It would track, I think it would actually make sense.

367
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:18,840
 Humans spend so much time thinking about sex or engaging in sex or masturbation or whatever,

368
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,680
 that why would that stop just because you were dead?

369
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:27,900
 Now, there's always stories about people saying ghosts come to them in the middle of the night

370
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,860
 and they have sex with a ghost and things like that, but we've covered that before on

371
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,860
 the show.

372
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,860
 I'll put one or two of those episodes in the show notes, but a lot of times it's like weirdos,

373
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,860
 right?

374
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:41,220
 A lot of times it's like in the Daily Mail or the Daily Star, some British tabloid or

375
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,660
 some woman's like, "I married a pirate ghost" or whatever.

376
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:50,020
 But we hear about that, but it's actually super rare when we talk about all the amounts

377
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:54,600
 of ghosts that are seen around the world, all the ghost stories.

378
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:00,040
 We counter a disproportionately low amount of sex ghost stories.

379
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:05,200
 Now it could be that people don't want to talk about it, or it could be that they just

380
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,120
 don't exist, but I think that there should be more ghosts that want to have sex.

381
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:16,680
 So we're going to take a look at two ghosts that may be the exception to the rule or there

382
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,200
 may be more out there and people just don't know about it.

383
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,200
 Who knows?

384
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,020
 Because these places are both kind of weird, but the reason why we're first going to LA

385
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:28,180
 is in LA there is the LA County Museum of Arts.

386
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:32,660
 So disposed of these flying the carbon helicopter, we're landing on Wilshire Boulevard.

387
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:41,780
 There is a legend at the LA County Museum of Arts that there is a ghost of a woman there.

388
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:45,740
 And if you're at this museum, you're walking around, you're like looking at, I don't know

389
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,020
 exactly what they have there.

390
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:51,560
 It's a museum of arts, so it's probably arts, but it's probably like modern art, right?

391
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,760
 It's probably like a statue of like a circle and then like some dudes facing it and people

392
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,160
 are like, oh, that represents the soul.

393
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,560
 And you're like, oh, whatever, where's the mastodons?

394
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,560
 Where are the mummies?

395
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,840
 They're like, sir, just because it has the word museum in it does not mean that there

396
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,840
 has to be mummies.

397
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,920
 I'm a mummy, mummy, walking around knocking over all the art at this museum, according

398
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:16,240
 to security guards at this museum, because officially they have no statement on this

399
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,240
 place.

400
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,460
 They don't, they go, we don't want to talk about the ghost.

401
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:25,580
 But security guards at the museum says every so often, this woman shows up, this ghost

402
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:31,700
 woman shall be standing there and you'll be like in the hallway or in the bathroom or

403
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:38,580
 you'll be tearing apart art and she shows up and she wants to have sex with you.

404
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:44,500
 This ghost woman is constantly trying to bang the dudes who work there and who visit there.

405
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:49,480
 Now I came across that on theshadowlands.net, which is a great repository, but a lot of the

406
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,480
 stuff you really kind of have to dig through to see if there's any truth to it.

407
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:58,660
 What's super interesting is there seems to be some truth to this one.

408
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:04,360
 There are reports of both a female and a male ghost at the LA County Museum of Arts.

409
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,840
 They're floating around in there.

410
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,920
 Officially she's not trying to bang you, but I think that's something they leave off the

411
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,000
 brochure.

412
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,060
 Women would constantly be like honey can we go to the museum again and they're like oh

413
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,220
 great are you going to try to have sex with that ghost?

414
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,220
 No.

415
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,020
 I want to see if they find out there's mummies in.

416
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:24,340
 But then once you get in you run away from your wife and you're like ha ha trick to and

417
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:28,180
 you're just walking around empty hallways looking for this ghost to bang.

418
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,900
 But apparently there's some truth to the story.

419
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:36,780
 Back on June 22, 1989, a woman was murdered there.

420
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,780
 Her name was Evelyn Wasserstein.

421
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,980
 She was 79 years old.

422
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,680
 Let's put it out as something that was a sexy ghost the whole time.

423
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:48,120
 You thought it was a ghost that looked like Daphne from Scooby Doo or Anya Taylor Joy

424
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,620
 floating down the hallway.

425
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,620
 No.

426
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,620
 Sorry to burst your bubble.

427
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,760
 I should have explained this earlier.

428
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,600
 As you're listening to this episode you're like oh yeah, sexy episode of Dead Rav Radio.

429
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,360
 She's 70.

430
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,240
 It's Phyllis Diller basically.

431
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,560
 It's a 79 year old ghost woman who's trying to have sex with you while you're trying to

432
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,860
 ease the bathroom where you're like a security guard there and someone goes hey can you go

433
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:15,900
 get some stuff out of the supply closet and you're like fine and you go in there and there's

434
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:20,020
 this old wrinkly ghost woman trying to have sex with you.

435
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,020
 Evelyn Wasserstein.

436
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,700
 She's 79 years old.

437
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,540
 So originally this place used to be a department store and it had a restaurant on the bottom

438
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,540
 floor.

439
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,780
 May Company was the department store.

440
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:34,940
 1989 Evelyn Wasserstein was playing cards with a bunch of her friends in this restaurant

441
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:41,560
 downstairs and her estranged husband, Jack Wasserstein, walked in.

442
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,480
 Estranged if I understand this correctly means they're still married.

443
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,720
 They're just like not together, right?

444
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,400
 Estranged husband Jack Wasserstein walked in and she apparently this wasn't reported

445
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,600
 in the LA Times but apparently she was sleeping around on him.

446
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,520
 That's why they were estranged and she was like what I'm 79 years old.

447
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,320
 I'm gonna tomcat all around town.

448
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,940
 He walked into the restaurant and he couldn't take that his wife was sleeping around on

449
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:10,140
 him so he shot her several times while she was playing cards.

450
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,860
 This was like in the middle of the day and then he put the gun in his own head and killed

451
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,860
 himself.

452
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:17,220
 And then Tom Hanks.

453
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,660
 Tom Hanks showed up and he goes there's lots of types of shrimp.

454
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,060
 And then he went away.

455
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,060
 He went away.

456
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,940
 What does that reference even mean?

457
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,140
 Shoot himself he dies.

458
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,420
 So we do have a recorded murder.

459
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,600
 We do have a the stats kind of fit right?

460
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:38,040
 We have someone who was murdered here who apparently was sleeping around on her husband

461
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,040
 and now her ghost still wants to have sex.

462
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:46,160
 And that is so interesting because I read that and I go why don't we see more of them?

463
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,800
 Why don't we see more elderly phantoms floating around the golden girls are gonna haunt you

464
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,560
 tonight and they're like ooh which one are you gonna have first and after you get them

465
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,760
 vomiting you're like uh you.

466
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,900
 How come there's not more ghosts trying to have sex?

467
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,580
 Because that is such part of the human condition.

468
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:04,180
 And again even if you're not having sex you're doing other sexual things.

469
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,180
 But that's not all.

470
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,620
 That's not all because you can't just have one sex ghost.

471
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,980
 That would be an outlier.

472
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,980
 What if I told you there was two sex ghosts?

473
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:11,980
 What if I told you?

474
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:18,780
 Out of my entire decades of paranormal research I have two sex ghosts that I didn't find on

475
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,820
 an article in the Daily Star.

476
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:24,220
 Let's travel over to Garden Grove.

477
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,840
 That's another city in the Los Angeles area.

478
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:33,160
 We're gonna drive over to Garden Grove and we're gonna check out this place called Midnight

479
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,280
 Adult Books.

480
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:40,800
 An adult bookstore if you guys don't know it's not an actual bookstore.

481
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,080
 They have videos, they have DVDs.

482
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,360
 I don't know what they sell now because they used to sell DVDs.

483
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,800
 I guess Blu-ray.

484
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,040
 Would you want to watch 4K porn?

485
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:59,060
 4K OLED porn on your giant 52 inch monitor gooning to the greatest degree you can.

486
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,020
 Midnight Adult Books stored.

487
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,780
 They don't sell books, maybe magazines.

488
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,820
 They're mostly known because not everybody knows this.

489
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:11,340
 They're mostly known for having video arcades.

490
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,060
 It's not like you're going to play Gallagher.

491
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,460
 You're not gonna play Dragon's Lair.

492
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,880
 There are usually these rooms that you go in.

493
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,240
 This is so archaic.

494
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,720
 It sounds so weird now.

495
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,240
 Still super popular.

496
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:32,360
 You pay $5 to go into the video arcade room and it's a booth with a television set and

497
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,680
 like a DVD player, VCR, whatever it is, streaming.

498
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,680
 I don't know.

499
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,880
 And then you watch porn in your own little booth.

500
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,480
 That's what the adult bookstores are for.

501
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,020
 It was a place so you could watch porn and you wouldn't have to worry about your wife

502
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,020
 finding out.

503
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:52,860
 Like in 1982 you go in there and you take some video tape, you stick it in there, you're

504
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,020
 taking tapes from home.

505
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,420
 You're like, "Finally I can watch Top Gun and Peace."

506
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,420
 You got your headphones on.

507
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,020
 You're like, "Hi, what are you doing?"

508
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,660
 No, you watch porn movies in this little...

509
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,540
 But that's not even what they're for.

510
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,540
 That's not even what it's for.

511
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,700
 That's what it is on paper.

512
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,100
 That's what the business is on paper.

513
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:14,440
 The truth behind adult bookstores, all of them, is that you don't buy books there.

514
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,440
 You can...

515
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,040
 A lot of people go there and buy sex toys, but even then, you know, you can buy the

516
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,000
 stuff online nowadays.

517
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,760
 People go there.

518
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,200
 Men, predominantly.

519
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,600
 Men go there not to watch porn in their own little booth.

520
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,600
 Disposies left.

521
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,120
 Disposies like, "Nope, I'm out.

522
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,120
 I know where this is going.

523
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,920
 I don't want to have anything to do with this."

524
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,120
 Flying the carbon helicopter away.

525
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,220
 You go to these adult bookstores to have sex with other dudes.

526
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:43,780
 So you can't call it "sex with other dudes" store.

527
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,860
 You have to call it an adult bookstore where there's no books.

528
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,860
 You have a booth.

529
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:48,860
 We're getting to ghost.

530
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,860
 There is...

531
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,860
 They were like, "Check in there and watch."

532
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,860
 I'm like, "Okay, Jason.

533
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,020
 When's the ghost showing up?

534
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,380
 The ghost will appear soon."

535
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:02,460
 You go into this booth to watch porn, but then there's like holes in the walls and

536
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:07,800
 other dudes are doing things and you're having sex with multiple people in these booths.

537
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:13,320
 Basically, you pay $5 to walk into a room to have anonymous sex with somebody.

538
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,080
 That's what an adult bookstore really is.

539
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,880
 So when you're driving down the road and you see an adult bookstore on the side of the

540
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,760
 road and everyone laughs and goes, "Hey, maybe we should go check one of those out."

541
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,760
 Just for laughs.

542
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,760
 Be very aware.

543
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,880
 You're walking into a place where people are randomly having sex.

544
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,660
 People are constantly coming and going and there's security cameras everywhere.

545
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:37,020
 So when your buddies are walking in, you're like, "Oh, this is going to be so much fun."

546
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:41,580
 Ten years later, when you're trying to become a local senator, just know that that videotape

547
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,980
 will show up.

548
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,620
 So midnight adult books.

549
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,620
 It's actually...

550
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:51,300
 This is super interesting because I really try to find out where this place was.

551
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:55,300
 Not because I'm like, "I need to do some on-the-ground research."

552
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,420
 It's because I'm trying to verify stuff.

553
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:01,560
 If you look for midnight adult books, there's actually two different addresses that pop

554
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,560
 up for it.

555
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,960
 And I don't know if it's still in existence, but it didn't turn into an Arby's or something

556
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,040
 like that.

557
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,520
 It seemed to have turned into another adult bookstore.

558
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,760
 It's either on Josephine Street in Garden Grove or Garden Grove Boulevard.

559
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,080
 But I have two options of what it could be.

560
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:25,200
 It could be Garden of Eden adult bookstore or Romantic's adult book and video.

561
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,500
 There's a lot of these stories in the area, apparently.

562
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,740
 When we talk about ghosts, we're always talking about emotional energy.

563
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,740
 And you figure...

564
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:39,980
 I think the idea that theaters are haunted, dance studios are haunted, those things always

565
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:43,320
 make sense because they're constantly generating so much energy.

566
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:48,540
 So you would imagine a place where people were having lots and lots of anonymous sex,

567
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,260
 probably cheating on their wives, right?

568
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,820
 They're going down to the adult bookstore.

569
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:57,200
 That must generate a ton of energy.

570
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,680
 A ton of emotional energy in these places.

571
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:04,160
 You walk into this room and there's a television set there, but you're not worried about that

572
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,880
 because two or three guys are coming in.

573
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:12,480
 I found a website where people review these adult bookstores.

574
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,120
 And I've really questioned about whether or not I can actually put in the show notes

575
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:20,000
 because apparently I found out recently that even the stuff in your show notes...

576
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 YouTube did that to me once.

577
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,820
 Stuff I had in my show notes, YouTube tried shutting my channel down.

578
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:29,300
 But there's a website where they review cruising spots, places to go.

579
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:37,300
 And when you read reviews of Romantics Bookstore, a guy's like, "Yeah, it was really cool.

580
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:41,540
 I was in this room and I got raped by three dudes."

581
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:44,380
 And you're like, "That's not cool.

582
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,940
 I mean, it's not...

583
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,940
 That's...

584
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,740
 I don't know what people are into this day, but that's not cool, right?"

585
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,120
 And it's awful.

586
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,480
 It sounded awful even by his description.

587
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,400
 It sounded absolutely terrible.

588
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,200
 It sounded absolutely terrifying.

589
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,280
 And that's a guy who left a review.

590
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,040
 That's a guy who left a review.

591
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:08,600
 That's a guy who's like, "I think he actually gave it four stars."

592
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,960
 So you can imagine the people who go there and it's not good.

593
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,960
 It's not good.

594
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,960
 He was totally...

595
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,800
 He was like, "I didn't expect it, but it happened.

596
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,180
 Four out of five stars.

597
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,180
 Absolutely bizarre."

598
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:27,100
 So you can imagine the type of emotional energy that's floating around this area.

599
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,700
 Midnight Adult Bookstore.

600
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:33,740
 Whether now it's Garden of Eden Adult Bookstore or Romantics Adult Book and Video, it's one

601
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,620
 of the two.

602
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,620
 It's haunted.

603
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,580
 I mean, shouldn't surprise anyone with everything that I've been talking about.

604
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,220
 Shouldn't surprise anyone.

605
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,220
 Apparently, this place used to be a nightclub.

606
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,880
 So before it was an adult video bookstore, people would go there to dance and hang out

607
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,000
 and do blow and whatever.

608
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,720
 And that's kind of what happened was there was a drug deal gone bad in this nightclub.

609
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,280
 And a man was stabbed to death.

610
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,280
 "Ohh!

611
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,600
 Sorry, sorry, the drug deal didn't go good.

612
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,160
 That's how they're supposed to go.

613
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,040
 And he died."

614
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,920
 And when the nightclub was torn down, or when the nightclub stopped operating there, I'm

615
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,420
 assuming they just used the same building.

616
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,780
 And it became midnight adult books and video.

617
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,940
 A man, like late at night, maybe in the afternoon.

618
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,900
 I don't know if they didn't specify time.

619
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:24,340
 I imagine the spookiest time at night in adult bookstories in the middle of the night.

620
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:30,740
 The clerks who would be working there would see a man in a cowboy hat walking around.

621
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:35,100
 And then he would walk into a booth.

622
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,660
 So remember we had that video arcade booth thing.

623
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,900
 He would walk into a booth.

624
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:43,680
 And that the staff knew was occupied.

625
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:48,520
 Now officially the rule is that you're not supposed to have sex there.

626
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,760
 Because it's illegal.

627
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,920
 It's having sex in public.

628
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,520
 It's actually illegal.

629
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,600
 Cops will sting these places every once in a while.

630
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,600
 They'll go undercover.

631
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,480
 They're like, "Oh man, do I have to do that?

632
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,040
 I just read the reviews on this place.

633
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,040
 This place is horrible.

634
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,560
 Johnson, you're the new...

635
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,120
 Plus, first off, you're Officer Johnson.

636
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,120
 You have to go.

637
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,400
 But secondly, you go down there.

638
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,560
 You're the newest one on the force.

639
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,180
 You go down there, you're undercover.

640
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,620
 And when someone tries having sex with you, you go, "Stop.

641
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,620
 Police.

642
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,180
 You're under arrest."

643
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,020
 So because you're not supposed to do it, it's sex in public.

644
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:21,380
 So officially these businesses aren't supposed to let you have sex in their little tiny disgusting

645
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,380
 rooms.

646
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,180
 You're supposed to get a hotel room across the street.

647
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:31,220
 So when a staff member sees two people in a booth, you have to break it off.

648
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,860
 That sounds like a resume for PTSD.

649
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,780
 How much do these clerks get paid?

650
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:40,440
 Could you imagine sitting there late at night, you see a guy go in a booth and another five

651
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,240
 minutes pass, another guy goes in the same booth, you're like, "Aw, man, you would have

652
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,280
 to work in a place with horse binders."

653
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,560
 Because otherwise it's like trying to separate two ladybugs who are having sex.

654
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,400
 These dudes are here to have sex.

655
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,080
 You're going to walk into this tiny booth and be like, "No, stop it.

656
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,080
 Stop it."

657
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,080
 But that's the rule.

658
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,080
 That's the law.

659
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,200
 They're supposed to stop the sex.

660
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,120
 The clerks have to stop the sex.

661
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,080
 So when they would see...

662
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,760
 And I'm assuming that people are sneaky about this.

663
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,140
 But this cowboy man would always be seen.

664
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,140
 He would never walk into a booth that was unoccupied.

665
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,700
 He would walk into a booth that was occupied.

666
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:18,620
 But when the clerk would go in and open the door and said, "Guys, you can't do it."

667
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:24,700
 You would just find, instead of finding the cowboy and a man, you would just find a man

668
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,420
 watching porn.

669
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,180
 And the clerk would be like, "What?

670
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,180
 Oh, no."

671
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,780
 And the dude's like, "I paid $5.

672
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:34,380
 Can you at least shut the door?"

673
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,380
 So yeah.

674
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,380
 You watch this.

675
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,380
 That's the ghost story?

676
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,380
 That's the ghost story?

677
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,080
 Yeah, it is the ghost story.

678
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:45,280
 But I find it super fascinating because why would the ghost...

679
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,200
 The ghost can go anywhere, right?

680
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,200
 The ghost is in the porn store.

681
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,000
 It's always going into a booth that's occupied.

682
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,760
 Which in my mind makes me think the ghost is trying to have sex with these dudes.

683
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:03,000
 The ghost is constantly trying to go into a room with another person and the staff has

684
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,640
 to go and break it up.

685
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,640
 But it finds out there's only one person in the booth.

686
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,660
 So this ghost wants sex.

687
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,220
 This ghost wants to have sex with dudes.

688
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:18,740
 And I'm wondering, the guy in the booth, does he see anything?

689
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,440
 Actually, that's actually...

690
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:26,620
 That kind of blows my mind now that I'm thinking about it because from what I gather from the

691
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:32,220
 one paragraph that actually is the story on theshadowlands.net, it's basically like a

692
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,220
 paragraph.

693
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:36,840
 I had to tell you what an adult bookstore was in the first place, but it says that the

694
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:42,480
 staff sees the man in the cowboy hat enter the booth that's already occupied.

695
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:48,480
 But if you're sitting there at your workstation, you're at a porn store, and you turn and you

696
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,480
 see a man in a cowboy hat, phase through the door.

697
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,600
 Like he actually walks through the door like it's not there like a ghost does.

698
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,320
 You wouldn't be like, "Oh, that must be a real biological human.

699
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,440
 I need to go stop him."

700
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:06,700
 You would look, you would see a cowboy through a door and you'd be like, "Ah, it's the ghost."

701
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:10,300
 And then you would just go back to reading your magazine or playing with your phone,

702
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,300
 right?

703
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:19,020
 To actually be confused that this was a real person, he would have to open the door of

704
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,580
 the adult video store.

705
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:26,300
 But the guy in the room, the guy who's currently pleasing himself while he's watching this

706
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:31,000
 porn, he didn't notice the door opened.

707
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,080
 He didn't notice anything.

708
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:38,760
 So is the ghost creating some sort of optical illusion for the worker?

709
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,680
 Like does he actually see the door open or does he phase through the door?

710
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,840
 Does the guy in the booth, does the door open or is he just so entranced by whatever video

711
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,840
 he's watching?

712
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,840
 He doesn't notice the door open?

713
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,840
 I don't know.

714
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,840
 I don't know.

715
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,840
 It doesn't say any of that.

716
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,840
 It doesn't say any of that.

717
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,840
 It doesn't say any of that.

718
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,140
 It doesn't say any of that.

719
00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:01,300
 It's literally just a paragraph that says when the guy walks in, then he disappears.

720
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:08,300
 But I think the point of all of this is, ghosts must constantly be wanting to have sex.

721
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:14,300
 I imagine because it's such a, and you could say, "Well, Jase, sex is a physical sensation,

722
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,300
 right?

723
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,300
 Sex is a physical sensation.

724
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,500
 So why would something without a physical body want to do it?"

725
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:23,560
 Yeah, but ghosts are always screaming in pain and stuff like that and covered in blood,

726
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,480
 calling for their mom and stuff like that.

727
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,560
 Little kids like appearing in your closet going, "Where's my mommy?

728
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,880
 Where's my mommy?"

729
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,080
 So I mean, they at least missed their moms, right?

730
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,160
 They at least missed their moms.

731
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,160
 But forget that one.

732
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,160
 That was an weird example.

733
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,800
 But if they're covered in blood or they're screaming in pain, then there is still some

734
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,680
 connection to the physical.

735
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,200
 There's still some connection to the physical.

736
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,920
 So you would also think that these guys must constantly be wanting to have sex because

737
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,980
 it's the one thing you can't do as a ghost.

738
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,620
 That and I don't know, probably play basketball.

739
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:56,220
 There's actually probably millions of things you can't do as a ghost.

740
00:39:56,220 --> 00:40:02,340
 But sex is the one thing that everyone thinks about at least some of the time, right?

741
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:06,700
 And then is engaging in at least some of the time and you just go on and on.

742
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:11,340
 Whether you're with a partner or you're headed down to the local adult bookstore, and especially

743
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:15,700
 again, like these people, that's what they're there for.

744
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:19,840
 They're there for quick, dirty, anonymous sex.

745
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,480
 So the energy just must be like flipping around in there.

746
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,440
 The emotional energy, you're in there, you have anonymous sex with three dudes, you're

747
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,320
 pulling up your phone to rate it four out of five stars.

748
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,520
 And then you're thinking, "Oh, dude, I hope my wife doesn't find out."

749
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:41,040
 Like all of that emotional energy just being deposited into these rooms over and over and

750
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,520
 over and over and over again for decades.

751
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,380
 This place must actually be a hot spot.

752
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:50,380
 I'm basically saying I want to see Zach Baggins or the Ghost Adventures head on down.

753
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:56,420
 I want to see Taps at an adult bookstore with all their EVP readers asking, "Is anyone there?"

754
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:59,260
 You're going to knock on the wall, you're going to knock on the wall and you're like,

755
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,620
 "Oh, I don't want to look over there.

756
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:03,020
 I know something's poking out of that hole."

757
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:06,740
 Yeah, I do think that ghosts must always want to have sex.

758
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:11,400
 And maybe these are good places to check out because you can go to all the haunted asylums

759
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,660
 and haunted dance studios and graveyards that you want.

760
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:19,900
 But a place that's open 24 hours a day where people are constantly having sweaty, sweaty

761
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:25,860
 sex, anonymous dirty sex in these rooms, it has to generate a lot of energy.

762
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:29,620
 And if you are a ghost, especially if you were a ghost that was killed there, it would

763
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,500
 be the perfect place to manifest.

764
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,420
 You're actually feeding off all of that energy.

765
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:37,460
 So do ghosts want to have sex?

766
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:43,920
 Is being dead the shut off valve to actually wanting to do the dirty?

767
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,840
 I do think that maybe ghost hunters should stop going to the abandoned spooky house on

768
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:58,200
 the edge of town and instead going into the inner city adult bookstores to find ghosts.

769
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:04,000
 Even if they don't catch an EVP, even if they don't see a full body apparition, I can almost

770
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:11,340
 guarantee that any room they go into, they will find a lot of ectoplasm.
