1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,440
 What happens when the country of Sweden is shown a commercial on how to make a taco?

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,120
 And then we travel to Nigeria to take a look at a story that's so bizarre I had trouble

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,280
 believing it was actually real.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,880
 But it is.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,360
 When several kids go missing in the town of Ibadan, the local population is tired of the

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,280
 police in action.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,680
 So they form a mob and head off into the woods.

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,680
 What they find terrifies the nation.

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,680
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:40,040
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,040
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,040
 I'm having a great day.

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,400
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,560
 I hope you guys are having lots of fun doing whatever you guys are doing.

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,040
 We got a ton of stuff to cover so we're gonna jump right into it.

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,800
 Also gotta say this is halfway through the season.

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,440
 This is usually when stuff kinda gets discombobulated.

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,720
 It's really bad on the back end here.

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,120
 I have a supporter but I don't know how they supported the show.

20
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,440
 I don't even know if this is a note that I wrote.

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,320
 If this is an actual person, it's just in my list of people to thank.

22
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,320
 So it's like, what?

23
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,440
 That's super weird.

24
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,400
 So give a round of applause for an idea guy.

25
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,760
 An idea guy is floating in on a giant thinking light bulb.

26
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,760
 It's like above his head and he's floating on it like a balloon and he's like I have

27
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,760
 no idea why I'm here.

28
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,520
 I was like open you did.

29
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,520
 You're in my notes.

30
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,440
 He's like I think I supported the show in some way.

31
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,440
 He is a show supporter.

32
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,440
 I think I have no idea.

33
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:40,360
 He's just in my notes but I would rather err on the side of caution and give idea guy

34
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,840
 a little tip of the hat than just ignore him completely.

35
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,840
 I just don't know.

36
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,440
 I put my hands on his shoulder.

37
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,840
 I don't know why you're here too.

38
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,680
 I don't know why you're here.

39
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,680
 But you are here.

40
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,680
 You are our guest of honor.

41
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,360
 You're gonna be our pilot, our captain this episode.

42
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,120
 If you guys can't support the show in any way however this dude did, whatever he did

43
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,040
 to support the show, maybe he did a live stream donation.

44
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,680
 I'm not for sure.

45
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,440
 But you can do that too.

46
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,080
 You can do something that I'm not for sure of either.

47
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,200
 Or you can help spread the word about the show.

48
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,200
 Really really helps out a lot.

49
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,080
 We're gonna start doing the flyers again.

50
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,760
 Now that society is starting to reopen up, we're gonna start putting flyers up.

51
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,640
 So that's a good way to spread the word about the show.

52
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:23,280
 You can go to deadrabbit.com or in the show notes there will be flyers in there once again.

53
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,800
 I'm gonna toss you the controls for the hair hang glider.

54
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:33,160
 We're gonna take a nice leisurely journey from deadrabbit command all the way out to

55
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,320
 Sweden.

56
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:40,320
 And as we're headed out there, go ahead and hit that little button on the left.

57
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,640
 That's our time travel button.

58
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,640
 We're going back to the year 1990.

59
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:52,360
 Apparently the three stooches are in charge of the time vortex.

60
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,640
 I got all of my information for this story from an article on Atlas Obscura's website

61
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,120
 written by Barbara Woolsey.

62
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,560
 So tip of the hat to you Barbara.

63
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,560
 At least I know what she did.

64
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,000
 I know what she did for the episode.

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,600
 Sorry idea guy.

66
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,800
 But I want to give credit to the journalists who do all this digging up.

67
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,600
 This story is weird.

68
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,480
 The story is weird and it doesn't actually, it's not like weird of the fact that don't

69
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,960
 expect a goblin to show up at any point in this story.

70
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
 It's just weird.

71
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,040
 It's just off weird and it kind of ends weird as well.

72
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,040
 But it's a good taste.

73
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,640
 It's a good little nibble because the next story is super disgusting.

74
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,760
 The next story is pretty dark.

75
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,760
 So I wanted to start off with something delicious and light.

76
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,760
 The year is 1990.

77
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,360
 This is gonna blow your minds bigger than any goblin.

78
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,920
 Cause when I tell people this in real life they're like what?

79
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,880
 In the year 1990 in the country of Sweden two things were happening.

80
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:53,000
 One, the economy was starting to pick up, people had money to burn and 1990 was the

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,120
 very first year that commercials were allowed on television.

82
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,240
 Isn't that weird?

83
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,820
 Could you imagine growing up, I don't know maybe you're a 90's kid but I can't imagine

84
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,820
 life without commercials.

85
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,820
 I love commercials.

86
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,640
 I actually really enjoy commercials and I miss them now that I'm obviously if I'm waiting

87
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,360
 for the show I'm like come on, come on, come on.

88
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,400
 I want to skip past them but when you don't have commercials and you grow up around commercials

89
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,160
 I've watched YouTube videos that were just commercials from the 80's and 90's.

90
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,160
 Like kids commercials.

91
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,000
 I wasn't watching commercials for law attorneys.

92
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 But I think even that would be interesting.

93
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,560
 Zimmer Jewelers and all that stuff.

94
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,560
 I love commercials.

95
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,560
 I love marketing.

96
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,560
 I love the whole science behind it.

97
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,360
 But they didn't have any commercials on television until 1990 in Sweden.

98
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,200
 So basically for the first thing you could see commercials in like movie theaters but

99
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,400
 other than that you didn't see them.

100
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,360
 So now for the very first time people are starting to see these commercials on their

101
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,360
 television.

102
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,280
 And there was a brand of chips called OLW.

103
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,280
 They're still around.

104
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,320
 But it's just like potato chips.

105
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,720
 And they came out with a commercial saying "Now it's cozy Friday time."

106
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,200
 I don't know exactly what it sounded like.

107
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,160
 I tried looking for the ad.

108
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,600
 But it was a really catchy tune and it apparently played all the time and it was brand new.

109
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,520
 People weren't used to commercials.

110
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,760
 So when this commercial popped up "Now it's cozy Friday time" and it was pictures and

111
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,780
 video of people eating chips.

112
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,080
 People go "Hey you know what?

113
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,080
 That actually sounds good.

114
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,580
 We already have Fridays.

115
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,520
 These dates already exist."

116
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,760
 The one thing it was missing was how cozy they were.

117
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:36,760
 So a new phenomenon catches on called Fredgisms.

118
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:41,160
 Which means if you pronounce it correctly means cozy Friday.

119
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,760
 From this ad, from this advertisement, a whole new cultural moment started.

120
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,000
 Every Friday you wear your pajamas.

121
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,720
 People are like "That wasn't in the ad?

122
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,720
 What are you talking about?

123
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,040
 We don't make pajamas."

124
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,640
 You wear your pajamas or in winter you wear thermals.

125
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,600
 And you spend Friday just sitting there eating chips.

126
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,160
 And then it became any processed food.

127
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,160
 Junk food.

128
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,160
 You sit there.

129
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,720
 Eat it.

130
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,080
 Watch television with your family in your pajamas.

131
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,600
 It's cozy Friday.

132
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,600
 It's Fredgisms.

133
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:18,160
 No that sounds like actually Fred in the corner is like "Oh yeah."

134
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,640
 Fredgisms.

135
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,800
 So Old El Paso Salsa is watching this from America.

136
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,800
 They're sitting in a boardroom in Texas and they're like "Oh we want in on this cozy

137
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,800
 Friday thing."

138
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,400
 And it's funny because that might sound like an exaggeration but it might be.

139
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,680
 I don't think they were hitting their fist with their hands.

140
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,920
 But apparently I don't get this.

141
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,800
 Old El Paso had been eyeing Sweden for years.

142
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,240
 The salsa company and they make taco shells and things like that.

143
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,360
 They go "We want in this" for whatever reason.

144
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,360
 It's just a country right?

145
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,640
 Have they dominated the rest of the globe with Sweden the one country they couldn't break

146
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,640
 into?

147
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,640
 We want this country.

148
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,040
 They've been trying for years to get their product into Sweden.

149
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,960
 They go "I have an idea."

150
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,760
 They begin airing a commercial.

151
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,560
 It's a very simple commercial.

152
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,560
 How to make a taco.

153
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,400
 Get an Old El Paso Shell.

154
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,840
 Get a new shell but the brand is Old El Paso.

155
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,840
 Get a shell.

156
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,560
 Put in the meat.

157
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,560
 Put in the cheese.

158
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,760
 And people are like "Whoa honey honey honey come here quick quick quick.

159
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,360
 What's going on Roger?"

160
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,000
 Look at this bizarre food because they weren't eating tacos.

161
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,520
 I'm sure the occasional person like an exchange student was like "Dude went over there and

162
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,520
 there food.

163
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,240
 It's like in a shell and you can eat it.

164
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,360
 What are you doing eating turtles?"

165
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,440
 But it was a brand new exotic food.

166
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,000
 And I guess in Sweden they're really used to the smorgi borg style.

167
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,920
 So you have this thing.

168
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,680
 You have this commercial "How to Make a Taco" and people are like "It's blowing people's

169
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,180
 minds."

170
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:53,600
 So that becomes mixed with Cozy Friday and to this day you have Taco Friday in Sweden.

171
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,840
 It's a national thing.

172
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,880
 Every Friday you wear your pajamas.

173
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,880
 You go to work.

174
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,840
 We have Casual Friday in America over there.

175
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,840
 It's Taco Friday.

176
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,840
 You go to work in your pajamas.

177
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,840
 Hopefully you're not a garbage man.

178
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,040
 You're all super cold outside.

179
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,360
 You wear your pajamas.

180
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,720
 You eat tacos now and also processed food.

181
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,480
 You have a bag of chips.

182
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,720
 Eat tacos.

183
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,000
 You had other Swedish companies getting on the business.

184
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,320
 They're selling Mexican spices to spice everything up.

185
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,880
 And then they're putting their own twist on it.

186
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,040
 They go "You know what?

187
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,200
 Tacos are delicious because tacos are delicious.

188
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,200
 How can we make them gross?

189
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,160
 How can we make them so Jason won't eat them?"

190
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,480
 So because they have this big smorguebork style they'll include cucumbers.

191
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,160
 I guess that's a big thing in Sweden.

192
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,960
 A lot of times there's just cucumbers sitting on the table and the kids are just eating

193
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,960
 it.

194
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,160
 They're constantly like pickling it.

195
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,640
 Which I guess it's a pickle then.

196
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,160
 But they're like dicing it and eating it and all that sort of gross stuff.

197
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,640
 They'll put cucumber in their tacos.

198
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,880
 They'll put peanuts in their tacos.

199
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,600
 Which sounds like a cruel trick.

200
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,200
 The taco, the crunchiest part, should be the shell.

201
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,080
 If I bit into a taco and I bit into a peanut I would assume it was a human tooth.

202
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,040
 And I was Superman and I could bite through human teeth.

203
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,040
 It would be quite shocking.

204
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,560
 They'll put pineapples in it which actually sounds pretty good.

205
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,280
 Then they put yogurt in it.

206
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,760
 I'm thinking that's a translation.

207
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,720
 They're grabbing like "Hey can you do honey?

208
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,920
 Can you have me some of that strawberry yule play?"

209
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:24,560
 I'm assuming in Sweden yogurt means something not totally disgusting to put on a taco.

210
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,240
 And they've made taco pizzas.

211
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,240
 Taco pies?

212
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,720
 You can buy a frozen taco pie from the store.

213
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,920
 And it's such a national thing.

214
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,160
 Stores, what are you chasing?

215
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,480
 What are you, a tourist board now?

216
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,360
 Stores on Fridays will sell discount taco stuff.

217
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,360
 Restaurants.

218
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,360
 You go on a restaurant to tacos please.

219
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,720
 Tacos are on sale on Fridays.

220
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,480
 And I guess in Sweden they have free lunches for the kids.

221
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,360
 It's tacos on Friday.

222
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,560
 So whether or not you like tacos or eating tacos on Friday, who doesn't like tacos?

223
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:02,720
 Because of these two commercials, because of Cozy Friday and How to Make a Taco, Sweden

224
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,280
 is the number one consumer of Mexican food in all of Europe.

225
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,840
 Number two is Norway.

226
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,840
 They also have Taco Friday.

227
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,480
 They also have a tradition like this where they're making tacos every Friday.

228
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,440
 I think it's just a weird story that's it.

229
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,440
 No goblins show up.

230
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,440
 But it's a weird cultural story to think.

231
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,560
 One, it boggles my mind to think no advertisement until 1990.

232
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,840
 It completely would reshape my childhood.

233
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,600
 Because Transformers, all those cartoons are basically giant ads.

234
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,760
 I don't even know if those existed.

235
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,600
 But yeah, I grew up with advertisements.

236
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,480
 I look forward every, at the beginning of each month, they would debut the, I used to

237
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,800
 want to go into marketing.

238
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,040
 It was actually like, I remember I wanted to be a journalist or work in advertising.

239
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,800
 I think it would be amazing.

240
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,240
 I think that part is the equivalent of a goblin to me.

241
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,520
 And then the fact that just a two ads, you had other, like I said, you had a really popular

242
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:01,160
 spice company that jumped on the bad wagon and they started making tortillas and they

243
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,320
 were really pushing as well.

244
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,640
 But basically from two advertisements, you created a cultural phenomenon.

245
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,680
 In America we had where's the beef, but it was like a joke.

246
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,960
 People weren't actually curious as to where the beef was.

247
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,760
 It was just a joke people would tell.

248
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,800
 And it was never a funny joke.

249
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,480
 But this one actually changed society.

250
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,560
 So yeah, it's just a weird cultural story, a little artifact.

251
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,360
 And if tacos aren't your thing, if you're allergic to flour and meat and cheese and

252
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,720
 lettuce, I don't know how you're still alive.

253
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,120
 I don't know what you eat.

254
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:39,960
 But just in case, on Saturday they have Lorde Godus, which means Saturday sweets.

255
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:45,960
 And they just sit around and eat sweets.

256
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,000
 They eat processed food on Fridays and sweets on Saturdays.

257
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,680
 And some killjoy was like, "Hey, isn't this not healthy?

258
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,120
 Shouldn't you not have a tradition where you eat processed food every Friday?"

259
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,400
 Because it has to be processed.

260
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,440
 They don't like homemade tortillas.

261
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,880
 They buy it from the store.

262
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,040
 And people go, "Yeah, it's super unhealthy for the body, but it's healthy for the society."

263
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,280
 Because it brings everyone together, no matter what you're doing.

264
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,280
 Your son's addicted to heroin.

265
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,000
 You're addicted to tacos.

266
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,240
 But you can both come together and have taco Friday.

267
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,080
 No matter what's going on, burglars or being jays with cops and then the clock strikes

268
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,520
 midnight and all of a sudden it's Friday morning they both sit down and eat tacos.

269
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,320
 It brings societies together.

270
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,120
 Idea guy, let's go ahead and call in that carbonicopter.

271
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,960
 We're going to wave goodbye to Sweden.

272
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:35,160
 But of course, dude, we got a full taco buffet going on in the carbonicopter.

273
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,000
 Idea guy's like, "Can I have some?"

274
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,040
 We're like, "No, dude, you can't fly and eat at the same time.

275
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,040
 Oh, this is so good.

276
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,280
 We're eating all the food.

277
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,600
 A little teardrop's coming out of idea guy."

278
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,160
 He's like, "Dude, you don't even remember why I'm on the show and now you won't feed

279
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,160
 me."

280
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,680
 Don't worry, we're going to save you the best.

281
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,880
 I'm going to personally make you the best taco ever for when we land.

282
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,480
 So fly us on out to Nigeria.

283
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:07,000
 Eating tacos, doing an ASMR podcast all of a sudden.

284
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,720
 We are in Nigeria.

285
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,120
 I'm going to toss Idea guy the most perfect taco, a whole plate of perfect tacos.

286
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:20,160
 You can munch on those as we're walking through the streets of Ibadan that's an Oyo state

287
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,840
 in Nigeria.

288
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,000
 It's March 22, 2014.

289
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,600
 And outside of Ibadan, but not too far away, is a location known as Soka Forest.

290
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,800
 This is not the forest from Wrong Turn.

291
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,400
 This is not Camp Crystal Lake.

292
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,920
 Although it will mimic those very, very quickly.

293
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,800
 It's not some far off destination.

294
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,160
 It's basically like off the freeway.

295
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,440
 You can see this forest as you're driving down major roads.

296
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:53,200
 And for years, people would say, locals would say, people are getting kidnapped and they're

297
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,400
 getting taken to the forest.

298
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,640
 And for years, they'd make reports to the police.

299
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,160
 And for years, the police would go, "Listen, here's what's going on."

300
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,160
 That's not true.

301
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,760
 They're not being kidnapped.

302
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,680
 I know, I used to have a son.

303
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,760
 He's not here anymore and the cops are like rolling his eyes.

304
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,040
 He's like, "A son, uh-huh."

305
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,160
 And they're not getting kidnapped.

306
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,360
 That's a local legend.

307
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,040
 Two, sometimes the police would say, that's not my jurisdiction.

308
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,040
 Like look at my badge.

309
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,040
 I'm a city cop.

310
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,040
 That's in the forest.

311
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,040
 You need to go find a forest cop.

312
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,040
 They're like, "Do those exist?"

313
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,520
 He's like, "It may be."

314
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,200
 But I'm not in charge of the forest.

315
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,840
 And then three, sometimes they would say, "Listen, people aren't kidnapped out there, but I

316
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,640
 know that every so often someone sees a weird figure walking around.

317
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,480
 There's a rehabilitation center out there.

318
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,480
 So like destitutes is the word I kept seeing in these news articles.

319
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,680
 This is not rumored.

320
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,640
 This was heavily reported in the news.

321
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,920
 Destitutes are taken out there and it's like a rehab center.

322
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,040
 So that might be a term for like drug addicts or drunkards or hobos.

323
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,040
 Who knows?

324
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,200
 But that is what this place is talking about.

325
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,160
 March 22nd, 2014 though, the people have had enough.

326
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,280
 Really to be specific, it was a group of people had enough.

327
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,120
 They were motorcycle riders.

328
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,280
 They weren't like dirt cross riders.

329
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,120
 "Hey Jimmy, where's the track at?"

330
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,880
 "At Soka Forest, bro."

331
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,320
 They wore taxi cab drivers, but they used their bikes as the taxi.

332
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,880
 And recently, three of them had gone missing.

333
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,520
 And the taxi cab riders, they all knew where the guys were.

334
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,840
 They had to be at Soka Forest.

335
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,840
 Nobody could find them.

336
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,720
 People had been disappearing in Soka Forest for so long.

337
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,320
 The police weren't doing anything.

338
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,520
 We gotta do something about it.

339
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,880
 So they straight up goonied this.

340
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:44,520
 They got a hundred dudes on their bikes and they drove into the forest.

341
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,400
 Could you imagine the sound of a hundred motorcycles coming at you?

342
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,400
 You're in the forest.

343
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:53,600
 You're just a squirrel hanging out, trying to get a nut, and then all of a sudden a hundred

344
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,520
 motorcycles powering through the forest.

345
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,360
 But what are they going to find?

346
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,240
 What would you think you're going to find?

347
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,520
 You hear a story of people missing in the area, three of your buddies go missing.

348
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
 Let's go out to the forest.

349
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,520
 They have to be out there.

350
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,560
 What do you think you're going to find?

351
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,080
 Because this forest isn't in the middle of nowhere, and even forests in the middle of

352
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,200
 nowhere have these, there's buildings.

353
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,160
 There's like warehouses dotting the edge of the forest.

354
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,560
 And that's where they're going.

355
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,360
 They figure we're just going to go ask some questions.

356
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,360
 And as they're driving their motorcycles through the forest approaching these warehouses, they

357
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,480
 do see a security team out there.

358
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,440
 So maybe the stories of it being a rehabilitation center are true.

359
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,520
 But chaos erupts.

360
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:45,220
 When as these motorcycle riders are going through the forest, they begin seeing human

361
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,760
 skulls laying on the ground.

362
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:56,680
 There were 20 decaying bodies, full bodies of people littering the property in the forest

363
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,040
 and around the warehouse, 20 corpses.

364
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:09,000
 And depending on the article, 50 to over 100 human skulls littering the property as well.

365
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,720
 This isn't a missing persons.

366
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,460
 Maybe people are being kidnapped and sold into trafficking or something like that.

367
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:21,640
 This is mass murder, mass serial killing in the year 2014.

368
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,160
 They begin attacking the security people at the warehouse.

369
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,440
 They believe these guys have to have something to do with not only their missing friends,

370
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,440
 but all of the…

371
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,440
 How would you not?

372
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,240
 How would you not if you went over to your buddy's house?

373
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,240
 Hey man, what's up?

374
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,240
 I have a question.

375
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,440
 Do you have anything to do with the 20 corpses littering your yard?

376
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,000
 And your buddy's like, no, no, no, I just run a rehabilitation center.

377
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,960
 You'd be like, what are you rehabilitating them from being alive basically?

378
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,680
 But the security personnel is saying that.

379
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,000
 We run a rehabilitation center.

380
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,800
 We don't know about those bodies, right?

381
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,400
 They were there when we got here.

382
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,840
 At this point the motorcycle riders are calling the police.

383
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,400
 And even locals are getting all these phone calls.

384
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,320
 People are pouring out of their houses and headed down the street because their brothers,

385
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,240
 their sons are telling them, you won't believe what we found in this forest.

386
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,760
 There's bodies everywhere.

387
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:15,400
 They begin getting phone calls as well from one of their missing friends saying, help me,

388
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,400
 I'm trapped in the basement.

389
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,480
 I'm trapped in the basement.

390
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,480
 I can hear you guys up there, help me.

391
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,360
 I don't know why he wasn't calling earlier and be like, hey guys, sorry, you haven't

392
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,360
 seen me in a while.

393
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,360
 I'm in a basement.

394
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,360
 The kids are trying to get into the warehouse.

395
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,320
 And security personnel is holding them back.

396
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,440
 And there's actually shots are being fired.

397
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,440
 Innocent people are getting shot.

398
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,360
 There was a pregnant woman walking down the street.

399
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,280
 She got shot by a security personnel because she was headed to the scene.

400
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,280
 She didn't die.

401
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,280
 She just got wounded.

402
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,680
 Baby was fine.

403
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,680
 The security were trying to basically shoe them off and they were beating these kids up.

404
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,000
 They were basically defending their property.

405
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,360
 The motorcycle riders, the young kids, they're all like in their teenagers college age, they

406
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,600
 said, these guys are actual serial killers.

407
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,920
 They weren't holding back.

408
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,400
 They grabbed a guy and burned him alive.

409
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,280
 They saw another guy like run out of the woods and he was talking on his phone.

410
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,880
 He's like, don't come here, guys.

411
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,160
 Don't come here.

412
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,360
 And they thought that meant he was part of the conspiracy.

413
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,080
 They burned him alive as well.

414
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,320
 So you have this, you have like vigilante action.

415
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,400
 You have security personnel.

416
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,400
 They were armed.

417
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,920
 They had everything from guns to bows and machetes.

418
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,920
 They're fighting.

419
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,480
 The police are trying to get into the middle of this.

420
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,000
 They really don't want to though because it's just so violent.

421
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,560
 The youths get pushed back from the place and then they decide to just begin slaughtering

422
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,600
 local farmers' cows.

423
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,880
 Again, this was not in the middle of nowhere.

424
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,600
 There was farms next to this because they figured there is no way these farmers did

425
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,160
 not know about this.

426
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,020
 You could smell the bodies when you were this close.

427
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,720
 If you're grazing cattle, you knew this.

428
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,720
 So in retaliation, they began killing cows and they were calling out the farmers, "You're

429
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,720
 part of this too.

430
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,720
 We're going to kill you."

431
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,000
 And a couple of them actually were able to breach the perimeter and wanted to get into

432
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,480
 the basement of this warehouse.

433
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:10,960
 There's photos of the aftermath of this.

434
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,280
 And I said on a recent episode, I don't like watching, looking at Gore photos because I've

435
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,320
 seen enough of it in real life.

436
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,580
 I run into them every so often when I'm researching true crime.

437
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,180
 I'm scrolling through this article.

438
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:26,300
 There was like 15 different articles that I was reading on this thing.

439
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,340
 And there's a photo of a couple bodies and I was like, "Oh, great."

440
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,660
 And then I realized these weren't decomposing people.

441
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,820
 These were the survivors.

442
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:43,260
 In all, after the police were able to separate and were able to safely get into the building

443
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,800
 that the security personnel were guarding and was saying was a rehabilitation center,

444
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,160
 they rescued 20 people.

445
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,040
 Some of them looked like they had been starving.

446
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,840
 Some of them looked like they were about to die.

447
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,160
 This photo was of two people laying on the ground.

448
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,680
 One of them, you could see the full skeleton of the guy.

449
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,320
 He was the survivor.

450
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,320
 One woman, because they got there, the 20 people, they were all taken to the hospital.

451
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,160
 Bunch of people were arrested.

452
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,780
 The youths, actually a lot of them went home, you know, because they burned a couple people

453
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,780
 to death.

454
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,080
 You don't want to get caught for that.

455
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,620
 Some of them were trying to go through the warehouse and find the access to the basement.

456
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,060
 The police were like, "There is no basement."

457
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:29,500
 The kindly owner who owns this building full of these people informed us there is no basement

458
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,100
 and they would not take no for an answer.

459
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:37,660
 They actually began trying to dig into and around the warehouse to see what's underneath

460
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,660
 it.

461
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,860
 The police had to beat them away.

462
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,860
 Beat them back.

463
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,880
 Wouldn't let them dig to see if there was a basement.

464
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,200
 But as the police, all of these 20 people, they were taken to the hospital.

465
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,520
 And of course, they were interviewed a couple days later, like, "What happened?

466
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,720
 What was actually going on here?"

467
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,720
 Because they were still saying this is a rehabilitation center.

468
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,120
 There was one woman.

469
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,080
 She said, "Back in September 2013, I remember I was leaving my house and I was walking out

470
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,360
 to my car.

471
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,720
 And then you guys came through the door.

472
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,540
 And there was a bunch of kids with shovels trying to get into the floor.

473
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,100
 And people were talking about rehabilitation center.

474
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,100
 That's all I remember."

475
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,340
 And the police go, "Okay, you got kidnapped in September of 2013.

476
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,080
 It's March 2014.

477
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,100
 You don't remember anything else."

478
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,740
 She goes, "No."

479
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,700
 Isn't that so creepy?

480
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,420
 They go, "Did you see people getting murdered?"

481
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:38,620
 She goes, "I can faintly remember people who were in captivity with us.

482
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,120
 Leaving and never coming back."

483
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,040
 She goes, "I don't know what happened to them.

484
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,720
 It was like a dream.

485
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,400
 I was walking out of my house.

486
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,120
 The next thing I know, police were bursting into a warehouse.

487
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,400
 I had no idea what was going on.

488
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,560
 That's terrifying to me."

489
00:22:55,560 --> 00:23:00,880
 That's like lost time involving aliens, but actually far, far darker.

490
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,800
 There's one woman said one day she was sitting on her porch.

491
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,240
 This was in another state.

492
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,240
 This wasn't...

493
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,240
 People weren't just being kidnapped locally.

494
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,660
 They were being kidnapped all over Nigeria.

495
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:14,380
 To the point that when this story broke, while all this stuff was going on, like within a

496
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:18,380
 day, people were traveling from all over the country because they had had a loved one go

497
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,620
 missing.

498
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:23,260
 Five years ago, two years ago, whatever, they were traveling out there to see if any of

499
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:27,540
 these bodies, mothers coming out to try to find their children who had been missing,

500
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,540
 snatched off the street.

501
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:34,820
 But remember there's like 20 bodies you could count, 20 living captives, but 50 to 100 or

502
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,220
 more skulls.

503
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:43,600
 Just one woman though said she was sitting on her porch and some police officers approached

504
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,360
 her one day and said she was under arrest.

505
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,360
 She's like, "For what?

506
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,360
 For what?

507
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,360
 Get in the car.

508
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,160
 We'll tell you later."

509
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,120
 They took her to this warehouse.

510
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:59,320
 And so that started a whole bunch of conspiracies and the conspiracies were already there because

511
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,080
 the police weren't investigating this.

512
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,600
 For years people complained about this place.

513
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,200
 It was not being investigated.

514
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,740
 The conspiracy theory was the government was behind this in some fashion.

515
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,900
 But why?

516
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,500
 Why would they have to gain from this?

517
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,220
 We covered this before, actually twice.

518
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:21,820
 I know we covered it when we talked about the Badu boys.

519
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,540
 It was a cult in Africa.

520
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,340
 It was fairly recent of serial killers.

521
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:34,180
 It was a serial killer cult that was smashing people's heads in with stone clubs, mortars,

522
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:39,560
 and selling the blood soaked rags to shaman who would then use them to cast spells for

523
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,560
 the rich and powerful.

524
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,720
 We also covered them if memory serves me correctly when we talked about the Jaguar cult.

525
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,480
 I also believe their magic was used to protect the rich and powerful.

526
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,600
 Once again we have that coming into play.

527
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:57,600
 The theory is this, these people were being kidnapped and then being murdered ritualistically

528
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,200
 or having their flesh peeled off.

529
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,200
 Or both.

530
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,620
 It's not one or the other they're like "we're gonna murder you" but we can't peel off the

531
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,620
 flesh.

532
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,500
 They can do both, unfortunately.

533
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:13,780
 But then using those for rituals as well for rich and powerful people.

534
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,820
 So that was the belief.

535
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:23,580
 You had some women in their time period there give birth and the babies taken away.

536
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:29,660
 So the idea that black magic was involved in this was really big in the local community.

537
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,440
 They can't think of another reason why you would do this.

538
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,880
 It was basically industrialized black magic.

539
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,280
 We've seen genocides obviously and they're always awful.

540
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:44,840
 We've seen genocide across the ages, across the countries, across the cultures.

541
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,440
 This wasn't any sort of ethnic cleansing.

542
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,440
 Not like it makes it better, but it wasn't ethnic, it wasn't political.

543
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:55,280
 It was likely magical.

544
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:00,220
 It likely was industrialized ritual dark magic.

545
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,180
 And so the people are going "listen, it's the same thing we talked about with the badoo

546
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:06,620
 boys" and I'll put those episodes in the show notes.

547
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,380
 The spells are designed to protect the rich and powerful and to make you rich you need

548
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,380
 this blood magic.

549
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,900
 You need this dark, dark energy.

550
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,060
 And that makes you rich and powerful in the first place.

551
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:23,260
 So those people are going to be in positions of power to cover up those crimes.

552
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,440
 Because if those crimes get exposed, they can get exposed.

553
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,920
 So they'll "oh no, it's just superstition, don't worry about it, why are you wearing

554
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,400
 that bib made of human flesh?

555
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,400
 What, this?

556
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,400
 This was here when I got here.

557
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,160
 I was born with this."

558
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:40,360
 And so the locals just don't believe it when the authorities say "oh no, no, no, it wasn't

559
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:45,840
 that" and they denied it that anything was going on for years they denied this.

560
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,920
 But once those kids on those motorcycles breached the perimeter and got into the forest, which

561
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,880
 again was not in the middle of nowhere.

562
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,660
 They could have walked off the road and found this stuff.

563
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,020
 So you have that belief.

564
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,620
 Is there any proof to it?

565
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,700
 Is there any proof to it?

566
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:08,060
 All the articles I read, nobody could ever say conclusively that this is why these murders

567
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:11,220
 took place, that it was ritual black magic.

568
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:15,900
 But there was no other than it was a rehabilitation center.

569
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,860
 That was the only other argument.

570
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:23,800
 No one else is saying it turns out that people were talking about organ trafficking, organ

571
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,160
 harvesting as well.

572
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,120
 But why would you starve a man?

573
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:32,040
 Someone's like "I want a new heart, but I want it to be as weak as possible."

574
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:36,680
 Why would you starve a man for so long if you're organ transplants?

575
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,840
 You would take the person at their prime health and then divvy up the organs right away.

576
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,320
 You wouldn't keep them prisoner.

577
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,120
 You would keep them prisoner if you wanted to prolong their pain if it had something to

578
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,360
 do with the dark arts.

579
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,620
 That makes sense.

580
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:55,900
 So there was organ trafficking and the fact that it was a legit rehabilitation center.

581
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:59,740
 And literally they said these people were here like this when they got here.

582
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,500
 They looked emaciated when they got here.

583
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,380
 That's why they were chained to the bed.

584
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,940
 I didn't have an answer for that one.

585
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,300
 But that it was a legit rehabilitation center.

586
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,820
 There's just a bunch of skulls and dead bodies everywhere.

587
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,980
 Or the ritualistic murder or the organ trafficking.

588
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:21,840
 I think an interesting way to wrap this story up is the closure to all of it.

589
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,360
 Cause we'll see this from time to time.

590
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,600
 Every show often a serial killer kills a bunch of people like Jeffrey Dahmer kills a bunch

591
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:31,400
 of people in his apartment or that dude in Cleveland or Idaho or wherever.

592
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,400
 Killed a bunch of women in his house.

593
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,240
 I mean that's happened in every state unfortunately.

594
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,480
 But there was one in particular, I forgot who it was.

595
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,680
 He was bringing women home.

596
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,960
 He was super stinky and his house was gross and he was killing women in his house.

597
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,060
 He tore the whole house down.

598
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:50,260
 It's like someone, like a local person will usually buy it and then they'll just demolish

599
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,620
 the house.

600
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,620
 Get rid of the memory.

601
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,660
 I'm pretty sure they did that to Jeffrey Dahmer's apartment building.

602
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,380
 Which would suck for everyone else who lived there.

603
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:00,660
 I guess they probably were like "I don't want to live here anyways."

604
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,860
 So they want to do that to this whole forest.

605
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:10,620
 The state governor, Abiola Ejimbo, comes out to the forest.

606
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:16,960
 He's the highest official in the state, comes out to the forest and goes "This forest stands

607
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,720
 as a monument to darkness."

608
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,960
 This warehouse where these dark and twisted actions took place, they will just be reminders

609
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,760
 to all future generations of what happened here.

610
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:37,040
 We need to actually demolish this stuff and rebuild a new Nigeria.

611
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:45,840
 One that's past these petty superstitions, one that looks past these folklore tales and

612
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:53,740
 one towards a brighter future for our state and for our country.

613
00:29:53,740 --> 00:30:00,300
 The governor gave that speech four days after the murders were exposed.

614
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:05,060
 The state governor came out and they were actually beginning to demolish the buildings

615
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:08,160
 and the police were like "There's evidence in there.

616
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,480
 You can't burn down the forest yet, governor.

617
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,880
 This is a murder investigation."

618
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:20,920
 Four days after over a hundred bodies were found, the governor of the state came out

619
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:25,800
 and ordered the destruction of the property and they started to do it before the police

620
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:31,200
 and eventually other members of the state government had to intervene and stop that.

621
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,060
 Five years after the fact, that would be a touching moment to tear that all down and

622
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,260
 build a park in the memory of the victims.

623
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,460
 The bodies were found on March 22nd.

624
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:43,120
 He was giving this speech on March 26th.

625
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,660
 That doesn't sound like a touching tribute to those who have died.

626
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:53,460
 That sounds like an attempt to destroy evidence, an attempt to cover up the ritual murders

627
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:57,540
 of at least a hundred people.

628
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:03,940
 And you can get kidnapped off the porch of your house and the police refuse to investigate

629
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:07,640
 and the government tries to destroy evidence.

630
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:12,880
 That is a bleak, bleak future.

631
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:19,080
 That is a world where we don't rule but the black magicians do.

632
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:25,800
 The shaman, the wizards, they rule the world.

633
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,440
 And does this type of magic stop in Nigeria?

634
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,620
 Does it stop at the borders of Africa?

635
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,860
 Or is it worldwide?

636
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:37,300
 We can hypothesize, we can trade conspiracy theories.

637
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:41,120
 But you won't know for sure until one of two things happen.

638
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:48,420
 You take a path towards becoming a political figure or a powerful person.

639
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:54,940
 And as you're moving up those ranks, you are asked to make a dark deal.

640
00:31:54,940 --> 00:32:02,480
 Or one day you're walking out to the car and the next thing you know, heavy steel clamps

641
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,760
 are placed around your arms and legs.

642
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:11,140
 And you stare off into the darkness of a warehouse and you can hear nothing but the sounds of

643
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:17,280
 others in captivity around you and your own beating heart.

644
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:33,500
 DeadRabberRadio.com is going to be our email address.

645

 DeadRabberRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and truth-crown podcast.

 You don't have to listen to it every day.

647
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,540
 I'm glad you're listening to it today.

648
