1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,560
 A man is challenged to do the spookiest thing during the spookiest month.

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,280
 And then we meet a man who has glimpsed into an alternate reality, one where 9/11 never

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:20,500
 happened, where we're at a more technologically advanced stage and society is more stable

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,460
 and peaceful.

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:29,920
 And this alternate reality of peace and prosperity exists because of the Sega Dreamcast.

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,920
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:42,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,200
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,200
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,680
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,920
 Hope you guys had a great day yesterday and I hope today is even better.

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,580
 We got a ton of stuff to cover so first off let's bring in one of our newest Patreon supporters

13
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,480
 rolling into Dead Rabbit Command like a rolling pulley.

14
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,480
 It's Mario.

15
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,640
 Give a round of applause to Mario.

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,200
 Mario you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,920
 You guys can't support the Patreon, totally understand it.

18
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,720
 Just help spread the word about the show.

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,200
 That really really helps out a lot.

20
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,320
 You have no idea how much it means for me to see other people talking about Dead Rabbit

21
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,560
 Radio online, talk about it to your friends, family, all of that stuff.

22
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,600
 Let's help this show grow.

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,640
 Mario I'm going to go ahead and toss you some oars.

24
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,880
 We're going to take the Dead Rabbit Rowboat.

25
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,600
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

26
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,640
 We are headed on out to Singapore.

27
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,800
 Splishity Splash.

28
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,320
 Splishity Splash.

29
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,520
 Mario is standing on the bow like the captain is where we're doing the hard labor.

30
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,400
 He's leading us all the way out to Singapore.

31
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:50,800
 Specifically we're headed to a place on the Singapore River known as Boat Quay.

32
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,600
 It's August 27th, 2021.

33
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,800
 If you don't know this about Asian culture, it's Ghost Month in Singapore.

34
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,960
 It's actually Ghost Month in a lot of Asian countries right now.

35
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,040
 This is the Ghost Month.

36
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,680
 It's the spookiest time to be alive and the most great time to be dead.

37
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,800
 Because this is when the veil is thin.

38
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,800
 This is when the ghosts can press up against reality and they're watching you shower and

39
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,120
 they're like, "Dude, he's not going to wash his butthole."

40
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,840
 He actually thinks he doesn't have to get soap back there.

41
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,480
 They're trying to warn him but they can't pierce the veil that much.

42
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,920
 But now is the part where the ghosts are really getting active.

43
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,880
 Also an other interesting thing, and we've seen this in a lot of cultures, this isn't

44
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:37,440
 particular to Asia, but ghosts have a really strong connection to water.

45
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,240
 Generally in areas where there's lots of waters or running waters, there's more paranormal

46
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,240
 activity.

47
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,960
 Oddly enough, there's a lot of cryptids, a lot of biological creatures like vampires

48
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,600
 and other cryptids that can't cross running water.

49
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,400
 That's interesting, I just remembered that.

50
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,720
 Ghosts love water and the more active the better, like a stream or a river.

51
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,400
 But a lot of cryptids can't cross.

52
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,040
 But anyway, so maybe we'll discuss that some other point if I ever remembered that topic

53
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,280
 again.

54
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,240
 Both of those factors are going to come into it.

55
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,520
 It's Ghost Month and Ghost Love Water.

56
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,800
 And basically, ghosts are most dangerous at this time and if you go near a body of water,

57
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,240
 well, you're asking for some ghost trouble.

58
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:25,240
 Earlier in the month of August, there's a man named Racen Ace.

59
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,760
 He's a very popular, he's gone viral, ghost hunter in Singapore.

60
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,880
 Hey everyone, this is Racen Ace and we're in this abandoned, a sanicisle.

61
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,600
 And isn't this super spooky?

62
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,800
 Like, share and subscribe, that type of thing.

63
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,160
 We've all seen these videos.

64
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:45,520
 If you haven't seen Racen Ace's videos, you've seen enough of these, I'm sure on YouTube.

65
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,240
 Racen was actually being accused of being fraudulent.

66
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,360
 People were coming forward on his YouTube channel and on his Facebook page saying, "You're

67
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,360
 making this stuff up.

68
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,840
 We can tell you're making this stuff up.

69
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,840
 You're too popular."

70
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,080
 Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

71
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,720
 When you are a creator of something, whether you're writing a novel or making movies or

72
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,920
 doing YouTube or podcasts, I'm going to tell you right, or just making a sanicisle, you're

73
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,240
 going to attract trolls.

74
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,720
 And the only thing you can do is to ignore them.

75
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,080
 I get trolls all the time.

76
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,560
 Whether they're my YouTube comments, I get personal emails.

77
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,920
 People have called me on my phone.

78
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,200
 People have tried visiting my place of work and all sorts of stuff.

79
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,960
 And it's just something that you just ignore.

80
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,040
 I never talk about it on the show.

81
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,320
 I never give them any sort of press or publicity or anything like that.

82
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,760
 They murder my entire family.

83
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,560
 I'd still be like, "Hey, I had a great week and how about you guys?

84
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,160
 Let's go ahead and get this episode started."

85
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,040
 You never give them any attention.

86
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,120
 Because I have this thing I call it the eating picture fallacy.

87
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,280
 Every show often you'll see someone pop up on YouTube and say, "I'm going to eat a picture

88
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,280
 every day of..."

89
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,800
 Someone's actually doing this right now.

90
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
 I'll see if I can find the show notes.

91
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,440
 But I'm going to eat a picture every day of the star of Ant-Man, whoever that guy was,

92
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,440
 Phil McCurdy.

93
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,000
 I'm going to eat a photo every day.

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Paul Rudd.

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,520
 I'm going to eat a photo every day of Paul Rudd until Paul Rudd eats a photo of me.

96
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,000
 And Paul Rudd can never eat a photo of this man.

97
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,840
 I'm saying that he wouldn't be able to digest it.

98
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,840
 I'm saying the second he does, then someone else will do it.

99
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,840
 Then someone else will do it.

100
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,680
 And then eventually he doesn't do it.

101
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,960
 And people call him out and they go, "Well, how come you did it for that guy?"

102
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,960
 You know what I mean?

103
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,280
 You can never, ever do it.

104
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,240
 The prom dates, I've been asked that to a lot of proms since I started doing this podcast.

105
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,280
 You're also like, "Oh, you go to prom with me?"

106
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,560
 If you can't, sorry ladies, you can't.

107
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,720
 Because once you give in, and those aren't even trolls.

108
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
 That guy just wants Paul Rudd.

109
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,880
 That guy wants Paul Rudd to know how delicious his photo is.

110
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,160
 But once you start giving in to them, then you can never stop.

111
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,840
 I was actually consulted by the family of a very popular TikToker.

112
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,800
 They reached out to me and they said, "Hey, we know that used to be a total a-hole.

113
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,840
 Do you have any advice for this guy who's being trolled?"

114
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,800
 And I was able to track down who was trolling him and said, "Just ignore him.

115
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,800
 That's all you can do."

116
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,840
 And then you can have his accounts deleted and stuff like that.

117
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,600
 So there are certain things you can do.

118
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
 There are certain things you...

119
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,520
 This is going on a little bit longer than I wanted it to.

120
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,480
 But basically what I'm saying is you can never give the trolls attention because they'll

121
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,480
 never be satisfied.

122
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,920
 And that all comes from the shoe on head thing.

123
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,920
 It started off like that.

124
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,920
 That's an internet meme.

125
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,920
 To this.

126
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,240
 To this story.

127
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,800
 So what happens is, race and ace gets called out for being fraudulent.

128
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
 And they go, "You know what?

129
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,800
 We think you're fraudulent.

130
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:36,080
 If you're the real ghost hunter you say you are, you'll stay the night in old turf city.

131
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,080
 All by yourself.

132
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,080
 You have to go to old turf city.

133
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,480
 It's one of the most haunted places in Singapore.

134
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,040
 Spend the night there by yourself.

135
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,000
 That'll prove that you're not a fraud."

136
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 And he does.

137
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 He goes to old turf city.

138
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 He spends the night.

139
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 That should be that, right?

140
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Nope.

141
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,160
 He fed the trolls.

142
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,440
 So he continues to get harassed.

143
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:03,000
 And this guy going by the name of Chiangster's SG messaged him.

144
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 And that's another thing.

145
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,920
 You should never magnify these names because then their name's out there and then they

146
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,920
 get to keep.

147
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,480
 Every show I've done I see people pop on Twitter.

148
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,440
 They're like, "Look at what this jerk sent me and they'll have his name on there."

149
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,360
 And I'm like, "Well, you gave him the attention he wanted."

150
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,920
 Chiangster's SG messaged race and ace and said, "If you're really the ghost hunter you

151
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,080
 say you are, it's ghost month.

152
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,040
 I got a real challenge for you."

153
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,160
 And race and ace posted this on his Facebook and he goes, "Yeah, I'll do it.

154
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,120
 I'm not afraid to know ghost trademark.

155
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,040
 Any trademark that?

156
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:39,320
 If you're really a ghost hunter and you're not a fraud, you will swim across the Singapore

157
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:46,880
 River at 2.30 in the morning during ghost month."

158
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,800
 Race and ace goes, "I'll do it because I'm not a fraud."

159
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,200
 So there's video of this.

160
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,360
 This guy's 46 years old by the way, so he's a year older than I am.

161
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,840
 I'm adding that because he should know better.

162
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,040
 If he was 22, I would be a little more understanding of this whole thing.

163
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:09,760
 But anyways, 46 years old is a video of him standing at Boat Quay, which literally means

164
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,320
 a wharf, but this is a place called Boat Quay.

165
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,800
 And he's on this video and he's saying this, there's translation for it all, but he goes,

166
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,440
 "Listen, what I'm about to do is dangerous.

167
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,720
 It's ghost month and bodies of water attract ghosts more than anything."

168
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,440
 And he does say this, this is more realistic, quote, "Please do not try this.

169
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:35,160
 If you are not an expert swimmer, I am not," unquote.

170
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,760
 And he jumps into the river and he's swimming across this Pitch Black River at 2.30 in the

171
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,840
 morning and the camera has a light shining on him and you see him swim out.

172
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,960
 I did not watch the video.

173
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,360
 I've seen enough people die in real life.

174
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,320
 I don't like watching videos of it.

175
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,760
 And I did not include it in the show notes.

176
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,360
 I didn't, I felt that was just a little too much.

177
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,360
 You guys can look it up.

178
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,280
 It's still on YouTube, but I just didn't want to link to it.

179
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,880
 They, he's swimming out and the flashlight's on him and he's swimming out and then he gets

180
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,400
 out to about out of range of the flashlight.

181
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,840
 Now he's supposed to swim across the river and back and it's not the whitest river in

182
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,840
 the world.

183
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:15,720
 This camera's just recording dark water for about 30 minutes.

184
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,800
 After that time the cameraman realizes something's wrong.

185
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,720
 They alert the authorities, the authorities show up.

186
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,240
 He's dead.

187
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,760
 Face and ace was found the next day floating in the river.

188
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,760
 It's an interesting story.

189
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,800
 One because it does have that thing where you just, and I, I'm sure that story with

190
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,560
 you because you're going to get trolled no matter what you do, whether or not you put

191
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,760
 out content or you're just yourself.

192
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,800
 There's always going to be some lunatic walking on the street yelling in your face and spitting

193
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,800
 saliva all over you.

194
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,520
 There's just the reality of the world.

195
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,560
 So I encourage people to make content.

196
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,840
 I know people who go, I don't want to write a book because it'll attract weirdos or I

197
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,880
 don't want to do YouTube because it'll attract weirdos.

198
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,280
 Weirdos are going to find you no matter what.

199
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,200
 There's no hiding from them.

200
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,640
 But it's all about how you deal with the weirdos and he should have just ignored all of these

201
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,920
 challenges because who cares?

202
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,080
 Who cares what people think?

203
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,680
 Who cares what people are trying to write in your coattails or call you fraudulent or

204
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,680
 anything like that?

205
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,760
 Who cares really?

206
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,920
 You have the show, you're having fun.

207
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,480
 If you're, if you're fraudulent, you're doing paranormal activity.

208
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,640
 Like I'm not a huge fan of that.

209
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,560
 I think it's pretty disingenuous.

210
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,560
 But whatever.

211
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,560
 Like just keep doing your thing.

212
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,560
 Have fun.

213
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,200
 Who cares what the trolls thing or people challenging you.

214
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,440
 And then, you know, if someone challenged me in a good hearted way, challenged me to

215
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,280
 say, Hey, it will pay for you to go out to this haunted insane asylum.

216
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,280
 We'll make a big deal of it.

217
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,200
 If you spend the night in there, I'd love to do that.

218
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,520
 If it was good hearted, you know, obviously, if it was like, I knew the person was a fan

219
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,520
 of the show.

220
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,520
 They want to send me out there.

221
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,520
 That'd be dope.

222
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,200
 But if someone's just challenging me to stuff, I'm not going to do it.

223
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,480
 They're just, it's the same thing.

224
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,160
 You'll just keep challenging you until you back down.

225
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,680
 And then they go, look at, he's, he's, he backs down from stuff.

226
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,000
 You can't, you can never eat the photo, Paul.

227
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Right.

228
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 You can never eat the photo.

229
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,500
 So from a content producer thing, I think this is a neat thing from behind the scenes,

230
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,600
 what we deal with and what you will deal with someday.

231
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,400
 Cause I know a lot of you guys are artists in one way or the other, but on the other,

232
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,840
 and you'll, no matter what art you do, you'll attract weirdos.

233
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:22,520
 But on the other hand, I wanted to talk about this because he is now part of the legend.

234
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,360
 A long time ago, we covered an episode, I don't think they ever found the murderer.

235
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,920
 We covered an episode about a kid who was ghost hunting in Oregon and there was a drive-by

236
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,360
 shooting like a completely unrelated event.

237
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,560
 And this kid got shot in the park while he was ghost hunting and he bled out and died.

238
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,440
 It was an early episode.

239
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,160
 I think that episode was like the first hundreds.

240
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,800
 And I thought that kid is now going to be part of the legend of that area.

241
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,240
 He's now a ghost in that area and people will be talking about, oh, we saw him.

242
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,800
 We saw him in the woods and stuff like that.

243
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,720
 And he was bloody and he, you know what I mean?

244
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,520
 Like he's become part of that legend.

245
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:01,720
 This guy, his death in a river during ghost month, I'm sure in the community right now,

246
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,720
 everyone's still in shock.

247
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,440
 Like you can go to this young, I say young man, he's older than me, but you can go to

248
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,080
 this man's page on his Facebook.

249
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,080
 His last post was like a day before this event.

250
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,560
 The last post was on August 26th.

251
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,560
 It's for Lenny Kravitz.

252
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,320
 I just weird timing.

253
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,920
 A Lenny Kravitz song called It's Not Over 'til It's Over.

254
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,000
 And I think people are still in shock, but give it a year, give it maybe even six months.

255
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,560
 You'll start to see people.

256
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,680
 And they may even be doing it now, but he was killed by a ghost.

257
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,000
 He was tempting the spirits.

258
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,880
 He was doing the stuff and the spirits came after him and that's what you get in ghost

259
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,760
 month is serious business.

260
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,040
 His name will now always be considered part of this legend and there will be sightings.

261
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,040
 I can almost guarantee you, not seeing that there will actually be sightings, but people

262
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,280
 will say they will see his ghost in that river.

263
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,520
 At late at night, if you go there, you can see him frantically swimming in the water.

264
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,840
 He's become part of the legend.

265
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:58,560
 So it's interesting on the technical side of it with the troll and then it's just interesting

266
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,640
 as far as the ghost legend goes.

267
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,560
 And authorities are looking for Chiangster's SG.

268
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,480
 They don't know if they're going to press charges yet.

269
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,760
 This person's anonymous.

270
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,760
 Racin Ais said, we know who you are.

271
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,400
 So other people in his group may know and this is all just happened August 27th.

272
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:22,240
 So it's very, very recent story, but the authorities want to talk to Chiangster's SG because that

273
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,440
 it was his decision to swim across the river, but you know, different countries have different

274
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,040
 laws and they may be able to prosecute them under something.

275
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,640
 So that'll be interesting.

276
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,960
 We'll see if more comes of this, but I think really the after effects outside of thinking

277
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:41,680
 of this poor man's family and his friends is he will become part of the ghost legend.

278
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,480
 He will become proof that it is so dangerous to swim during ghost month because a ghost

279
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,480
 will get you.

280
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,800
 These hungry ghosts will ascend from the watery depths to kill you when really the lesson

281
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:59,320
 is don't swim across rivers in the middle of the night if you're not a good swimmer.

282
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,360
 And that's why those legends, a lot of those legends exist.

283
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,400
 They're cautionary tales.

284
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,160
 So I feel really bad for the guy.

285
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,280
 It'll be interesting to see if anything happens to Chiangster's SG and it'll be interesting

286
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,280
 to see how this legend grows.

287
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,560
 Mario, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys for the Carbentercopter.

288
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,480
 We are leaving behind Singapore.

289
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,560
 Fire this bad boy up.

290
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:27,560
 We are headed on out to a small town in middle America.

291
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:37,280
 We're flying over the fruited plains, the vastness of the United States and we're looking for

292
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:42,160
 one house in particular, but we don't have a specific location.

293
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,040
 This is any town USA.

294
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,920
 It's March 2020.

295
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,360
 Now this will be one of those time periods like 9/11 that whenever you think of March

296
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:59,320
 2020, you'll remember it as the start of the lockdowns, the start of the COVID lockdowns.

297
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,560
 When people, I mean the COVID-19 had been floating around, literally floating around

298
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:09,080
 through the air since December, November of 2019 and we all got it at some point.

299
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,640
 But March 2020 is when the United States and a lot of governments around the world said,

300
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,160
 "Oh, this is here.

301
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,480
 We're shutting down the country."

302
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,440
 People dealt with that in certain ways.

303
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,760
 And we're going to meet a young man.

304
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,800
 He didn't give his name, so we're going to call him Wyatt.

305
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,560
 That's just a stab in the dark.

306
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,120
 The COVID lockdowns did not treat Wyatt very well.

307
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,520
 He loses his job and he's stuck at home.

308
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,520
 Literally stuck at home.

309
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,960
 This is like early, early in the lockdown.

310
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,640
 He's drinking, drinking a bit.

311
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,960
 And he bought a high-end laptop because he thought he was going to be doing this tech

312
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,720
 job, but fell through.

313
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,240
 And he's thinking about, as we often do, thinking about the past, thinking about old memories

314
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,920
 and thinking about times we were happy.

315
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,340
 Because in 2020, there wasn't a lot of that early on.

316
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,640
 People were very, very worried.

317
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,840
 So you start to get nostalgic and he goes, "You know what, dude?

318
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,960
 I have this high-end laptop.

319
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:07,280
 I'm going to play a bunch of ROMs on this, play a bunch of GameCube games and PlayStation

320
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,840
 games and stuff that I, when I had so much fun when I was younger."

321
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,040
 And he's playing these games and he starts to think, he goes, "Dude, you know what?

322
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:21,400
 The games I loved the most, the games that I enjoyed the most were Sega Dreamcast.

323
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,680
 Like that was a system.

324
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,200
 I remember just having these warm memories sitting around in the basement.

325
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,840
 Do-do-do-do-do."

326
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:33,520
 So he downloads some Sega Dreamcast ROMs and he's playing them.

327
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:38,880
 He starts to get a feeling while he's playing these games like Fantasy Star Online.

328
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,840
 These games don't feel like they belong.

329
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:58,360
 They're as good as he remembers, but they feel different than gaming today.

330
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:03,680
 Dreams are one of those topics that you ask 100 people what they think the nature of

331
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,680
 dreaming is.

332
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:10,040
 You'll get probably, I won't say 100 answers, but you'd probably get 20, right?

333
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:14,160
 You'd get a lot of different versions of what people thought dreams were.

334
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:21,040
 Some people think they're just neurons firing and our brain's trying to construct a narrative.

335
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,400
 Some people say that we die when we fall asleep.

336
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,240
 Or new people when we wake up.

337
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,400
 The unconsciousness is death.

338
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:35,400
 There's been a talk recently about dreams are actually gateways into alternate realities

339
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,400
 as well.

340
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,080
 That's interesting because you know we're fans of the paranormal.

341
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,720
 We love the weird.

342
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,720
 I read a really interesting article the other day by Dr. Robert Lanza MD.

343
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:57,160
 He wrote it for psychology today and it was called "Dreams are more real than anyone thought."

344
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,440
 It's one of those articles, like I'm not the smartest dude in the world.

345
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:06,360
 It's one of those articles that I had to read a couple times to really grasp.

346
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:11,440
 It basically comes down to this, that reality is nothing but, and this is all like philosophy

347
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,960
 101, but reality is a consensus of what reality is.

348
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,440
 We all see the same things and we agree that physics works this way and what creates the

349
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,160
 rules of the universe is this common agreement among the observers.

350
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,900
 That's why when we start looking at quantum mechanics, the deeper into the universe we

351
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:35,120
 look things start to make less sense and then we're observing it and then stuff starts to

352
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,560
 make sense.

353
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,720
 Basically we understand how the macro level works but the smaller we get, it just doesn't

354
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,720
 make any sense.

355
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,440
 The science doesn't make any sense.

356
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,200
 We can't predict it as much.

357
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,480
 But the macro world we all observe.

358
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:56,880
 So we've all agreed on this consensus reality and that's the reality we live in.

359
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,800
 But Dr. Lanza says in a dream you are the only observer.

360
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,200
 There's only one.

361
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,840
 That is why you are all powerful in a dream.

362
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,480
 I read that and I thought that is so interesting.

363
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,040
 There's no one else to intrude in that.

364
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:19,120
 So if I want to believe that I can fly or Freddy Krueger is real or I'm dating Britney Spears,

365
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,840
 there's no one else to say, no you're not dating Britney Spears.

366
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,440
 There's no one to say that that doesn't exist.

367
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,360
 So because I'm the only one, I'm the only observer and that's the whole thing when you

368
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,040
 look at quantum mechanics.

369
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:36,120
 You can have an experiment like the split, double split experiment go on where if no

370
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,080
 one's watching it, it acts one way but once you look at it, it acts another way.

371
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,160
 There's now an observer in this quantum realm.

372
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,200
 And I know that's really bastardizing it and there's been a lot of debate over whether

373
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,880
 or not that's true but the point is that in a dream there is no secondary or third level

374
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,880
 observer.

375
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,680
 It's just you.

376
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,800
 And he says the problem is we look at dreams a lot of times as we are a player in a video

377
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,800
 game.

378
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,120
 But he goes that's not the case.

379
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:11,560
 When you are dreaming, you, you alone are populating a four dimensional reality.

380
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:15,400
 You can pick stuff up, you can move through the environment, you can interact with it

381
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,240
 in any way you want and time passes in the environment.

382
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,640
 You have all four dimensions that you need plus you can pick up stuff that you can never

383
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,360
 pick up in real life and it feels normal.

384
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,320
 But who you know the thing is is like that's true.

385
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,200
 I'm reading this article and I thought yeah sure that's true.

386
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:40,240
 I'm the only observer in the dream but it's just a dream.

387
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:46,280
 So whether or not I'm flying around or trapped by a thousand zombies in a locked room, it's

388
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,200
 just a dream.

389
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,960
 And people who said well you know it's an alternate reality I always thought well okay

390
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,680
 maybe like I'll let's pretend that you're right that it is you travel to an alternate

391
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,480
 reality when you dream which is going around.

392
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,840
 I've seen a lot of articles on that recently.

393
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,640
 But you're still dreaming.

394
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,080
 Like even reading all that stuff I thought you're still dreaming.

395
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:16,120
 Whether or not it's a reality and you've created this false world you're still dreaming.

396
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,800
 So it's nothing.

397
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,720
 You wake up and it's over.

398
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,200
 Whether or not it's an alternate reality you wake up from it.

399
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,200
 It's gone.

400
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,480
 It doesn't exist anymore.

401
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:32,760
 Dr. Lanz, this is the thing when you read stuff sometimes it really makes you kind

402
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,760
 of read because I've always had that opinion.

403
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:40,240
 A lot of people have talked to me about dreams and the nature of dreams and my opinion always

404
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,200
 is that does it really matter what goes on in the dream?

405
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,320
 It's just a dream.

406
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,600
 What doesn't matter it's just a dream.

407
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,160
 Dr. Lanz, I had this and this.

408
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,720
 He wrote this in this article.

409
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,400
 "We dismiss dreams because they end when we wake.

410
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,200
 However, the duration of the experience is a poor reason to diminish it.

411
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,360
 Certainly, we don't think our experience of day to day life is less real because it ends

412
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,200
 when we die.

413
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,720
 It's true we don't remember events in our dreams as well as we do those occurring in

414
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,280
 waking hours.

415
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,800
 So that Alzheimer's patients may have little memory of events doesn't mean their experience

416
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,920
 is any less real."

417
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:30,360
 I've read that I don't know like a week or two ago and I've been thinking about it all

418
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,360
 the time.

419
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,280
 I go that that's true and I have no argument for that.

420
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,280
 You're right.

421
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,960
 I always dismiss dreams no matter what they are whether it's some sort of magical portal

422
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,400
 or just neurons firing.

423
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,600
 It didn't matter they're just dreams.

424
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:49,400
 You wake up they disappear but they're real while you're in them.

425
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,600
 So in a sense they are alternate realities.

426
00:22:52,600 --> 00:23:03,320
 But can you extrapolate those out to something we should all share as multiple observers?

427
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:08,280
 Let me go back to the story of Wyatt here and I think that was the name we gave him.

428
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,680
 Once he's playing these Dreamcast ROMs more and more he starts to realize that the games

429
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,520
 just don't feel like they belong.

430
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,400
 And he has this quote in his post.

431
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:23,480
 It's like quote "The Dreamcast was a system that did things and had games that just don't

432
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,360
 fit in the profile of gaming."

433
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,360
 Unquote.

434
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,360
 He can't really put his finger on it.

435
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,960
 They just don't seem of this world.

436
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,480
 And then the dreams start.

437
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,640
 This wasn't a one off thing.

438
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:48,360
 This was a repetitive dream that he kept having and kept fleshing out this alternate timeline.

439
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:53,240
 In this world Sega won the console wars.

440
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,960
 In Nintendo had a good run.

441
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,040
 Nintendo Super Nintendo they weren't ever able to beat the Sega Genesis.

442
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:05,240
 And by the time the Dreamcast came around Nintendo was licensing off its characters to third

443
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,400
 party so you could play a Mario game on a Sony PlayStation which those still exist in

444
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,960
 this dream world of Wyatt's.

445
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:19,520
 But it's the Sega Dreamcast and the Sony PlayStation that are at war with each other.

446
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:25,920
 And at this point they're up to the Dreamcast 3 because in these dreams he's in the current

447
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:31,240
 day he's not imagining what it would be like in the heyday of 2004 when the Dreamcast was

448
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,480
 actually out.

449
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,000
 He's dreaming in the year 2020.

450
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,120
 And in this world there's no COVID.

451
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,840
 There's no lockdowns.

452
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,680
 9/11 never happened.

453
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:51,720
 He said that Alcada he would hear about because see he is aware of our history but he's in

454
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:57,320
 a world where things are different so he knows that 9/11 then it happened and he goes I don't

455
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,280
 know if it was prevented or if they never planned it but he goes Alcada exists.

456
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,440
 You hear about him in the news.

457
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:09,040
 But terrorism is still at such a level he said the IRA like blew up a pub and they talked

458
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,640
 about and they like 11 people died and they talked about it on the news for a week.

459
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,240
 And he's thinking good thing you guys aren't in my reality because while tragic that's

460
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,560
 nothing like 9/11.

461
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:26,800
 He said Bush President Bush lasted one term there was never a president Obama and the

462
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,160
 current president was not Donald Trump.

463
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,160
 We're speaking in 2020 here.

464
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:37,640
 But a man named Chris McPherson he was previously a representative of Maryland.

465
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,920
 He was previously a representative of Maryland.

466
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,560
 Maryland how do you say that?

467
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:47,240
 I don't think I've ever had to say that state out loud until now.

468
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,320
 But he said I couldn't find Chris McPherson when I woke up I tried looking for him I

469
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:55,360
 couldn't find that there was a representative by that name.

470
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,200
 He said the world was more technologically advanced.

471
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,840
 He said society was similar because people were asking him questions like what about

472
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,800
 this what about that they said is it is woke as it is he goes you know it's interesting

473
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,800
 it is but it doesn't really have that much of an impact like people really aren't getting

474
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:15,840
 canceled like people are still aware of social issues and they're calling each other out.

475
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,800
 But society it's not like a breaking point.

476
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,240
 It's not that important.

477
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,360
 People still see the issues as important but there's not a lot of social fallout from

478
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,760
 it.

479
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,400
 I'm reading this post and I'll be in the show notes I'm reading this post and all of these

480
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:38,880
 questions that follow it and people are asking this and that and everything.

481
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,740
 Just a dream right just a dream a man's repetitive dream which those are always weird I've never

482
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:48,520
 had a dream that continues and his dream would keep continuing he kept ending up in this

483
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,960
 world.

484
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,000
 You started seeing other posters try building up the mythology and they try to say that

485
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,640
 we are originally from the Sega Dreamcast timeline but CERN they fired up CERN and it

486
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:07,000
 sent us to the Mario timeline I'm like okay the mythology is getting too deep and the

487
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,240
 original poster the Wyatt character who was talking about he said he didn't post that

488
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,800
 he said someone else was posting that he had no idea what that was but that's when they

489
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,160
 were really trying to add all this mythology and it's just whatever like I've heard the

490
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:24,640
 CERN stuff sometimes we just need conspiracy theories to exist in and of themselves and

491
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,080
 that's really what this is the conspiracy is is there an alternate universe where the

492
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:36,280
 Sega Dreamcast won and for whatever reason it's a better world it's almost like those

493
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:42,920
 games were made for a more deserving people but when you play them in our world it's just

494
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:48,840
 they don't seem right they don't fit into place we react to things so violently and

495
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:56,080
 we divide ourselves among lines, real or imaginary, constantly at each other's throats but it's

496
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,440
 just a dream right?

497
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,200
 I mean in a sense yeah even he admits it's a dream he's not saying that he meditated

498
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,320
 on it it's not saying that he did some sort of ritual and body swapped he admits it's

499
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:15,280
 a dream that he's had over and over and the story keeps growing.

500
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:22,560
 So remember going back to what Dr. Lanz has said in a dream there's only a single observer

501
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:27,120
 but when you have more people observing the same thing then it becomes what we know of

502
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,920
 as reality when you have multiple observers agree on the same thing subconsciously or

503
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:37,680
 consciously both agree that you can't walk through a wall you can't walk through a wall

504
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,560
 if there's only a single observer you can do whatever you want but once you start getting

505
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:47,640
 more and more observers in the mix it makes it real.

506
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:53,040
 What is reality but consensus among the observers?

507
00:28:53,040 --> 00:29:00,800
 A long time ago I did an episode on an internet phenomenon known as Chris Chan and we talked

508
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:10,000
 about Chris's belief in the dimensional merge that every single fictional universe was going

509
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,600
 to collide into one and most of the Great Lakes area was going to be taken over by Gotham

510
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:21,840
 City while New York would be New York but it'd be full of Marvel superheroes and at

511
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,000
 any point you could be walking down the street and my little pony could walk by you could

512
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,240
 step on a smurf or the iron giant may squish you instead.

513
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:39,960
 It was just the ramblings of an insane person but it all came down to the Sega Dream.

514
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:51,320
 The logo itself on the Sega Dreamcast was a gateway to all of these worlds.

515
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:57,800
 The Sega Dreamcast was the key to everything.

516
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:04,680
 How many observers does it take to make reality?

517
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:10,800
 At a certain point if you walked into a room and the six people in that room had already

518
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,880
 had a consensus do you have any input in the matter?

519
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,960
 What if you're the hundredth person in the room or the millionth person in the room?

520
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,920
 Do you have any input on what reality is?

521
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:29,920
 But what if it does just take a handful?

522
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:37,360
 Things about the Dreamcast a better world than we are in right now.

523
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:46,360
 A vision of the Dreamcast being a gateway to all worlds ever.

524
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:53,600
 While the consensus in this reality is that the Dreamcast was a very good gaming system

525
00:30:53,600 --> 00:31:00,240
 with a lot of memorable games but it did not meet the market needs of the time and it is

526
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:10,160
 now either collecting dust, played by the most ardent supporters, or sitting in the landfill.

527
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:19,200
 How many people will it take to believe that the Dreamcast is something more than plastic

528
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:25,600
 and metal, circuit boards, and plugs?

529
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:34,080
 How many people will it take to believe that the Dreamcast is something else for reality

530
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,440
 to shift for us all?

531
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:46,880
 And the most bizarre thing is most of us probably wouldn't even be aware of it.

532
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:54,800
 Reality is consensus, but it does not require consent.

533
00:31:54,800 --> 00:32:02,160
 If the shift is strong enough, you'll never remember a time that Nintendo won the console

534
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,520
 wars.

535
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:09,480
 You'll just go along with the new reality.

536
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:33,840
 It's the only reality you ever knew.

537
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:49,600
 It's the only reality you ever knew.

538
00:32:49,600 --> 00:33:07,360
 It's the only reality you ever knew.
