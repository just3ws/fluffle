1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Public restrooms. Some people love to use them. Some people would rather hold it in all day long than to sit on a toilet seat that was previously occupied by another person's butt.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 But today we're going to take a look at a sinister side of public restrooms. From true crime to hauntings. These restrooms, yep, we're doing a whole episode on this.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 From true crimes to hauntings. Some public restrooms tell tales darker than the darkest poop. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 You guys are like, dude, you're not really doing a whole themed episode about this. Well, I am. I am. Okay?

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Still a little under the weather. The earache's gone. No sore throat. I still just got this cough. I've spent most of the day just kind of laying about.

7
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 So you're like, oh, that's why you're just doing- No, no, no, no, I think this is a- that's not an excuse. I think this is an interesting episode.

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Because I actually started off on one thing and then I go, I bet you I can find enough toilet related stuff. Good stuff! Good, trust me. This is a good episode.

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Okay? I haven't recorded it yet, but I know where this episode's going to end. This episode's going to creep you out. Let's get started with public restrooms.

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 What are they? You know what they are. I don't have to go over the Webster's Dictionary to find a public restroom as a urinal. No.

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 They're places in the public where you go to the bathroom. But did you know? Let's start off with a conspiracy paranormal and true crime podcast.

12
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Let's start off with a kind of a conspiracy here. Some of you guys are going to be very, very familiar with this. Some of you guys probably won't be.

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 But conspiracy number one. I don't know if this is necessarily a conspiracy, but it may make you reconsider tapping your feet to a jaunty tune that you're listening to on your Walkman before Tinder existed.

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Really, the way that you would have, not Tinder, before Grindr existed, the way you would hook up with other dudes is you would go into the men's room and you'd sit down at your toilet in your stall, and then you'd wait for someone else to sit in their stall, and then you would tap your foot.

15
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Now you'd have to tap your foot so the person in the other stall could see it, but if you tapped your foot, you'd wait a second, then you'd see if the other guy would tap his foot.

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Oh, now you think. Maybe. It's just a coincidence. So then you would move your foot a little bit over. This is how boomers hooked up in bat.

17
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Again, before Grindr, you wanted to just blow a dude in the middle of the day. This is what you had to do. You would tap your foot. You're like, "Jayson, this isn't a conspiracy. It's a mating ritual for homosexual men. It's kind of a conspiracy."

18
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 Hold on. This isn't a whole episode. The whole episode is not going to be dating tips from 1980s that don't apply because you're not gay. And again, if you were, you could just use Grindr.

19
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 You would tap your foot back and forth, and then that way you would know that it wasn't a coincidence. And then one guy would stick his hand down, and then you'd go, "Okay, that's obvious."

20
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Because like, let's say I move my foot, and then a second later you move your foot. That might be a coincidence. Then I move my foot, and you move your foot.

21
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Still might be a coincidence. Someone finally has to take the step to kind of put their hand down, and then you guys can start like, you know, sticking your genitals underneath the stall and get to work.

22
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Now, obviously, obviously, very, very, very dangerous for two reasons.

23
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 One, because there's more than two reasons why sticking your genitals into another man's stall could be dangerous.

24
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 But the obvious ones is police, obviously, could be a setup. That was a big problem with gay rights in the '50s.

25
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 They weren't--they were basically getting beaten up all the time. They'd go to a gay bar, and the cops would come in and just kick the crap out of all the men in the bar, and then they'd go home.

26
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 They'd be all bruised. Their wives were like, "What happened to you?" And they're like, "Ugh." And then they'd have a sport called UFC, and then I engaged in it, and I got beat up. I don't want to talk about it.

27
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Or they would be get caught cruising at bars. You know, it's funny, you talk about--we always talk about like, lost media and stuff like that.

28
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 So, it is a very famous underground movie. I think it started out with Pacino called Cruisin. It was about a detective.

29
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 A police detective has to go underground into the gay leather community. I think it came out in like the '70s or '80s.

30
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 And he's hunting the serial killer, so he has to go undercover, and the gay volunteers for that assignment.

31
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 And they're like, "I'll do it! Sergeant, me, me, me!" And they're like, "Oh, yeah, sure. You have your own leather uniform. Sure, you can do it."

32
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 He's like putting on his assless chaps to work, and I was like, "Finally, I can use this."

33
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Anyways, that movie apparently has--it was shot--I've never watched it. I heard it's fairly gritty, but 15 minutes had to be edited out of it, because it was just super, like--

34
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 for like the early 1980s to have like this super fetishized gay community stuff freaked a lot of people out.

35
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 They took 15 minutes out of it, and it's been lost to time. The footage has absolutely been lost.

36
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 James Franco made a movie about the 15 minutes. I don't know. It's all weird, but he made a whole movie where he reenacted the 15 minutes or something like that.

37
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 I don't know. I've never seen it. It's nothing that I've been particularly interested in. I just know about it.

38
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 So anyways, whoever's talking--oh, yeah, so gay dudes used to get beat up, and they used to get arrested for pulling their pants down in bathrooms.

39
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 But the whole thing with like tapping your foot--again, I don't know if people do that today, but I remember. It didn't happen to me.

40
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 I was like, "Hum-da-dum-da-dum!" They stamped my foot. "Oh, no, I draw. I play in a--what's that game called? Jacks?"

41
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 Like throwing the ball down and picking up the jacks, and they see my hand go down. The next thing I know.

42
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 That didn't happen to me, but I was aware of it. I was aware of this stuff.

43
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Because you go to a bathroom, there's glory holes, right? You're like, "Jace, what bathroom are you going into?"

44
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 You're basically going into the bathroom from It's Always Sunny.

45
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 No, like you'd go to bathrooms in bad parts of town, or sometimes even good parts of town.

46
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Someone would drill a hole through the wall or through the stall wall.

47
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Again, highly dangerous. I wouldn't do it.

48
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Because, one, the cops--whoa, I'm not gay! That's a big one. Two, the cops.

49
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Like if you were, the cops are on the other side. Three, what if you misinterpreted the signals and you stuck it in?

50
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 And then the dude was like reading a book, and he was playing jacks, and you saw his hand go down, and he's like, "Oh!"

51
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 And then you got to fight on your hand. So there's another really good reason not to do that, but we're going to save that for the end of the episode.

52
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 So I want to end this on--I'll end the episode with that story. So anyways, that's kind of a conspiracy theory, right?

53
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 I think it is. I think it's kind of a hidden culture. It's a hidden culture.

54
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 I bet you guys never knew that. Some of you might have, but I bet most of you guys never knew that.

55
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 That for a good period of time, in at least American history, I'm sure it was also throughout other parts of the world,

56
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 if you tapped--it was basically like, you know, in Indiana Jones, how they go into that place and they have that giant stick in the sunlight,

57
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 like hits the stick, and Indiana maneuvers it, and the beam's like, "Woo-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow-woow

58
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 like hits the stick and Indiana maneuvers it, and the beams like--and then once it hits that certain thing, it opens a doorway, and you had to do a certain series of maneuvers of rituals to start being a dude in the next stall.

59
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 So it's kind of like Indiana Jones, except far more dangerous. So let's go ahead, though. We're not just going to talk about that the whole episode.

60
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 The people who are continuing to listen to it, they're like, "I'm not going to listen to this for 35 minutes. I'm not going to listen to Jason with his stuffed up nose talk about secret symbols."

61
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 I always thought it was weird, though, because that's definitely like a secret society, right?

62
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Let's talk about ghosts in bathrooms. Let's talk about ghosts in bathrooms.

63
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Now, it started off--I was reading this article by Brent Swancer called "A Survival Guide for Encountering Japanese Bathroom Spirits."

64
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 So I want to give credit to him. It's from Mysterious Universe. Got a lot of this information from this.

65
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 There's actually more haunted bathrooms than you would expect. Now, we got two different types of haunted bathrooms.

66
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 We got Western haunted bathrooms, and then the Japanese ones, right? The big old Japanese weirdos.

67
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Now, one of the Japanese haunted bathrooms--I actually covered--I'm pretty sure I covered this on a past episode, so we're going to breeze through this one as a quick overview.

68
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Some of you longtime listeners may remember me talking about a girl named Hanako of the toilet.

69
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 If you're a ghost and your nickname involves anything close to being a toilet, you've failed at being a ghost.

70
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 You've failed--that's the least--well, you know what? The one thing, it would be the least frightening thing, but I think in a lot of ways--and we'll go through this more--

71
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 bathrooms might be the most terrifying place to be haunted. You don't want to be a bathroom ghost because another ghost is going to make fun of you,

72
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 but you definitely--I'd rather be trapped in a haunted house than trapped in a haunted bathroom.

73
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Hanako of the toilet--what it is, it's a little girl who wears World War II clothing, which I've kind of scratched my head.

74
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 I don't know if she's wearing a little--didn't the Japanese kids always wear the schoolgirl outfits from anime, post and pre-World War II?

75
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 I don't know. I don't know whether they were wearing before it. But anyways, apparently she was wearing World War II clothes.

76
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 I don't know if she's like in a little uniform with a sword, but with her, you actually have to summon her.

77
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 So you go to the third floor of a building, you go into the girl's room, you go to the third stall, and then you go--that's you knocking.

78
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Are you there, Hanako-san? And then you'll hear a little girl go, "Yes, I am."

79
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 And then she either--you either open the stall and there's a little creepy girl standing there, or she opens the stall and she drags you into the toilet, which is a portal to hell.

80
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Or she turns into a three-headed lizard and eats you.

81
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 So I covered her on a long past episode, and I don't remember what episode it was, but I do remember a little girl turning into a three-headed lizard.

82
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 So there's that, right? But that's when you have to summon. That's basically the foot-tapping equivalent of summoning a ghost.

83
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 If you're not tapping your foot, no generals are going to be popping underneath your stalls.

84
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 So don't--don't tap your foot, you're good. Don't knock and go, "Are you there, Hanako-san?" Stuff like that.

85
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 But let's look at some ghosts you just kind of don't mind their own business.

86
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 There's one known as Kashimi--oh, power. Power is--oh, that's kind of spooky.

87
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Like, I'm talking about these ghosts and the lights are starting to flicker. There's a bit of a storm going on right now.

88
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Oh, I don't want to finish the recording of this episode. You guys are cool with me ending this episode here, right?

89
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Kashimo Rico. Kashimi--sorry, I did not pronounce that right the first time.

90
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 Kashima Rico. And actually, pronouncing stuff is really important with this one, so I probably should have done more research.

91
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 Kashima Rico. So apparently this girl, either by her own act of suicide, or some, like, people, like, threw her in front of it, or it was an accident,

92
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 she gets chopped in half by a train. [makes train noises]

93
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 This is not a chainsaw train. That was the sound of a train, like, driving by real fast.

94
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Chops is girl in half. Now, for some reason, she also haunts bathrooms.

95
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Not bathrooms on trains, or bathrooms near trains, but any bathroom in Japan.

96
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 You could be sitting in the bathroom, doing your business, and you hear a--

97
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 [makes train noises]

98
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 It's the sound of somebody dragging their spine on the ground. They're using their elbows to move, Commando-style, but they got no legs.

99
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 That's a sound you wouldn't--you wouldn't hear that sound and go, "Hmm, that sounds oddly like a spine being dragged across the ground.

100
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 I can hear the spinal fluid pooling." No. You would not--like, you understand the sound of, like, a shotgun.

101
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 [makes gun noises] Or a sword. Sling! That's not a sound. You wouldn't be able to place that sound, but apparently, it's a very distinct sound.

102
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 And you can hear it walking in the--or crawling in the bathroom towards you, and you're in your stall.

103
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 See, I told you this is gonna get spooky. You're in this stall, and you hear us.

104
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 [makes train noises]

105
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 And you'll see come underneath the stall--you tell me which one's creepier.

106
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 You'll see underneath the stall, a girl with no lower half of her body crawling into the bathroom with you, crawling into your stall with you.

107
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Or is that creep--that's creepy, obviously, but is that creepy? Or is it for you to be hearing that noise, and then it stops, and you don't know where it's coming from, you don't know what it was,

108
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 and then you look up, and it's staring at you from the top of the stall.

109
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 Now, in that version, you don't know that she's half a person, right?

110
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 In that version, you would just think it's some creepy girl hanging over the side, but it's still spooky.

111
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 What's spooky? Or seeing someone slide under--I guess the one where you've noticed that they're only half a person is the spookiest one, but--

112
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 I also think, like, looking up and seeing someone staring at you over the stall is absolutely terrifying as well.

113
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 But anyways, she asks you a--you didn't have to invoke this one, she just comes to you while you're on the bathroom.

114
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 She'll ask you a question. These Japanese ghosts are quite interactive.

115
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 She asks you a question, and she goes, "Where are my legs at? Who's got my big toe?"

116
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 She actually asks, "Where are my legs at?"

117
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 And you have to answer her. You can't ignore her. You have to answer her.

118
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 You have to tell her, and this is why pronunciation is important for this one, you have to tell her they're at the Maishin Expressway.

119
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right. So if you ever get attacked by this one, or think you might, I would recommend going to the show notes,

120
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 looking up the pronunciation, but you have to say, "The Maishin Expressway."

121
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 If you say that, she scuttles away to go find her legs.

122
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 If you tell her, "I don't know," or you don't have any idea where her legs are, or you give her a different place, she rips you in half.

123
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 And now you scoot around with no legs.

124
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Now, the assumption, I'm assuming, is that you become a ghost as well.

125
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 So maybe at this point, there's been hundreds of... there's not the same one.

126
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Maybe Kashima, maybe you might run into one of Kashima's victims, but you still have to say that her legs are at Maishin Expressway.

127
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 I don't even know if that's a real place. I guess I should have looked that up.

128
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 It's like this tourist nation has these ancient Japanese towers, this koi pond, and a pile of rotting girls' legs.

129
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 We don't know where they come from. Every day there's a new pair, but come enjoy the scenery.

130
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 What's interesting is that Kashimi is actually a subset. Japan actually has an entire type of demon called a "techi," or a "tiki."

131
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 And it's a girl who's been chopped in half by a train. It's its own subspecies of demons.

132
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 But generally, they carry skites, and they cut you in half. There's a horror movie called "Tiki."

133
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 Now, I didn't watch the horror movie in preparation of this episode. I was too busy just laying and taking my temperature every hour,

134
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 afraid that I'm super sick. But I did watch a five-minute YouTube video where people took the best scenes of the movie

135
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 and put it to some Lincoln Park song. So it's like, "Dying in my skin!"

136
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 And there's this girl crawling. "These wounds, they will not!"

137
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Basically, it was a "alternate" video or something like that. But anyway, so I watched one of those.

138
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 I read the synopsis. "Standard Japanese Fair," but Kashimi is a...

139
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 I think I've made a record for his different pronunciations of a name.

140
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Each time it's different in such a short amount of time, his Japanese ghost is actually one of many legless ghosts.

141
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 But not all of them appear in bathrooms. Not all of them ask where their legs are.

142
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 A lot of times they just cut you down. So very, very weird. Very weird thing.

143
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 We got this other Japanese bathroom ghost. This was the first one I came across.

144
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 Aka-manto. This one wins the award for being the most annoying one. Easily.

145
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 The most inconvenient... But getting your legs shopped off is pretty inconvenient.

146
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 But this one. Generally these happen in girls' restrooms, which I think that it kind of makes sense

147
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 because on one hand when a boy is telling the story, the girls' restrooms seem like the most forbidden place.

148
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Right? Like, the boys' restroom you go and you get each other in headlocks and you throw each other in the toilet, stuff like that.

149
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 But the girls' restroom, you don't know what's going on over there.

150
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 And girls tell these stories just because they're scared all the time.

151
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 And girls' restrooms are also a... It has a lot to do with their changing bodies and stuff like that.

152
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 It's not as mystical. Boys see girls' restrooms as some weird Shangri-La clubhouse.

153
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 You don't know what's going on in there. I remember when I was a little kid, I went into a girls' room at my church.

154
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 They had a couch in there. They had flowers. I was like, "What in the world? This is awesome!"

155
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 I know they made a joke about that on the office too, where they took over the girls' restroom.

156
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 It was like, had a couch in it. It was a different setup.

157
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 So they generally don't do that at public restrooms. I mean, churches and stuff like that, but not now in public.

158
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 I think that the girls' restroom for girls, it's a place of my body's changing.

159
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 I don't know. I could be overreaching on that one, but...

160
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 Or a place of solitude that they can go to and cry when they can't decide who to date, Jughead or Archie.

161
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 And guys, it's just a weird, mystical place that we're not allowed to go into. We're not allowed to go in there.

162
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 But anyway, so, I think a lot of these involve the girls' restrooms for that.

163
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 But also, this one, you go into the girls' restroom. Now, normally, it's the last stall.

164
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 And all I've said is, I've used to been a janitor in my life.

165
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 From my own experience, there is something creepy about girls' restrooms myself.

166
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 Not creepy in the sense that girls are creepy, but they do seem to be...

167
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 They seem to be charged with a different emotional energy than boys' restrooms or men's restrooms.

168
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 They really do. Like, yeah, when I was a kid, I was like, "Ooh, a couch."

169
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 But, I mean, how often as a man or a boy do you go into a bathroom for some solitude to cry,

170
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 unless it's your own bathroom at home? You don't want to see you cry.

171
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 But, like, a public restroom or like a college restroom, things like this,

172
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 they see a girls' restroom seem to have a different... seem to have a different emotional energy than a boys' restroom.

173
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 So, that's another reason. And I've experienced that myself.

174
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 I don't like going into girls' restrooms, which is fine.

175
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 I only do it when I'm a janitor or when I've had to go in and clean them up.

176
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 And two, there's something about the last stall. It's always the last stall in these places.

177
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 I thought it was interesting in the Hanako one, you go to, like, the third stall,

178
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 but this one's specifically the last stall. You go into the last stall,

179
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 and right before you go to wipe...

180
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 [imitates explosion]

181
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 A figure very, very inconvenient, right? Like, you've already done your business,

182
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 but I guess it could have been worse. You could have been mid-poop and this creature appears.

183
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Right before you pull that first piece of toilet paper and go to wipe, this figure appears. It's a man!

184
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Supposedly a very handsome man, but his face is covered by a mask.

185
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 And he's draped in a red cloak.

186
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 His name's Aka Manto. His name actually means red cloak or red cape.

187
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 And he asks you, "Red paper or blue paper?"

188
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 And you go, "Well, I've seen The Matrix, and I...

189
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 I'll pick the red one, 'cause then I'll go on an adventure."

190
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 "Red paper."

191
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 And then he f-flays your skin off. [screams]

192
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Takes it off, making it look like a big old pile of spaghettios. Super gross.

193
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 So now, we're gonna rewind it. So now you get a second chance, you go,

194
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 "Well, I'm not gonna do that again. I hate spaghettios."

195
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Blue paper, and he goes, "Blue paper."

196
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 And he goes, "Blue paper."

197
00:20:43,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 And then he suffocates you, "Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

198
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 And you say, "Yell-- If you pick a different color, like one person would say yellow,

199
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 they get drowned in a toilet full of pee, so you definitely don't want to pick brown.

200
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 Whatever color you pick, the creature will find a way to kill you to make you look that color."

201
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Like if you pick pink, he could just like pinch your cheeks, and they get all pink and rosy,

202
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 and then, like, all the blood rushes through your cheeks, and the rest of your body starves.

203
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 If you picked green, he would probably like bury you in the swamp.

204
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 This guy, I'm sure you-- I think-- I'm sure there would be a game where you could try to come up with colors,

205
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 like you're like fuchsia, and he's like, "Ugh!" Trying to figure it out,

206
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 but again, he's also a demon, so he might know the answer to it.

207
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 So how do you get away from this guy, right? Well, you-- this is an easy one.

208
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 You just ignore him. If he appears, and he goes, "Red paper," or "Blue paper,"

209
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 you just finish wiping, and then you walk past him and leave.

210
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Which is actually kind of a lame ghost.

211
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Like, he has the ability to, no matter what color you pick out, you pick ultraviolet.

212
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 He's like, "Ugh!" Turns you into a dying star giving off gamma bursts.

213
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 He has the ability to do all these things, but you-- or you can just walk away from him.

214
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 This is one of those ones, and I'm sure a lot of kids talked about, because these are all--

215
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 this one dates back to the 1930s. Aka Manto dates back to the 1930s.

216
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 This urban legend's been around.

217
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 It's one of those things that I'm sure of, like, you were a kid. That would be terrifying to hear.

218
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Oh, the power is going out. That would be terrifying to hear, right?

219
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 That you go into a, um, bathroom and this thing appears,

220
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 but then you would start to act-- logically, you'd go, "Well, how does anyone know that?"

221
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 Well, one day Nancy went in there, and then, like, she turned into a bunch of spaghettios.

222
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 Yeah, but you don't know which one she picked.

223
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 Like, the only way you would know these things, if someone picked one of these things

224
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 was killed by them and then was able to tell people they were killed by them, right?

225
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 So it's one of those urban legends that doesn't really-- and most urban legends don't pass this either.

226
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 They don't pass the nudge test. When she starts to put a little bit of weight on it, kind of goes away.

227
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 But we're not just going to talk about Japanese ghosts, because when I started this,

228
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 I was just going to do a segment on Japanese ghosts.

229
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 I wasn't going to talk about the weird symbology of the bathrooms, and I wasn't going to talk about this,

230
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 but then I thought, "There's a lot of stuff we can talk about in bathrooms," right?

231
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 Because bathrooms aren't only around in Japan, right? There's haunted bathrooms all over the world.

232
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 There's not as many as I thought there were, but I did find a couple ones.

233
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 There is-- in the Empire State Building, there was a woman back in the '80s.

234
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 She was standing on the observation tower, and this woman walks up to her,

235
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 and she was dressed like in World War II clothing. Again, I don't know what that means.

236
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 She's dressed in a full uniform. She was a Japanese girl.

237
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 And the woman goes, "My husband, he died during the war. He died during the war."

238
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 And I-- that's it. I'm out. I'm going to kill myself and the person on the observation deck was,

239
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

240
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

241
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 and then the woman leaves the bathroom, and the witness is totally shaken, and she follows the ghost.

242
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 She knows this is a ghost now, follows her back out onto the observation deck,

243
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 and the ghost jumps off the building again. And one witness said she had seen this ghost.

244
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 What happens is the ghost will jump off the building, appear in the bathroom,

245
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 walk out of the bathroom, jump off the building, appear in the bathroom, walk out of the bathroom, jump.

246
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 It's weird. It's all-- I've heard of ghosts like replaying the events.

247
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 I don't think I've ever heard of them replaying the events that quickly afterwards.

248
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 You know what I mean? Like, it's not like if you stand on this chair on Halloween,

249
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 the hand comes out of it, and then if you continue to stand on the chair every 30 seconds,

250
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 the hand will continue to reach out like some puppet.

251
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 But this one is in a constant feedback loop.

252
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 It's almost like the only way you could stop it is by not observing it.

253
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 Is by not observing it in the first place.

254
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 But anyways, we have that one. We also-- this one's a little more uplifting.

255
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 We have Scott Stapp. He's the lead singer, former lead singer of the band Creed, with arms wide open.

256
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 And he was having a rough go of it. He was having some sobriety issues.

257
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 He was trying to stay off of alcohol, maybe drugs, but I know he had an issue with alcohol.

258
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 And he also was trying to be in the band Creed at the time.

259
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 And he goes, "Oh, you know what? I need to be in this band and I need to stop doing these drugs."

260
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 But I also need to buy this tour bus that used to be owned by Scott Wyland,

261
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 the lead singer of Stone Temple Pilots, who died of a drug overdose in the bathroom in the tour bus.

262
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 I don't know if that is true. I do know that he died.

263
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 But I don't know if he actually died in the tour bus bathroom.

264
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 But according to this story, Scott Stapp buys this bus.

265
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 And one day the bus is driving down the road and Scott Stapp is walking through the bus

266
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 and he's just like, "Ugh, I need to drink and I-- or I-- or I-- and/or maybe do drugs."

267
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 I don't know. I don't know what else I was addicted to, but I know I'm not in a good spot.

268
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 And he walked into the bathroom and then the ghost of Scott Wyland appears in the mirror and says,

269
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 "Scott Stapp, we have the same first name."

270
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 He didn't say that. He goes, "Listen, dude, get your act together because you can be exactly where I'm at."

271
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 I.e. dead from a drug overdose. You got to get your stuff together.

272
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 The actual quote that Scott Stapp said-- that Scott Wyland said was,

273
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 "Dude, this could have been you." This actual quote, "Dude, this could have been you.

274
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 And this could be you if you continue that path. Don't do what I did. Don't go down that road."

275
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 And then he continues to say, "Scott Stapp on this experience says, 'It was definitely one of those God moments.

276
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 I get goosebumps right now just talking about it. It was a God moment.'"

277
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 So good stuff can come out of a haunted bathroom too, right?

278
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 Now, it's interesting. I want to do a couple true crime bathroom stories, but before we move on from that,

279
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 there's an author named Michael Dillon Foster. He wrote a book called The Book of Yokai,

280
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 Mysterious Creatures of Japanese Folklore, and he has this quote about bathrooms.

281
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 Why bathrooms are so creepy? Quote, "The bathroom is a somewhat unusual space in a household or school or wherever it exists.

282
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 It empties into another realm, the sewer, and in that sense, the bathroom is a place of transition.

283
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 And the toilet in particular is a portal to a mysterious other world.

284
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 Even though we generally flush things down, it would not seem surprising for something mysterious to come up through the toilet."

285
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 I think that's over-- I think that's an overread on it. I think the reason-- because bathrooms are creepy, and public bathrooms are creepy.

286
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 I think bathrooms are creepy for a couple different reasons. One, you're alone.

287
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 You're not only alone, but you're in your most vulnerable state outside of sleeping, right?

288
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 You're-- your pants are down. There's mirrors everywhere, which mirrors are pretty creepy in and of themselves.

289
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 The lighting-- the lighting's bad. They tend to stink. There's also another ghost that smelled like poop walking around.

290
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 That was in Scotland. If you want to go there, it's the Dumfries House. There's not much to that.

291
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 There's some huge mansion, and there was a ghost that smelled specifically not just poop. He smelled like diarrhea.

292
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 You'd be on a ghost-- you wouldn't be a ghost tour. They're like, "Look at this great Faberge egg, and look at this fancy chest, and then you'd smell poop all over the place."

293
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 "Diarrhea." That was the last of those ghosts. But anyways, I don't necessarily think it's because the toilet's a portal to the underworld.

294
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 I think it's that you're alone, you're vulnerable, and you're-- basically, when you're sitting on a toilet, then your pants are down around your ankles, and if something happens, you are caught out.

295
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 So I think you're already creeped out by that. And then you just add being young and being alone, and then all these urban legends are going to start off and things like this.

296
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 Washing your face, looking up in the mirror, seeing something behind you, very, very common trope in horror movies. It doesn't surprise me that real-life ghost stories have that same thing.

297
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 And we also do a lot of thinking in bathrooms, whether you're in the shower, sitting on a toilet. They do seem to conti--

298
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 I said earlier about the girls' restroom seems to be more emotionally charged. My theory is this. You have a-- that's where a woman will go to-- or to, like, freak out, right?

299
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 They'll go, they'll sit in the bathroom, they'll sit in the handicap stall, they'll sob silently to themselves.

300
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 But I think that they can charge all this emotional energy. They're getting picked on at school, they're getting picked on at work, all of this stuff.

301
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 They go in, they sit there, they're just releasing all this emotional energy, and after 10, 20 years of these women's restrooms, I think that it can just-- just like a sponge.

302
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 Because they do feel creepier. They do feel creepier. But you want to know something that's really creepy. Let's go to the true crime stories involving public restrooms.

303
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 I'm going to give you-- I'm going to tell you guys this. This part's rough. This part's rough. So if you guys want to bow out now, I'll see you guys tomorrow, because it's going to get into some dark stuff.

304
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 One of these stories disturbed me for a long time, so if you guys want to bow out, it's totally fine. Dead Rav radio, I'll check you guys tomorrow.

305
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 Let's get into some true crime involving public restrooms.

306
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 There's really-- when we talk about true crime involving public restrooms, there's one big case that I remember when it happened.

307
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 I was alive when it happened. I was old. I was in my 20s when it happened.

308
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 Terrifying. Terrifying, terrifying story.

309
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 1998, Oceanside, California. There was a family reunion going on. And there is an aunt-- there's like this roadside bathroom.

310
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 Like a gas station bathroom or something like that. This nine-year-old boy-- yeah, that's-- that's-- there's a nine-year-old boy named Matthew Chechi.

311
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 He had to go to the bathroom. He had to go to the bathroom. And his aunt goes, "Okay, I'll stand outside the bathroom."

312
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 So the boy goes into the restroom. And then it's a public restroom, right?

313
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 This guy walks in after Matthew. This guy named Brandon Wilson. He walks in. He was a homeless man. He's a drifter.

314
00:31:48,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Walks into the bathroom. Three, four minutes pass, if that. And the man walks out of the bathroom and walks by the aunt and goes, "What is this?"

315
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 And just keeps walking, like just beelines. And she gets this weird feeling.

316
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 Che-- the kid was out of view for minutes. Three, four minutes. She gets this weird feeling. She goes in the bathroom.

317
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 The bathroom kid slits from ear to ear, bleeding out. I mean, it was that fast that she comes in. He was still bleeding.

318
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 Between the time the guy walked in, what happened was the guy walked in and just slit the kid's throat and then turned around and walked out.

319
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 And so that's his aunt and took off. And it took him days to find the guy. Because he's a drifter. That's the thing.

320
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 You don't-- they don't have-- I don't want to go on a huge anti-hobo rant.

321
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 They're really hard to track down. The way they caught him was he ended up stabbing another woman a couple days later and then he stopped and let her go.

322
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 And she starts running on the street and he goes, "Nah, never mind." And then he chases her down and starts stabbing her again.

323
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 And a bunch of the woman's coworkers wrestled him off. And as she survived-- and this guy, though, killed this kid-- he told the cops, "I'd do it again."

324
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 And no emotion about killing the kid at all. Admitted that if he had the chance, he would do it again.

325
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 And then he went to prison for-- he got the death penalty. And then he hung himself 13 years later to the week of the boy's murder.

326
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 Hung himself. That story-- so that happened in 1998. So I was probably about 21 when that happened.

327
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 That story terrified me. That story sent a chill through, I think, everyone. Everyone. I think that really-- because you think minutes past, minutes past.

328
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 This kid walks into this bathroom. Terrifying story. Terrifying story.

329
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 There's another one, though. We're going to circle back around like this. I really tried finding an article on this.

330
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 I'll see if I can continue to find something and put it in the show notes. I think I read it in a book that was written in the '70s, so it's a lot harder to find this source.

331
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 But I told you about people tapping their foot, hooking up having gay sex in bathrooms. Well, you-- I said it's dangerous for a couple different reasons.

332
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 One, a lot of times cops would do it. Cops would-- they need to go get a bus. They'd go into the bathroom, tap their foot, and then they'd make the motion.

333
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 The next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person, the next person

334
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 I remember reading this because, again, quite horrific. You would tap your foot, and then he would tap his foot, and he would do this little rigmarole until eventually you would expose yourself to him.

335
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 And then the next thing you would know was the whole lower half of your body was dripping wet.

336
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 There was one survivor of this. They did catch the guy eventually. A couple people died. One guy survived this.

337
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 Maybe two people survived. But anyways, they did catch the guy.

338
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 They-- you'd get down on your knees to expose yourself, and he said-- the victim goes, "I just felt myself completely wet."

339
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 My lower half was wet, and the next thing I knew I was on fire.

340
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 Well, this guy did. He was some weirdo, serial nut job, serial killer, crazy lunatic arsonist who either-- who knows why he was doing this stuff? Who knows why he was doing this stuff?

341
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 But he was targeting gay men. He would spray lighter fluid on them, and then light them on fire, and then run out of the bathroom, and the guy would be completely burned.

342
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 And I remember, "Oh, I was reading this article. I was reading this book, and the guy was in the hospital recovering."

343
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 He's like, "I still have a penis, but it's just basically all scar tissue."

344
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 It's basically all scarred up. He goes, "Every time I get an erection, blood just shoots out of it."

345
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 Like, you know, you're trying to put water in a sieve. He didn't actually use that analogy, but he goes, "Every time I get an erection, because there would be holes in it."

346
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 It's just, "Pfft, pfft," which-- actually, now that I say that, why? How is he getting erections in the hospital to begin with?

347
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 But apparently he was, and he was horribly scarred from this.

348
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 Now, I don't know. Let's assume, because I'm an optimist, that eventually that all got cured, and he healed up, and he was able to live a total normal life.

349
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 But that's the real danger with hooking up with strangers.

350
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 Tinder, and Grindr, and all of these apps, and really any even match.com, OKCube, and all this stuff.

351
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 I've always been very, very nervous about just meeting people you don't--

352
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 But again, that's me. I'm from an older generation, but me, like, meeting people that I don't really know, or haven't been vetted through social circles.

353
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 Like, obviously, if I'm dating a girl that is at my work, I can assume she's passed the background check.

354
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 I can assume she's passed the drug test, or meeting someone who's in-- not in my social circle, but in one of my friend's social circles, they've kind of been vetted.

355
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 The idea of just going on the phone, picking a picture, going to hook up with that person.

356
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 I'm not going to say that I haven't done it, but it's definitely very, very-- I'm very paranoid about doing it.

357
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 I did have a blind date once, and it went so horribly. I told the girl I thought I was turning into a vampire, but--

358
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 And she didn't leave. I just wanted her to leave. I wanted her to be polite. I told her I felt my organs were shifting inside of me.

359
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 It was a disastrous blind date. I also told her I had a talking cookie in my fridge. She wouldn't leave. She would not leave.

360
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 I did have a cookie in my fridge. I didn't talk, but I did consider it one of my roommates. The point is, is that--

361
00:37:50,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 I don't try-- I don't like-- I don't obviously don't like going on blind dates and, um, like, using the phones, but back in-- back before there was even phones, you didn't even have that.

362
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 You couldn't even look at a picture. I mean, it's dangerous to pull out your phone and go, "Hmm, that's your age, and that's your geographical location vis-a-vis me.

363
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 I'm going to hook up with you." That's-- that's safer in a way than, "I'm going to stick my junk underneath this metal door to a total stranger in a public restroom."

364
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 Because, again, best case scenario is, you get off. Worst case scenario is, you get murdered or set on fire.

365
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 So whether it's an arcane combination of hand-waving and foot-tapping, that you honestly can do accidentally, guys, so be careful that will--

366
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 [laughs]

367
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 They have dudes trying to bang you, or ghosts that you can summon or just appear themselves in your stall, ready to take your soul to the underworld,

368
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 or even more terrifying, serial killers and maniacs in the stall next to you. You never know what you're going to run into in the bathroom.

369
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 When you go into the bathroom and you see someone's pooped all over the seat, it's all super disgusting, you kind of got to, like, grab stuff with your elbow and, like, throw paper down,

370
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 and it takes you a while to clean the seat up just so you can go to the bathroom. You're always dismayed and disgusted by that, but it could be worse.

371
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 It could be far, far worse. Admittedly, that's pretty disgusting, but it could be worse.

372
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 So I recommend, you guys, when you do use a public restroom, be vigilant.

373
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 Make sure, when you look in the mirror, there's not a suicide ghost behind you.

374
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 Before you wipe, just remember, don't pick any colors.

375
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 And, no matter how much you love that song that's playing on the radio, don't tap your feet.

376
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 Or you might get a surprise you didn't expect coming.

377
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
