1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 The Randonautica app is back for a follow-up.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 This time it leads people to a gruesome discovery.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Out in the middle of the Oregon Woods sits a box built for Bigfoot.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Then we take a trip to Italy to uncover a bizarre story.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 A man is on a walk with his friends, and then right before their eyes,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 banishes today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 I don't know if I'm a big-doll. Actually, I'm a walk big-doll.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 [Music]

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 We got a bunch of stuff to cover today, so we're gonna get started.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 First up, I want to give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, BigPodreg.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 BigPodreg, thank you so much for supporting the show.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 You are going to be our person in the cockpit.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 The pilot is determined. I'm looking for you. You're gonna be that dude today.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Just help get the word out about the show. That really, really helps out a lot.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Also, I have a merch store, Minecraft server. That's all in the show notes.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 The Minecraft is free. Just hop on in. Let's play.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 But first off, before we play, don't start playing just yet.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Or I guess you can play and listen at the same time. That's what most people do.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 BigPodreg, let's hop in the Dead Rabbit Robo. You're the captain.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 You don't have to row because you're a Patreon supporter.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Me, I'll row. We're rowing up to Duwamish Head.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 That is a place in Seattle, Washington.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Now, this was sent to me by two of my awesome listeners, Tressa with an R.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 I mispronounced her name last time. I never mispronounced names.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 So you're allowed to get one wrong every once in a while.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Tressa and Christian Dal Olmo.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Christian and Tressa, thank you so much for sending this over.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 It's an update to a story I did a while back on the Randonautica app.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Quick recap. Randonautica is an app that basically sends you to random locations based on...

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 It's like truly random. It uses quantum computing to figure out a place for you to go.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 I did a whole episode on it. I think it was episode 463,

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 "How to Hack the Universe." It was a very popular episode.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 You want a more detailed explanation, you can go to that.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 You can stop this podcast and listen to that one, but that's kind of an overview.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 This group of teenagers was using the Randonautica app,

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 and it sent them to a place called Duwamish Head,

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 and they recorded all of this. It's on their TikTok video.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 It's in the show notes. It was from this account, "Uggh Henry."

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 They go there and they find a suitcase, and in it were some garbage bags.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 They alerted the... It wasn't just a suitcase with garbage bags in it.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 It wasn't like that was suspicious.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 It was the fact that it was super smelly, and it was in the water.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 So they called the authorities. The authorities came out,

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 and there was body parts in the bag.

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 So basically Randonautica sent this group of meddling kids

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 to interfere with the serial killers' plans.

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 A little more gruesome than your average episode of Scooby-Doo, but that's what happened.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 So there's this thing like, isn't that weird how Randonautica would like,

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 randomly send them to this location?

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Were they there to find that and so on and so forth?

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 And then there's another viral video on TikTok.

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 This one is put out by TikTok account user, "Hello there, love."

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 It's also in the show notes.

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Someone else was using the Randonautica app in California,

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 and it directed them to a street corner, and there they ran into a crazy lady,

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 possibly homeless. I don't know for sure.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 She might own a high-rise apartment building,

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 but she had a shopping cart in the middle of a residential neighborhood.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 That's usually a sign you're homeless.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Normally people aren't like, "Honey, I'm home!"

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 They're walking with their whole shopping cart.

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Normally, if you're not in a shopping-mart area,

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 and you have a shopping cart, you're homeless.

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 But anyways, this other group of people were using Randonautica.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 It sent them to this location, completely randomized location.

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Sent them there. There's a crazy lady.

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Allegedly, she might again have a PhD in engineering.

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 I don't know, she just looked crazy.

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 She's staring at these people with a shopping cart,

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 and in the shopping cart is a black suitcase,

75
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 of a similar design to the suitcase found in Washington.

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 So, coincidence, most likely.

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 I mean, Randonautica, it's going to send you everywhere,

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 and eventually you're going to find two different people's suitcases.

79
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 But that's kind of the implication.

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Isn't it weird that these group of kids in Seattle,

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 they're directed to them to a suitcase full of human remains,

82
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 and then this group of people got directed in California

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 to a crazy lady with a similar-looking black suitcase.

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 It's an interesting story, and Tressa and Christian,

85
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 thanks for sending it over.

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 I think there's an even more interesting little avenue we can go on.

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Let's put on our conspiracy caps here.

88
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 If you'll remember on that episode I did, How to Hack the Universe,

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 I said that the universe has a plan,

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 and when you start doing stuff at the quantum level,

91
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 when you're upsetting the universe's plan,

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 who knows what's going to happen?

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 You're throwing a monkey wrench into the great machinations of the universe.

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 What if these kids do uncover a serial killer?

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 They found this suitcase randomly,

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 because they would not have gone to this location

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 had Rando Nautica not randomly sent them there.

98
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 And eventually, by the time the cops got there,

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 the tide had risen and the suitcase had already washed back out to sea.

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 It could have just washed away forever, right?

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 What if Rando Nautica...

102
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Conspiracy cap fully on,

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 what if this serial killer, because that's what Seattle police are thinking now,

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 they don't know how many...

105
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 They just have a bag of body parts.

106
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 They don't know if they're male or female body parts.

107
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 They don't know if it's more than one person.

108
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 But what if this serial killer, assuming there is one,

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 was not supposed to get caught?

110
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 What if this serial killer was supposed to operate

111
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 unknowing for like two or three years,

112
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 and then eventually get caught and all this other stuff would happen,

113
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 but because the universe had a plan

114
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 and this group of literal meddling kids interfered with it,

115
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 and the serial killer gets caught two years earlier than they were supposed to?

116
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Weird thought, right?

117
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Which is good, I'm not saying...

118
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 No, no, let the serial killers do what they need to do.

119
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Let them, you know, just...

120
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 They're just doing their own thing.

121
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 We want to catch them as soon as possible,

122
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 but it's interesting to think that if the universe had a plan for this killer to go on and on,

123
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 but quantum mechanics upset that plan,

124
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 that's an interesting way to look at it.

125
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 It could be possible that eventually there's a...

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 Now this dude's door and these police are like,

127
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 "Hey, sir, listen, this is gonna sound nuts,

128
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 but there was a serial killer we found out he was coming to kill you,

129
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 but we caught him because these kids found these body parts in a suitcase."

130
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 And the guy's like, "Woo, that's close, man.

131
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 I almost got killed by a serial killer," and the police are like, "Yes,

132
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 but now you're safe," and the police are walking away and they're like,

133
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 "Sir, what's your name again?"

134
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Even though we came to your address,

135
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 even though we obviously know who you are for narrative purposes,

136
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 "What's your name again?"

137
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 And the guy looks at the police and he goes, "My name's Christ,

138
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Mr. Antichrist."

139
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 And then he stares at the camera.

140
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 So basically the implication of that made-up story is

141
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 one of the serial killers was supposed to eventually kill the Antichrist,

142
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 but these kids found the backpack.

143
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 I don't know.

144
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 The point is that I'm glad that these body parts were found,

145
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 but it would be interesting to think like,

146
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 what if this evil person was supposed to be continuing to do stuff,

147
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 and maybe Rando Nautica really will upset the gears of the universe.

148
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Who knows?

149
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 But again, I am not pro serial killers.

150
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Well, maybe eventually they'll kill the Antichrist.

151
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Let's just let them keep slaughtering people, catch them as soon as possible,

152
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 but again, I think it's an interesting story.

153
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 Big podrig, let's hop- let's leave behind the dead-rab-robot.

154
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 It smells like body parts.

155
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 We are headed out to Oregon.

156
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 So actually, let's get back into it.

157
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 We can stand on the smell.

158
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 We'll just row back on down to Oregon.

159
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 We're typically headed to the Siskiyuu National Forest.

160
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Siskiyuu National Forest.

161
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 It's in Jackson County, Oregon.

162
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 We're rowing on down there.

163
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 So we'll hold our nose with one hand, we'll row with the other,

164
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 we're headed down there to Jackson County, Oregon.

165
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Now this story was recommended to me by Austin Bergen from YouTube,

166
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 so I really appreciate this recommendation.

167
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 We docked the boat.

168
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Now we got to hike through the woods for a while.

169
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 It's fine. It's a beautiful day out.

170
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 We get to this little tiny place in the forest, right?

171
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 I know that's super specific.

172
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 Don't try looking for this place yourself without getting a map.

173
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 But anyways, we walk through the forest.

174
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 There's big old trees and stuff like that.

175
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 There's bears taking naps.

176
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 And then we see this giant box in the woods.

177
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 It's 10 by 10 feet.

178
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Not inches, because that's totally different.

179
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 I'll catch something different.

180
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Nothing. It'll catch a grasshopper.

181
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 There's a box that's 10 feet by 10 feet.

182
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 And it has giant telephone poles for legs, for posts, I think,

183
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 is the actual term.

184
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Don't have me on your construction site.

185
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 It's in the ground.

186
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 It's this giant thing.

187
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 And it's all old and stuff.

188
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 It's been there for a while.

189
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 It was actually built in 1974.

190
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 It's two years older than me.

191
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 And we're walking and we see it.

192
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 There's this giant door.

193
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 It's a palace, okay?

194
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 I don't know why.

195
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 It's like it has four sides to it.

196
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 You guys get it.

197
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 It's a box.

198
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 It has this giant door on it.

199
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 And we smell something.

200
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Gross.

201
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 We've got to start holding our noses again.

202
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Inside this box, even though it's broad daylight,

203
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 it's super spooky and dark inside the box,

204
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 there's a rope hanging there.

205
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 And inside it is a dead rabbit, all skinned and stuff,

206
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 just kind of...

207
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 just kind of swaying in the wind.

208
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 At this point, I look at Big Podrig and he looks at me

209
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 and we push you inside the box and we go,

210
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 "This is for investigative purposes."

211
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 We push you inside the box.

212
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 "No, no, no!"

213
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 You go in and you're like,

214
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 "Well, since I'm in here,

215
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 I have always been curious about what rabbit tastes like."

216
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 And then the door slams shut.

217
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 And now you, if you pick number one,

218
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 you are in the Big Foot Trap.

219
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 This is an actual real thing that was built back in 1974.

220
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 The North American Wildlife Research Team,

221
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 they found a single footprint in some dude's garden.

222
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 And they go, "Okay, based on their magnifying glasses,"

223
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 and they're like, "Based on this one footprint,

224
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 let's build a giant box in the middle of the forest."

225
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 It's a Big Foot Trap.

226
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 They put rabbits in it and they have this door in it.

227
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Again, you guys know what a house is.

228
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 It's shaped like a house.

229
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 It doesn't have like a couch and a swimming pool,

230
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 but it has a dead rabbit in it,

231
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 which makes it the best house.

232
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 And the idea is that Big Foot would walk into the house

233
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 and go, "Mmm, rabbit are..."

234
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 and then the door would slam shut and he'd be trapped.

235
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Now, you think, "Okay, great.

236
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Now you have a house in the middle of nowhere

237
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 with a giant monster inside of it. What do you do?"

238
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 Well, they actually thought ahead,

239
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 which is actually more than I was giving them credit for.

240
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 They thought ahead for this.

241
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 They were going to have a tranquilizer gun there.

242
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Not inside the room.

243
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 That would be like Laurel and Hardy.

244
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 They're like, "Yay, we trapped Big Foot. Yay!"

245
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Now it's just time to trank it.

246
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Laurel, where'd you put the trank gun?

247
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 "Well, I'm sorry, Hardy."

248
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 I don't know those characters anyways.

249
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Now he has to go in there.

250
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 He has to dress up like Big Foot and sneak in there.

251
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 A sexy Big Foot.

252
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 They had a tranquilizer gun on the outside of the house.

253
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 So what happened is they trapped Big Foot in there.

254
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 This was the idea.

255
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 And then they'd shoot it with the trank gun.

256
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Now you just have an 800-pound monster in the middle of the woods.

257
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 You had a transport.

258
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 They actually had a sled nearby.

259
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 So they're like, "Weee!"

260
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 and they can go down this hill.

261
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 But when they're not using it for that,

262
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 they would actually...

263
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 the plan was to load Big Foot up on the sled

264
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 and then carry it to a truck.

265
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 In case the tranks wore off early,

266
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 because you know it's a mythical creature.

267
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 For all you know, they won't work at all.

268
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 They also had handcuffs.

269
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 They called manacles for it.

270
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 So in their mind's eye, they imagine

271
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Big Foot being dumb enough,

272
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 being smart enough to hide its tracks

273
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 and bury its own dead

274
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 and leave no real evidence of its existence for hundreds of years,

275
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 but would be dumb enough to go,

276
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 "Mmm, rabbit on rope, my favorite art!"

277
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 and set off the trap.

278
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 In their mind's eye, they thought,

279
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 "We catch 'em, we'll take 'em back."

280
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 And actually, they didn't...

281
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Now that I think about it,

282
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 they weren't gonna like take 'em to a zoo.

283
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 I remember reading,

284
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 and this is my job to take notes and remember stuff.

285
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 They were gonna shoot 'em with a tranquilizer gun

286
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 and cage 'em up for a bit,

287
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 but their goal was to tag him

288
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 and then follow him around.

289
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 So the plan wasn't to lock 'em up in a cage.

290
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 The plan was just to stalk him

291
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 and find his family members,

292
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 maybe put them in cages.

293
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Now that I'm thinking about it,

294
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 that was the end goal.

295
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 So you tag Bigfoot and you let him out.

296
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 He wakes up, he's trapped to a sled,

297
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 he's manacled, you let him out,

298
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 you don't get murdered by Bigfoot,

299
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 he runs away.

300
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Then he goes home and he's like,

301
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 "You no believe day I have.

302
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Me just simply want to eat rabbit."

303
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 And they're like,

304
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 "Was it another rabbit on the rope?

305
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Everyone else in the Bigfoot family speaks normal.

306
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 This is just main Bigfoot.

307
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 The Bigfoot has this speech in bed of men."

308
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 And he's like,

309
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 "Ugh, yeah, rabbit on rope, delicacy."

310
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 And they're like, "No, it's not.

311
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 It's just one skinned, rotted, no complain."

312
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Me read newspaper.

313
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 So, then what?

314
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 Then they go to the house

315
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 and there's a bunch of creepy dudes in the woods

316
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 being like, "Ugh, yeah, look at all them Bigfoots."

317
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Dude, they then tag those Bigfoots

318
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 and see if they have extended families.

319
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 They're related to the swamp ape in Louisiana.

320
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 They go visit during the summer.

321
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Then what?

322
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 I mean, I guess then what is the proof

323
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 of mythological creatures existing,

324
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 but why not just take the Bigfoot?

325
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 The Bigfoot you capture

326
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 and take him to the zoo,

327
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 or a bunch of pictures of you next to his unconscious body.

328
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 Whatever, whatever.

329
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Anything, they tag him

330
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 and they're just gonna let him walk away.

331
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Would you get a Bigfoot smart enough

332
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 to cover up his tracks?

333
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 I think he'd look down at his arm and be like,

334
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 "Ugh, this is not part of anatomy."

335
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 "Ugh," and rip the tracking device out.

336
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 But anyways, I guess it's fair to say

337
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 they never worked because we don't have

338
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 proof of Bigfoot.

339
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 The box did catch a couple bears, though.

340
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 That way they knew it worked.

341
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 So, imagine this.

342
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Imagine this scenario.

343
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 A bunch of Bigfoot hunters, right?

344
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Have now contained

345
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 a black bear in a box

346
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 in a 10 foot, 10 box.

347
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 A black bear, mind you,

348
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 that has just been fed.

349
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 And you go, "Well, then he's not hungry."

350
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 "Uh-uh-uh, now he is the strength of a bear

351
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 and the speed of a rabbit."

352
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 'Cause he just ate the rabbit.

353
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 In a box!

354
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 They caught multiple bears in this thing,

355
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 so they knew it worked,

356
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 but then you have to release the bear.

357
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 I don't think they're like,

358
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 "Oh, you got those handcuffs, Laurel?"

359
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 No, no!

360
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 You would just, whoever lost the coin toss,

361
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 had to like, run up.

362
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 I don't even know how you would let a bear

363
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 out of a giant box.

364
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Or why you would, I would just be like,

365
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 "Well, I guess that bear's dead.

366
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Let's just leave him locked in the box forever."

367
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 And then maybe he'll be bait for Bigfoot.

368
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Eventually there's just nothing but bear carcasses in there.

369
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 Bigfoot walks by and goes,

370
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 "Mmm, me really like rabbit, but no room!

371
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 No room for Bigfoot to eat it."

372
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 And just walks by.

373
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 So, yes.

374
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 It's now, what happened was,

375
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 the park service goes,

376
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 "Uh-uh-uh, yeah, that can't.

377
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 That can't exist anymore."

378
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 It still is there,

379
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 but they bolted the door shut.

380
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 Or open, actually.

381
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 It wouldn't be no fun if it was just a box in the woods.

382
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 They bolted it open, so you can go there.

383
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 They actually give directions online.

384
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 You can go there,

385
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 you can kinda look in a big old empty box.

386
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 It smells like dead rabbit and bear feces.

387
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 I'm sure there's a hobo living in it now,

388
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 so only go during the daytime.

389
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Um...

390
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Or don't!

391
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 I mean, it's not like hobos disappear during the day.

392
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 They're like, "Oh no, the sun's coming up.

393
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 I'm going into the fifth dimension!"

394
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 And they just kind of dissolve.

395
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Now they're in another realm until the moon appears

396
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 and they come back in our world.

397
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 There can still be hobos living in it during the day.

398
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Don't, if you go there and get attacked by a random hobo,

399
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 don't sue me for me saying, "Oh, you'll be safe."

400
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 It's probably still extremely--

401
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 There's bears in the area, at the very least.

402
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Right?

403
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 So, I mean, that's dangerous too.

404
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 But anyway, so it does still exist.

405
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 Park Service now does maintenance on it,

406
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 'cause people do go there to check it out.

407
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 So yeah, there you go.

408
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Bigfoot Trap.

409
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 It's actually the only known Bigfoot Trap

410
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 in North America.

411
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 It might be the only one in the world.

412
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 But, um, it didn't--

413
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 I mean, is it really called a Bigfoot Trap?

414
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 It didn't catch a Bigfoot.

415
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 That is one of the great philosophical questions

416
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 you can ask someone.

417
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Whenever someone's trying to blow your mind

418
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 when you're smoking weed, you can say,

419
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 "Is a Bigfoot Trap really a Bigfoot Trap?"

420
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 If a Bigfoot is never trapped inside of it.

421
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Whoa, dude.

422
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 And if an umbrella had like a hole in it,

423
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 is it still an umbrella?

424
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Whoa, dude.

425
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 You can blow their minds.

426
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 You can blow their minds.

427
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 So let's go ahead, though.

428
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Our minds are gonna be blowing on our next story.

429
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Big Podrick.

430
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Let's hop in that carpenter copter.

431
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 We're headed out to Italia, good old Italy,

432
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 flying on out there.

433
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 We're going back in time, too, so...

434
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 [imitates flying]

435
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 We're flying through the ether.

436
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 We see a bunch of five-dimensional hobos.

437
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 They're trying to panhandle on the way.

438
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 "No, no, no, roll your windows up.

439
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Pretend you don't see them.

440
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Pretend you don't see them."

441
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 [imitates flying]

442
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 We're back in the mortal realm.

443
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 It's made--

444
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 This is an interesting story.

445
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 Before I even get into dates.

446
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 This is an interesting story.

447
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 I got this from UFO Insight, was my main source.

448
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 They got it from a Russian website

449
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 that's translating an Italian story.

450
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 It's very, very interesting.

451
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Now, there's two or three details that are in dispute,

452
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 even when we look at the original Italian story

453
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 that the Russian site was talking about.

454
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 And those were the dates and the location.

455
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 And they're not so vast that it ruins the story.

456
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 It's interesting.

457
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 This story takes place on either May 3rd, 1753,

458
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 or May 3rd, 1756.

459
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 Bizarre, bizarre detail

460
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 that the day is exactly the same but different year.

461
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 It takes place in a city called Toscana,

462
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 but supposedly in or near Sicily, in Italy.

463
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 But there doesn't seem to be a city with this real name.

464
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 People have tried trying to find this city.

465
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 So those are kind of interesting details.

466
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 It may make it a work of fiction,

467
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 but it does seem to be a much older story.

468
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 It could be an Italian fable

469
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 that's just kind of passed through the era.

470
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 But even then, the story is still very obscure.

471
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 I'd never heard about this before.

472
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 I got this from the UFO Insight article.

473
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 "Demons, Angels, or Aliens,

474
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 the account of Alberto Gordini and the Devil's Trap."

475
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 So big podric, we're going to land that carbonicopter.

476
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 We're walking around Sicily.

477
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 We're buying some Italian furniture and stuff like that.

478
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 We're underneath the Tuscan Sun.

479
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 We're soaking up those beams,

480
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 getting in that sweet, sweet vitamin D.

481
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 And as we're there, we see Alberto Gordini walking around.

482
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Now, he's just a gardener.

483
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 He's just not even gardening at this point.

484
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Is a gardener really a gardener if he never gardens?

485
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Whoa, dude!

486
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 Alberto Gordini's walking around.

487
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 He's with a group of people, his wife, a couple other dudes,

488
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 including the Duke of Zanini.

489
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 And we didn't know the Duke was going to be here.

490
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 We stand up, we got to salute the Duke.

491
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 As he's passing, he kind of gives us one of those hand waves

492
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 and we sit back down in our Italian furniture.

493
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 They're walking around the town square area.

494
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 And so they're all talking.

495
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 They're having a good old time, just chatting it up.

496
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 And they're talking, everyone's kind of looking,

497
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 and wife looks over at Alberto,

498
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 and Alberto looks at his wife,

499
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 and she sees that little look in his eye.

500
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 It was the look that he gave her the first time they met.

501
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 She knows even this late in life he's still in love.

502
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 And then she kind of looks because of butterfly, grabs her attention,

503
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 she looks away briefly, she turns back to her husband,

504
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 and he's gone.

505
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 Now around the same time everyone else in the crowd realized this,

506
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 wait a second, wasn't there another guy here?

507
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 It wasn't a massive crowd of people,

508
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 it was just a couple of friends walking through this town square.

509
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 What? Where'd he go?

510
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 Hot spring sun is bearing down on their skin.

511
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 What? How did that happen, dude?

512
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 Where did he go? Everyone's kind of like flustered and stuff like that.

513
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Now your first impol- I didn't think about this,

514
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 but because I'm- I'm a weirdo, so I immediately would have went time warp,

515
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 but a rational person, if you're walking through an area and someone disappears,

516
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 they figure, sinkhole!

517
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 He must have fallen somewhere, so they immediately begin digging up the area.

518
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 They don't find him. What? Digging, digging.

519
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 Can't find him.

520
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Bring out Dig Dug, he's digging, digging, blowing stuff up.

521
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 I don't know how long they dug, it could have been like it was nighttime and the wife is still digging,

522
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 and they're like, "Mrs. Gordini, it's time to go," and she's still digging,

523
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 her hands are getting all bloody, her fingernails are all dirty and stuff,

524
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 and they're like, "Mrs. Gordini, it's time to go," and they're like pulling her away.

525
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 I don't know how long they dug for, they could just kick the dirt around for a bit and be like,

526
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 "Yeah, he's gone, he lived a good life," or they could have brought out like people with shovels, who knows,

527
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 but the point is they tried to find him, he disappeared in the middle of the day,

528
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 having a conversation with these people.

529
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 22 years later, town had moved on, life had moved on,

530
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 his wife most likely had moved on, found someone else to manja with,

531
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 and then, boop, Alberto Gordini just appears, exactly where he was standing before.

532
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 What? Oh, man, that sun looks like it's 22 years older, it feels way hotter, it feels 22 years hotter.

533
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 What's going on? Everyone in town is like, actually by then, a lot of people probably didn't even know who this dude was.

534
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 The whole city's gardens were overrun, if we only had a gardener.

535
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Have you disappeared for 22 years and popped back up in the same location?

536
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 It's not like they were even looking for this guy, he just fell in a hole as far as they knew.

537
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 You don't put up missing people posters for people who fell in holes, it's not,

538
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 you just look in the hole and either they're there or they're dead.

539
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 I don't think there was posters of his face around being like, be on the lookout for this dude who fell in a hole.

540
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 Like, I think at that point everyone just thought he died, but, so he pops up in a town,

541
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 there were people walking around who are adults, who weren't even born when he disappeared, 22 years, it's a long time.

542
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 So he ends up being like, what is going on? Timmy, what day is it? And they'll be like, what? It's May 3rd, sir.

543
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 It's 17 and he's like, yes, I've only been out for a day. It's 1775.

544
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 And he's like, why do you have to say it so slow to give my hopes up?

545
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 I don't know, sir, I'm just a little Tim, a little tiny Italian Tim.

546
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 You're 22 years he'd been there. Now, of course, he starts telling people what happened and they think he's nuts.

547
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 First off, they don't think that this the real dude, they go, that's impossible, you can't just fall in a hole.

548
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 We dug for a while, and sir, I shifted from side to side because they barely dug at all.

549
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 They're like, dude, we dug so much and then like, we filled it back in perfectly. You couldn't even tell we dug.

550
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 That's how much we dug. He's a little suspicious on the rescue efforts, but they don't believe him.

551
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 And when he's telling the story of what happened to him in the past 22 years, he keeps saying, I feel like I've only been gone for a couple of minutes.

552
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 And they're like, well, if you are who you say you are, you've been gone for 22 years.

553
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 Now, his wife doesn't reappear in the story. So I'm pretty sure she either died or got remarried in left town,

554
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 which if you were walking through town and someone magically disappeared in front of you, I would move too, right?

555
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Like, I don't care how good my job is. If I was like, well, you know, I really like the job and the 401(k) is great,

556
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 but I could also magically disappear at any moment. I think I can find somewhere else.

557
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 I think I will take a pay cut to not dissolve into thin air.

558
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 So she doesn't show back up. Anyways, everyone in town thinks he's a lunatic at this point because he's talking about this weird story of where he was at.

559
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 And so 10 years pass and everyone in town is just like, oh, great. They seem walking down the street.

560
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 They're like crossing this. They're like trying to cross the street. They're like, oh man, I wish cars were invented.

561
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 So I could get in one and drive. Oh, hey, Alberto. How are you doing?

562
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 You guys won't believe what happened. Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm the portal and all that. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

563
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 Great. Looking at their watch. Did they have watches back then? Looking at their sundial. They're not that old. They're not Egyptians.

564
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 Anyway, somewhere between a watch and a sundial. It was a watch dial.

565
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 Eventually, though, a priest, a local priest named Father Mario gets involved in the story.

566
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 He's been hearing stuff about this. He's like, what? There's like this guy disappeared 22 years ago and supposedly he's back.

567
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 That's weird. I mean, I think that's underselling. It is obviously weird. And people are like, yeah, yeah, but that's all he talks about.

568
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 I think he's nuts. Like obviously that didn't happen. That's impossible.

569
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 So Father Mario, though, tracks him down and goes, I want to hear your story. And Alberto's like, really?

570
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 Are you not going to walk away? You're not going to try to invent the automobile while I'm talking? No, no, no.

571
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 I want to hear your story. So finally, Alberto feels comfortable.

572
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Someone wants to hear his story in full. This is the story he tells. He's walking through the city with his wife and his friends.

573
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 He sees a couple of dapper-looking people sitting in an Italian furniture on the side of the street saluting the Duke.

574
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 And then he's in a tunnel. He's in a pitch-black tunnel.

575
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 At the very end, he sees a white light. And at that point, he's probably thinking, oh, great, dude.

576
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 I was halfway done doing a crossword puzzle. I can't die now.

577
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 And he's walking through the tunnel.

578
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 He gets to the end of the tunnel where the white light is. And as he's walking through the tunnel, he starts to see what he described as, quote, "weird mechanisms."

579
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Those are those watch dials I've heard so much about. He's looking at all this stuff on the side.

580
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 He then sees a large canvas covered in stars and dots.

581
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 Now, that's interesting visual because how would you explain a flat-screen television set to someone from the 1700s?

582
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Like, you would look like a view screen of a spaceship. It would look like a canvas.

583
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 That would be the best way to say it, a canvas with dots and stars.

584
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 So it's possible that now he's in some sort of alien vehicle. He's somewhere.

585
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 He's definitely not in a sinkhole. He's somewhere. He said that it seemed to pulsate with life.

586
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 Now, there's no television that does that, but I do think it's interesting.

587
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 The canvas, a flat screen without like space and stuff on it would look like you would describe it as a canvas.

588
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 Now he's in this room. He's at the end of the tunnel. He's in this big room.

589
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 And there he sees a woman, a tall, thin woman. I almost said blonde woman, but then her hair wasn't actually described.

590
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 That was just my own fetish. I'm like, and she was blonde. They were all blonde.

591
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 It was a tall, thin human-like figure with long hair. That's the actual description.

592
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 I don't know if she was a blonde. It was a woman, though.

593
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 And she turns around and she sees this dude and she's like, "Oh, great. You're not supposed to be here. You're not supposed to be here."

594
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 She tells him that he fell through a crack of time and space, and it would be, quote, "very difficult" to get him back to his own time.

595
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 So apparently that was an interesting comment for her to make because it means that this has happened before.

596
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 It's not like she turned around and went, "Oh my God, what are you? Are you some sort of biological entity?"

597
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 And she's like poking him with a stick. "I don't know how we're going to get you home. I don't even know what your home is. What are we going to..."

598
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 She turns around and she looks at him and she goes, "Okay, here's what happened. You fell through a crack in time. It's going to be really hard to get you home."

599
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 So it implies that she... this isn't her first human interloper.

600
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 So he goes, "Okay, I want to get back home." Like he began saying, "I got to get back home. This crossword puzzle is halfway finished.

601
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 I really need to know what a four-letter word is for mucus." And she's like, "Well, we'll try, but it's going to take you a while. It's not going to be super easy."

602
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 But while you're here, let me explain what this place is. She said it was a place for souls without flesh and body and the eternally young.

603
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 Now, when you think of those two terms, eternally young and souls without flesh and body, I immediately think of a holding area for souls.

604
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 Eternally young, I think a little like baby people, right?

605
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 So little Casper ghosts get ready to go inside babies so they can have life.

606
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 And then, souls without flesh and body is like a waiting room, either waiting to be reincarnated or to move on to the afterlife.

607
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 So it's almost like a purgatory type thing. She also mentions flying cities.

608
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 So basically, he meets this woman, this hot blonde, he meets this hot interdimensional blonde, and she goes, "You're in a place full of the eternally young souls without bodies,

609
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 and there's flying cities." She's kind of naming this stuff off, and he's just like, "Home, home, home, home."

610
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 And she's like, "Well, let me tell you a little bit more about how death in the afterlife, home, home, you just want to go home so bad."

611
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 She's like, "You don't want to hear about the flying cities, home, home, fine, fine, I will do my best to try to get you home."

612
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 But those flying cities are pretty, home, home, fine.

613
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 Okay, quick chanting that. "We're in a world without time and space, and you're very, very annoying."

614
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 He just appears back in time. So when she said it's going to take a long time to get him home, it wasn't a long time in that universe.

615
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 It was a long time in our universe.

616
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 He tells the story of Father Mario's like, "That's dope. Now, I need to know where this place is at. Can you show me exactly where this place is at?"

617
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 And Alberta's like, "Yeah, yeah, I know where it's at. It's like right downtown. You take a left at the Windys, go five blocks, we're there."

618
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 They're walking down the street, they're eating Frosties and the hot spring sun of Italy.

619
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 And they get to the town square and Father goes, "So where, where were you when this happened?"

620
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 And Alberta goes, "Oh, oh, yeah, here let me show you." And he walks and he goes, "I was right..."

621
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 Disappears, right in front of Father Mario.

622
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 Father Mario was luckily holding his Frosty. So now he has two Frosties.

623
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 But unfortunately, he might have let a man back to another dimension.

624
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 So Father Mario actually had a fence erected around this area and it had a sign put on it saying, "The Devil's Trap."

625
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 So what it was labeled. So now you can't even walk there.

626
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 It's an interesting story and it's one that we don't know.

627
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Obviously, your first inclination is, "Well, let's go there, right? Let's try jumping in this trap."

628
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 We have an Italian story that was translated from Italian to Russian from Russian to English.

629
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 And two of the key details that we really need are the exact date.

630
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 But even more important is the city.

631
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 Like, is there a sign there that says, "The Devil's Trap."

632
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 In Italy is the... The story is... There may very well be, but the story is so obscure.

633
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 Even if you lived in that city, you may think it's a local rumor, or you may not even know it exists.

634
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 But what it seems like, and they tried tracking it down, they go, "The city could have used to been named this, or it could be this."

635
00:30:52,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 We don't know. But it's possible in Italy, there is a little spot in the middle of the town square with a gated fence that says, "The Devil's Trap" on it.

636
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 With a warning not to go in there.

637
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 It's also interesting to note that it's obviously been more than 22 years since this happened.

638
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 It's possible that... Again, assuming the story is true, it could just be a fable. It definitely sounds fantastic, but it's possible that Alberto went back to that dimension.

639
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 The blonde woman turns around and was like, "Seriously, dude? Why? I was just showing Father Mario, man! He wanted me to show him where it was at!"

640
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 And he immediately was like, "No, my Frosty!"

641
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 So that's possible, right? It's also possible that he went back, did come back 22 years later, and was just like, "I'm moving. I'm not going to track down Father Mario."

642
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 Because the story is he was never seen again, but it's possible that he may have popped back up 22 years later, or a couple years later, or 100 years later, or whatever, and just left.

643
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 Because he's like, "I'm out of here." What if he appeared and there was a fence around him, and he's like, "No! I can't step over this four-foot fence!"

644
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 And there's just a pile of bones there, big-foot walking by, being like, "Mmm-mm-mm."

645
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 Finishing his crossword puzzle, laughing, "Hahaha! Four-lead wood from Lucas's snot!" Walks past him.

646
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 So, if you live in Italy, and you're not doing anything this summer, visit every city in your country, especially around Sicily.

647
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 Visit every city around Sicily. See if you can find a little gated area known as the Devil's Trap.

648
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 And if you do, are you brave enough to step inside of it?

649
