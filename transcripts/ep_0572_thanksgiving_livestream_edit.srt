00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Hey everyone, this is Jason Carpenter, the host of Dead Rabbit Radio, and the episode you're about to listen to is

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,240
 our Thanksgiving live stream episode. It is a full episode. It has three really cool stories.

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,960
 It is a full episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. The reason why it's so long is afterwards we did a

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,920
 about an hour and a half long answer and question, or is it a question and answer session?

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,460
 No, I give the answers and then you're like, "Whoa, how did you know what my question was gonna be?"

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,940
 So this is a full episode of Dead Rabbit Radio with a bunch of bonus content.

7
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,060
 I hope you guys enjoy and I hope you guys had an awesome Thanksgiving.

8
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:43,500
 A contest in the Philippines is supposed to bring joy to the country and instead it brings deadly riots.

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,660
 A man driving his car down the road

10
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,920
 has a close encounter of the

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,200
 turned kind, because like the cars are turning, stuff like that.

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,580
 And then

13
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,580
 we travel

14
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,900
 to the world of sci-fi.

15
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,500
 Is it possible that there really is a pair of glasses out there

16
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,660
 that will allow you to see aliens on Earth today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

17
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:24,540
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

18
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,700
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day, too.

19
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,180
 I hope you guys are having an awesome Thanksgiving.

20
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:36,500
 The way I think we're gonna do this segment is I'm going to go over the story, then

21
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,660
 maybe take a little break and look at your comments and things like that. Hey Peter.

22
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:46,500
 And we will go from there. We'll just kind of be flexible with it. But first off,

23
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,660
 let us go ahead. I didn't have someone picked out to fly anything in this. Hey, Fehu.

24
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:58,480
 So we're just all gonna hop on board. We got no pilot. It's totally autopilot. This time should have installed this.

25
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,820
 Let's hop on board the

26
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,260
 Dead Rabbit Rowboat. We are headed out to the Philippines.

27
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:13,020
 We're rowing. We're rowing and stuff like that. My back's all hurting. So I'm assuming you guys are actually rowing.

28
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,180
 I'm just gonna sit back drinking some sparkly and ice caffeine.

29
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:25,980
 Mmm. That's one thing that gets edited out of the podcast is my constant drinking of stuff.

30
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,940
 Constant drinking of stuff. Hey, comfy.

31
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,500
 So

32
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,740
 We're going to the Philippines. The year is 1992.

33
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:42,700
 And PepsiCo in the Philippines has a problem. They're looking at their spreadsheets. They're looking at all of their stuff.

34
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,620
 And they go,

35
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,300
 This is shocking actually. I didn't know a major company could be this sucky.

36
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,420
 Pepsi only covered

37
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,940
 4% of the market share in the Philippines, which is nothing.

38
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,900
 I probably have 4% of the market share in the Philippines and I don't even make soft drinks.

39
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,900
 So

40
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:07,340
 they were like, okay, this guy in Oregon makes more money than we do in the Philippines.

41
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:12,300
 Let's decide to have a lottery. They did this in South America and it was a huge hit.

42
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,500
 So they go, let's do it in the Philippines, you know, we're over there.

43
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,540
 So they have this thing that if you bought a Pepsi

44
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:26,460
 a 7up or a Miranda drink, I'm assuming that's some sort of drink, not just a person named Miranda who works at PepsiCo.

45
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:33,340
 On the caps, they had a three-digit number from 001 to 999.

46
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:39,660
 And it's a lottery basically. We've all done this. I mean, uh, Coca-Cola. I remember I used to have this

47
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:45,500
 scam. Don't tell anyone. It's probably past the statute limit. It's probably not even a crime now that I think of it.

48
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,860
 I used to

49
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:55,260
 live off of free Coca-Cola's. What's up, Stuart? I used to fall off of clean free Coca-Cola's

50
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,940
 and they had a thing where now they have QR codes and see what things you got to enter into the computer.

51
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,980
 Thank you, Rampart. Really, really appreciate that. That is awesome.

52
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,140
 Um,

53
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:12,060
 I used to they had a little thing that was a free Coca-Cola and I was super poor at the time

54
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,460
 and I would

55
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:21,900
 Go to the store and I would just look I tilt them. I tilt them somehow I evolved like they were designed not to do that

56
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,860
 Thank you, Wesley. They were designed not to do that

57
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,620
 You should just have to be able to see but somehow is able to figure it out

58
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:35,580
 Um, so basically this is what is going on there except without all the rampant fraud

59
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,220
 except without me trying to break the system

60
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,540
 Now in the Philippines

61
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:49,020
 They use the peso and you could win anywhere from 100 pesos. So you buy us Miranda

62
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,660
 which historical hiker just said is like an orange drink

63
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,300
 You can buy a Miranda drink

64
00:04:54,300 --> 00:05:01,100
 And you could win 100 pesos which is about four dollars

65
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:08,860
 Now the average daily wage in the Philippines at the time was about four dollars. There was 118 pesos

66
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,620
 so imagine if you could buy a drink and

67
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,740
 You'd earn a day's wage. That's huge, right?

68
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,100
 But that was just one of the lower in prices

69
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:26,300
 The number the number one prize was one million pesos

70
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,500
 And there'd be a 40 000 in us cash at the time

71
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,660
 Which was the equivalent to 23 years of work

72
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,220
 so of course

73
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,260
 Everyone was buying these drinks. Could you imagine buying a drink? I mean even just get one

74
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:48,540
 One day off basically but to get 23 years worth of days off for buying a Pepsi

75
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,780
 And if you lose you still have a delicious Pepsi

76
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:54,460
 Their market share went from 4 to 25 percent

77
00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:00,940
 They didn't corner the market, but they had a corner of the market. Which is just as good, right? It's not as great, but it's pretty good

78
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,780
 May 2nd 1992

79
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,700
 Wait, let me back up. This is where I would do a cut

80
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,660
 So the way that the way that the price was done

81
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:17,420
 Was that they had them made it a factory. It was super secure. They had them made it a factory

82
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:23,740
 And you had a three digit code and then a security confirmation code to keep counterfeiting down

83
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,060
 You would be able to match up that bottle with that security code

84
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:37,180
 May 2nd 1992 the daily number is announced. It is 349. So check your check your bottle caps guys

85
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,620
 Check your Pepsi and your Miranda bottle caps if you have one

86
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:49,180
 The number is 349 it's announced on the news. It's a huge deal in this country

87
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,500
 but

88
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,780
 There was a computer that number wasn't supposed to be

89
00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:01,260
 That well it was supposed to be 349, but what happened was there was a computer error at the factory

90
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:07,100
 So more than two caps were listed with 349

91
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,740
 A total of 800,000 caps

92
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,660
 Were worth a million pesos

93
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,380
 800,000 people were about to earn 23 years

94
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,220
 Of never having to work never having to work for 23 years

95
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:29,980
 But of course that's that's not what

96
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:37,020
 It's not what was it was that happened Pepsi it set aside two million dollars for this competition because of this screw up

97
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,260
 They were on the hook for 32 billion bucks

98
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:47,660
 Now Pepsi is a big company. I don't think they can take a 32. I don't think they can I don't know many companies

99
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,980
 That could take a 32 billion dollar hit

100
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,700
 So they immediately were like

101
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:57,500
 Hey guys, sorry, but so sorry about making you think that your life was changed

102
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,740
 There's only actually two winners out there

103
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,940
 We have the security codes. Nobody else can win this money

104
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,740
 So

105
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,060
 What do you expect would happen in this

106
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,780
 situation

107
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,100
 You figure people would be upset. That's true

108
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:21,580
 You figure people first off they all rent to the Pepsi co-plants to redeem their caps and that's when they're like no

109
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:26,140
 I'm sorry. Sorry, dude. We don't have any money here as trucks full of pepsis are constantly going out

110
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:31,980
 They came to the plants. They weren't getting their paid the money. The Pepsi came out and said listen

111
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:37,980
 We don't we're not gonna we're not gonna cover any of this stuff

112
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:43,980
 Tell you what though. Tell you what to make it up for you. We will give you 18 dollars per cap

113
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,780
 So that's still a good week's worth of labor

114
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:54,140
 Half the people said that's fine. Like they got that. It was a total error. Half the group said we'll take the 18 bucks

115
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,460
 We're not going to get anything else

116
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,780
 The other half of the people

117
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:04,700
 Form the 349 alliance, which actually sounds pretty badass honestly 349 alliance

118
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,620
 Now they didn't take their 18 dollars. They think that they are deserved

119
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:15,340
 One million pesos so they begin protesting. Oh pay so pay so they're walking through the street

120
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:19,980
 They're walking through the street. They're walking into banks. They're all pay so they're like, yeah, we know that's our currency

121
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:26,460
 Why do you keep yelling that they're walking on the street? They start protesting outside of pepsi factories pay so

122
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,940
 They probably had a catchier slogan than that

123
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:33,820
 And these people are like, what does that even mean? You're just saying what we use to buy stuff

124
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,540
 They start protesting that doesn't work. They call for a boycott of pepsi

125
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:45,820
 That doesn't work. So then it just it just remember this all started with with soda caps

126
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,780
 They begin setting pepsi trucks on fire

127
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:54,300
 So now they're hurting they're hurting what they truly love. I'm sure most of them were addicted to

128
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:59,100
 Pepsi at this point pepsi trucks are driving down the street people are setting them on fire

129
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:04,380
 they're breaking into parking lots they're destroying the trucks and then that's not even the top thing

130
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,460
 And then one day a couple people were at a pepsi warehouse typing

131
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,940
 Doing stuff

132
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:17,900
 Selling pepsi out of the back of the warehouse. They're black market pepsi salesman a grenade comes through the window

133
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,020
 kills three people

134
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:26,860
 So now everyone's like, okay, let's we might want to rethink this 349 alliance thing

135
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,540
 There were rumors that pepsi had actually hired

136
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:37,420
 Agitators like pepsi there was a rumor that pepsi got some south american mercenaries to come and be like

137
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,980
 Hey, we really need this protest to end. Would you mind setting our trucks on fire?

138
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,340
 And lobbing grenades

139
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,660
 Through our windows south american mercenaries like yeah, that's what we do. It's a wednesday. That's what we always do

140
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,740
 Then to make matters even worse

141
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,940
 There was a pepsi truck driving down the road one day

142
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,020
 And someone came up alongside of it and threw grenade

143
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,660
 into the pepsi truck

144
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,140
 and the explosion

145
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,100
 Killed a mother and her child nearby

146
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:14,060
 So

147
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,660
 That's

148
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:21,500
 That's pretty rough at this point public tide was turning. I think probably the first grenade attack people were already like

149
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:26,140
 I don't know about this whole 349 alliance thing that it killed us three guys at the pepsi warehouse

150
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,820
 but at this point

151
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,580
 Pretty much all the protests stopped all the attacks stopped

152
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,940
 The court cases though continued and eventually

153
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:41,580
 Pepsi goes listen, we're so sorry about that. We'll offer you

154
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,060
 $380

155
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,900
 And then most of the people said it will take the $380 way more than 18

156
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,500
 It's way less than 40 000

157
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,780
 But you know again, you probably threw a grenade at someone

158
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,100
 You're just hoping to get some money to get out of the country

159
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,540
 And then a couple of them hold out for even more money

160
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,820
 Supreme court the supreme court of philippines had to step in and say

161
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:10,060
 You don't deserve anything you you get zero money. You should have just taken the 18 dollars or the

162
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:15,980
 380 bucks. There was no way you were going to get 40 000 dollars as far as I can tell

163
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:21,580
 I mean again, this story just happened back in 1992. Thanks for the thanks for the support steward

164
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:28,780
 This story just happened back in 1992 as far as I can tell no one was ever prosecuted, you know for like throwing throwing grenades into stuff

165
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:34,940
 You know the big crimes. It's one thing. Listen setting Pepsi trucks on fire is still like a crime

166
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:42,300
 It's still technically a crime, but when you're throwing grenades at trucks because you didn't get 40 000 dollars

167
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,580
 You might want to reevaluate your life decisions

168
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:50,620
 However, you also have to think that Pepsi probably should have done something more on the outset

169
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:55,340
 To take care of this whole situation. So that is just another weird

170
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:01,820
 Is this a thing now another this is one of those weird wacky stories that just kind of been lost to time

171
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,420
 I had never heard about this before people's lives are actually affected

172
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:12,380
 And i'm actually now that I say it I wonder what happened to the two people who had the winning lid

173
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:17,980
 Did they ever get there? They were the ones throwing their grenades. They got their 40 000 dollars

174
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,220
 And they're like the fire rises brothers. They use all their money to buy grenades

175
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:29,020
 I thought that was a weird story. I just saw that the other day. I don't even remember how oh actually I do know how it came across it

176
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:36,380
 I saw it on reddit. So I wanted to give a shout out to the real big jc 22

177
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:41,020
 for posting that in uh reddit. So I really really appreciate that

178
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,060
 And it is

179
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:47,660
 Burn i'm gonna open a window real quick. Let me know if this changes the

180
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,060
 um

181
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:55,500
 The audio quality because i'm wearing this and I got my pajama pants on i'm wearing this shirt

182
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:04,380
 Okay, i'm back

183
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:09,820
 Take a little segue real quick if you don't mind I posted this on my twitter yesterday

184
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,660
 It's something really weird was happening yesterday something really weird. Hey, nicole

185
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,220
 Citrus Heights dudes citrus heights in the house

186
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:22,780
 I I came across something weird yesterday. I was watching. I don't remember what I was watching on youtube something dumb

187
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,740
 Probably I think I was just wasting time

188
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:35,420
 I saw a commercial it kind of like struck me. I was like, uh, it was a commercial for the rise of skywalker

189
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:43,500
 And it said coming soon this film has not yet been rated and I was like what didn't that movie come out last year

190
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,900
 Now because I obviously am into like the paranormal

191
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,540
 And so like that I immediately thought

192
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,980
 I immediately checked my calendar. I was like

193
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,580
 Did I travel back in time? Did I go back in time?

194
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:01,340
 Now I didn't as

195
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,540
 far as I know

196
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,900
 But it popped up and first I was thinking because I think I was watching

197
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:10,220
 Um read a letter media earlier. They were doing something about the force awakens

198
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,220
 So I was like maybe that triggered some sort of algorithm

199
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,860
 for the rest of the night

200
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,020
 I got pretty much two ads

201
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:23,420
 Playing back to back now to get ads for like I don't know. I this gets a friend a ad pops up

202
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,980
 Still that's always weird

203
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:32,380
 I would get ads for the rise of skywalker coming soon in uh christmas

204
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:40,140
 Which again came out in 2019 last year and every time that commercial came on I looked down at my little digital clock on my computer

205
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,180
 I was like

206
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,180
 still 2020 right

207
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,220
 I'd get commercials for that

208
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,620
 The other commercial I got was

209
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,900
 For a model car

210
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,980
 A model no joke. No, this is so weird and again, I don't

211
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:00,300
 Not a big believer in synchronicity and stuff like that, but

212
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:08,140
 I get a commercial for the model car of the delorean

213
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:17,980
 From back to the future. No, just the loren. I should have added that far as I go. It's the lorian. It was actually it was actually a

214
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:24,300
 Like back to the future time machine and melk just said the blu ray release. That's what I thought as well

215
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,380
 But that's been out for a while

216
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,700
 and again, it said

217
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:33,100
 Thank you, sk really really appreciate it again. It would say this movie has not yet been rated

218
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,980
 It was they were running the ads that they ran

219
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,540
 this time last year so

220
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,460
 one

221
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:45,420
 YouTube is ripping off disney. They're charging them. This could be happening all over the world

222
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:50,060
 And they're charging disney to run ads that disney doesn't even knows running

223
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,700
 So they're getting like an extra million dollars two

224
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:58,060
 We're about to time travel basically like right now the

225
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,700
 Was a thing

226
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,900
 Was a thing going on the veil is getting thinner and thinner and we're all about to go back in time

227
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:13,180
 Or or actually there's a thousand other rational explanations, but I remember thinking I remember when I first

228
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:18,940
 That's that that's that I remember the first time I took more than one time the first time I thought did I go back in time?

229
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:24,060
 And then it goes on and on and I kept doing it throughout the night

230
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:27,500
 And then my first thing was like if I went back to the year 2019

231
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,940
 My first thought was

232
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,540
 I don't want to have to record all those episodes again

233
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:39,740
 Like that would be super weird to have done all that work and then have to do more work on it

234
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:45,980
 So different time zones collapsing the uh, that was bonkleman's comment. Yeah, I would

235
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:53,580
 But then I figured you know what I would do obviously you would warn people about the whole covid situation

236
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,660
 You'd be like just running around everyone's gonna get sick everyone's gonna get sick in a couple months

237
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:02,300
 But not really everyone just some people but everyone's going to be afraid they're gonna get sick and you're not really gonna know

238
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,900
 what to do for the first

239
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,420
 Uh, first 100 days. Yeah, sure Eric

240
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,740
 shout out to Eric

241
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,740
 and then um

242
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:15,820
 Yeah, I would just be I I could probably save a bunch of lives

243
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:20,940
 But then I'd have to like rerecord episodes. So that would be rough. That would be rough. So

244
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,340
 rerecord episodes

245
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,340
 rerecord episodes or

246
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,500
 save

247
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,500
 200,000 lives

248
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:37,500
 Uh, I was hoping maybe I could go back in time and keep my files on my computer. That's how lazy I am

249
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,580
 I don't mind going back in time, but do I get to keep the files on my computer?

250
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:47,420
 So let's go ahead and move on to our next topic here. This one's a shorty

251
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:52,940
 I haven't done a lot of stories from think about it docs.com lately

252
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,460
 I've been doing a lot of stuff and I kind of want I really like that website

253
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,700
 I hope you guys aren't getting tired of it. I think

254
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,980
 subconsciously I knew I needed to take a break

255
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,980
 but

256
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,740
 um, yeah, I've

257
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,940
 I really like that website

258
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,620
 I like them because they're just kind of these short creepy stories

259
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,500
 That we can look at

260
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,780
 Um

261
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,820
 And then to ask answer ryan's question real quick because he has to go take a shower

262
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:24,380
 What's the hottest cryptid? I was thinking about that the other day that big booty reptilian that I covered

263
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,980
 Last year. I was honestly sitting and I was thinking about

264
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:34,380
 That you guys I don't remember the episode but there's an episode where I talk about falling in love with a big booty

265
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:40,620
 Reptilian alien so that would be that one and thank you again steward for keeping the spirits up in the chat

266
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,940
 Let's go ahead and hop in the dead rabbit durgable

267
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,940
 We are going to head on out. We're leaving behind the Philippines. We're saying goodbye

268
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,700
 We're drinking a bunch of coca-cola because they didn't honor their sweets

269
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,860
 And I'm have a bunch of bottle caps in my hands of 349 on them

270
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:01,260
 I'm throwing them out into the people below everyone get rich but no grenades no grenades

271
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,620
 We're flying away in the dead rabbit durgable

272
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:10,860
 Durgable is flying over the pacific ocean

273
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,540
 I think I think that's easy's way to get back

274
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:18,140
 We're headed out to seattle washington

275
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,900
 The year is 1997 wait

276
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,180
 The year is 1972 had a little

277
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:32,700
 Little brain. It's the time travel. It's it's the veil getting smaller the year is 1972. We're in seattle washington

278
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,340
 We are walking down the street

279
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:41,980
 I don't all know why I always put myself into these scenarios and then I have to like go. Oh never mind never mind

280
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,660
 We're not walking on the street

281
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,660
 Hold on a second

282
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:54,460
 Gonna take another drink

283
00:20:54,540 --> 00:21:05,820
 We're walking on the street and we see a car

284
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:10,380
 There's a bunch of car. We're not straight. There's a bunch of cars. There's a bunch of cars. This isn't a norm

285
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,540
 This isn't no abnormal

286
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:21,580
 Sorry, my god light headed there for a second. Hey, zapp zapp

287
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:27,900
 I think I have a problem because I stare at myself while i'm talking

288
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,180
 And it actually hurts my eyeballs

289
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:35,580
 It like makes you dizzy when you do that like I feel a little a little light headed. Okay

290
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:40,060
 One second to recalibrate. I'm gonna do a little stretching

291
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,180
 I'm gonna

292
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,140
 Burp burp away from the my cave elvet

293
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,420
 Sorry guys

294
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,420
 Yeah, it was weird. I

295
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,140
 I've had that sensation before doing the life's

296
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:58,060
 I've had that sensation before doing the life's okay

297
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:04,140
 We ready? Yeah, we're ready. Yeah, it's just weird. Okay

298
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,180
 Hey cantilians

299
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:12,860
 The year is 1972. We're in seattle washington. It's a sunny afternoon day

300
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,820
 There's a man driving

301
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:19,900
 Let's do it. Yeah, I'm fine. There's a man driving home to interview

302
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,100
 And you know, he's probably a pretty good

303
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,780
 Interview whether or not he got the job, but we'll just assume that he did

304
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,580
 Can there it okay considering what's about to happen?

305
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,580
 His car comes and it stops in an intersection

306
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:39,180
 He's just sitting there cars idling listening to some 1972 music

307
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:42,380
 He's waiting for

308
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:46,780
 The light to change and then he says

309
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:52,300
 He becomes aware of a sensation to his left

310
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:56,060
 So he's sitting in this car

311
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:01,020
 And he can sense something on the left hand side

312
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:09,660
 Can tell something staring at him he can tell something is intently staring at him

313
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:18,060
 He says he turns to his left and he sees what he calls an old junker car

314
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,780
 a beat-up piece of garbage

315
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:25,900
 If he wasn't that bad, maybe they weren't driving the jason jelapi, but it was a beat-up car

316
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,340
 And he looks and he says what he sees

317
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,780
 Is a woman

318
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,780
 Sure enough staring at him

319
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,420
 from that car

320
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,980
 She said

321
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,500
 He said

322
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:46,140
 She had an exceptionally round head large round head

323
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,260
 Not so much like great alien

324
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,900
 But he almost said that it was like

325
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,700
 super obese

326
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,100
 Like just just

327
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:01,740
 You're just saying like this big old chick was chair staring at him. Well, it's a little more than that, right?

328
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,340
 Because that's not a story

329
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,900
 But he said like he had like a she had like a big

330
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,740
 Obese head not like a great alien that big obese head

331
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,940
 And she's staring at him

332
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:18,140
 And he's still waiting for that light to change but now his view is kind of locked on her

333
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:21,740
 She said

334
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,180
 He said

335
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,180
 Her eyes were wide open

336
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,980
 They were bright blue

337
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:34,220
 You're like she's you just described you mean a normal woman. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I'm saving the best for life

338
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,820
 He looks at this woman. She has big bright blue eyes

339
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:42,620
 Pale skin super white skin with

340
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,300
 red lipstick super bright red lipstick

341
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:51,340
 And and hair she had hair on her big head her big dome head

342
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:57,180
 What makes this scary because again, I've just described basically you driving down not you not you is her

343
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,580
 But I'm saying everyone's seen this no

344
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:04,620
 What is scary is as he's looking at her she looks relatively normal

345
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,260
 She's a little pale could probably use some more iron in her system

346
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,980
 She smiles at him

347
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:14,300
 I just realized

348
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:22,540
 Let me go ahead and finish it

349
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:31,660
 She she smiles at him. Okay this woman this woman who may or may not be totally normal smiles at him

350
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:36,460
 And he notices

351
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,780
 He notices her teeth are made of wood

352
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:47,260
 And then he

353
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,420
 He drives away. Okay, so

354
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:53,660
 When I first read this story, I thought whoa dude

355
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:57,660
 That's like when I at that time I was driving on the road and I thought that I saw that alien

356
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,020
 Not alien when I was driving on the road and I thought I saw that demon

357
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:07,820
 Remember I told a couple stories like that where I thought I saw like no milks like the poor girl

358
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,740
 I thought it was okay when I first read it and I read it a couple times. I thought

359
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:18,140
 Oh, dude, it's like when I saw a demon in the car next to me or driving past me. Maybe this guy

360
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:23,820
 She doesn't do anything spooky. She doesn't do anything spooky. She's just an obese woman

361
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:27,420
 With a lot of lipstick on and wooden teeth

362
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:35,340
 I totally thought it was creepier than that actually now that I think about it this poor woman was 1972

363
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:41,740
 So she may not be alive anymore. She might be it's meant on how old she was depends on how much she took care of her teeth

364
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,540
 but

365
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,540
 sorry

366
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:49,980
 That's just a story about a woman with wooden teeth

367
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,980
 I thought it was going to be a story about a man who

368
00:26:53,980 --> 00:27:00,140
 Do you like even how I built that up? It was like super slow because I was like, oh, I can't wait till I get to the teeth part

369
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,140
 This is going to be super spooky

370
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:06,460
 And as I was reading I was like, wait a second. She's just an overweight woman with bad teeth

371
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:11,740
 Now that I'm looking at these notes, let me show you

372
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,460
 This is the actual sentence here

373
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:20,540
 She stared at him and then fixed a very broad chest shire cat like grin

374
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,740
 showing

375
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,740
 Showing sorry. I had to do it

376
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:31,420
 showing very square yellow brown teeth that looked

377
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,660
 like they were made of wood

378
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:37,820
 They weren't even made of wood. They just looked like it

379
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:41,260
 Uh

380
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,260
 Sorry, sorry guys

381
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:49,340
 After I saying hey, how come I don't do think about a doc's doc on anymore that might be why so

382
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,660
 Thank you team ad

383
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:56,460
 Thank you really appreciate that and that woman looks like she might have wooden teeth. I yes

384
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,900
 So that is not the case. Yeah, I know I know that

385
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:05,580
 That was not to be fair to be fair. I didn't make the report

386
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,140
 I didn't make the report if it was me

387
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,100
 Making the report then I'm just reading

388
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:15,180
 Just reading it, but I thought that was spookier. Oh man

389
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:19,100
 That was a Thanksgiving episode. Okay, but we have

390
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,940
 A really cool story to wrap this guy up

391
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,780
 Really cool story to wrap this up and then I'm gonna stick around and we'll do some questions and answers

392
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,580
 If you guys want to kick out kick around and stuff like that as well

393
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:36,700
 Let's see. Oh and this owl painting we should talk about this real quick. Sorry for the podcast listeners

394
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,540
 but this owl painting I got at artifacts bookstore

395
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:45,740
 And it was like two bucks and it has a little hole. Oh guys here. Hold on

396
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,540
 I think I might have shown you guys this before but I'm gonna show you some me

397
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:53,500
 I'll take a quick break. Yeah, when you stare at yourself talking you actually get dizzy

398
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,540
 It actually makes you dizzy. Check this out

399
00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:02,460
 I got this for free

400
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:10,700
 I got this for free. It was actually Sabine helped me get it. Dude check that out

401
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:15,420
 This is a watercolor bigfoot painting

402
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:22,460
 I haven't figured out where to hang it up yet. I kind of want to hang it back here, but I'm afraid I'm going to bust it up with my

403
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,580
 My chair rocking back and forth

404
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:37,180
 And then while I'm up I got my bigfoot

405
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:41,420
 Bigfoot lunchbox

406
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:44,620
 So

407
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,620
 I think that around town people always

408
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:51,820
 Yeah, that should put I you know, I I always thought you know what to be a cool, um

409
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,180
 logo, but I'm not an artist

410
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,980
 Is the

411
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:01,180
 You know how bigfoot's doing that walk that walk pose

412
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,540
 If someone could put a book in one of his hands

413
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:07,740
 And just write on it book of Mormon

414
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,460
 That'd be a sticker

415
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,380
 That'd be sticker

416
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,380
 You could have book of Mormon bigfoot

417
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,860
 People love that theory

418
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,940
 Mormon bigfoot monkeys don't exist

419
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,420
 Those are the two

420
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:25,100
 Yeah, I thought about that you could just put a little tie on him a little tie on the bigfoot

421
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:31,180
 Monkeys don't exist in Mormon bigfoot are my two like go-tos when I'm talking to people about the show that haven't

422
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,580
 Uh

423
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,100
 Haven't heard about it

424
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:40,620
 It's like well, do you think monkeys exist? Yeah, of course. Well, I should listen to my episode

425
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:44,300
 I've thought about going back and doing moron stuff. You got to be careful

426
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,300
 You don't want to keep

427
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:50,780
 One time I did a whole week about vampire lord kevin. I love that week

428
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:54,860
 I absolutely love that week. I should just repeat that at some point

429
00:30:54,860 --> 00:31:00,620
 But he had so much material haunts has a ton of material as well

430
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,420
 but um

431
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:06,380
 He gets

432
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:10,460
 His youtube channels keep getting shut down for a reason like I

433
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:16,380
 Not a huge fan of people being censored and stuff like that. He doesn't he just

434
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:22,860
 But anyways, so you got to be careful how much haunts how much haunt stuff you've covered

435
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,060
 Again, I've said this before and I'll say it again. I wish him the best of luck

436
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:30,220
 Wish him the best of luck. He's a young man. I don't agree with him

437
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:35,100
 But I don't think he's a uh bad. I don't think he's a bad dude

438
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:40,700
 I think he's probably I think at heart. He's a good person. I just think he's misinformed about a bunch of stuff

439
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,860
 So I wish him the best

440
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,060
 um

441
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,860
 Doesn't mean that we don't have a laugh. I think

442
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:52,940
 I don't know. I don't know. I kind of have you know, I guess I guess I've kind of adopted haunts

443
00:31:52,940 --> 00:32:00,940
 Adopted haunts as my conspiracy son. He will someday become the true mongo jr. I'd like to do something with him. But yeah, so

444
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:06,860
 We are we've left behind the Philippines. We're now seeing good, but you know what we really should

445
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:13,900
 Pull the guy from the last story. Let's pull him out of his car and make him apologize. Make him apologize to

446
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,860
 This woman this poor woman who he put on a UFO

447
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:22,940
 Paranormal website to talk about how spooky things are

448
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:29,500
 We're basically just punching him in the stomach or like apologize. Apologize. He's like what I thought it was spooky

449
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:34,540
 She had horrible teeth and as we're punching him as we're beating this guy up for being rude

450
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:38,300
 We all feel someone looking at us from behind

451
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,100
 They're like what?

452
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:45,740
 We're slowly turning around and behind us. She's just still standing

453
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:50,780
 There she's still standing there on her phone. She's like what guys? I just have that type of Bora

454
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:55,660
 We're leaving behind Seattle, Washington. We are headed out to

455
00:32:55,660 --> 00:33:01,420
 Los angeles. Oh wait, what I have to say what vehicle we're in

456
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:07,900
 Let's hop on board the carboner copter. Everyone get on board. Our hands are all sore from doing all the punching

457
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,820
 Um, my elbows. I started a couple elbows there. Hey, robert

458
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:18,060
 Let's all hop on the carboner copter and and nick just asked who's hawns

459
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:25,980
 Um, that's a long story, but you can check out episode was it 151 152 somewhere around there

460
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,580
 hawns is a man who believes monkeys don't exist and he's

461
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:34,620
 He's he's a jewel. He truly is a jewel in the youtube crown

462
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:41,580
 We are all hopping on board the carboner copter. William burdell says there's 50 of us

463
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,460
 We're all getting in the car. We're not team at standing outside

464
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:49,580
 We are leaving behind Seattle, Washington. We are headed out to Los Angeles, California

465
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:59,580
 Helicopter is flying over the west coast now this story is partially a story mostly a story

466
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,660
 But I want to say real quick

467
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:05,020
 I want to say really quick that a quick dead rabbit recommends

468
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:08,540
 There's a lot of movies that I saw that I assume

469
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,900
 Other people saw who are into this stuff

470
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:19,500
 So I'm going to assume almost all of you have seen they live at this point

471
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:27,100
 They live is the story of a man

472
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,860
 We're actually what I mean the plot is pretty basic

473
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:34,060
 It's the story of a man who finds a

474
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:37,100
 Box of glasses

475
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,380
 What and he sells him at the sunglass hat makes a million dollars

476
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:47,180
 It's the story of a man who basically lives in our society. He finds a set of glasses

477
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:55,020
 Put some on because he's homeless almost people do they still glasses and they put them on

478
00:34:55,020 --> 00:35:01,740
 He begins to see that the world isn't really what they think it is

479
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:06,940
 You guys have seen the iconography you've eaten if you've never seen the movie the old bay sticker

480
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,460
 It's kind of like the weird alien face or just the word obey

481
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:17,900
 He looks up at billboards and it says consume pro create obey magazine covers are all basically

482
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,860
 everything is

483
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,780
 subconscious

484
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:27,100
 When he takes him off the world is colorful when he puts him on the world becomes black and white and he sees all these

485
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:30,780
 messages everywhere and he sees maybe one in every

486
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:35,100
 50 people maybe a little less than that

487
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:40,380
 Are aliens so he takes up this cause the movie is actually really good. I saw it when I was a kid

488
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,700
 My dad rented it. I remember watching the commercials for it

489
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:49,340
 So I had have been like 11 or 12 when it came out. It's definitely a mind-bending movie when you're that young

490
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:54,940
 To see all this stuff it is great sci-fi it's more of an action movie than a sci-fi

491
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:58,140
 Thanks, Sean

492
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:01,100
 Really really well done movie. So

493
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,940
 It's one of those things like you want it to be true

494
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:13,180
 You want it to not that you want aliens to be putting subliminal messages in all of our stuff and you want aliens flying

495
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:20,060
 You know down to take us over and yes, uh, nick has pointed this out and so did david david the

496
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,780
 line i'm here to

497
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,660
 What was it? I've come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass

498
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:32,700
 And i'm all out of bubblegum and then he starts a mass shooting. It's a really interesting movie because from his point of view

499
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,700
 He's shooting aliens

500
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:40,540
 But to everyone else in the movie. He's walk. He walks into a bank and massacres a bunch of people at random

501
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:44,940
 So it was a really and yeah rowdy rowdy piper started. I think you steward

502
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:52,060
 It's a really really interesting film because you it can really trip people out you imagine

503
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,460
 Not saying this is true

504
00:36:54,460 --> 00:37:00,780
 But when you you could take that i'm actually surprised this doesn't play you more into mass shooting culture

505
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,580
 I know there was the one guy who shot his minister

506
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:07,020
 Like four times in the head because he thought he was a reptilian

507
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:13,500
 And the minister survived and everyone said whoa, he must have really been a reptilian because he survived four shots of the head you

508
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,300
 You can survive four shots of the head

509
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,620
 The thing is is that

510
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,620
 Not like right in your head

511
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,820
 But remember if you get shot here or you get shot here

512
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,700
 It's still considered people in the podcast can't see what i'm doing

513
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:33,020
 But you get shot on the forehead right here or if you get a bullet that grazes the side you're there still considered shot in the head

514
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:37,740
 So you can survive i'm not saying why the not the guy's an alien. He i doubt he's an alien

515
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,060
 but um

516
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,300
 Because aliens could also die from four shots in the head

517
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,660
 Anyways, where was it going?

518
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:49,740
 I'm surprised this isn't playing more in a mass shooting culture, which i'm kind of glad

519
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:53,020
 I wish we didn't have a mass shooting culture but this idea that

520
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,220
 I only killed the bad ones like not

521
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:00,380
 I think basically that's a hitman or an assassin or a soldier

522
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:03,820
 But you know somebody's saying I walked into that place and everyone I shot was an alien

523
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:06,620
 So I don't know why i'm on trial i'm surprised it doesn't come out more often

524
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:11,980
 But anyways, it's a great movie did rabbi recommends they live i'm surprised they haven't remade it yet

525
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,300
 Was zack effron in the lead

526
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:19,980
 Which actually now I say doesn't sound too bad. I always like movies when they get

527
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,740
 Hot young not physically hot although he is cute

528
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,420
 Not cute

529
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:33,420
 Okay, I I think it's interesting when you take like robert patinson and put him in batman because you're going to get a whole new audience for the movie

530
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:41,100
 So if they took uh zack effron and put him in they live you're going to get a bunch of people

531
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:47,500
 Who've never watched they live to watch it so I don't have a problem with that. I think it remakes her fine

532
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:51,420
 So here we go

533
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:54,780
 Yeah stewart said he just knows someone who got shot twice

534
00:38:54,780 --> 00:39:00,780
 In the head i'm assuming but maybe not and they live so yeah, it can definitely have multiple shots can happen

535
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,100
 Get shot on the head. Okay, so

536
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,980
 The other recently on

537
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:09,820
 The export

538
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,900
 this

539
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:17,660
 Paraglasses appeared so we're in los angeles and that's where they live takes place. We walk into a warehouse

540
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:22,620
 Rowdy rowdy piper. He's standing there like a force goes. I miss rowdy piper

541
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,940
 Not like I knew him like he was my neighbor

542
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:29,020
 But his force goes to stand in the corner. He's not into us. We're walking through this warehouse

543
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:33,580
 And there is a pair of goggles sitting on a table

544
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:39,260
 And recently on the export there's been a kind of explosion of interest into these things

545
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:43,100
 They're called killner screens or killner goggles

546
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,700
 So we pick them up and we put them on you know

547
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,980
 What?

548
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,460
 Everything's blue now kind of purplish

549
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:57,820
 Um, we're looking around I was about to make an iphone 65 joke, but I didn't so I should deserve some credit for my restraint

550
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:02,780
 We're wearing these killner goggles and i'm looking around at all of you guys you guys all look totally cool

551
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:06,140
 You're your auras. Let me actually explain what the goggles do first

552
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:12,700
 Apparently they allow you to see auras and you can train yourself to see an aura

553
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,260
 Or you can just look at them

554
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,820
 and you can look at them

555
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:22,460
 And you can put what was I said I was distracted by caggy key's comment

556
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:27,180
 Um, who said the first time you ever heard about they live it was recommended to him by a neo nazi

557
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,100
 when you

558
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,100
 Put on these killner screens

559
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:38,140
 You can look at people and see their auras. Hey scar you can see the energy around the person

560
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:42,860
 Now you can train yourself to see auras

561
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:45,500
 You can do that

562
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:51,100
 And I I'll get into the aura thing in a second, but anyways so auras are the basically the life energy around you

563
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:59,100
 Now you can go through years of training to see auras or with these killner screens

564
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,500
 You can put these on you can actually look at people and see

565
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,740
 Their auras but these killner screens did something else too

566
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:09,980
 Every so often you'd be looking through a group of people. So i'm looking through all you dudes

567
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,660
 You guys are all super cool and stuff

568
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,900
 You guys are hopefully you guys are just standing there normally

569
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:19,660
 But when I look at you with the glasses, you're making a cool b-boy pose spinning around on interdimensional cardboard

570
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:23,820
 But then we go outside. We're wearing these killner goggles

571
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:28,780
 We go outside in that Los Angeles proper and every show often we see someone with a

572
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,740
 interesting aura

573
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:41,580
 Did you see that guy the guy driving the bus? We see an obese woman with bad teeth. We're like, ah, but she has a normal aura so

574
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:50,060
 But every so often you see you'd see people with different auras like an angry aura or like a super happy more happy than normal aura

575
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:53,420
 But every so often you'd see something that could only be described

576
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:57,100
 As an inhuman

577
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,300
 aura

578
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:06,140
 So these killner screens were banned by the government

579
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:10,860
 Specifically the ingredient that was used to make them

580
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:14,300
 Which i'm gonna try to pronounce

581
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:19,740
 Dick, I don't think this is how you say it but dick yannan die

582
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:23,660
 Dick yannan die was this

583
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:29,100
 Die that was needed to make these killner screens

584
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:36,220
 The government banned it. They said you can't use dick nan and die. Not only can you not use it? You can't pronounce it correctly ever again

585
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,020
 Dick yannan die. You can't use it

586
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:43,020
 And to this day dick yannan die is still illegal

587
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:46,780
 And so the ability to make these glasses

588
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:52,380
 Are also illegal is the government possibly keeping from us technology?

589
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:55,020
 That will allow us to see

590
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,500
 alien invaders

591
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:06,300
 It's an interesting story and I had a lot of fun looking into it. Let's really dig into it. That's pretty much the bulk of the mythos

592
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:10,300
 Dick yannan die apparently is what bonkelman is saying

593
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:17,260
 Here's here's we here we go there apparently also there was an other version of these glasses

594
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:22,620
 Made by a guy named tom bow camp arnold called the prana view goggles

595
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:27,820
 But I couldn't find any proof that this guy like when I went looking for the information on that name

596
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:32,380
 I couldn't really find anything prana view goggles do exist, but they're apparently the same thing

597
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,940
 Basically, hey short circuit

598
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:41,900
 So let's take a look at first off did these goggles exist is this just an internet myth that's going around?

599
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:49,340
 Yes, the goggles existed. William killner was a real person. He wrote books on the human aura back in

600
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:55,420
 1911 really wrote the first book about human auras or at the time as they were knowing

601
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,980
 human atmospheres

602
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:04,300
 So he's one of the pioneers of human auras and he did invent these glasses and they were made

603
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,260
 with dick yannan

604
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:11,420
 In between two sheets of glass dick yannan die is made from

605
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:15,500
 Like burnt tar to die. That's made from tar

606
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,500
 What's interesting about this

607
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,740
 is that

608
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:30,140
 Let me explain to you apparently the human auras were kind of like white light energy around them and these other people

609
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:34,300
 Who knows what they were would show with like a blue oval there would be like an oh

610
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,780
 It wouldn't be like this energy just kind of floating around the person

611
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:39,260
 But an oval around them

612
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:42,860
 And one guy said apparently he looked through them and he saw

613
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:45,500
 Someone with slits for eyes

614
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:48,060
 But we just had a guy who saw wooden teeth

615
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,340
 Wooden teeth and reported it as an alien or monster

616
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:55,980
 So I don't know maybe the guy just maybe the guy just got little ninja stars in his eyes and then pulled him out

617
00:44:55,980 --> 00:45:00,620
 And then he looked at him. He didn't notice there was a pledge to you now to his eyes. He had blue goggles on

618
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:03,100
 So the the goggles did exist. They

619
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:09,660
 Were made by William killner who is a real person who steadied human auras. So all that part of the story matches up

620
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:12,380
 So then I started looking at it and I go

621
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:16,860
 Okay, then my next question because this is how I approach these stories. I read it. I was like that's fascinating

622
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:19,660
 Is it true?

623
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:21,740
 I

624
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:28,060
 Started looking into this. Is this dye actually illegal? Yes, it is. So now my interest is really peaked

625
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:31,980
 Now my interest is really peaked because we having a lot of this story matched up

626
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:35,340
 It was banned in the 1940s

627
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:41,260
 There should be our first clue of where this could be going. It was banned in the 1940s

628
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:48,300
 And in 2010 around 2010 it was briefly made legal again for some weird reason

629
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,420
 I'm assuming it was a paperwork mess up

630
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:54,860
 Because it was quickly made illegal again

631
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:58,380
 Now when you read about these goggles

632
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,940
 You'll always come across this

633
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:03,260
 story

634
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,820
 When you read about these goggles, you'll always hear this story

635
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:08,620
 I hired a chemist

636
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:10,860
 who could

637
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:16,220
 Get anything he has security clearance to get acid he gets security clearance to buy as much heroin as he wants

638
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:18,540
 He's a chemist. He can do science stuff with this

639
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:23,500
 We asked if he could buy some dicky dicky ham and dye for us

640
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:28,780
 And they told him his security clearance wasn't high enough for that stuff

641
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:35,980
 So everyone's like, oh, it must be true the aliens must be working on this

642
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:39,260
 They must be suppressing this technology

643
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:45,020
 Because if this chemist can get lsd and heroin, how come he can't get this dye?

644
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:57,020
 Interesting story interesting little tidbit because you sit there and you think yeah, that is interesting like heroin and lsd is super

645
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:59,500
 You know, it's illegal. We know that why is this stuff illegal?

646
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:04,780
 But then you got to start and this is where I started thinking differently and was able to kind of get to the bottom of this

647
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:09,100
 If I'm a nuclear engineer, I'm a high level

648
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:16,220
 scientist and I'm working on like nuclear chemistry. Do you think I could order unlimited amounts of heroin?

649
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:26,300
 Just because you're a chemist doesn't mean you can get every possible chemical out of there

650
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:31,900
 If you're a chemist in one field you can't be like, you know what I want to do

651
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:35,580
 I know I've been doing like biology. I know I've been doing this chemistry of starfish

652
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:40,220
 But I really want to see what happens when I inject him with heroin. So you order a bunch of heroin

653
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:43,100
 You'd probably have to get some paperwork filled out for that

654
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:47,020
 The reason why this stuff is illegal and this is kind of

655
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:52,780
 Interesting because a lot of people lead this stuff out the ex post was posting what they knew

656
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:59,100
 It's the articles that he was sourcing that leaves this information out. It's highly carcinogenic

657
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:02,540
 Dicky M and I

658
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:08,700
 Can cause cancer. It's toxic at the very least you can argue that. Oh, you know the cancer research may

659
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:13,340
 May not be valid because we haven't had long-term studies on the very least

660
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:19,100
 It's toxic. It can also be used as a way to and this is why it was made illegal in the 40s

661
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:25,660
 Because if you had this stuff and you were able to see aliens from 1911, why would they make it illegal in the 40s?

662
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:28,220
 Why would they spend 30 years when people walk around being like?

663
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:31,340
 There's an alien. There's an alien

664
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:37,420
 Why wouldn't you just make it illegal the next day? The reason why it was made illegal in the 40s is because this can be used to make

665
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:40,700
 disannose

666
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,780
 settling

667
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:45,340
 Rocket fuel

668
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:49,900
 Now before we were really making a ton of rockets and making jets

669
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:54,940
 I actually think it's a jet fuel before we were like, oh, look at this stuff. It's blue. It's kind of cool

670
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:57,100
 I can kind of tell if my boss is an alien

671
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,740
 But once we start building jet fighters

672
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:07,340
 We start to realize it's probably not a good idea to have this stuff two inches from your eyeballs or really anywhere around you

673
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:12,300
 This stuff, where did I put in my notes? This stuff burns so hot

674
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:19,580
 It burned not the glasses itself, but it can be converted to the dye cycle Eikoline or whatever

675
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:22,540
 It can reach temperatures of

676
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:30,540
 910 degrees Fahrenheit. That is the hottest possible fire in an oxygen atmosphere

677
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,780
 Two inches from your eyeballs, right?

678
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:41,020
 I mean that is as hot as it can possibly get on the planet earth and you got people like hey, Mal, look I can see a white line around you

679
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,900
 Isn't it awesome in there like smoking a cigarette?

680
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:52,060
 So that's the reason why it's illegal because it's super super dangerous, but of course

681
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:56,220
 You could always push back that, you know, it's not toxic

682
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:03,180
 Toxic levels and carcinogenic levels is easy to kind of say. Oh, it's just that it's just that stay away stay away

683
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:10,140
 The thing is you can make these goggles yourself. They say if you take a purple sheet of glass or plastic

684
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:14,620
 And a blue like because it's cobalt blue is really what you're looking through

685
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:18,140
 This dye is this particular shade of blue

686
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:22,140
 Take purple tape blue put them there stare through them

687
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:29,900
 And you can see them you have to pretty much shut off. I got differing things on this you either have to shut off all visible light

688
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:33,740
 Or you have to just get a little bit of light in the side

689
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:41,500
 But people who have built these goggles using the plastic stuff not you can buy these online, but they're total ripoffs. They're basically like

690
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:50,860
 Sunglasses you can buy at a gas station someone commented on x you can buy glasses that you buy at a gas station, but they cost you 90 bucks

691
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:52,860
 Just

692
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:55,420
 Oh look at these blue shades you can find them

693
00:50:55,420 --> 00:51:00,460
 But you know you can also build them yourself by taking the two proper colored lenses and put them together

694
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:03,660
 But what's interesting there's this is the way we're going to wrap this up

695
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:06,220
 You have some people saying

696
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:13,340
 The reason why you do see a white outline around the person they said the reason why that is is because the way that the tint is

697
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:17,260
 It's blocking all the light waves except for like a little bit around the person

698
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:20,220
 So it's actually a natural way that light is reflected

699
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:24,540
 You're seeing white lines around people and if you already believe in auras

700
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:27,500
 Then you're going to believe that is an aura

701
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:35,500
 So you have to think this is just another device another spooky invention that's supposed to let us

702
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:40,060
 Pierce the veil and see what we know is true. I believe in auras

703
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:43,020
 I totally believe in auras

704
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:46,540
 I think it's I think it's one of those things

705
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:50,460
 It's it's one of those weird things like if you don't believe in them or if you believe in them

706
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:53,020
 It's not it's such a benign theory

707
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:57,900
 But I do believe that we do when we're around other people we sense them

708
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:04,700
 Like I think you can build we call it, you know gut feeling but I think really what we're doing is we're detecting their aura

709
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:09,020
 The

710
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:12,460
 Cal and aura is basically an energy field that we give out

711
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:17,020
 It's basically like you can tell someone could be standing there totally normal

712
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:23,420
 And you can go something and I've talked about this on shows too. I can walk into your house and tell you how healthy your marriage is

713
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:27,500
 And I think they're just the walls are soaked with that emotional energy

714
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:34,460
 You can be soaked with that emotional energy people can see you and you think you're doing just fine and someone walks up to you and go

715
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:36,460
 You doing okay, man? Oh

716
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:40,780
 You can even be someone you don't know being like are you feeling okay?

717
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,260
 kind of just I feel like you're

718
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:46,700
 Feel like you're kind of sad that you have those wooden teeth. You're like it's

719
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:51,500
 So I do believe in auras. I do believe people can see them

720
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,980
 I do believe it's something that you can train yourself to do

721
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:57,820
 But that's something that these glasses can skip ahead

722
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:01,260
 And I think a lot of people wanted there's two stories of these glasses

723
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:05,420
 One is that it gives you the paranormal ability to see people's emotional energy

724
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:10,940
 Which would give you a leg up and would make you feel special that you could see that the other one

725
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:16,700
 Obviously is the effect that aliens are invading that might be more important than telling whether or not your neighbor is mad at you

726
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,740
 but

727
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:24,780
 Preventing an alien invasion by wearing these goggles and and being able to see what's going on

728
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:27,740
 That's kind of the sci-fi story to it

729
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:31,180
 And then we have the mystical one of you just being able to see people's auras

730
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:36,060
 I think this story is important for another reason and I want to wrap this up like this and I want this to kind of be

731
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:41,260
 Something that may be some of you and I I feel the same way. We'll take something away from this

732
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:51,820
 This might sound contradictory coming from me, but why do you need to see the aura?

733
00:53:51,820 --> 00:54:01,580
 Why do we need to visibly see the aura if we know that we can feel it

734
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:07,180
 Why do we need to see it because we want proof

735
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:11,740
 We want proof it's this weirdest thing in this

736
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:15,500
 Form of research we want proof

737
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,340
 example

738
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:19,340
 You walk into a house

739
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:21,660
 You feel uncomfortable

740
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:24,380
 You feel like you're not alone

741
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:27,180
 When you're in your bedroom

742
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:31,260
 So you tell someone hey man, I think my bedroom is haunted

743
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:36,060
 What's the first question they're gonna ask

744
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:39,980
 Would you see

745
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:44,780
 Well, I didn't see anything. I just felt something. Oh, okay

746
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:53,580
 You know that your house is haunted you feel it in your bones

747
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:58,140
 But you still want proof

748
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:01,340
 We believe

749
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:06,780
 That scene is believing that scene itself is proof

750
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:15,740
 But why our sense of sight deceives us all the time you can look at any sort of optical illusion

751
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:18,620
 Or something off in the darkness

752
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:20,940
 Our sense of sight deceives us all the time

753
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:26,380
 Why is it important for you to be able to see auras when you can already see

754
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:30,060
 Air quote auras you can already feel them you can feel that energy

755
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:37,260
 We have a weird desire to need proof. I don't know if it's a human thing

756
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,980
 I don't know if it's something that's mostly in the paranormal world

757
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:43,580
 But you know what I mean

758
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:48,860
 If someone tells you they think someone's haunted someplace is haunted you are going to ask

759
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:53,180
 What did they see did you see something did you hear something?

760
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:58,620
 Think about all the times I've done this many times or I'll be sitting in my living room

761
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:03,340
 And I'll be thinking something's haunted. I'll be wondering about ghosts or anything like that

762
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:08,060
 And I'll be thinking what would happen if I saw that bottle fly across the room

763
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:13,980
 It's never happened to me. I've never seen anything levitate in front of me

764
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:20,460
 But is that really

765
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:23,260
 Let's not say the bottle flies across the room because that's a violent act

766
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:28,940
 But let's say that you see your phone levitate an inch off the table and fall down

767
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:34,940
 Is that any more proof that one moment than

768
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:37,980
 months of

769
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:43,100
 Being in your place feeling psychologically like there's something standing behind you

770
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:46,780
 You never see anything you never feel anything you never hear anything

771
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:52,300
 But every time you get up out of your chair. It's almost like someone else is getting up out of that chair with you

772
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:56,140
 When you're standing in the shower

773
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:00,140
 It's like there's someone right outside the shower curtain

774
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:03,100
 watching you

775
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:06,140
 You feel this so intently

776
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:10,860
 That you're uncomfortable in your own place. You've actually been looking at moving

777
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:17,260
 But you keep telling yourself no that's dumb. That's dumb for months that goes on versus one second of your phone going

778
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:24,380
 This is just a inch off the why and I know the answer is the phone

779
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:26,860
 But why

780
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:30,780
 Why do we put so much emphasis on the scene?

781
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:36,220
 Why would you want to build glasses made of a carcinogen that also turns into a jet fuel?

782
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:40,860
 So you could physically see something even though you have 40

783
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:45,740
 In my case 43 years of being able to sense people's auras

784
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:49,980
 I think it's important for us to start looking at some of these

785
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:55,900
 Events that we are investigating and the reason why I say it's contradictory for me because

786
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:59,820
 I'm always about the proof. I'm always about the proof

787
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:06,460
 But you'll notice with UFO stories ghost stories things like that. I'm not so much about the proof

788
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:10,380
 Because it's usually just one person telling a story

789
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:14,940
 Conspiracies is where I want proof because conspiracies have a weird tangle

790
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:19,500
 You're trying to draw all these connections and I do that with alien stories as well

791
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:24,860
 Sometimes and they're talking about like weird, you know, weird people making bizarre claims

792
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:26,940
 But when it's one person driving down the road

793
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:33,420
 Sees a beast woman with wooden teeth and this I didn't fact check that I probably should have read it a couple more times

794
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:37,180
 But I didn't fact check that I think it's important for us and for you

795
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,740
 dear listener

796
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:45,820
 To follow the gut to not worry so much about what we see and what we hear because both of those can be

797
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:48,460
 Just as easily deceived follow your gut

798
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:54,540
 When you're investigating ghost stories when you're investigating the paranormal

799
00:58:54,540 --> 00:59:00,780
 Don't worry so much and again this super contradictory and it might come to bite me in the butt in later episodes

800
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:07,340
 But don't worry so much about what you're visually seeing think about that feeling you have

801
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:10,300
 because that feeling is

802
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:15,260
 Your sixth sense that's probably the bad term you're feeling is your seventh sense

803
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:22,940
 That feeling is just as important as sight as hearing and it's telling you that person has a bad aura

804
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:25,260
 It's telling you that person

805
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:27,900
 May not be a person

806
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:33,180
 So don't worry about evp readers don't worry about

807
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:37,500
 electronic devices unless you're a gamer then you know you probably worry about this

808
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:42,620
 But don't worry about the goggles and the think about it those ghost hunters. They go in with the machine

809
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:45,820
 They're like look at the temperature is lowered

810
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:51,900
 That's doesn't prove that doesn't prove anything more than someone going in there and going

811
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:56,540
 I sense a great spirit in here one's a measurement that anyone could go

812
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:58,540
 Well, yeah, they're the blue the wind blue buyer

813
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:03,980
 I wasn't there and that could be fake and stuff like that we put so much of reliance on science when we're talking about something

814
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:05,980
 That's paranormal

815
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:10,380
 To the point that we're building carcinogenic glasses made of jet fuel on our face

816
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:16,780
 Let's we can do that stuff, but don't discount that gut feeling because if you're in that house

817
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:21,980
 Could cut see this way because if you're at home you may have all the emf readers

818
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:24,780
 You may have all the spirit boxes

819
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:29,900
 You may have your kill-nir screens on your face ready to go

820
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:31,660
 but

821
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:38,140
 All of those can be equally deceived as well. The only thing you can trust is when the pit of your stomach opens up

822
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:43,660
 Because that thing is standing behind you once again

823
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:51,420
 If it can't be seen by our eyes if it can break the laws of the universe

824
01:00:51,420 --> 01:01:00,300
 Why wouldn't it be able to deceive the technology man has made to detect it

825
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:05,980
 The only defense mechanism we have against this stuff is ourselves

826
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:09,980
 So don't waste money on this junk

827
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:15,100
 Just understand that when you feel uncomfortable

828
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:18,860
 There is probably a good reason for it

829
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:22,620
 Or

830
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:27,180

837
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:59,820
 This is normally the point where I immediately shut my mic off and I go

838
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:11,100
 Those in so thank you rampart and thanks Austin Austin for jumping in and christian I see you're in there as well

839
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:13,260
 Shane

840
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:15,260
 I um

841
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:19,580
 Normally with those this one I kind of knew how it's gonna end it because I remember the other day

842
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:23,980
 I was taking a shower and I go why is it so important for us to see these things when I was looking at these glasses

843
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:29,580
 I was like, why is it so important for us to see these things like isn't it enough for us to just know?

844
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:36,300
 And I get it. It's uh, it's okay mug. I get it. It's a

845
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:41,740
 Like you want to see you and I get that too like I would

846
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:46,860
 It's it's an interesting dilemma and I was thinking about then I go that's kind of how I want to wrap this episode up

847
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:49,340
 You want to see it? I get it

848
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:57,900
 But it's how important is it to see it if you can feel it like I've seen

849
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:01,340
 A few things I've seen a few things but I've

850
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:03,340
 I've

851
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:09,260
 Experienced more than I've seen now. Take that which episode that I did the other day imagine if

852
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:13,340
 I um saw the witch walk into the salt and go

853
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:19,260
 Like a blue lightning show up and stuff like that. I could be like I could tell you guys that would you guys believe it though?

854
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:21,580
 Like even I was like guys, I swear to god

855
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:26,140
 I saw blue lightning come down and stop the witch from walking in you be like what?

856
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:29,820
 The story the fact that she doesn't walk in through the salt

857
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:31,820
 I

858
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:37,100
 Didn't see the physical reaction. I was sitting in the chair the whole time and this is a comfy chair by the way

859
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:39,820
 Who mentioned that earlier?

860
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:47,020
 Milk yeah, it is a comfy chair. Um, so yeah, we have this tendency to want to see

861
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:54,220
 And then callum that's funny callum just posted. What does everyone think about this supposed december second alien invasion?

862
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:59,740
 It's not gonna happen. I'm actually I would I have thought honestly about

863
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:01,740
 doing

864
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:03,740
 A podcast like a whole podcast

865
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:07,100
 Weekly podcast that's just prophecies

866
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:10,380
 Not old prophecies

867
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:15,260
 You could do a week and you're like hey everyone december second it's coming up

868
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:20,940
 Everyone's going everyone's going to get diced and then of course that would go by nobody's going to

869
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,500
 Pay attention to it

870
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:27,580
 And then you go on to the next one and the next one and the next one and all that stuff like these prophecies

871
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:34,460
 They keep coming. They're always super close. They disappear. I remember aliens were supposed to invade the 2012

872
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:40,380
 Olympics, I remember that aliens were supposed to invade the royal wedding

873
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:43,180
 I'm not the kate middleton one

874
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:49,500
 Um, what other world in civil war in the united states guys remember that just like a couple weeks ago

875
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:56,140
 We were being told that the war world war three with america is going to go to war if i ran and all this stuff is going to happen

876
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:59,660
 Everyone does this stuff. It's not just paranormal people

877
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:07,260
 Everyone does this everyone does these prophecies

878
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:14,620
 I'd say a late night tv show on sci-fi. That's what khaki kih was saying

879
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:20,460
 I don't understand why the whole idea. I mean I again, I believe in aliens

880
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:23,500
 I don't understand why we don't have a

881
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:26,460
 I

882
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:28,780
 Got to turn my fan on it's so hot

883
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:33,180
 Yeah, why don't aliens just fully invade or if they have been taken over

884
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:38,700
 These are the questions that I would like to ask someone who legitimately legitimately believes in

885
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:46,300
 The I had a brother-in-law. I guess I still have a brother-in-law who believes that reptilians are taking over the world

886
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:49,580
 They're queen of queen of england, you know, you guys know the theory

887
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:52,940
 Queen of england's a reptilian world leaders are reptilian

888
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:55,420
 I would love

889
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:58,940
 He legitimately believed that stuff. He might still but I would love to

890
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:06,620
 Sit down and talk with someone who actually believes that stuff because I just have a ton of questions. Yeah, david. Ike

891
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:14,300
 When did the aliens start my big question is this when did the aliens start doing this and what's taken him so long?

892
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:22,860
 Those are big questions. Um khaki cube. Have you ever heard the theory that earth is actually under alien sanction?

893
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:26,940
 No aliens are allowed to make contact with earth. That's an old one. I've heard that before

894
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:30,940
 It's a pretty convenient one as to why aliens don't make contact with us

895
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:39,100
 Obviously, there's some leaps of logic in that and this is funny because like again if with with straight off alien encounter stories

896
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:40,700
 I'm more

897
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:45,820
 I want to say trusting but I give them more the benefit of the doubt but that is becomes a conspiracy theory

898
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:51,260
 Why would the aliens have this convention put up? Oh, it's because humans are barbaric and then

899
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:58,940
 They have to learn what what if humans done in the past when we've come across quote unquote barbaric people on this planet

900
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:02,460
 Do we just sit there

901
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:08,220
 There's basically a couple tribes left now that we don't do anything like on the island

902
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:12,540
 We covered it in one of our stories about. Um, what was the name of that island?

903
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:16,220
 paint paradise island a sanctuary island or something like that

904
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:21,180
 Generally we we either enslave them destroy them

905
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:24,300
 or um convert them

906
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:26,620
 And usually it's a combination of the three

907
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:29,100
 So why would the aliens be sitting outside this?

908
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:36,060
 Planet the only planet with that has liquid water in it in a any sort of as far as we can tell

909
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:42,940
 As far as we can tell within light years of us the only planet with liquid water with two thirds of it being liquid water

910
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:45,260
 Why would you just sit back?

911
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:49,580
 And just kind of see if they blow it up. It doesn't make sense. I can see there. It doesn't make sense

912
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:53,180
 And yeah, the rampart says that's the star trek's prime directive a lot of

913
01:07:53,180 --> 01:08:01,420
 A lot of UFO conspiracies are pulled directly from science fiction. Sure. You could argue it's vice versa that the cia is trying to

914
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:06,060
 put those theories into science fiction so people don't believe them when they come out but

915
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:09,180
 You do see a lot of that as well

916
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:15,740
 A bonkerman says that he's heard it's more advantageous for alien race to obtain the raw materials from asteroids

917
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:16,220
 That's true

918
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:19,660
 It would be more advantageous for us to get raw materials from asteroids

919
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:23,820
 But you can't get tons of liquid water from asteroids and as far as we know

920
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:31,660
 Liquid water is important. I mean assuming they're biological which a reptilian would be a biological and nordic would be biological

921
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:37,660
 Even if they have massive water reserves in their home system, they're a far far from home

922
01:08:39,180 --> 01:08:41,740
 So why don't they come to take our water like well again?

923
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:46,140
 Why are they just kind of hanging out and waiting to figure it out and you can imagine like the nordics of the table and he's like

924
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:51,100
 I believe the humans deserve a chance and the gray aliens talking about hippie

925
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:56,220
 Environmental nonsense the reptilians like let's eat them all like how's that a council?

926
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:59,260
 Basically they all hate each other's guts

927
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:02,700
 Aaa

928
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:06,380
 Asked if I could talk to bigfoot, what would you ask or tell him?

929
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:09,180
 That's an interesting question if I could talk to bigfoot

930
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:12,060
 If I met bigfoot and he I could talk to him

931
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:19,500
 I would probably ask him why

932
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:22,940
 Like what is he doing here?

933
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:27,660
 Not from some sort of metaphysical thing because that's a deep question. You're walking on the street and you're like, hey, buddy

934
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:28,700
 What's up?

935
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:31,420
 Why are you here? I like to get coffee. You're like no

936
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:38,940
 Why are you I would wonder why he hangs out in the forest and stuff like what's his he may be like me bigfoot

937
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:41,020
 Me this is me home

938
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:45,420
 And I'm a leprechaun now. I'm saying me all the time. You could be like this is just where I hang out

939
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:50,780
 But I would be I would be curious like did you used to be human do I have more than one question?

940
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:52,620
 Did you used to be a human?

941
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:56,220
 Are you from another dimension? What's like? What are you talking about weirdo?

942
01:09:56,220 --> 01:10:00,780
 I'm a giant ape that can talk for like five minutes. You're asking me if I used to be human to me

943
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:04,940
 That's the scariest bigfoot theory every time I cover it on the show. It gives me the heebie-jeebies

944
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:09,340
 People turning into bigfoot. So I've covered that twice and it's super spooky. Yes

945
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:13,740
 Milk xm64 sentinel island. That's what I was talking about. Thank you

946
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:23,580
 Bigfoot's watching the stream right now

947
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:26,300
 yeah, you know, there's a lot of

948
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:30,140
 belief that bigfoot and UFOs are tied together

949
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:33,260
 Why is it that the states with the most cryptids

950
01:10:33,260 --> 01:10:37,100
 Also have lots of goth girls in it like florida, for example

951
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:41,740
 I don't know if that's true because I'm assuming that new orleans has a ton of goth girls

952
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:47,340
 I don't know how big their cryptid count is. I know I really haven't found many cryptids in

953
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:55,020
 A lot of times they're lame cryptids. No fence. No fence southern southern dead rabbit radio listens

954
01:10:55,260 --> 01:11:00,140
 You have like swamp creeper dude. Yeah, it's basically bigfoot, but he smells even worse

955
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:02,620
 Maybe a lizard man

956
01:11:02,620 --> 01:11:03,980
 That's it

957
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:09,820
 I gotta say this man south america has it beat for cryptids like the stories that we've pulled out of south america

958
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:12,300
 South america and eastern europe

959
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:18,860
 But I don't think anyone's come close to south america's cryptid count. Absolutely insane. Absolutely insane down there

960
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:21,580
 I will say this. I remember once reading something

961
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:25,660
 You know why we get all the crazy articles about florida and florida man and all that stuff

962
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:29,900
 It's not that florida has a higher population of crazy people. It's that their

963
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:35,340
 Public records and their freedom of information is way more open than any other state

964
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:40,780
 So if someone commits any sort of crime all the information is released almost immediately

965
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:49,900
 So their name details of the crime stuff like that other states can take a while other states have more stringent rules on on who can know what

966
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:54,860
 That's why florida has so many crazy cases. They just have much more open access

967
01:11:54,860 --> 01:11:58,540
 Much more open access

968
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:07,980
 The documents how do we get talking about goth girls? I mean i'm not complaining necessarily, but i'm seeing goth girls pop up a lot

969
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:14,380
 Um, which again not complaining. I think we talked about this before how come there's not goth the women

970
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:18,860
 And I think it's because most of them start using heroin at some point

971
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:20,620
 um

972
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:25,660
 But yeah, is it if you are 30 years old and you're dressed goth and you're not a musician

973
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:28,780
 You're not a heroin addict and you're not a vampire

974
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:34,140
 Are you a goth girl or a goth woman? Is there another term for it? Is there a goth term?

975
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:41,100
 Is historical hiker still on here? She may know she knows about old timey stuff. Um, she's like what no

976
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:45,100
 I don't know if there's such a thing as a goth woman. I don't know if she's still on here though

977
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:50,860
 I've been thinking about redoing the boo pill

978
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:55,740
 That episode came out years ago or two years ago. I think it's an important episode

979
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:58,860
 I think it's an important episode

980
01:12:58,860 --> 01:13:02,700
 Girls love the paranormal

981
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:04,620
 so if you want

982
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:11,500
 To find a good way to communicate with girls do paranormal people levitate girl levitating in the corner and they're like, hey ladies

983
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:13,660
 How are you doing?

984
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:16,060
 um, no join a ghost hunting group

985
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:21,260
 Or a man that must suck with all pandemic stuff not being able to do ghost hunting

986
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:26,700
 Or there's a bunch more ghosts running around. I actually miss ghost hunting. That's one of the things

987
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:31,100
 That I really haven't done in years. I would love to do that

988
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:37,660
 I would love to start doing that again x m 64 the boo pill is my theory

989
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:44,140
 That if you want to meet women be interested get interested in paranormal because women love this stuff

990
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:46,460
 so

991
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:51,340
 Learn to do tarot cards learn to read palms do astrology ghost hunting

992
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:56,700
 See women aren't so much in encrypted hunting. You're like, oh, we're gonna go hunt a squash. They're like, uh

993
01:13:56,700 --> 01:14:00,060
 But if you're like, oh, we're walking through a dark house with this device

994
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:06,860
 Girls love that stuff girls love to be scared. So take the boo pill. Um, it's a good way

995
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:08,940
 It's really is a good way to meet women

996
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:12,860
 Yeah, we might do it as a rerun the problem is in that episode

997
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:18,140
 I played audio from someone else's clip and I had to be I think I edited it out at this point

998
01:14:18,140 --> 01:14:24,700
 I had to be careful earlier on in the show. I was doing more stuff like that. See you later. Ross. Have a happy Thanksgiving

999
01:14:24,700 --> 01:14:32,940
 Um, yeah, but you got to be careful with copyright on the podcast side and the youtube side. So I think I took that out

1000
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:39,420
 What's going on in the afterlife that prevents ghosts from talking to us in a more obvious way

1001
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:44,700
 Why do they have to be so vague? I think that there's basically two answers to that one is

1002
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:50,300
 That they don't have the power to or they can only manifest in certain ways

1003
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:53,740
 I think which is interesting, you know, a lot of people who have ghost experiences

1004
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:58,620
 Especially when people have passed away loved ones have passed away. They come to them at night. They come to them in dreams

1005
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:00,140
 They'll smell

1006
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:04,220
 The smell where they're sitting in their dad's chair. They'll smell as old cigars and stuff like that

1007
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:06,860
 I think all that's touching and I'm not diminishing that at all

1008
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:11,980
 I think the thing is is like I think the most obvious answer is how come after your

1009
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:17,340
 Father or your mother or your brother passed away. They're not constantly hanging out with you helping you shoot hoops

1010
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:21,260
 Because after you die everything here seems so minimal

1011
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:24,140
 it would be the equivalent of

1012
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:29,420
 As an adult do you ever go back to your kindergarten playground?

1013
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:35,100
 Like I don't even know if that's a good example as an adult would you ever

1014
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:38,700
 pick up

1015
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,780
 a rattle

1016
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:46,940
 And if you did would you be amazed by it? I think when you died the and you don't forget the people here

1017
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:53,420
 But I also have a theory that there's no time in the afterlife. So let's say that I died right now

1018
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:55,420
 and

1019
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:58,220
 My mother dies 30 years from now

1020
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:04,060
 In heaven, thank you osu!mir or in the afterlife. I guess I should say

1021
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:06,700
 I died and instantly

1022
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:09,020
 Thank you, Ari appreciate that

1023
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:15,100
 I died and then instantly my mom standing next to me. There's no time there. It's not like I'm up there and I'm like 30 years

1024
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:17,500
 Oh, I'm so alone

1025
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:20,060
 There's no time. It's all instant. So to you

1026
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:26,860
 On earth it's 30 years and then you pass away and you see them to them. You're already standing right next to them. So

1027
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:30,220
 since time isn't of an issue

1028
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:35,660
 And you're in a realm where you realize all this stuff is inconsequential. Why would you be hanging out here?

1029
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:39,820
 Because as far as you're concerned, everyone's up there already. That's just my theory

1030
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:43,420
 It doesn't make sense that you would have people floating around in the afterlife

1031
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:47,660
 Time is something that really only exists in this dimension that we can measure it

1032
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:54,220
 Barfee man, I have a pop filter. This is my backup mic. This is my real mic over here

1033
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:57,500
 Tlm. Yeah, am I popping it pretty bad? That sucks

1034
01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:02,860
 I'm gonna lean in really really close. Yeah, this is my blue yeti. This is my live stream mic

1035
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:11,340
 As mere asks do you believe in the law of attraction? Yeah, I've actually done a couple episodes on the law of attraction

1036
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:15,980
 Um, I 100 believe in it. I think you I think that you

1037
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:21,100
 I think people who don't believe in the law of attraction still use the law of attraction

1038
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:23,500
 Which is a kind of an interesting thing

1039
01:17:24,060 --> 01:17:28,860
 You'll see any bodybuilder any bodybuilder you talk to

1040
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:32,940
 They'll say when I started bodybuilding I visualized this body

1041
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:37,020
 Before I started

1042
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:42,380
 Lifting I visualized what I'm gonna look like today and as I was working out over the years

1043
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:46,380
 I would visualize my legs getting bigger my thighs getting bigger. That's a lot of attraction

1044
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:49,420
 A businessman doesn't go into his shop

1045
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:52,940
 Five times or seven days a week. It's a small business owner

1046
01:17:52,940 --> 01:17:57,100
 Goes in there seven days a week works eight hours a day and then it's a success

1047
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:03,580
 You have to visualize that success and and I am he pointed out nevel Goddard. I believe

1048
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:10,380
 I recommend going to Wallace waddles. They really the guy who invented it. He preceded nevel by about 30 years

1049
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:13,020
 I believe he wrote the science of getting rich

1050
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:18,300
 And that book changed my life it changed definitely changed the way I look at life

1051
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:24,780
 I don't really read a lot of books. I read monthly articles, but that book's amazing and the law of attraction totally works

1052
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:29,900
 I do not work on this show. There are times where I don't use the law of attraction on this show

1053
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:34,940
 And I noticed that my my views go down and my I don't gain new listeners

1054
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:43,100
 But when I focus on people finding the podcast enjoying the podcast my numbers go up. It's 100 true. You create your reality

1055
01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:51,100
 Yeah cocky cute cocky cube said I I heard a theory once that ghosts exist in all forms at once time past present future

1056
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:53,100
 Yeah, that would make sense

1057
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:56,780
 It would make sense. You'd be chilling up there with you know, vlog tepe is

1058
01:18:56,780 --> 01:19:01,260
 Hopefully not but you know, maybe he's gone over his whole impaling thing into him

1059
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:04,860
 He's only been up there for a minute. You wouldn't even notice you're like, hey, vlog. What's up?

1060
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:09,500
 You're all covering your butthole as you're walking by and he's like, yeah, it's a horrible stereotype

1061
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:15,260
 Yeah

1062
01:19:15,260 --> 01:19:19,340
 Denzo says that skateboarding is a lot of law of attraction. I think any sport

1063
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:25,500
 Where you're thinking you visualize that ball going out of the stadium. It's super powerful

1064
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:32,220
 It's a super powerful thing to visualize and the sport is interesting because you have everyone's visualizations working against each other

1065
01:19:32,220 --> 01:19:34,620
 but

1066
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:38,380
 The universe gives you what you ask of it now. Obviously the pushback is you always hear

1067
01:19:38,380 --> 01:19:41,100
 What about some kid in the Sudan?

1068
01:19:41,260 --> 01:19:46,700
 His family was killed by raiders and he's on the run and he hasn't eaten in four days where his law of attraction

1069
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:49,740
 Do I think he brought those raiders to his village? No

1070
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:53,340
 No, I don't think the law of attraction in my personal experience

1071
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:55,660
 Because I'll be walking on the street and I'll be like, dude

1072
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:59,580
 I hope like some ninjas jump out of the bushes right now and then Leonardo comes and he helps me

1073
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:03,020
 We fight off the foot clan. I'm constantly thinking about like getting in fights

1074
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:06,540
 I'm constantly thinking about like what happens if someone kicked in my door right now

1075
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:12,940
 I'm always thinking about all of this stuff and never happens. It never happens. I'm just always on edge

1076
01:20:12,940 --> 01:20:18,700
 I don't think the law of attraction works on a negative aspect. It probably would if that's all you did

1077
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:20,780
 I also have positive thoughts

1078
01:20:20,780 --> 01:20:22,780
 But if you think positively

1079
01:20:22,780 --> 01:20:28,060
 I don't basically what I'm saying is the kid in the Sudan that was really unlucky that he was born in that place in that time

1080
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:30,380
 in that village

1081
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:32,220
 It sucks

1082
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:36,060
 but if we could get that kid out of that village get him into a

1083
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:38,780
 like a society

1084
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:42,540
 Move him to Egypt or something like that move him anywhere

1085
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:46,380
 Give him some books give him some people who care about him

1086
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:51,180
 And apply the law of attraction that kid's going to be a success without law of attraction

1087
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:54,140
 The kid will still be have a much better life than he had before

1088
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:57,180
 Because you know, he was not under constant threat of getting killed

1089
01:20:57,180 --> 01:21:02,220
 But I think a lot of attraction can't help but it doesn't I mean if you're in a situation like that

1090
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:10,540
 You didn't cause that but you can use this as one of your toolkits to get out of it. So I think I do think it's definitely worthwhile

1091
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:16,220
 AFX asked what's the deepest rabbit hole you ever explored?

1092
01:21:16,220 --> 01:21:18,300
 um

1093
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:20,220
 the conformers

1094
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:22,220
 the conformers that story still

1095
01:21:22,220 --> 01:21:28,460
 The conformers 100 the conformers like I can't even go into detail about what happened

1096
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:31,260
 the conformers

1097
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:35,100
 I'm not yeah that that's the weirdest rabbit hole I've ever covered on this show

1098
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:40,060
 It's episode it's like episode 87 or something like that. It was weird when I covered it

1099
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:44,300
 It was weird when I was researching it. It has not stopped being weird

1100
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:46,780
 all this time

1101
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:50,940
 The conformers that's all I cannot go into any more detail about what is

1102
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:56,140
 the summary of the conformer's story was that there was an alien race of

1103
01:21:56,140 --> 01:21:58,860
 um inorganic rocks

1104
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:01,500
 I can't do a follow-up

1105
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:05,740
 I'm barfing man the conformer's story is just so

1106
01:22:05,740 --> 01:22:13,020
 The conformers are an alien race supposedly it's the only alien race and they're inorganic minerals

1107
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:17,980
 Their voices sound like pebbles falling in a metal bucket. They're extremely religious

1108
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:23,260
 Extremely violent and the governments of the world have made contact with the conformers on multiple

1109
01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:26,460
 points multiple times

1110
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:29,340
 Try researching it

1111
01:22:29,420 --> 01:22:32,380
 You're not going to be able to find anything probably only my episode

1112
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:36,620
 As I was researching it websites are getting deleted

1113
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:39,340
 as I was researching it

1114
01:22:39,340 --> 01:22:45,500
 I heard about it. It was a throwaway line on a mysterious universe episode back in like 2005

1115
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:48,460
 2006 that you just mentioned it

1116
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:56,540
 It always intrigued me and I went looking for it found some stuff websites got deleted. I did the episode the weirdness

1117
01:22:56,540 --> 01:22:58,780
 has not stopped

1118
01:22:58,780 --> 01:23:00,780
 100 percent

1119
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:03,100
 The conformers

1120
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:08,940
 Yeah

1121
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:11,580
 Um

1122
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:17,580
 That's the deepest rabbit hole I've ever fallen into and the point the thing the interesting thing is

1123
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:23,420
 When when it comes to the show I'll say this there are times where I'll come across information

1124
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:31,180
 I like to share the information with you if I come across conspiracy theories that I can't talk about on the show

1125
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:38,300
 Like I used to be all about like gaining the knowledge gaining the knowledge, but the thing is is like

1126
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:42,540
 What what's the point of having knowledge if you can't share from it?

1127
01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:44,540
 Sure, you can learn from it, but if you can't share from it

1128
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:50,700
 So if I come across knowledge if I come across stuff that I can't share with you guys, I'm just like

1129
01:23:52,940 --> 01:23:58,620
 I'm good. I'm good like you can I'm good this conversation doesn't need to go any further. I'm

1130
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:02,860
 I'm fine. So that's when the rabbit hole that's to me is a deep rabbit hole

1131
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:06,860
 But uh, yeah now interesting story. It's over. I'm uh

1132
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:11,260
 Yeah conformers um someone asked

1133
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:19,820
 Maximilian have I ever heard of the green children of wool pit? Yeah, that's actually a pretty con like that

1134
01:24:19,820 --> 01:24:21,260
 that's one of those

1135
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:24,300
 Stories that you and I'm not insulting you at all or anything like that

1136
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:27,180
 but that's one of those stories that like when you get the books of

1137
01:24:27,180 --> 01:24:32,700
 Um like famous stories. That's one of them that that hasn't always been an interesting story

1138
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:39,740
 There's always been theories like they weren't actually green that it was a translation error that their clothes were green

1139
01:24:39,740 --> 01:24:44,460
 Some people said they were obviously like from inner earth. I think that's the most popular one

1140
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:47,580
 other people saying that they had

1141
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:50,060
 um

1142
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:55,260
 Some sort there's actually a disease that turns them green turns people green eat a bunch of green beans

1143
01:24:55,260 --> 01:25:02,460
 I think if I remember correctly the boy died in the girl stayed in the village and had kids and

1144
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:06,780
 Their kids could stick around like their kids didn't have any issues or anything like that

1145
01:25:06,780 --> 01:25:12,140
 I I think it's I think it's interesting because we also have this story about that woman who gets kidnapped

1146
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:14,620
 Well, it was bigfoot who got kidnapped in Siberia

1147
01:25:15,340 --> 01:25:22,620
 And they thought it was a bigfoot and they kept her captive for 30 years and the chieftain of the this back like in the 1800s early 1900s

1148
01:25:22,620 --> 01:25:25,100
 The chieftain of the village starts banging the lady

1149
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:30,460
 banging bigfoot and she gives birth to a couple kids and then she dies eventually just of old age

1150
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:31,740
 and

1151
01:25:31,740 --> 01:25:38,220
 Western or not western scientists, but scientists further out into russia hear this hear this old legend

1152
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:42,860
 They're like what you're banging bigfoot and there's still grandkids walking around they tested her

1153
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:48,780
 She wasn't bigfoot. She was a black woman. She was like an escaped slave in Siberia

1154
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:53,260
 That they thought was bigfoot because she didn't speak the language. She was tall

1155
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:57,580
 And they have a version of that type of cryptid over there

1156
01:25:57,580 --> 01:26:01,500
 So I would be my reason that was an episode. I really like the episode

1157
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:06,220
 I'm wondering if they could do the dna test in wool pit to see if they could actually

1158
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:09,980
 Or if they have because again, I haven't covered that I haven't followed the story since I was a kid

1159
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:13,580
 But uh, yeah, it is an interesting story

1160
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:21,580
 Lanny lanny akea asked if I've ever heard of or what was springfield jack again spring hill jack

1161
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:24,060
 actually people now believe that he was a

1162
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:30,540
 Like a sexual predator like his whole thing when he would jump out and grab women

1163
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:37,740
 And then leave and over time the legend became he could jump over walls that he had springs attached to his feet

1164
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:42,140
 Or that he was an actual cryptid when really it was a guy jumping out of the bushes and grabbing women

1165
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:45,740
 We covered him briefly on an episode. I did an episode about the ghosts

1166
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:49,980
 Where the origin of ghosts like the white sheet came from it was sex

1167
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:52,620
 You used to take poor people in england

1168
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:55,100
 put them in a

1169
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:58,940
 White sheet and tie the tie the feet if when they when they died when they're alive

1170
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:00,780
 They're like hey, we're gonna pull a prank on you

1171
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:05,580
 They'd put a white sheet over you and then tie it to the feet and then you just pick it up and throw it into the grave

1172
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:09,260
 So the idea of someone standing there with a white sheet over them

1173
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:15,500
 Thought this guy's a zombie this guy's a ghost. So it was like 18 late 1800s england

1174
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:22,300
 Or maybe mid 1800s england where the image of the ghosts and the white sheet popped up because it was such a terrifying figure

1175
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:24,940
 What people were doing is they were putting on a white sheet

1176
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:30,780
 Jumping out at women mostly walking down the street and then while they were shocked

1177
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:34,300
 Assaulting them sexually assaulting them people would also mug you

1178
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:37,020
 They jump which would be a little less

1179
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:39,260
 Startling if you're walking on the street and a guy jumped behind

1180
01:27:39,260 --> 01:27:45,180
 With a sheet looks like a ghost here. We're like, oh no a ghost, but then a gun shows up. You're like, oh, it's just

1181
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:47,660
 It's just the normal mugging

1182
01:27:47,660 --> 01:27:53,660
 Here i'll give you some like the balloons or whatever they used back then so yeah that was spring heal jack was kind of the same thing

1183
01:27:53,660 --> 01:27:56,380
 it was a

1184
01:27:56,380 --> 01:28:00,940
 It was basically a guy committing sexual assault. That's what i've seen. That's what i've seen

1185
01:28:00,940 --> 01:28:04,060
 Not seen myself, but i've seen that theory pop around

1186
01:28:04,060 --> 01:28:06,060
 I

1187
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:12,620
 See mad says can native american bigfoot legends come from early african migrants

1188
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:15,420
 most likely not

1189
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:18,380
 um, the the led see the thing in russia

1190
01:28:18,380 --> 01:28:21,500
 They were so far off

1191
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:25,260
 In syberia that they had never seen a black person before

1192
01:28:25,260 --> 01:28:32,700
 But every other part of the world even if you had african migrants coming to other parts of the world like this story because you have bigfoot in

1193
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:37,980
 Asia you have bigfoot in you don't really have bigfoot in europe, but you have the green man

1194
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:41,820
 You have them in americas and stuff like that you have in south america

1195
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:46,380
 All of those other regions would be used to people with very very dark skin

1196
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:51,740
 If not from africa like in asia there would be africans walking around and stuff like that trade routes

1197
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:54,780
 So i wouldn't be so shocking but in syberia

1198
01:28:54,780 --> 01:29:00,700
 They had just never seen a black person before and they did have those legends of those wild beasts running through

1199
01:29:01,180 --> 01:29:04,940
 The syberian forest so they just kind of put two and two together and they were wrong

1200
01:29:04,940 --> 01:29:07,420
 They were 100 wrong

1201
01:29:07,420 --> 01:29:10,140
 But that that was how that worked out like that

1202
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:19,100
 Then so i don't remember what episode the formers was i think if you go to youtube and type in conformers dead rabbit radio

1203
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:22,540
 It'll pop up. Um, if you listen to it on the podcast

1204
01:29:22,540 --> 01:29:26,540
 Here's a tip if you go to the dead rabbit radio website

1205
01:29:26,540 --> 01:29:30,540
 If you go to the the podcast site of the website, there's a search bar

1206
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:35,420
 If you're ever looking for a particular term because that's how i have to find stuff from time to time

1207
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:39,900
 I type it in the search bar. I type in conformers. It'll pop up every episode where

1208
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:43,100
 In the show notes or in the title the conformers is there

1209
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:46,060
 So if i remember looking for her like i'm like

1210
01:29:46,060 --> 01:29:49,100
 What was that story where a guy was changing his tire?

1211
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:53,020
 Alien alien popped out of the tire. It was really bad service from good year

1212
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:57,900
 I'll type that in and if i happen to have that in a headliner in the show notes or something like that

1213
01:29:57,900 --> 01:30:02,860
 It'll pop right up and i can find that episode because my big fear. Okay, uh, lannick

1214
01:30:02,860 --> 01:30:07,020
 Is saying it's episode 60 so it was real early on that would have been like

1215
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:09,660
 Three months into the show

1216
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:11,740
 That's how much i wanted to cover that story

1217
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:14,460
 um

1218
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:17,340
 Yeah, i have a um or is it episode 202

1219
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:25,100
 I don't know it's one of those two so anyways that would make i wouldn't be i would be surprised if it was early as episode 60

1220
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:28,220
 But it could be because i really wanted to cover something xm

1221
01:30:28,220 --> 01:30:36,460
 64 what do you have planned for episode 666 dude this this podcast is hard enough to pull off without doing special episodes honestly

1222
01:30:36,460 --> 01:30:40,380
 Like i didn't do an episode for 420 people are kind of like uh

1223
01:30:40,380 --> 01:30:47,500
 I barely did an episode for 500th anniversary or i'm not 500th anniversary 500 episode

1224
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:52,540
 I think i did an episode i didn't even do a special episode for episode 100

1225
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:57,580
 It's really hard to just do a daily show let alone plan stuff ahead. I have a bunch of stories for

1226
01:30:57,580 --> 01:31:00,700
 Christmas, but i'm not even going to do them on Christmas

1227
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:05,100
 I'm going to spread them out throughout the months because otherwise i'm just going to forget otherwise i'm just going to forget about them anyways

1228
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:11,580
 Shane Fitzgerald asked do i search every topic to make sure you haven't done it

1229
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:17,500
 Not every topic, but there's topics where i'll be reading something i'm like this sounds super familiar

1230
01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:24,380
 There was one that i was like oh my god this sounds super familiar. No i was researching. I was like oh this is so awesome

1231
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:30,460
 I can't wait to tell this story and then at the ending of the article was a detail and i was like oh that sounds familiar

1232
01:31:30,460 --> 01:31:35,500
 I'd already done it that would be embarrassing. You know again i'm 43 years old i'm

1233
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:39,020
 i'm physically fit

1234
01:31:39,020 --> 01:31:41,260
 Maybe not fit i'm physically healthy

1235
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:43,980
 I even have i bought one of these micrometer

1236
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:46,940
 because i was like um

1237
01:31:47,980 --> 01:31:49,980
 My brother got covid

1238
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:51,340
 dummy

1239
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:54,540
 He's doing fine. He's doing totally fine. But i was like

1240
01:31:54,540 --> 01:31:56,380
 well

1241
01:31:56,380 --> 01:31:58,380
 i'm gonna get me a little oximeter

1242
01:31:58,380 --> 01:32:00,700
 um

1243
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:03,740
 But i'm healthy my my heart my rusty heart rates good

1244
01:32:03,740 --> 01:32:06,060
 um

1245
01:32:06,060 --> 01:32:08,380
 My oxygen levels good and everything like that so

1246
01:32:08,380 --> 01:32:13,020
 Where were we going with that? What were we talking about?

1247
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:15,340
 even

1248
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:19,500
 This is what i was talking about i'm 43 years old so i'm like i'm starting to forget stuff

1249
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:21,660
 more easily

1250
01:32:21,660 --> 01:32:26,700
 As i forget what i'm talking about because of the blinking lights on this machine. I'm like

1251
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:32,460
 Yeah, i started to get lightheaded early honestly guys. I didn't know if i was going to be able to the episode

1252
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:35,260
 You guys who were there from the beginning the first

1253
01:32:35,260 --> 01:32:38,060
 I don't know like

1254
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:41,420
 What was it steward uh you guys steward sucker are you okay?

1255
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:47,420
 We were maybe 15 minutes into the episode and i was like i got lightheaded and i think um

1256
01:32:47,420 --> 01:32:49,500
 I forgot who said someone else said

1257
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:55,260
 Breathe i think i was talking too quickly. I think i was de-saturating my oxygen level

1258
01:32:55,260 --> 01:33:02,380
 Satan himself themed episode. You know what's funny? I've all this might be the ultimate

1259
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:05,420
 pacifist i'm not a pacifist

1260
01:33:05,420 --> 01:33:07,740
 quite adept at punching people but

1261
01:33:07,740 --> 01:33:10,140
 I would love to see

1262
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:12,460
 The story of reality end

1263
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:15,740
 With satan being like hey god, sorry about that whole

1264
01:33:15,740 --> 01:33:20,940
 You know rebellion trying to destroy earth and god's like ah bring it here bro and give each other

1265
01:33:20,940 --> 01:33:24,540
 I'd love to see that to be the end of the story whether or not that happens

1266
01:33:24,540 --> 01:33:28,380
 Who knows maybe because that's what i want in the afterlife. That's what i'll see

1267
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:31,180
 Who knows?

1268
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:37,180
 That's funny xm64 says you should delete the episode and skip to 667 make it a lost episode

1269
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:45,900
 People would have my head dude. I when i miss number episodes i get email which i'm grateful for i'm grateful for you guys fixing my mistakes

1270
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:46,700
 But

1271
01:33:46,700 --> 01:33:52,780
 We've been like hey man, uh, let's see your podcast for a while. I noticed that you have your episodes are out of order

1272
01:33:52,780 --> 01:33:55,340
 I was like, oh thanks, dude. So no which is nice

1273
01:33:55,340 --> 01:34:00,780
 Getting that fixed 14 family. I was thinking about them the other day. I actually christian

1274
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:03,180
 doll olmo

1275
01:34:03,180 --> 01:34:10,060
 Mentioned the uh the fact they have podcast used to be called the 14th century 14th family and i might actually do an episode

1276
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:18,220
 On that i got it. Yeah steward. It was super weird. I just i part of i've blanked out my screen now

1277
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:20,220
 So i can see your comments

1278
01:34:20,220 --> 01:34:23,580
 But i did this during the live stream i did um

1279
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:27,420
 The other day last week i stare at myself

1280
01:34:27,420 --> 01:34:32,060
 I stare at myself and the i think i mean i'm staring

1281
01:34:33,020 --> 01:34:37,980
 And i think it's messes with my eyes. I think it makes me lightheaded. I think i end up talking faster

1282
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:41,740
 But no i'm doing totally fine. Yeah, i was sitting here and i was

1283
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:46,700
 If you're curious you can go back and watch it like i was i sat here for a second i thought

1284
01:34:46,700 --> 01:34:51,260
 What do i do like i looked over and i think did i drink something wrong?

1285
01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:54,220
 Did i drink some dick of yammon?

1286
01:34:54,220 --> 01:34:55,980
 oh man

1287
01:34:55,980 --> 01:34:57,980
 Um, i was like what should i do?

1288
01:34:58,940 --> 01:35:02,780
 And i and i was part of me was like no just wrap it up and i was like nah

1289
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:06,460
 And look at you power through it you power through it

1290
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:16,780
 Score order says my girl mentioned the ringing and you hearing that silent did not exist prior to the 1800s

1291
01:35:16,780 --> 01:35:19,340
 Is that a conspiracy theory she heard?

1292
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:27,180
 It would be interesting to know i i doubt i would 100 doubt that people in the 1800s

1293
01:35:27,660 --> 01:35:31,820
 Were subjected to the amount of noises and noise pollution. We are

1294
01:35:31,820 --> 01:35:37,660
 I bet you if you took someone from the 1800s and put them not i'm not just talking about honking horns

1295
01:35:37,660 --> 01:35:40,700
 If you put them in a movie theater their ears would bleed

1296
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:46,380
 I think we have become so accustomed to such a loud noise think about it if you lived in a village

1297
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:50,780
 All your life and then someone played

1298
01:35:51,660 --> 01:35:57,900
 The the the inception trailer at the normal volume that the inception trailer is played at here

1299
01:35:57,900 --> 01:36:03,660
 People would other than the fact that people think demons were coming you they'd blow their eardrums out

1300
01:36:03,660 --> 01:36:05,820
 I don't think a cow could ever be as loud as

1301
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:10,380
 At a normal theater let alone an i max theater so

1302
01:36:10,380 --> 01:36:12,780
 that could be

1303
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:18,060
 They could have never heard that ringing because their ears were never never even close to being damaged as us

1304
01:36:18,060 --> 01:36:21,180
 Unless they're working in some massive factory

1305
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:23,500
 Oh

1306
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:26,460
 And let me so i'll get to that in a second chain

1307
01:36:26,460 --> 01:36:32,700
 Someone earlier asked how come my older episodes aren't available on the podcast app. They should be

1308
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:40,620
 I know that would probably be the podcast app itself. I do know that they're listed all the way

1309
01:36:40,620 --> 01:36:43,980
 Back there

1310
01:36:43,980 --> 01:36:47,900
 It shouldn't be

1311
01:36:49,180 --> 01:36:51,740
 I'm sorry. I saw that comment. I was going to reply to it

1312
01:36:51,740 --> 01:36:54,300
 um, every episode I have never

1313
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:59,580
 Put anything behind a paywall and I have never purposely removed episodes

1314
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:04,940
 I've had to edit episodes because of like massive errors in them

1315
01:37:04,940 --> 01:37:08,540
 But

1316
01:37:08,540 --> 01:37:10,540
 Recently when I had to fix

1317
01:37:10,540 --> 01:37:15,180
 That I had a patreon supporter. I think now I'm always going to remember him as kyle

1318
01:37:15,180 --> 01:37:18,060
 But I think his name was marked and I kept calling him kyle

1319
01:37:18,540 --> 01:37:20,540
 Oh, that was irritating

1320
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:23,260
 I think he needs another ride in the carpenter copter for that one

1321
01:37:23,260 --> 01:37:26,780
 But I've had to do edits, but I've never removed episodes. They should all be there

1322
01:37:26,780 --> 01:37:34,780
 Shane Fitzgerald, I don't know why that episode is is listed. I saw that too on spotify. It's listed as like

1323
01:37:34,780 --> 01:37:39,260
 The test episode. It's not a bad episode. I think it actually would get people interested in the show

1324
01:37:39,260 --> 01:37:45,180
 When you like because I could pin monkeys don't exist or Mormon bigfoot, but those episodes are so old

1325
01:37:46,140 --> 01:37:51,580
 I still think they're great. I still think great. I think the show is less sucky than it used to be

1326
01:37:51,580 --> 01:37:57,260
 I used to put out episodes that I was like this episode sucks. Thank you, but I had a deadline. I was like, uh

1327
01:37:57,260 --> 01:38:02,460
 Nowadays I'm what the reason why I think the show is better is I used to

1328
01:38:02,460 --> 01:38:08,940
 Research stories and put them together and I would spend time researching stories that weren't any good

1329
01:38:08,940 --> 01:38:12,380
 I'd spend a lot of time researching stories that weren't any good

1330
01:38:12,380 --> 01:38:15,900
 I have a whole maybe folder and sometimes they pop up

1331
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:21,900
 Sometimes I'll hold on to them for months and months and months and then I'll have another story that complements it and then it's

1332
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:23,820
 perfect

1333
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:28,700
 But it used to be I would just find stories and put them together and sometimes the story sucked and I wouldn't have any

1334
01:38:28,700 --> 01:38:31,900
 Backup. Sorry. I'd release the episode. I stopped doing that

1335
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:34,540
 around episode 100 or

1336
01:38:34,540 --> 01:38:39,660
 Something or maybe 200 but anyways, I think the episodes are much tighter now

1337
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:45,100
 You could argue whether or not the conspiracies are as good. I did cover a ton of great stuff in the beginning

1338
01:38:45,660 --> 01:38:48,380
 Like monkeys don't exist like the conformers and things like that

1339
01:38:48,380 --> 01:38:53,020
 But I really still like the direction of the show. I like the stories recovering

1340
01:38:53,020 --> 01:38:58,860
 Yeah, dead rabbit radio is anywhere you can get podcasts. It's on spotify. It's on apple podcast

1341
01:38:58,860 --> 01:39:04,460
 It's on a podcast addict. It's anywhere you can listen to podcasts. That's that

1342
01:39:04,460 --> 01:39:09,980
 So, yeah, no, it's a um

1343
01:39:09,980 --> 01:39:14,220
 It's a podcast that's on youtube as opposed to a youtube show that's turned into a podcast

1344
01:39:14,620 --> 01:39:22,780
 To slight distinction. But yeah, it's where if you I prefer to listen to podcasts on podcast apps, but I love this interaction

1345
01:39:22,780 --> 01:39:26,060
 I absolutely love the fact that people

1346
01:39:26,060 --> 01:39:28,860
 Um that I can talk to you guys like this

1347
01:39:28,860 --> 01:39:34,140
 Barfee man says I sort of missed the long period of butthole and poop themed episodes. That was a period

1348
01:39:34,140 --> 01:39:36,700
 I still have a few

1349
01:39:36,700 --> 01:39:38,780
 I still have a few

1350
01:39:38,780 --> 01:39:43,660
 You have to space those out like the episode the other day by the guy who hung himself

1351
01:39:44,540 --> 01:39:49,580
 That one was pretty gory. Um, steward said it was kind of creepy and it was kind of that balance

1352
01:39:49,580 --> 01:39:56,700
 But you you have to balance out the gross episodes because otherwise you're just you just do gross episodes and then people

1353
01:39:56,700 --> 01:39:59,980
 Don't want to don't want to listen to you anymore or

1354
01:39:59,980 --> 01:40:03,580
 That's all they want to hear and that's not all I want to talk about

1355
01:40:03,580 --> 01:40:11,980
 But you do need to be occasional I've done some bad episodes. I've actually probably could do a rerun week

1356
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:15,100
 The lord of the rings episode I think

1357
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:17,420
 Is the worst episode of the run of the show

1358
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:20,540
 Lord of the rings is lord of the rings real

1359
01:40:20,540 --> 01:40:23,100
 Is awful

1360
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:28,860
 It's so poorly edited it went on for like an hour and I cut it down to like 30 minutes

1361
01:40:28,860 --> 01:40:34,060
 Then I realized I cut out too much stuff, but I was super bored when I was recording it

1362
01:40:34,060 --> 01:40:36,060
 I think I actually wasn't feeling good either

1363
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:40,300
 I have a better recording schedule now and so that fits

1364
01:40:40,780 --> 01:40:43,820
 Yeah, khaki cube says I like most of the episodes. I think that's fair

1365
01:40:43,820 --> 01:40:49,820
 Not every not every episode is going to hit for you. I always do the episode. I think

1366
01:40:49,820 --> 01:40:53,340
 About me listening to it. I create the shows for

1367
01:40:53,340 --> 01:40:55,340
 me

1368
01:40:55,340 --> 01:40:57,980
 Not just saying it's selfish, but I think we're all kind of the same

1369
01:40:57,980 --> 01:41:01,740
 I think now there are days where I'm like, oh, I don't want to hear about another UFO store

1370
01:41:01,740 --> 01:41:04,860
 I don't want to hear about bigfoot store. I'm not interested in that conspiracy

1371
01:41:04,860 --> 01:41:08,780
 So you'll hit play you'll listen to what the two topics are for the show

1372
01:41:08,860 --> 01:41:11,100
 And then you maybe you listen to half of it and then shut it off

1373
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:15,420
 Totally fine. I do it too. There are podcasts that I absolutely love

1374
01:41:15,420 --> 01:41:19,580
 And I'll be listening to it and I'll be playing video games and then halfway through I'll pause it and I'll go

1375
01:41:19,580 --> 01:41:21,740
 Do something else and I'll never finish listening to the episode

1376
01:41:21,740 --> 01:41:27,180
 That that's just the way podcasts are you're not going to love every episode. I hope the episodes are enjoyable

1377
01:41:27,180 --> 01:41:30,140
 I enjoy making them. I enjoy the stories, but

1378
01:41:30,140 --> 01:41:31,980
 Yeah

1379
01:41:31,980 --> 01:41:33,260
 It happens

1380
01:41:33,260 --> 01:41:35,420
 It happens not everyone's going to love every one episode

1381
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:39,020
 Yeah, khaki cube says episodes 200 or early 300s

1382
01:41:39,020 --> 01:41:41,100
 I think the show was still really raw

1383
01:41:41,100 --> 01:41:45,660
 Then again, I think the topic because the topics are something that they come

1384
01:41:45,660 --> 01:41:51,660
 And no level of skill or production value or experience the topics are the topics

1385
01:41:51,660 --> 01:41:59,900
 So you can't really replicate that I think the store I think the show now is much tighter than it used to be

1386
01:41:59,900 --> 01:42:03,020
 I'll listen to early episodes and I'll be like

1387
01:42:04,300 --> 01:42:06,060
 It's so

1388
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:08,860
 There are episodes that I can't listen to and somebody picked one

1389
01:42:08,860 --> 01:42:15,420
 To be I'm going to show it during the reruns for our next best of I think it's probably one of the worst episodes

1390
01:42:15,420 --> 01:42:17,900
 It's a really good subject matter

1391
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:21,340
 It's a great story, but I totally messed it up

1392
01:42:21,340 --> 01:42:29,580
 Is really really bad really really bad. So anyway, oh no a a a it's lord of the rings is based on a true story

1393
01:42:29,580 --> 01:42:31,660
 Not that it was real

1394
01:42:31,660 --> 01:42:34,060
 Book but that it's actually actual history

1395
01:42:34,060 --> 01:42:40,060
 History yeah, barfing that says doesn't let relisten to depressing episodes totally fine

1396
01:42:40,060 --> 01:42:42,060
 I used to relisten to the show

1397
01:42:42,060 --> 01:42:44,620
 I think I've used to listen to the show more often now

1398
01:42:44,620 --> 01:42:50,700
 I just produce too much stuff and I listen to it two or three times and for its release while I'm editing it and things like that but

1399
01:42:50,700 --> 01:42:57,260
 Good night free. Yeah, thanks for coming out. Have a happy Thanksgiving

1400
01:43:00,220 --> 01:43:02,220
 Um

1401
01:43:02,220 --> 01:43:07,020
 A bonkerman says when you consider request you have some criteria in mind

1402
01:43:07,020 --> 01:43:09,500
 Yes

1403
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:13,340
 This is generally what I look at when I get requests one. How is it obscure?

1404
01:43:13,340 --> 01:43:17,660
 Like is it super well-known because that's really the main

1405
01:43:17,660 --> 01:43:23,420
 Thing if it's super well known. That's why I've never covered like the great reset

1406
01:43:23,420 --> 01:43:26,140
 I've never covered

1407
01:43:27,740 --> 01:43:31,180
 Basic references to like QAnon. I've never done a deep dive into that

1408
01:43:31,180 --> 01:43:36,460
 The reason why I covered adrenochrome was because sean puff daddy combs wrote that book

1409
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:39,020
 Wrote that book the adrenochrome witch

1410
01:43:39,020 --> 01:43:46,140
 So, you know, that was a if it's here's the thing is it obscure first thing? Secondly if it's not obscure

1411
01:43:46,140 --> 01:43:50,860
 Is there a new spin on it? So adrenochrome everyone knows about that the adrenochrome rich

1412
01:43:50,860 --> 01:43:53,500
 Written by sean puff daddy combs

1413
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:56,220
 There we go there

1414
01:43:56,860 --> 01:43:59,020
 And then is it funny or creepy?

1415
01:43:59,020 --> 01:44:04,380
 So when you're looking at stuff or super interesting someone last night

1416
01:44:04,380 --> 01:44:06,220
 dear

1417
01:44:06,220 --> 01:44:11,420
 Dear gobelman dear grobbleman. I think it's on youtube sent me an article

1418
01:44:11,420 --> 01:44:17,580
 Or sent me a lead for the story. I spent the neck and I knew normally don't spend this long right reading articles

1419
01:44:17,580 --> 01:44:20,460
 I spend the next two hours reading this guy's life story

1420
01:44:22,460 --> 01:44:30,140
 Super obscure never heard about it. It's not spooky. It's not scary, but it's incredibly interesting

1421
01:44:30,140 --> 01:44:36,060
 So that's really the criteria. How obscure is it if it's obscure? Is there something else going on?

1422
01:44:36,060 --> 01:44:41,820
 Is it funny or is it spooky or is it interesting and sometimes it's all three?

1423
01:44:41,820 --> 01:44:45,660
 Thank you. Thank you

1424
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:48,140
 I'm gonna try this zolo zolitz

1425
01:44:48,140 --> 01:44:50,460
 kuintale

1426
01:44:50,460 --> 01:44:52,060
 sf

1427
01:44:52,060 --> 01:44:57,660
 I'm glad you're enjoying the show and you have a Thanksgiving. You have a happy Thanksgiving as well. You have a happy Thanksgiving as well

1428
01:44:57,660 --> 01:45:04,540
 Thank you the rampart. Thank you. I really appreciate it soybean taking over the world

1429
01:45:04,540 --> 01:45:09,900
 That episode gets my number one episode is nicotine conspiracy theory

1430
01:45:09,900 --> 01:45:12,380
 um

1431
01:45:12,380 --> 01:45:18,220
 Is nicotine healthy for you recently someone there's a big youtube channel called blame it on a whore hay

1432
01:45:18,940 --> 01:45:24,220
 Covered some oh medieval found footage. They covered medieval found footage. So I've been getting a lot of hits on that video

1433
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:28,940
 And um, you have a soy beans is soy bean intelligent

1434
01:45:28,940 --> 01:45:33,900
 So a grand grand unified soy theory. It was the name of that episode that one gets a lot of stuff

1435
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:37,420
 I'm worried was I a fan of art bills catalog? Yeah

1436
01:45:37,420 --> 01:45:39,580
 Yeah

1437
01:45:39,580 --> 01:45:45,260
 I'm I'm a bit of a hipster though. I don't know if this is anti hipster hipster. I um

1438
01:45:45,260 --> 01:45:48,140
 I really like george nori

1439
01:45:48,380 --> 01:45:50,380
 I really like george nori

1440
01:45:50,380 --> 01:45:53,660
 Um, he was the one that I listened to the most. I remember

1441
01:45:53,660 --> 01:45:56,460
 When I lived in sacramento

1442
01:45:56,460 --> 01:45:59,820
 I had a period of time is about three months. I didn't have any electricity

1443
01:45:59,820 --> 01:46:07,820
 So my only entertainment was a portable dvd player that I would power up during the day at college

1444
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:12,380
 I think I might have had a laptop, but this was back in like 2004

1445
01:46:12,380 --> 01:46:14,220
 2005

1446
01:46:14,220 --> 01:46:19,500
 I did have a laptop, but there was the internet wasn't around like it is today. I don't think youtube was around

1447
01:46:19,500 --> 01:46:24,700
 So I'd watch star trek voyager on my miniature dvd player

1448
01:46:24,700 --> 01:46:29,180
 And I would listen to george nori at night on my ray battery powered radio

1449
01:46:29,180 --> 01:46:35,260
 So yeah, it kept me going. I think these types of these type of shows are important. They were important to me

1450
01:46:35,260 --> 01:46:40,140
 So thank you callum for that question. They're you know, they were important for me

1451
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:43,180
 Like I know what it's like to be alone and I know what it's like

1452
01:46:43,180 --> 01:46:47,020
 To have a hobby that either people think is super weird

1453
01:46:47,020 --> 01:46:51,260
 Or they think you're super weird for having it or they think you're dumb for having it

1454
01:46:51,260 --> 01:46:56,220
 And being able to sit in the dark and go to bed listening to

1455
01:46:56,220 --> 01:46:59,340
 george nori talked to people like me

1456
01:46:59,340 --> 01:47:05,260
 And then you know mysterious universe was the same thing where here is this guy

1457
01:47:05,260 --> 01:47:07,500
 I I I've listened to it

1458
01:47:07,660 --> 01:47:10,700
 Over the years, but when I first started listening to it was just a guy and

1459
01:47:10,700 --> 01:47:15,740
 He's talking about cool ghost alien stuff. It makes you not feel alone

1460
01:47:15,740 --> 01:47:17,820
 And I think that's the most important thing

1461
01:47:17,820 --> 01:47:23,340
 That people can do for each other. It's not a special superpower. It's not something that because I'm a podcaster, right?

1462
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:27,340
 We can all make each other not feel alone. So yeah, that's what george nori did for me

1463
01:47:27,340 --> 01:47:33,180
 All that stuff. Yeah, and that's a good question. Okay, what are some popular or non obscure theories?

1464
01:47:33,980 --> 01:47:40,540
 This is a question from khaki cube. What are some popular or non obscure theories paranormal events that you think could possibly be true?

1465
01:47:40,540 --> 01:47:43,660
 um

1466
01:47:43,660 --> 01:47:49,900
 I think there's a lot of them. I think that paranormal events again most of the time people are like I saw a ghost walking on the hallway

1467
01:47:49,900 --> 01:47:55,260
 That's fine. I'm not I that doesn't affect me whether or not they saw a ghost or saw an aura

1468
01:47:55,260 --> 01:47:59,900
 Whether or not they they saw an alien or you if it doesn't affect me it doesn't affect anyone

1469
01:47:59,900 --> 01:48:03,340
 It's probably an interesting story. It may be true. I'm gonna accept it

1470
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:10,060
 At a face value it's when people start trying to fleece other people and this I think you guys might have caught on too

1471
01:48:10,060 --> 01:48:12,300
 I didn't say this when I was wrapping this episode up

1472
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:18,620
 When people when people are selling 90 dollar glasses telling you can see auras that's ripping people off when people are telling you

1473
01:48:18,620 --> 01:48:20,700
 You can attend their workshops to find out if you

1474
01:48:20,700 --> 01:48:28,540
 Were reincarnated from Atlantis you're ripping people off if someone's just telling you hey, you know, I'm from Atlantis

1475
01:48:29,820 --> 01:48:34,780
 Okay, that's totally fine. Thank you, ug. Thank you. Thank you very much for that

1476
01:48:34,780 --> 01:48:38,620
 But when people start grifting each

1477
01:48:38,620 --> 01:48:44,060
 That's when I'm I get that's when I start to get skeptical. That's when I'm like, okay. Well, let's hold on here

1478
01:48:44,060 --> 01:48:48,060
 Um, let's see what this is all about because I think someone's ripping each other off

1479
01:48:48,060 --> 01:48:51,580
 But it's but I think as far as so paranormal stories when Miley Cyrus

1480
01:48:51,580 --> 01:48:56,140
 And demi lavato recently said that they saw UFOs. I'm like, yeah, they probably did

1481
01:48:56,620 --> 01:49:00,940
 They they very may well have seen an identified flying objects or actual

1482
01:49:00,940 --> 01:49:07,260
 Alien ships. I don't know. I hope they had fun seeing them. They're probably telling the truth

1483
01:49:07,260 --> 01:49:12,220
 But when it comes to stuff like yawning eggs, that's when I'm a little more

1484
01:49:12,220 --> 01:49:17,580
 I'm not answering your question. It's funny because I'm thinking the paranormal part as far as conspiracy is being true

1485
01:49:17,580 --> 01:49:23,420
 um, I think a lot of the I remember hearing a conspiracy theory a long time ago that

1486
01:49:23,420 --> 01:49:25,820
 uh, Lou Perlman

1487
01:49:25,820 --> 01:49:31,180
 The I don't know if it's a conspiracy theory that was a conspiracy that Lou Perlman the manager of the Backstreet Boys

1488
01:49:31,180 --> 01:49:33,980
 Um, was raping them

1489
01:49:33,980 --> 01:49:38,860
 I remember hearing that a long time ago through like some back channels in the music biz

1490
01:49:38,860 --> 01:49:42,780
 I don't even remember where I heard that from it's from one of my friends

1491
01:49:42,780 --> 01:49:48,620
 We were all making music together. I'd heard that and I was like, what he's like. Yeah. Yeah, apparently

1492
01:49:48,620 --> 01:49:54,140
 He raped the Backstreet Boys when they first got started and I was like, what are you talking about?

1493
01:49:54,460 --> 01:49:58,700
 And apparently I guess he did one of them like it turned out to be true

1494
01:49:58,700 --> 01:50:02,860
 He's in prison now, but I think he's in prison now for like tax fraud

1495
01:50:02,860 --> 01:50:05,500
 So it's something like that

1496
01:50:05,500 --> 01:50:07,500
 It's those little weird

1497
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:13,900
 Conspirators that you hear like you've got to sleep your way to the top and then like bird man starts banging little wane and all sorts of

1498
01:50:13,900 --> 01:50:21,660
 Weird those type of conspiracies. I believe more and those are again very mainstream if you're into uh hip hop

1499
01:50:21,660 --> 01:50:23,740
 you've definitely heard about bird man and

1500
01:50:24,300 --> 01:50:26,300
 Little wane. I hope it's not true

1501
01:50:26,300 --> 01:50:29,340
 Let's see here

1502
01:50:29,340 --> 01:50:32,140
 Yeah, no problem moss no problem at all

1503
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:40,140
 I'm just reading these here

1504
01:50:40,140 --> 01:50:53,580
 Uh, lanny lanny akea said what do I think about when a place that's supposed to be haunted is guarded by other people

1505
01:50:54,140 --> 01:50:58,060
 Not like monks and robes or anything like that but when like the county purchases the property

1506
01:50:58,060 --> 01:51:00,380
 We actually did that

1507
01:51:00,380 --> 01:51:06,140
 Another story like that just the other day where there was a house that was supposed to be haunted that the county purchased

1508
01:51:06,140 --> 01:51:08,140
 I find that extremely suspicious

1509
01:51:08,140 --> 01:51:11,340
 I find that extremely extremely suspicious

1510
01:51:11,340 --> 01:51:17,820
 When you have the government blocking off access to supposed haunted places. So yeah, even though it is a

1511
01:51:17,820 --> 01:51:20,060
 it's

1512
01:51:20,060 --> 01:51:23,980
 That's funny because charging people to go in a haunted house to me that could be

1513
01:51:24,140 --> 01:51:26,620
 Kind of a grift but again, it's not hurt anyone

1514
01:51:26,620 --> 01:51:31,820
 You have fun time walking around in a haunted house to cost you five bucks when you're paying like

1515
01:51:31,820 --> 01:51:38,780
 The rampart says two thousand dollars an hour to go to a seminar to see if they are from mars. That's a grift

1516
01:51:38,780 --> 01:51:43,900
 When you're ripping them off william burtles. Thank you very very much for that donation

1517
01:51:43,900 --> 01:51:49,580
 And then yeah, ug as well. I wanted to appreciate that ug said dr

1518
01:51:49,740 --> 01:51:56,380
 Is the most underrated content on youtube really appreciate that and william burtles says that thanks for keeping company in my mind intrigued during a

1519
01:51:56,380 --> 01:51:59,260
 Difficult lonely year. I've been hearing that from a lot of you guys

1520
01:51:59,260 --> 01:52:05,660
 So i'm glad that this show has been there. I mean dude. It definitely helped me those first six weeks or whatever

1521
01:52:05,660 --> 01:52:08,460
 was um

1522
01:52:08,460 --> 01:52:15,500
 Dude, I was just petrified man. Nobody knew anything. I was super scared. Thank you jones. Thank you really really appreciate that

1523
01:52:15,500 --> 01:52:18,540
 I was the little little pear dude doing the bow

1524
01:52:19,180 --> 01:52:21,180
 um, I was super

1525
01:52:21,180 --> 01:52:25,980
 Paranoid i'm glad that I had this show to do. I'm glad that it didn't take any time off

1526
01:52:25,980 --> 01:52:27,980
 I'm glad the show helped you guys as well

1527
01:52:27,980 --> 01:52:30,460
 helped the community going

1528
01:52:30,460 --> 01:52:34,780
 Yeah, i'm glad I was able to help you guys out because you guys helped me out as well

1529
01:52:34,780 --> 01:52:40,140
 Um ug says your sotomy gamora episode was dark dude. Was that the one

1530
01:52:40,140 --> 01:52:44,940
 Where god was raped? I'm pretty sure that was that episode. That was a dark one

1531
01:52:45,740 --> 01:52:49,260
 That's an episode that I thought was I enjoyed

1532
01:52:49,260 --> 01:52:53,500
 Making that episode. That's not an episode. I don't think anyone could listen to

1533
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:58,060
 It's not like a serbian film, but it's not an episode you want to listen to

1534
01:52:58,060 --> 01:53:02,700
 Twice I think it's an interesting story and I think it's a rough ending

1535
01:53:02,700 --> 01:53:04,940
 um

1536
01:53:04,940 --> 01:53:06,780
 Yeah

1537
01:53:06,780 --> 01:53:10,380
 Yeah, god was raped. I mean that's a powerful statement

1538
01:53:10,380 --> 01:53:12,540
 um

1539
01:53:12,540 --> 01:53:16,220
 That was real like when I was doing the uh conspiracy theory iceberg

1540
01:53:16,220 --> 01:53:19,020
 that was one of the um

1541
01:53:19,020 --> 01:53:23,420
 That was one of the episodes that I really wanted to cover was that one

1542
01:53:23,420 --> 01:53:26,300
 um

1543
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:28,700
 That topic because it was just so evocative

1544
01:53:28,700 --> 01:53:34,860
 But yeah, no, it was really interesting the um, shane Fitzgerald said have I caught any flak?

1545
01:53:34,860 --> 01:53:39,500
 No, the only episode the episodes that I caught the most flak for

1546
01:53:40,460 --> 01:53:45,100
 Um, harry potter was not written by jk Rowling. I to this day

1547
01:53:45,100 --> 01:53:52,540
 Get comments about what an idiot I am for not reading the books and having an opinion on it

1548
01:53:52,540 --> 01:53:57,980
 Which if I responded to stuff I'd go you don't listen to every episode of my podcast

1549
01:53:57,980 --> 01:54:02,300
 So how can you have an opinion on my podcast? I see the thing is is like I don't

1550
01:54:02,300 --> 01:54:06,220
 React to negative comments. I stopped reading them at a certain point

1551
01:54:06,780 --> 01:54:11,660
 And thank you fellow content creator you had mentioned that earlier as well about supporting the show and I really appreciate that

1552
01:54:11,660 --> 01:54:13,900
 I

1553
01:54:13,900 --> 01:54:15,900
 Don't read negative comments

1554
01:54:15,900 --> 01:54:18,220
 I don't read negative comments

1555
01:54:18,220 --> 01:54:23,980
 If I start to recognize a certain username they're constantly leaving negative comments. I just stop reading their comments

1556
01:54:23,980 --> 01:54:29,660
 Um, because some people that's what they'll do. I got I'm too busy for that. I'm too busy for that stuff

1557
01:54:29,660 --> 01:54:35,660
 Um, that's funny free number 22 said god was raped sounds like a dark metal band

1558
01:54:36,060 --> 01:54:41,100
 I'm assuming band not a dark metal bank to go there. Everyone's in goth makeup

1559
01:54:41,100 --> 01:54:45,020
 I um, no, it's a good episode. It's not an episode. You'd want to listen to twice

1560
01:54:45,020 --> 01:54:48,780
 I think the episode with my uncle is probably an episode. You don't want to listen to twice

1561
01:54:48,780 --> 01:54:51,820
 um

1562
01:54:51,820 --> 01:54:53,660
 Yeah, there's some episodes that are darker

1563
01:54:53,660 --> 01:54:59,260
 I try to space those out because I want to show it to be there's a difference between it being creepy

1564
01:54:59,260 --> 01:55:02,620
 And it being depressing

1565
01:55:02,620 --> 01:55:05,260
 And sometimes there's a line there

1566
01:55:05,500 --> 01:55:12,860
 Um, sometimes there's a line there like god was raped wasn't supposed to be creepy. I remember the one the guy with the nail jacket

1567
01:55:12,860 --> 01:55:17,820
 Um, that was one that I had I had those notes ready to go for like four months

1568
01:55:17,820 --> 01:55:21,900
 And I was like, no, I gotta have the right time for this. This story is really really distressing

1569
01:55:21,900 --> 01:55:27,580
 And again, it was a story that I recorded it and I actually edited some of the grosser stuff out

1570
01:55:27,580 --> 01:55:33,740
 Like this isn't gonna this doesn't add anything to the story. In fact, it goes from being creepy to depressing at that point

1571
01:55:33,980 --> 01:55:37,740
 So those are all determinations you're gonna make because at the end of the day

1572
01:55:37,740 --> 01:55:42,460
 You listen to this because one you want the company you want to hear the stories

1573
01:55:42,460 --> 01:55:50,300
 George nori wasn't doing podcasts. George nori on the radio wasn't making you go to he might make you scared as you were going to sleep

1574
01:55:50,300 --> 01:55:54,620
 But

1575
01:55:54,620 --> 01:55:57,980
 But he never made you as far as I remember I never felt depressed

1576
01:55:57,980 --> 01:56:02,780
 Maybe a little hopeless if I thought the world was going to end but I didn't feel down

1577
01:56:03,180 --> 01:56:05,180
 No

1578
01:56:05,180 --> 01:56:12,300
 You guys always leave positive comments kekky. Shane. No, it wasn't the nail gun murders. I forgot about that one

1579
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:14,140
 It was the guy who had

1580
01:56:14,140 --> 01:56:20,460
 Nail he had a jacket. He had a long nether jacket with nails sticking out of it and studded nail collars

1581
01:56:20,460 --> 01:56:22,540
 And he was raping women

1582
01:56:22,540 --> 01:56:28,700
 It was rough

1583
01:56:28,700 --> 01:56:30,780
 It was like back in the 70s

1584
01:56:30,860 --> 01:56:34,940
 Yes xm 64 I was thinking about that. I was listening to dead world the other day

1585
01:56:34,940 --> 01:56:37,580
 I have two rap songs on my youtube channel

1586
01:56:37,580 --> 01:56:40,140
 dead world part one and two

1587
01:56:40,140 --> 01:56:44,940
 Yeah, I can't think of a good name the story with the gang that went to the diner in new york. That's another one

1588
01:56:44,940 --> 01:56:48,060
 That there's a story that I have

1589
01:56:48,060 --> 01:56:51,820
 That I came across and it was so horrific

1590
01:56:51,820 --> 01:56:56,540
 I go I have to talk about that on my show and then I thought this is so horrific

1591
01:56:56,540 --> 01:56:59,180
 I can't talk about it on my show

1592
01:57:00,140 --> 01:57:05,740
 It's like something right out of a horror movie. It happened super recently. It happened in organ during the great fires

1593
01:57:05,740 --> 01:57:09,420
 It's a horrifying

1594
01:57:09,420 --> 01:57:11,820
 horrifying story

1595
01:57:11,820 --> 01:57:15,820
 So you have to figure the that balance out. Maybe I'll do that story when more time has passed

1596
01:57:15,820 --> 01:57:18,300
 Maybe

1597
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:20,300
 But you have to balance that stuff

1598
01:57:20,300 --> 01:57:29,500
 The I'll do the quick and leave I'll do a quick rundown and then we'll probably wrap it up Levi

1599
01:57:30,220 --> 01:57:37,980
 The cart the castration fetish to me they're see that's not to me those stories are funny because everyone in it is a willing participant

1600
01:57:37,980 --> 01:57:43,660
 If they were kidnapping people and cutting their balls off just because they were serial killers or whatever like that

1601
01:57:43,660 --> 01:57:46,700
 It would be creepy. I probably wouldn't cover it as often

1602
01:57:46,700 --> 01:57:51,260
 It's the fact that all three people could get together and all of them decide to chop off somebody's balls

1603
01:57:51,260 --> 01:57:57,820
 It's super weird. I'll tell you this story. I don't have all the details with it, but it may ruin your Thanksgiving. So

1604
01:57:58,620 --> 01:58:03,580
 Um, we'll we'll wrap it up like this. I'll tell you this story that recently happened here in the great fires

1605
01:58:03,580 --> 01:58:07,020
 And if you don't want to hear it if you don't want it to be depressing

1606
01:58:07,020 --> 01:58:09,980
 Have a happy Thanksgiving

1607
01:58:09,980 --> 01:58:12,220
 Here we go

1608
01:58:12,220 --> 01:58:16,220
 So again, I don't have the details. I don't have the dates and everything like that. I'll put it in the show notes

1609
01:58:16,220 --> 01:58:18,220
 I don't I don't have the articles

1610
01:58:18,220 --> 01:58:21,580
 There was this big wildfire up here in organ

1611
01:58:21,580 --> 01:58:25,180
 See you later team man

1612
01:58:25,180 --> 01:58:28,060
 There's a big wildfire up here in organ. They were going on for a while

1613
01:58:28,860 --> 01:58:30,700
 and there was

1614
01:58:30,700 --> 01:58:32,700
 this house in the middle of the woods

1615
01:58:32,700 --> 01:58:36,780
 and like many people they lived out there and the fire was

1616
01:58:36,780 --> 01:58:40,860
 Approaching but it was far enough away. They weren't in immediate danger

1617
01:58:40,860 --> 01:58:43,740
 so the dad goes

1618
01:58:43,740 --> 01:58:47,500
 There's like a dad a mom a son and a grandma

1619
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:50,220
 and a dog I believe

1620
01:58:50,220 --> 01:58:55,980
 And the dad goes I'm going to run to the town to get some supplies and then I'm going to come back

1621
01:58:56,860 --> 01:59:02,300
 And I don't we'll just hang out here or something like that like I don't really understand what their battle plan was

1622
01:59:02,300 --> 01:59:04,940
 but the dad leaves

1623
01:59:04,940 --> 01:59:12,940
 And while the dad's gone, there's a huge change in the weather and the fire begins to do a beeline right for that house

1624
01:59:12,940 --> 01:59:20,700
 This is again really depressing guys so this kid

1625
01:59:20,700 --> 01:59:24,140
 and the grandma

1626
01:59:24,540 --> 01:59:28,780
 And I think the whole family gets into the car the whole family gets into the car

1627
01:59:28,780 --> 01:59:33,980
 Dad's gone. So the mom the grandma the kid and the dog are all sitting in the car

1628
01:59:33,980 --> 01:59:37,180
 and

1629
01:59:37,180 --> 01:59:40,220
 The fire engulfs the vehicle

1630
01:59:40,220 --> 01:59:43,420
 And the woman the mother apparently

1631
01:59:43,420 --> 01:59:46,060
 Like the tires melt

1632
01:59:46,060 --> 01:59:49,340
 The tires melt. I'm trying to remember the exact sequence of events here

1633
01:59:52,860 --> 01:59:54,860
 So they're all in the car

1634
01:59:54,860 --> 01:59:57,340
 We'll jump ahead. So what happens is

1635
01:59:57,340 --> 02:00:00,940
 The dad is driving back to the house

1636
02:00:00,940 --> 02:00:07,580
 The fire enveloped the house. He doesn't know it yet. He's driving back to the house. I guess he has to like

1637
02:00:07,580 --> 02:00:14,220
 Secretly stealth by some firefighters or maybe this part of the road wasn't even barricaded at this point

1638
02:00:14,220 --> 02:00:17,980
 He's driving. He's driving. He's driving and there's just flames everywhere

1639
02:00:17,980 --> 02:00:22,140
 He sees that the area that his house is on fire. He's totally freaking out

1640
02:00:22,860 --> 02:00:26,300
 And then he sees a figure walking down the street

1641
02:00:26,300 --> 02:00:31,900
 And it is someone burned from head to toe

1642
02:00:31,900 --> 02:00:36,780
 Walking out of the fire fire just smoking skin still smoking

1643
02:00:36,780 --> 02:00:40,380
 And he runs and he throws a blanket around this person

1644
02:00:40,380 --> 02:00:44,140
 I can't tell if it's a man or a woman is just this person

1645
02:00:44,140 --> 02:00:47,100
 Everything's burned off. There was a blanket around the person

1646
02:00:48,540 --> 02:00:53,180
 Throws the person in the back seat and the person goes hey comfy. Hey, yeah, have a great one

1647
02:00:53,180 --> 02:01:00,060
 or um, yeah, thank you and then um the person in the back seat he goes I need to um

1648
02:01:00,060 --> 02:01:06,460
 The woman goes oh no, I gave away the person in the back seat says take me to the hospital

1649
02:01:06,460 --> 02:01:11,820
 And the guy says I find my family have to go find my wife and kids and that's when the person in the back seat goes

1650
02:01:11,820 --> 02:01:13,900
 I am your wife

1651
02:01:14,460 --> 02:01:21,420
 And she was so badly burned. He couldn't even recognize her. Everything was completely gone from her true story

1652
02:01:21,420 --> 02:01:24,780
 It sounds like an urban legend sounds like something out of a horror book

1653
02:01:24,780 --> 02:01:32,220
 But he did yeah, he took her to the hospital and then it turns out that the car was completely engulfed in flames

1654
02:01:32,220 --> 02:01:34,460
 I think she jumped out of the car and ran

1655
02:01:34,460 --> 02:01:38,620
 Is what happened or the car caught on fire and the woman was still in the house

1656
02:01:38,620 --> 02:01:42,300
 She couldn't get to the car so she just took off through the fire running

1657
02:01:43,020 --> 02:01:47,580
 And the um the son they found the grandma in the car

1658
02:01:47,580 --> 02:01:49,660
 Everyone was dead in the car

1659
02:01:49,660 --> 02:01:54,220
 The grandma was trying to drive the car the tires and melted and the boy was holding

1660
02:01:54,220 --> 02:01:57,980
 His dog and they were all burned to death. So super grizzly

1661
02:01:57,980 --> 02:02:05,020
 Super dark. It sounds like an urban legend story. Yeah, I know I know guys. I told you

1662
02:02:05,020 --> 02:02:07,420
 um

1663
02:02:07,420 --> 02:02:11,100
 Yeah, yeah, it's a that was a story that I was like I remember reading that thing

1664
02:02:11,180 --> 02:02:17,020
 It sounds like an urban legend. It sounds like rampart says sounds like a creepypasta. Joan says sounds like something on snopes

1665
02:02:17,020 --> 02:02:19,500
 um

1666
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:22,380
 A a dark story a dark story. Um

1667
02:02:22,380 --> 02:02:28,060
 But yeah, I was like dude, uh, I don't I think his wife may still be alive. I'm not for sure

1668
02:02:28,060 --> 02:02:33,980
 It was big news. It was absolutely big news in the area because it was such a shocking story

1669
02:02:33,980 --> 02:02:36,940
 but um

1670
02:02:36,940 --> 02:02:38,940
 Yeah, I was like I remember

1671
02:02:39,020 --> 02:02:42,140
 Prepping it up and stuff like that and I thought

1672
02:02:42,140 --> 02:02:44,620
 um

1673
02:02:44,620 --> 02:02:49,180
 No, I don't want to share this story like this isn't and you guys are like telling on thanksgiving

1674
02:02:49,180 --> 02:02:51,820
 Telling on thanksgiving. I thought

1675
02:02:51,820 --> 02:02:55,420
 You know, because you listen to the podcast again, you want to be creeped out you want to have a laugh

1676
02:02:55,420 --> 02:03:00,620
 You want to hear something interesting? I have to be careful at how grizzly the stuff gets and when I do it

1677
02:03:00,620 --> 02:03:04,220
 There has to be this story if I told on the podcast it would just be like

1678
02:03:05,500 --> 02:03:10,940
 Oh, here's a creepy. You know what? I mean, it is creepy, but there's that depressing element to it as well

1679
02:03:10,940 --> 02:03:14,300
 but

1680
02:03:14,300 --> 02:03:22,380
 Happy thanksgiving don't let it don't let it be sad though. I mean, it's a sad story but you know, um

1681
02:03:22,380 --> 02:03:30,860
 Yeah, it's it's a sad there's no uplifting side to it. There's no uplifting side to it

1682
02:03:30,860 --> 02:03:33,180
 um

1683
02:03:33,180 --> 02:03:37,420
 No, I have not heard of a hamper lady's song. I might be able to check that out, but yeah

1684
02:03:37,420 --> 02:03:40,860
 They're writing about a burn victim. Um

1685
02:03:40,860 --> 02:03:46,300
 Yeah, the barfing man that story about the guy who was wearing the santa claus suit and threw a molotov cocktail and it

1686
02:03:46,300 --> 02:03:48,300
 melted to his skin

1687
02:03:48,300 --> 02:03:53,260
 So, yeah, that was a story that I remember thinking was too depressing, but I the my level of interest

1688
02:03:53,260 --> 02:03:56,140
 I'd been that it was a story I'd been thinking about for years

1689
02:03:56,140 --> 02:04:01,180
 Oh, and then cat I will wrap it up like this because I do have to uh take off but

1690
02:04:02,860 --> 02:04:07,580
 As far as going as far as what I think about skinwalker ranch. It's funny

1691
02:04:07,580 --> 02:04:12,140
 I just read an article the other day about how the security personnel there makes stories up

1692
02:04:12,140 --> 02:04:18,700
 Because their boss gets mad when people don't see anything. So they say that they actually they just make stuff up

1693
02:04:18,700 --> 02:04:21,980
 Skinwalker ranch is one of those things. I know like jet propulsion labs

1694
02:04:21,980 --> 02:04:25,340
 I believe is out there a bunch of scientific groups have been out there and things like that

1695
02:04:25,340 --> 02:04:29,500
 I don't

1696
02:04:30,780 --> 02:04:32,300
 It may be real

1697
02:04:32,300 --> 02:04:35,980
 It may be real. Um, it's something that I looked into a lot back in the day

1698
02:04:35,980 --> 02:04:41,020
 And then it became just so well known that I've just kind of gathered stuff through osmosis here and there

1699
02:04:41,020 --> 02:04:45,900
 Um, again, it's one of those places that they're like here. We can get scientific proof of this stuff

1700
02:04:45,900 --> 02:04:49,580
 Why do you want scientific proof of it? Like even if you have scientific proof people?

1701
02:04:49,580 --> 02:04:51,580
 It's going to question the science just enjoy

1702
02:04:51,580 --> 02:04:56,620
 Just enjoy it. Enjoy the experience. Don't you don't have to try to convert other people

1703
02:04:57,580 --> 02:05:02,060
 And then um, yeah, you know, I've looked into it. It's not I'm not a huge

1704
02:05:02,060 --> 02:05:08,620
 I've like Hitler conspiracies not see conspiracies to me. Those are pretty well known

1705
02:05:08,620 --> 02:05:14,300
 Um, I've looked I've looked into some of the people who were involved in esoteric hitlerism

1706
02:05:14,300 --> 02:05:19,980
 Like one of them killed himself by jumping into like a piano string or he did something super weird

1707
02:05:19,980 --> 02:05:22,220
 He jumped he jumped into a piano

1708
02:05:22,220 --> 02:05:26,380
 Like one of the guys killed himself by jumping like face first into a band saw or something like that

1709
02:05:26,380 --> 02:05:28,060
 I was like, oh, that's interesting

1710
02:05:28,060 --> 02:05:32,860
 But the fact that people think that a world leader is actually some sort of deity or some sort of god

1711
02:05:32,860 --> 02:05:36,780
 Whether or not it's seen that's the thing like because it involves hitler

1712
02:05:36,780 --> 02:05:40,060
 It has a certain level of like ooh it's more spooky

1713
02:05:40,060 --> 02:05:44,620
 but it's no different than people who thought like Stalin was the reincarnation of a god or

1714
02:05:44,620 --> 02:05:50,060
 Um, you know, all the chinese dynasties are supposed to be descended from gods

1715
02:05:50,060 --> 02:05:53,900
 So the the story itself isn't super interesting to me

1716
02:05:54,220 --> 02:05:58,860
 That's basically what it is a group of people believe that their leader is from god

1717
02:05:58,860 --> 02:06:02,300
 And that it goes on this very day

1718
02:06:02,300 --> 02:06:08,700
 Whether that leader is from your local church or it's the president or it's some king or something like that. So yeah

1719
02:06:08,700 --> 02:06:13,020
 Yeah, I'm sure there are people who believe in esoteric Stalinism

1720
02:06:13,020 --> 02:06:18,780
 Why wouldn't there be like it? I know that's the thing I've looked into and I was like, it's kind of interesting

1721
02:06:18,780 --> 02:06:22,220
 Sometimes there's stuff where it's just like it would be me reading

1722
02:06:24,060 --> 02:06:26,460
 Reading facts and that's not fun

1723
02:06:26,460 --> 02:06:30,060
 So it'd be like this person believes this about hitler and this person believes this about hitler

1724
02:06:30,060 --> 02:06:34,700
 And then this other person believes that there's like three of the main ones and I go isn't that wacky

1725
02:06:34,700 --> 02:06:39,500
 Like it's interesting, but it's it doesn't really translate to a podcast

1726
02:06:39,500 --> 02:06:42,380
 That basically be what it would be

1727
02:06:42,380 --> 02:06:43,820
 um

1728
02:06:43,820 --> 02:06:48,940
 And again, I think it's it's the same thing as there are people who it would basically be the equivalent of like

1729
02:06:48,940 --> 02:06:53,340
 Anyone believing their particular world leader at that particular time

1730
02:06:54,300 --> 02:06:56,300
 was a

1731
02:06:56,300 --> 02:07:01,100
 Descended or chosen by god to run and things like that

1732
02:07:01,100 --> 02:07:07,020
 Yeah, so I think that is interesting. So the same thing with uh adam waffen or the order of the nine angels

1733
02:07:07,020 --> 02:07:09,100
 It would be me reading facts

1734
02:07:09,100 --> 02:07:13,580
 About those groups. All of those groups are very well known. You can definitely check them out on wikipedia

1735
02:07:13,580 --> 02:07:20,220
 There's been tons of articles written on them. I've researched them. It would basically be me saying this this this

1736
02:07:20,220 --> 02:07:22,140
 is a thing

1737
02:07:22,140 --> 02:07:26,380
 And that's not super interesting to me and I don't think it comes across well on a podcast

1738
02:07:26,380 --> 02:07:31,100
 Especially when you can read that stuff online you can dig into it as much as you want

1739
02:07:31,100 --> 02:07:34,300
 What would what would the podcast episode be?

1740
02:07:34,300 --> 02:07:40,860
 Like what how would I what would I do what would I say about those groups?

1741
02:07:40,860 --> 02:07:47,500
 It would be the same thing. You know what I mean? I get that those groups have a like people assign them a different level of

1742
02:07:47,500 --> 02:07:50,620
 um, I don't want to say value, but a different level of

1743
02:07:51,180 --> 02:07:58,540
 Intriguingness of intrigue because it's related to but I've never like I've never been super into

1744
02:07:58,540 --> 02:08:03,260
 uh, Nazi myths or uh, you know, I've never seen them as

1745
02:08:03,260 --> 02:08:06,460
 this like super um interesting thing

1746
02:08:06,460 --> 02:08:09,420
 So I think that's why usually when I'm reading them. I'm just like

1747
02:08:09,420 --> 02:08:14,780
 Because I was never into them and then yeah when when I'm doing stuff like a group. It's

1748
02:08:14,780 --> 02:08:17,660
 It's just like here's a group. This is what they do

1749
02:08:18,060 --> 02:08:21,980
 I've done death cults, but it's not just like the colonial dignidad

1750
02:08:21,980 --> 02:08:26,620
 Um, that was that group had a middle of beginning and an end it ended

1751
02:08:26,620 --> 02:08:32,300
 And I was able to tell the story of this rise of power and then the height of corruption and then they're downfall

1752
02:08:32,300 --> 02:08:35,740
 There's a narrative arc by just saying these groups exist

1753
02:08:35,740 --> 02:08:42,380
 There's not not really any narrative hooked there even esoteric hitlerism was like these people believe this thing

1754
02:08:42,380 --> 02:08:45,340
 And then one guy jumped into a band saw or however he killed himself

1755
02:08:46,060 --> 02:08:50,620
 And that's it and it's just what everyone else believes but no, I appreciate the suggestions, but

1756
02:08:50,620 --> 02:08:55,100
 I a lot of people have recommended those over the year two years and it's just not

1757
02:08:55,100 --> 02:09:00,940
 It's just not super interesting to me. Um, let's see here

1758
02:09:00,940 --> 02:09:04,700
 Did you do do do

1759
02:09:04,700 --> 02:09:10,300
 Take a look at these other things

1760
02:09:11,980 --> 02:09:13,980
 Calla yuga I can look into it, but I

1761
02:09:13,980 --> 02:09:21,100
 I might have come across that but I might have not it may fall into that same thing where it's just

1762
02:09:21,100 --> 02:09:23,100
 um

1763
02:09:23,100 --> 02:09:25,100
 A group that exists

1764
02:09:25,100 --> 02:09:28,380
 So we'll take a look at it, but I'll check that out. Um

1765
02:09:28,380 --> 02:09:31,260
 I would recommend

1766
02:09:31,260 --> 02:09:37,500
 Emailing me that so I make sure you get credit because a lot of times when I have to give credit for the chat

1767
02:09:38,060 --> 02:09:41,900
 I have to go fighting through it. I have to go through it, but I'm gonna head out now

1768
02:09:41,900 --> 02:09:45,420
 I actually have to now process this episode get it uploaded to the podcast

1769
02:09:45,420 --> 02:09:52,140
 I gotta do a couple little tweaks and stuff like that. Okay. Calla yuga is the nazi version of raggedon rock. Yeah, I can check it out

1770
02:09:52,140 --> 02:09:54,940

1775
02:10:11,740 --> 02:10:16,220
 I like telling a story. I don't they're boring to record and they're super boring at it
