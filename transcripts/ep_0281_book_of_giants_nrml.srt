00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Today is a special episode of Dead Rav radio.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 We're going to take a look at one story.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,680
 And that is the story of the Book of Giants, a book that was considered too weird to be

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,400
 included in the Bible.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:19,000
 In Genesis there is a brief section that mentions the flood that destroyed all of the evil

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,480
 men in the world.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:28,040
 But there is an entire book telling the backstory of what happened involving giants, rogue angels,

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:35,120
 and the battle so epic the scale has never been matched at any other point in history.

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,120
 We'll explore that and more today on Dead Rav radio.

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:48,840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rav radio.

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,080
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter here.

12
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,080
 I'm having a great day.

13
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,840
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

14
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,840
 I got some Patreons.

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,360
 I set up my Patreon account yesterday and I got some.

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,760
 I want to say thank you to Elkie, Dave H, Dave Carr, Scott Stewart, and Chris Kilborn

17
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,520
 for supporting the show.

18
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,520
 That's really, really awesome.

19
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,920
 And I want to say just so you guys don't think I'm wasting your money, I bought this

20
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,920
 book.

21
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,680
 Let me read you the description of it.

22
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,960
 What is the agenda and purpose of all of this alien activity?

23
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,140
 Why do they hate humanity and work in the darkness?

24
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,400
 Are we prepared to face them?

25
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,680
 The war started over 6000 years ago.

26
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,680
 I'm assuming this was written by a hardcore creationist.

27
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,480
 The story started over 6000 years ago.

28
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,840
 Now it is more evident with the increasing violence and deaths.

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,200
 What forces are behind it?

30
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,320
 You can't escape if you are human.

31
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,600
 They come to eat your flesh and drink your blood.

32
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,600
 There is only one weapon that will destroy them.

33
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,960
 Discover it before it's too late.

34
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,600
 That is the description for this book.

35
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,640
 I have found no reviews on it whatsoever.

36
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,320
 It came out two years ago.

37
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,320
 It's self-published.

38
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,560
 It's called "Gay Aliens - The Great Deception."

39
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,120
 And oddly enough, there's copies of the book that are listed as "Gay Aliens - The Great

40
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,120
 Reception."

41
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,400
 So I don't know if he originally had a typo, but I ordered that book.

42
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,520
 Thank you, Patreons, for allowing me to buy this $11 book.

43
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,840
 So I will read "Gay Aliens."

44
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,000
 I hope I'm assuming it's him saying that aliens are turning people gay.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,560
 I'm going to assume that's just based on the title.

46
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,920
 But that, I don't know.

47
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,560
 Based on that title and that description, it could literally be anything.

48
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,960
 But yeah, so "Gay Aliens - The Great Deception."

49
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,520
 I will let you guys know when I get it, if it's any good.

50
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,040
 Spoiler alert, it won't be, but I at least assume it will be hilarious.

51
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,040
 And it's in paperback.

52
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,040
 There wasn't even a Kindle, so I get to have a book sitting on my bookshelf with that title.

53
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,240
 Okay, so let's go ahead and move on to our first story.

54
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,240
 Now our first story does require a bit of an introduction.

55
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,920
 And I'm going to keep this as brief as possible, because it's basically a history lesson.

56
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,920
 I recorded one version of it.

57
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,920
 It was 10 minutes long.

58
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,920
 It was totally boring.

59
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,440
 Okay, back in Bible times, there was a guy named Enoch.

60
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,960
 And he went on these adventures, and he wrote about them in this book called "The Book of

61
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,960
 Enoch."

62
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,360
 Now this is pre-flood when Enoch was kicking about back there, right?

63
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,960
 And he has this - his book is weird.

64
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,920
 I might do an episode on just his book.

65
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,880
 He goes into space.

66
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,720
 He's hanging out with angels.

67
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,640
 He's doing all these wacky adventures, right?

68
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,200
 He's a very, very well-respected man in the region.

69
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,200
 And he's in, like, the Jewish lineage.

70
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,440
 So he's a real person.

71
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,680
 He has mentioned several times throughout the Old and the New Testament.

72
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,520
 He was related to Noah, I believe, as well.

73
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,920
 But real guy shows up.

74
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,280
 But anyways, he says he went on all these adventures.

75
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,040
 And he also is a main character in the book.

76
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,080
 We're going to look at "The Book of Giants," which takes place pre-flood as well.

77
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,880
 Now back in the - I think it was like 400 AD when they were kind of putting the Bible

78
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,880
 together.

79
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,880
 Jesus is gone.

80
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,880
 They're putting the Bible together.

81
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,920
 When they're having this huge voting council, they get to the book of Enoch and the book

82
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,520
 of Giants, and they're like, "No, no, you cannot put these books in the Bible.

83
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,720
 We have talking snakes.

84
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,280
 We have buildings being blown up by trumpet horns, but this is just ridiculous."

85
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,240
 So they took it out, and it pretty much disappeared.

86
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,080
 Because people stopped studying it.

87
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,200
 People stopped talking about it.

88
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,800
 And back then, he didn't have the Internet archive.

89
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
 It was just gone.

90
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,480
 They did end up - a century later, there was half of it, a version of half of it, found

91
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,480
 in China.

92
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,760
 It was written in Aramaic, but it was found in China.

93
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,560
 And they're like, "Oh, look, it has Enoch in it.

94
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,160
 This is related to the book of the Bible.

95
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,360
 This is probably - we've heard references to the book of Giants.

96
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,360
 This is probably it."

97
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,400
 In the 1940s, two dudes were knocking about in the Middle East.

98
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,280
 They walked into a cave by the Dead Sea and found a bunch of books of the Bible that were

99
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,480
 written between like 300 BC and 200 AD.

100
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,480
 Preserved in jars.

101
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,120
 And in those jars, you had like real books of the Bible or canonical books of the Bible.

102
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,360
 Like, you had like Genesis and Acts, whatever.

103
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,360
 You had all the goodies.

104
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,360
 You had all the goodies.

105
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,040
 But you also had the book of Giants.

106
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,680
 The first half, it starts to decay halfway through.

107
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,600
 So people have looked at it and they go, "This is really, really weird.

108
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
 Probably shouldn't have been in the Bible.

109
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,360
 It just is just too weird."

110
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,040
 But I said Enoch is mentioned throughout the Bible.

111
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,560
 Elements of this story I'm about to tell you are mentioned throughout the Bible.

112
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,800
 And in Genesis, the book of Genesis, it says, "Hey, listen, there was a time when some

113
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,280
 angels came down and started having sex with humans and that - I love this quote.

114
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,320
 So let me read you this real quick.

115
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,000
 When human beings began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them,

116
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,440
 the sons of God saw that the daughters of humans were beautiful and they married any

117
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,440
 of them that they chose.

118
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,560
 The Nephilim were on the earth in those days and also afterward.

119
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,760
 When the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them, they were

120
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,360
 the heroes of old, men of renown."

121
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,920
 So that's just a little part of Genesis.

122
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,240
 And then it goes on to say, God said, "This is not what I wanted.

123
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,360
 This isn't working.

124
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,360
 Humans are too wicked now.

125
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,520
 I'm going to cause a flood."

126
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,760
 And then he goes, "Yo, Noah."

127
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,600
 And Noah looks up in the sky.

128
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,160
 And God is mimicking building a boat.

129
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,040
 Noah's like, "Oh yeah, I should do that."

130
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,960
 He's just playing Fortnite all day long.

131
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,520
 God said, "Come on, man.

132
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,520
 Build that boat."

133
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,680
 He's like, "Yeah, I'll do it tomorrow."

134
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,520
 The ultimate procrastinator.

135
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,520
 So that's it.

136
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,840
 But the Book of Giants explains - there's eight verses in Genesis that tell that story.

137
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,280
 The Book of Giants explains step by step what happened.

138
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,880
 Way more than a flood.

139
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,200
 Way, way more than a flood.

140
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,000
 So let's hop on board the carboner copter, strap in, because this one's going to be nuts.

141
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:38,320
 We're going back in time to the Middle East.

142
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,320
 Coming over.

143
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,640
 Nice little town.

144
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,720
 Everything's made of clay, except the people and the animals.

145
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,400
 All the buildings are made of clay.

146
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
 Candles are flying over.

147
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,920
 It's nighttime, right?

148
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,520
 Now, the reason why we're here is this is the story of the Book of Giants.

149
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,160
 God says, "Actually, you know what?

150
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,160
 Let's go to heaven.

151
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,160
 Let's go and sit in this meeting.

152
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,080
 We're going all over the place for this one.

153
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,200
 We're floating on a cloud.

154
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
 We're floating on a cloud.

155
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
 We're in a giant meeting.

156
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,160
 God's sitting there smoking a giant cigar.

157
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,400
 He's seated at a table with 200 angels and he's like, "Listen, guys, Project Earth is

158
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,800
 going great, but I think we need to do a little bit more on the blue marble."

159
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,040
 Pulls down a pie chart.

160
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,920
 He's like, "Listen, this is how many people are on the planet.

161
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,040
 This is how many of them are morally good.

162
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:23,360
 I need you, my angels, my watchers," as the humans know you, "to go down there and show

163
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,920
 them what needs to be done."

164
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,840
 It takes a couple puffs of cigar.

165
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,680
 And now the leader of this group of watchers is Shemi Haaza.

166
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:39,360
 Now, I should say right now that every angel sitting in this boardroom, this is long after

167
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,200
 Lucifer tried overthrowing God and there was a giant war in heaven.

168
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,960
 It was the ultimate act of rebellion and God took Lucifer and one-third of the angels

169
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,560
 and cast them out of heaven.

170
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,400
 This is way after this.

171
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,880
 There was a massive war in this alternate dimension before time and space had actually

172
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,720
 even crystallized into a real thing.

173
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,640
 Everyone sitting in this meeting fought in that war.

174
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,640
 Okay?

175
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:09,520
 There's not a single person of this 200-man team that does not know what happens if you

176
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,240
 don't follow the rules.

177
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,640
 Some of them may even be like, "Oh man, you know, I really like Lucifer.

178
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,640
 He's a really cool guy.

179
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,640
 Too bad he went nuts."

180
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,680
 And they're like, "Yeah, you know, just forget it."

181
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,640
 But they all remember that.

182
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,640
 Okay?

183
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,440
 Just remember that as a thing that's going to happen throughout the story.

184
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,200
 So Shemihaza and his homeboys are like, "We will go to earth and do what you say."

185
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,360
 And God goes, "And," they're all leaving out the door, he stops them, "Whatever you

186
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,160
 do, do not bang them."

187
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,920
 And they're like, "Why would you even suggest that?

188
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,920
 He is omnipotent.

189
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,640
 He does kind of know what's going to happen next."

190
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,920
 But Shemihaza's like, "Of course not, dude.

191
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,080
 Humans are gross."

192
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,480
 So then, 200 angels fly down to earth.

193
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,720
 And they do what God says.

194
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,680
 They start teaching people how to be like good people.

195
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,320
 They're picking up old ladies and dusting them off.

196
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,400
 And then they're like repairing the clay houses.

197
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,680
 And they're like, "You know, you probably could use some wood in this house."

198
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,480
 And they're like, "Oh yeah, maybe giving them advice and stuff like that."

199
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,480
 And we're watching this whole thing.

200
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,480
 We're just eating apples.

201
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,320
 We're having a good time watching these angels do what angels do.

202
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,600
 But then, as the angels are helping like build a barn or whatever, this woman walks out of

203
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,960
 her house.

204
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,640
 And Shemihaza's like, "Oh, God, his eyes get super big.

205
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,680
 They're all bouncing out tongue."

206
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,040
 It falls instantly in love with human females.

207
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,680
 And we, at this point, we saw me in our apples because we know something bad's going to happen.

208
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,040
 And it spreads.

209
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,760
 The angels are just amazed at how beautiful human females are.

210
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,840
 And to be fair, human females are quite beautiful.

211
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,720
 So they start banging the women.

212
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:49,400
 Now that is bad enough because you're basically creating a half-human, half-angel baby.

213
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,920
 But it doesn't stop there.

214
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,560
 When God is talking about destroying the world, I think anyone who's familiar with the story

215
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,720
 of Noah, but if you aren't, when he's talking about destroying the world, it's not just

216
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,040
 that there's a much a half-human, half-angels.

217
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,560
 He does, in the Bible, it uses the term, "The mighty heroes," the heroes of renown,

218
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,720
 the mighty warriors.

219
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,200
 It wasn't just that.

220
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,200
 When you look at the book of giants, there's a phrase that's used over and over again.

221
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,080
 The women prostituted themselves.

222
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,600
 They're like, "Oh, we didn't see none of that.

223
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,240
 We saw a woman walk out of a house.

224
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,520
 A guy turned into a cartoon fox for a minute, and then they started banging."

225
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:27,840
 But what was going on is the women were basically saying, "I will have sex with you, but I want

226
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,840
 power.

227
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,880
 I want knowledge.

228
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,480
 I want to know what you know."

229
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,520
 And what we see in the book of giants is there are phrases saying that they were taught the

230
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,400
 secrets of the universe.

231
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,160
 You have these celestial beings that existed before the universe even had shape.

232
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,920
 And they're on first date.

233
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,920
 And the girl goes, "So, what are you doing?"

234
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,320
 He's like, "Oh, I'm a watcher.

235
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,880
 I help build barns and stuff like that."

236
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,560
 And she goes, "Do you know how to stop time?"

237
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,120
 And he would.

238
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,440
 He may not have the necessary power to be able to do that, but he would go, "Yeah, actually,

239
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,720
 I do know how it's done."

240
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,840
 He'd start explaining how black holes work and all sorts of stuff.

241
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,560
 They taught them the dark arts.

242
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,360
 They taught them basically how to be a witch.

243
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,920
 And in return, the women had their babies.

244
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,600
 That is the beginning of the wickedness.

245
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,600
 You have angels no longer.

246
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,040
 They're teaching people, you know, give a penny, take a penny.

247
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,160
 They're teaching them how you raise the dead to impress these women.

248
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,040
 And the women, in turn, were banging them.

249
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,240
 And the babies were described as giants.

250
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,400
 Now, sometimes they were literal giants.

251
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,840
 Sometimes they were just massive people.

252
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,120
 One of them supposedly was 450 feet tall, which out of all the details of the story,

253
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,840
 even the ones I want to tell later, I think that's the most unbelievable thing.

254
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:42,240
 Some of them, they were giant just in that context meant immensely strong, mighty.

255
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,720
 So these children were heroes.

256
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,760
 Gilgamesh, the hero from the Mesopotamian mythology, is listed as a Nephilim in the

257
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,120
 book of giants.

258
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,880
 So he's this mighty, mighty hero.

259
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,880
 These people like Hercules, which is the same story, a human and a god having a baby, causes

260
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,560
 people to be superhuman.

261
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,280
 We're not talking Superman level, but we're talking Captain America level.

262
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,440
 To Hulk level type heroes.

263
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,160
 We are now reading the newspaper, because a couple generations are passing this time.

264
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,800
 We luckily don't age, otherwise we'd be dust by this.

265
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,080
 We're reading the Daily Clay, it's the only newspaper in town.

266
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,480
 And it's just story after story about these great heroes who are going out and slaying

267
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,040
 enemies and bashing lions open, picking mountains up and throwing them around.

268
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,560
 Just insane stuff.

269
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,240
 Your newspaper is a comic book.

270
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,560
 There's no pictures back then, they didn't know how to draw.

271
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,560
 So it's just words.

272
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,560
 Like, regular book.

273
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,680
 But the point is, is that all of these great adventures are going on.

274
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,880
 But power corrupts.

275
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:45,360
 And these watchers and their witch wives and their mighty, mighty kids decide, why are

276
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,480
 we protecting humans?

277
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,200
 We are the dominant species on this planet.

278
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,960
 They cannot fight against us.

279
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,600
 Because there would be wars.

280
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,360
 You'd have one of these Nephilim, which was the half human, half angel.

281
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,120
 You'd have one of these Nephilim just massacre a thousand people in a battle.

282
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,920
 You could not stop these guys.

283
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,560
 And they go, why are we fighting, why are we even fighting for these guys?

284
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,240
 We should just be ruling them.

285
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,080
 So then, this is when we pack up and leave town, most people do.

286
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,080
 And this is happening all over the region.

287
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,000
 The watchers begin to enslave humans.

288
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,600
 Now again, all of this stuff is really like cliche sci-fi fantasy stuff.

289
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,920
 But for thousands of years, people, this was a book of the Bible.

290
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,480
 People believed this existed.

291
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:35,120
 It wasn't until a couple people voted it out that it stopped being part of the canon.

292
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,080
 Anyways, let's step back into this.

293
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,280
 We're running out of town.

294
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,880
 We're getting the carbon helicopter flying away.

295
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,320
 And if you're human, you're enslaved.

296
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,600
 If you're lucky, most likely they just bash their head.

297
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,160
 They began to take over large parts of the region.

298
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,720
 And then, power corrupts, they begin to go to war with each other.

299
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,400
 So now you have different angels and their superhuman children fighting other angels

300
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,840
 and superhuman children for control of a ravine or farmland or whatever.

301
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,120
 And normal humans could no longer live in this area.

302
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,640
 It was just too chaotic.

303
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,880
 Enter Enoch.

304
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,480
 So Enoch is, Enoch is a totally weird dude.

305
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,840
 He has a few, he's almost a superhuman in his own aspect.

306
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,800
 But he's basically like God's messenger, God's homeboy on the planet Earth.

307
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,840
 Enoch is watching all of this, right?

308
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:34,440
 And it gets to the point where the watchers basically go, "You know what?

309
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,440
 We're just going to start eating people.

310
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,680
 Like we're tired of keeping slaves and we're tired of just killing them.

311
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,240
 We're going to start eating people."

312
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,040
 So the watchers begin to eat people.

313
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,440
 So now we're not even slaves.

314
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,600
 We're just dumb animals ready to be devoured.

315
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:55,000
 At that point, Enoch calls up God and says, "Hey, you need to do something about this,

316
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 right?

317
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 You need to do something about this.

318
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,440
 You kind of caused this in the first place."

319
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,280
 God, God, again, first he's a business, first he's really proactive working at business

320
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,280
 meeting.

321
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,080
 It's maybe been 150, 200 years since this all started.

322
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,440
 In that period of time, God has become a total deadbeat dad.

323
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,400
 He wants nothing to do with what's going on on Earth.

324
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,440
 Enoch goes, "Listen, you have an army.

325
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,120
 You have an immeasurable army.

326
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:25,760
 You have 200 angels and thousands of wives and who knows tens of thousands of superhuman

327
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,040
 children running around the area.

328
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,240
 You got to do something about this."

329
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,320
 And God, God tells Enoch, "No, you.

330
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,320
 You go do something.

331
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,720
 I'm just going to sit here on my big fluffy couch.

332
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,720
 I'm retired."

333
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,480
 And Enoch goes, "So let's walk.

334
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,560
 Let's go on a walk with Enoch.

335
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,840
 We're going to walk with Enoch and we're going to enter the camp of the Giants with

336
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,320
 Shemi Haaza.

337
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,680
 And we're standing now.

338
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,960
 We're flanked by a bunch of angels and a bunch of hot witches.

339
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,960
 There's two human kids."

340
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,240
 And Enoch goes, "Listen, you guys need to stop.

341
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,680
 You guys need to stop."

342
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,640
 And we're like, "That's all you're going to say?"

343
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,120
 And Enoch kind of puts his hand up.

344
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,120
 He's like, "Oh, give me a second.

345
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,120
 Give me a second."

346
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,080
 You need to stop because if you don't stop now, God's going to destroy all of you."

347
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,720
 Shemi Haaza is like, "Oh, God can't destroy."

348
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,720
 Actually, no.

349
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,720
 At that point in reality, Shemi Haaza was like, "Uh-oh."

350
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:22,120
 Because again, they have seen what happens to angels when they go rogue.

351
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,120
 But Shemi Haaza dismisses Enoch, gets him out of there.

352
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,000
 We all get thrown out on her butts.

353
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,040
 And he doubles down.

354
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,560
 They begin holding secret occult meetings on the top of this mountain in the region.

355
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,840
 They would figure out, they were basically now uniting themselves.

356
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:42,360
 So the war between the watchers and their children was going to have to come to an end.

357
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,320
 They would have to provide a united front because they know what's going to happen.

358
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,600
 There's one version of the story.

359
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,800
 This was one that, because I had to read a bunch of articles on this.

360
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,120
 I wasn't able to verify this in other versions, but there's one article I read that when

361
00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:00,280
 they were on that mountain, they were in contact with Azazel, which was another name for Satan,

362
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,800
 for Lucifer.

363
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:07,520
 And they were basically saying, "Well, if God's going to destroy us, if we don't stop

364
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:13,360
 and we don't want to stop, maybe Satan will help us out with that sweet, sweet Satanic

365
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,360
 power."

366
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:18,240
 So they've totally just, God said, "Stop doing it."

367
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,720
 And they totally went in the opposite direction.

368
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:25,160
 So at this point, God finally gets up off the couch and just makes them have bad nightmares.

369
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,680
 Like, again, he can totally end it at any point.

370
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,720
 He gives them bad nightmares.

371
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:34,600
 So the sons of Shemi Haaza one night they woke up and they had this horrible dream.

372
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,800
 So they hold another meeting because this kid's dream.

373
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,960
 And he says, "This is what I dreamt."

374
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:45,760
 He goes, "I dreamt I was walking through a garden and there was 200 trees in the garden.

375
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:52,680
 And then an emperor came down like a burning fireball."

376
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:57,000
 And the other watchers, this dream, that sounds kind of like just a basic surreal, lynchian

377
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 type dream, but it really concerned the watchers that he had this dream.

378
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,560
 So they said, "Listen, there's one person that you can talk to.

379
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,920
 He's the smartest person on the planet.

380
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,040
 Go talk to him and ask him what the dream means.

381
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,680
 His name's Enoch."

382
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,600
 So one of these mighty warriors comes to Enoch, Enoch's little shack.

383
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,760
 We're just hanging out there.

384
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,520
 Guy walks in and he goes, "Hey, you might know me from killing all those bears the other

385
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,520
 day."

386
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,200
 But Enoch, I have to ask you about this dream.

387
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,400
 So he describes the dream to Enoch and Enoch's just sitting there drinking his tea.

388
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,880
 Enoch is around 300 years old at this point.

389
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,520
 I should have mentioned that earlier.

390
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,200
 Enoch is a very, very old and wise man.

391
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,600
 He's drinking his tea and he goes, "I know exactly what that dream means."

392
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,000
 The 200 trees represent women, not the watchers themselves.

393
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,880
 They represent the women, the wives.

394
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,320
 And those trees were watered by corrupt gardeners who are the watchers.

395
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,000
 And the fruit those trees were bearing was poisonous fruit.

396
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,200
 And that's you, the Nephilim.

397
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,920
 The emperor coming down on the throne is your destruction.

398
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,720
 You are going to be destroyed first by fire and then by flood.

399
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,560
 You will be wiped off this planet.

400
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:08,000
 The warrior goes back, tells Shemi Haza, "Shemi Haza comes to Enoch and goes, 'Is there

401
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,440
 any way we can stop this?'"

402
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,160
 And Enoch goes, "Nope.

403
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,840
 You've interfered with the normal plan.

404
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,120
 You had all these babies.

405
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,400
 You can't have this race on this planet.

406
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,400
 You just can't.

407
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,320
 You're not allowed to."

408
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,360
 Shemi Haza is like, "If we pray," and Enoch's like, "Nope, it doesn't matter.

409
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:31,000
 You should pray for forgiveness because you're going to die, but there is nothing you can

410
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,320
 do to stop your death at this point."

411
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,200
 And Shemi Haza is like, "That's not funny.

412
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,520
 I thought you were going to insert a joke there."

413
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,600
 And Enoch's like, "No, no jokes during that part.

414
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,080
 I can dab on you before I leave.

415
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,000
 Will that make you feel better?"

416
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,240
 Shemi Haza is like, "Kinda."

417
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,320
 So Enoch dabs on him and he leaves.

418
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,640
 Shemi Haza goes, "That was kind of cringey, but it didn't make me feel a little bit better."

419
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,360
 Because now he knows that not only is he doomed, but his children are doomed.

420
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:04,360
 But like everyone who has their back against the wall, you figure, "Maybe I can make one

421
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,760
 last-ditch effort."

422
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:11,460
 So he gets all of the other Watchers together, all of their Witchwives, all of their children,

423
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,080
 so they have this massive army and they're hanging out by this mountain where they worshiped

424
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,480
 Azazel.

425
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:25,240
 And so everyone on this battlefield under Shemi Haza's control has superpowers.

426
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,600
 They would be the equivalent of if the X-Men and the Justice League and the villains, the

427
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,620
 Legion of Doom, whatever, all of them were in one plateau.

428
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:39,960
 So of course, nobody's going to fight these guys except for God, right?

429
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,880
 So but God, again, is the deadbeat dad of this story.

430
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,920
 He doesn't do anything, directly, at least.

431
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,720
 So he calls up his buddy, Raphael.

432
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,440
 He gets Raphael up there.

433
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:56,160
 And Raphael's an archangel and he's like, "I need you to clean up a mess for me."

434
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,560
 Raphael's like, "Another one?"

435
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,840
 And God's like, "Yes, yes."

436
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:03,840
 But this one will be particularly exciting if you ever wanted to fight a bunch of superhumans.

437
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,840
 Today's the day, Raphael.

438
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,840
 So he's like, "Ah, it sounds kind of cool, doesn't it?"

439
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,600
 And God's like, "I know, it actually is kind of cool.

440
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,000
 It sucks that I got to wipe all these people out."

441
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,680
 But they've just polluted the gene pool on Earth.

442
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,840
 So Raphael is like, "I got to assemble a team.

443
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,400
 I got to put my crew together, God."

444
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,320
 And God's like, "Go ahead and do that."

445
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:28,280
 So Raphael goes into the ranks of heaven and he goes, "I want you, and you, and you."

446
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,280
 That's it.

447
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,920
 Everyone's like, "That's all you're taking."

448
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,680
 They know what's going on down there, Raph.

449
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,360
 He's like, "I think we got this, right?"

450
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:39,200
 So he brings down Michael, Gabrielle, and Uriel, which are all archangels.

451
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:46,800
 So you have four archangels versus 200 angels, all these witches, and a bunch of giants.

452
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:51,640
 Again, all of these angels have fought during the war in heaven.

453
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,000
 And these particular four that are coming down were the generals.

454
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,160
 They were basically, if you put Conor McGregor, General Patton, and Superman in a blender.

455
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,040
 These guys would be Superman-level heroes.

456
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,040
 You put them in a blender.

457
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,840
 The blender would break, but out of the ruins of the blender would come Raphael.

458
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:19,720
 So they come flying down into this giant field where all these people are assembled.

459
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,720
 Come down.

460
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,720
 I guess they wouldn't go, "Whew."

461
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:27,600
 It sounds like they're just coming through a wind tunnel.

462
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,760
 Big old angel wings.

463
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,640
 They swoop down, land on the battlefield.

464
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,600
 And they're like, "It's time to go, Shemihausa."

465
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,640
 Shemihausa's like, "No!

466
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:42,040
 Now we can get into the dramatic, like, the war drums are coming."

467
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,000
 And Shemihausa's sweating.

468
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,920
 All of the angels are sweating at this point.

469
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,600
 All the watchers are sweating.

470
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:53,160
 The kids, the superheroes and their wives, they're just like, "Lookit, there's four of

471
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,440
 them versus all of us.

472
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,440
 We're going to win."

473
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,640
 But the watchers know these guys.

474
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,480
 They're like, "Uh-oh."

475
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,480
 War drums.

476
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,480
 "Waaaaah!"

477
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,480
 Giant's roaring in the distance.

478
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,480
 450-foot tall giant.

479
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,480
 "Waaaaah!"

480
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,400
 Now we're hiding behind a rock.

481
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
 We're watching this battle.

482
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,000
 We're hiding behind this rock.

483
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,560
 And I should say now, Enoch is gone.

484
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,520
 And he's not anywhere near this battlefield.

485
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,600
 And not only is he not near this battlefield, he's still the carpenter copter.

486
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,400
 So we are stuck on the ground.

487
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,680
 We're like hiding behind a rock.

488
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:32,200
 We are basically two hobbits on this massive battlefield.

489
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:37,720
 Raphael pulls out a flaming sword, making sure he doesn't catch his wings on fire, takes

490
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,720
 off.

491
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,600
 Anyways, dramatic music.

492
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:50,520
 And you have these four angels being to basically carve their way through this sea of superhumans.

493
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:55,760
 Now, and carve would be a good way to put it because they're just decimating these guys.

494
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:01,440
 But four of anything versus these numbers, it's not a cakewalk.

495
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,800
 These angels are cutting down these dudes, fighting these other angels, chopping off the

496
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,520
 heads of a couple witches, shooting off witty one-liners.

497
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,520
 "Waaaaah!"

498
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,920
 All this fair and love and gore, split dudes' guts open.

499
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:21,120
 Uh, I can't think of a pun for a giant.

500
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,800
 But anyways, he doesn't say anything, just stabs the giant in the stomachs.

501
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
 Giant falls on a bunch of people.

502
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,840
 Anyways, they're chopping all these people up, but they are outnumbered.

503
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,000
 They are outnumbered.

504
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,800
 And over the course of the battle, they're not doing too well.

505
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,320
 They're really not doing too well.

506
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,880
 Enoch is gone, and we're stuck there.

507
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,880
 And then that is when the tide of battle turns.

508
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,120
 Enoch wasn't-- Enoch, God is constantly just not paying attention to anything that's going

509
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,120
 on.

510
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,120
 Enoch, however, goes, "You know what?

511
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,080
 I'm gonna go take care of some stuff, dude.

512
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,080
 I'm gonna go take care of some stuff."

513
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,240
 The angels are holding their own, but the wheel of the battle is slowly turning against

514
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,680
 them.

515
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,840
 That is when, throughout the valley, you hear a--

516
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:14,320
 [Dramatic music]

517
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,320
 And at that point-- This isn't the Book of Giants.

518
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,880
 I thought this was an incredible detail.

519
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:28,720
 At that point, 400,000 humans from across the globe have assembled on this battlefield.

520
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,920
 An army of 400,000 men has been drafted up.

521
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:39,640
 The legends went out that today is the day we destroy the giants.

522
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,880
 Today is the day we take back Earth, and that cry went out.

523
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,040
 People would just pick up their spear, leave their village, grab their shield and their

524
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:56,120
 sword, get their sun to tend the farm as all the adult men left the city, and they just

525
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:01,440
 came from all over to that field.

526
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,800
 And they didn't just come with swords and shields.

527
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:08,080
 The Book of Giants is very specific on the weaponry they brought.

528
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,560
 This is part of the fragment from the Book of Giants.

529
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:18,560
 500,000 righteous came with fire, napatha, and brimstone.

530
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,160
 The biggest weapon they had against these giants was fire.

531
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:29,160
 You have all of them in one location, and they just begin raining hell down on these

532
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,960
 mutants.

533
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,240
 Torched the entire area.

534
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,960
 And as they're burning, as these giants are burning, as these witches are being torched,

535
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:44,480
 you have wave after wave of humans, totally normal people running in a battle attacking

536
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,040
 these super humans.

537
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:51,440
 Taking back for the first time, the first time humans were able to fight these guys.

538
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:58,280
 It took for archangels on their side, it took surprise attack, it took thousands and thousands

539
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:05,520
 of gallons of napalm and brimstone, big ol' rocks, big guys are putting on heaven mitts,

540
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,760
 throwing big heavy rocks of brimstone at 'em, people are looking at 'em, "are you sure you're

541
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,760
 not a giant?"

542
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,760
 He's like, "no, I'm not a giant.

543
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,120
 It drinks a giant bucket of ale, totally normal."

544
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,280
 They just burnt these monsters to the ground.

545
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:23,920
 And Sami Haza is watching this whole thing, and he knows it's over.

546
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:29,440
 He knows that archangels are getting their second wind, 400,000 troops are surrounding

547
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,280
 them far outstripping his army, and there's just no way they're gonna make this.

548
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,680
 So he leaves.

549
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,920
 He takes off.

550
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,040
 The day is one.

551
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:45,960
 Sharon, after that, Enoch leaves.

552
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,680
 Now one of the most interesting things about Enoch, again, one of the passages that's mentioned

553
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:56,280
 in the canonical Bible about him, is that Enoch doesn't die.

554
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,000
 Scholars, the way the Bible verses set up is that he walked with God and then he was

555
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 no more.

556
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,280
 And that has been believed to be by scholars that he didn't die, he was taken away.

557
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,920
 He's considered to be the only man in history who never died.

558
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:15,160
 He's in heaven and he's still alive.

559
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,120
 So that's how much of a pimp this dude was.

560
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:23,360
 That's how, even God's like, "you know what, I made you do some ridiculous stuff, you

561
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,960
 didn't get to fly around in space, but yeah, you don't gotta die, man.

562
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,320
 I'm gonna give you a bus pass to heaven.

563
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,760
 I'm going to, I guess it's more of like a limo ride, it's not even a bus pass.

564
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,120
 You don't even have to die.

565
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,120
 Come hang out with me.

566
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,120
 Just come chill with me."

567
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,240
 And Enoch's like, "yeah, yeah, that's cool."

568
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:46,440
 And after Enoch leaves, Raphael visits Samaehaza one last time.

569
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,080
 Lands in front of his hut.

570
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:54,040
 There's still a few giants left, still a few wives, still a few watchers, but the majority

571
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,160
 of them were wiped out in this battle.

572
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,800
 But they were still there and they were still interbreeding.

573
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,280
 So Raphael lands and Samaehaza's sitting there.

574
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,960
 Probably all burned up, probably sitting there all bandaged up in bed.

575
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,360
 And Raphael says, "so Enoch's gone.

576
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,880
 Enoch's gone now.

577
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,080
 Samaehaza's like, "is he dead?"

578
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,840
 Raphael's like, "no."

579
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,840
 But he's in heaven.

580
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,840
 He's not here anymore.

581
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,640
 Samaehaza's like, "that's weird.

582
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,400
 Oh, that's not expecting."

583
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,400
 Raphael's like, "yeah, mysterious ways, you know all that stuff."

584
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:28,520
 But I'm telling you this because now it's time for the second part of God's plan.

585
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,760
 There is a flood coming and it will destroy you.

586
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,040
 This is just a message from one angel to another.

587
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,720
 Because we fought together.

588
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,520
 I've known you for a billion years, Samaehaza.

589
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,040
 It's time to repent.

590
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,640
 You can't avoid this.

591
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,800
 You've been putting it off all this time.

592
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,800
 You gotta repent.

593
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,800
 And Raphael flies away.

594
00:29:50,800 --> 00:30:02,160
 And as he's flying away, little raindrops start falling.

595
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:09,000
 Samaehaza looks outside of his hut and just watches the rainfall.

596
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,200
 The great flood has started.

597
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,960
 So the story's fascinating on server...

598
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,720
 As a narrative, the story I think is really, really fascinating.

599
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,720
 Just as a story.

600
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,720
 But what I...

601
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,520
 You can pick it apart.

602
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,840
 So I think probably the most interesting takeaway from the story is that people go,

603
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:30,880
 "well, if the people in biblical times were super wicked and then God destroyed the world,

604
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,320
 aren't people today probably even more wicked than they were back then?"

605
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,240
 Or have been in periods of time more wicked than they were back then?

606
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,520
 But according to the book of Gents, that's not the reason why the flood happened.

607
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:46,880
 It was the fact that they were being wicked, but you also had an entire subspecies on Earth

608
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,360
 that was destroying his people.

609
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,680
 Now I know a lot of people are going to go, "wait a second, so 400,000 righteous men showed

610
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:58,360
 up at the battlefield and fought off the giants, but then God killed them all with a flood."

611
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,360
 Here's an...

612
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,840
 I don't want to get too much into the weeds on this thing, but the great flood, the Bible

613
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,240
 is a...

614
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,360
 Is not a history book.

615
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,720
 It is the religious history of the Jewish people.

616
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,720
 When they had the great flood, it flooded the region.

617
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,000
 The word that, you know, keeps saying that the world is...

618
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,200
 The entire world is flooded.

619
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,280
 It kills all the humans and stuff like that.

620
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,280
 That's not what happened.

621
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,880
 If you look at it in a spiritual...

622
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,320
 A spiritually historical text, the flood killed everyone in the region.

623
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,960
 Because even the most ardent creationist, I can't imagine, could argue, "well, they

624
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,920
 can be ridiculous," but there was absolutely no way.

625
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,080
 I believe there was a great flood.

626
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,080
 I believe that Noah built the ark and all that stuff.

627
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,800
 I do not believe for one second that Noah got off the ark with his family, and then

628
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,040
 a thousand years later you had a bunch of Chinese people, and they're all descended

629
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,040
 from Noah.

630
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,840
 That is completely ridiculous.

631
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,840
 There is no logic.

632
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:53,680
 I believe that a giant flood happened and a select family got on a boat and the entire

633
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,600
 region there was wiped out.

634
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,160
 But outside of that region you'd have people being like, "whoo, good thing I was living

635
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,160
 on this cliff.

636
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,560
 I don't think Noah and his family were the last people left."

637
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,240
 I think elements of the Noah story are a parable.

638
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,720
 I don't think you put two of each animal on the boat.

639
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,320
 Again, that just doesn't make any sense.

640
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:15,320
 But the idea of someone having a portend of a natural disaster, avoiding said natural

641
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:19,600
 disaster, and then reclaiming the land where everyone else was destroyed, I think historically

642
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,920
 that could have happened.

643
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,080
 I guess in a world where there's giants you could fit two animals, two of each animal

644
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,840
 on a boat, but anyways I'm getting too much.

645
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,960
 So those 400,000 people who came to fight the giants, they weren't all then wiped out

646
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,960
 by the flood.

647
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,120
 They went back to their own regions and continued to prosper.

648
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,760
 When you hear that story, it's funny because again half of it was remnants in China and

649
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:45,040
 then they found another chunk of it in the beginning half in the Dead Sea Scrolls.

650
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:50,840
 There are many elements in the story we've seen in fantasy novels that came out before

651
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,080
 the story of the Book of Giants was readily available.

652
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,320
 Obviously, Lord of the Rings, things like that.

653
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:03,080
 I think that whether or not the story is true, I think that the story was passed along so

654
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,880
 much in our culture.

655
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,600
 I think it's become part of our cultural memory where we may not actually remember the story

656
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:15,880
 itself, but the idea of alien invaders or supernatural beings trying to take over the

657
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:22,200
 planet, the idea of getting the entire planet on one battlefield to fight said invaders,

658
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:28,140
 the idea of divine intervention in a battlefield working side by side with the good aliens

659
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,720
 versus the bad aliens.

660
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,360
 You'll see that stuff across sci-fi, you'll see that stuff across fantasy literature,

661
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:38,800
 and I think it resonates to us like Lord of the Rings is because it's part of our cultural

662
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,800
 memory.

663
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:44,120
 For thousands of years, people believed this story was true, and then you can now read

664
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:52,360
 a story in the 1940s about a group of "normal" people siding with a good angel, Gandalf,

665
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:56,680
 versus an evil angel, Yav Sauron, who's corrupting the world and everything like that.

666
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,240
 I don't think that he was reading the Book of Giants, and even if he did read the Book

667
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,080
 of Giants to write that, we didn't.

668
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:08,800
 I think our cultural knowledge of that story embedded into us made us more excited to hear

669
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,800
 that story.

670
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,040
 It was reminding us of those old days.

671
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:16,120
 I personally would like to believe the Book of Giants is real, because it's awesome.

672
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,680
 I mean, that story is great.

673
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,360
 I love that story.

674
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,440
 I really would like it to be awesome.

675
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:27,280
 But I mean, obviously the logical side of me is it's an interesting parable to explain

676
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,760
 a horrible natural disaster.

677
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,760
 But still.

678
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:37,840
 Wouldn't it be great if you knew for a fact that there was a time on this planet where

679
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:45,800
 we all united to fight back monsters and reclaim the world for ourselves?

680
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,560
 This story made me so excited.

681
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,600
 This story got me so excited that I thought this story is like an action movie.

682
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,240
 And what does an action movie need?

683
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,760
 What does every action movie need?

684
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:08,440
 It's a song during the credits that recap the events of the story.

685
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,920
 Yo my name is Enoch and I'm from another epoch.

686
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,400
 I once went to space and I parted with the Ewoks.

687
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,520
 But long ago the watches came inside some bitches had a bunch of giant babies turning

688
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:24,000
 women, the witches putting men up in stitches, warfare everywhere.

689
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,760
 They started eating flesh so I got out of there.

690
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:32,600
 God sent a dream so they could come to me and I could perceive what it all means.

691
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:38,720
 I got 200 trees, we got poisonous seeds and soon you're gonna be 6 feet deep.

692
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,720
 It's war now.

693
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,960
 Get to your battle stations, no items box only.

694
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,680
 Final destination but we don't fight fair when we come to fight.

695
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,120
 We come and load it for bear.

696
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:52,440
 We got angels in the air, break bones and tear.

697
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,680
 But the giant babies running in fear.

698
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,680
 Get that weak sauce out of here.

699
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,200
 We bring in 400 k.

700
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,720
 We shoot and fire and flame.

701
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,000
 Boy you gotta know that we're winning that day.

702
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,880
 Up, up in a way I went to heaven and stayed.

703
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,680
 And I'm a pimp up there cause I ain't never been slayed.

704
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,040
 My name is Enoch and I'm from another epoch.

705
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,320
 I once went to space and I parted with the Ewoks.

706
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,960
 I got one last thing to say.

707
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,800
 I'm so OG you'll find my rhymes in a cave.

708
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,800
 Get a rubber radio.

709
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,320
 It's your daily paranormal conspiracy true crime podcast.

710
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,720
 You don't have to listen to it every day but I'm glad you listened to it today.

711
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,400
 Have a great one guys.

712
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,980
 (upbeat music)

713
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:42,980
