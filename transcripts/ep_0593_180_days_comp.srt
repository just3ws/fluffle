1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
 Seven years ago a man who claimed he was abducted by aliens

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:11,900
 Said that he knew the date that they would show themselves to all of humankind and that date was just passed into law

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,940
 by the United States Congress and then we take a look at the theory of

4
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:24,080
 Video games getting too smart for their own good. What happens when programmers are constantly crafting games?

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,220
 24/7 all around the world

6
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:34,740
 Is there a chance eventually one of them could become self-aware and make you their target today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

7
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:47,640
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,440
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. We got a ton of stuff to cover first off

9
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,160
 Let's bring in one of our supporters work give it up give it up to William Burdell's William Burdell's

10
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:03,100
 Walking in he's drinking milk. I'm running out of stuff for you guys to do as you guys entered Dead Rabbit Central

11
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:10,300
 He's drinking milk. Hopefully you're not lactose intolerant. William actually donated during my Thanksgiving live stream a very generous donation

12
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:15,160
 So I appreciate that you're gonna be our captain our pilot this episode. You can't support the show financially

13
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:21,360
 You know exactly what I'm gonna say. It's okay. Just help spread the word about the show that helps out tremendous

14
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,460
 And it's fan art Friday. So take a look at this awesome fan art from Twitter

15
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:35,000
 Twitter user named Slappy Sleepy Slappy Sleepy drew this I think actually I couldn't find this guy on Twitter

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 But I haven't my know it's Slappy Sleepy made this so awesome. Thank you so much Slappy Sleepy William

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,360
 I'm gonna toss you a shovel in a bag of coal

18
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,120
 Let's hop in the carpenter caboose

19
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:52,080
 We're taking the train to our first story and our first story is actually something I touched on yesterday

20
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:57,680
 So chica chica chica chica chica chica train is moving across the countryside yesterday

21
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,960
 I told a story and I said I don't even know if it's true

22
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,860
 I don't even know if my recollection of it was true because I couldn't find it anywhere online

23
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,120
 Couldn't find any bookmarks for it

24
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:14,440
 It was about a man who I said was in Malaysia who built a box to hide underneath in a woman's restroom

25
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,840
 Well, I found it. I've actually found the story. So I wanted to go in a little more detail with this one

26
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,560
 It's fairly short William go ahead. I see you are see you're already going to Malaysia. No, no, no turn left

27
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,180
 We're headed to New York City. It was way off. I was just on the top of my head

28
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,620
 I thought it took place in Malaysia chica chica chica chica. We're headed to New York City

29
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:40,160
 It's February 13th 1992. It's one day before Valentine's Day. Everyone's looking for love

30
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,160
 But Joseph Cornetta

31
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,080
 31 year old resident of New York had something else in mind

32
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,440
 He built a coffin sized box and took it into a woman's restroom at a place that he worked

33
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,140
 He was the plumber so it kind of makes sense. That's a good cover story plumber's walking in the bathrooms

34
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,500
 I mean they normally don't disappear

35
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,800
 They normally don't walk in and then never walk out

36
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:10,140
 but he built this coffin sized box wrapped it in brown wrapping paper and would go into the women's right it was there all

37
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,200
 The time so now I have more information and kind of feel you and you're like Jason

38
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,980
 I don't want you to fill me in the story was gross yesterday

39
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:21,520
 He built this coffin sized box and it was there all the time and you have to step up on it to wash your hands

40
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,520
 Or to look in the mirror every so often

41
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,000
 He would go in when there is no one there and again that gets perfect cover as a plumber

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,120
 It's almost like his whole life led up to this scheme. He builds this coffin sized box

43
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,080
 He would go and he would hide in it and women would have to step on it to use the sink and he would look up their skirts

44
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,440
 the way that his scheme

45
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,020
 unraveled was that a woman saw a creepy guy go into the

46
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:51,520
 Woman's restroom and she she reported it. She goes. That's weird. She sees this guy go in he never comes out

47
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,840
 So she actually alerts security and a female security guard goes in there and she's looking around

48
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,480
 She's like that is weird because this woman just saw this guy come in a while ago and he's never come out

49
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,720
 It was a ghost to me who's a ghost plumber then she's like in the bathroom. She goes on might as well wash my hands

50
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,720
 so she steps up on the platform and

51
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,440
 She falls through it she falls on top of this guy now

52
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,280
 It's coffin size so she didn't like plummet like 10 feet, but she fell on top of this guy

53
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,840
 She jumps off of the platform and lifts it up apparently she she hulk

54
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,400
 Apparently a wooden coffin can't hold her and she can also just pick it up

55
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,080
 Yeah, and when she picked it up underneath it was Joseph Cornetta and he was charged with third-degree burglary

56
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,480
 That's weird. I get maybe they didn't have voyeurism laws back then New York

57
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:44,160
 They might not have them nowadays for all I know but that is a true story. I didn't dream it up

58
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,560
 I did find it in a book of wacky news and I put something in the show notes

59
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,400
 So you can look at it yourself if you're so inclined, but I wanted to go ahead and clear that one up William

60
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,760
 I'm gonna toss you the keys to the dead rabbit durgible. We are headed out to I did not plan this story to fall on this date

61
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,720
 It was supposed to be on yesterday's episode supposed to come out yesterday

62
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,800
 We're touchy the keys of the dead rabbit durgible. We're headed to the United States Congress. This is not political

63
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,840
 This is nothing to do with what happened recently at all, but we do have to go to Congress for this story

64
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,360
 We're flying back to the United States Congress and after flying to the United States Congress

65
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:28,080
 We have a little meeting set up like a table. That's all it's a folding table and a couple of chairs in the dead rabbit durgible

66
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,720
 We're all sitting around it and I go okay guys. It's a bizarre story. That's going on

67
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,640
 I got an email from Scott and he turned me on to the story. So I tip a little hat to Scott

68
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,320
 I see him send to the table. Thank you very much for sending this my way

69
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,920
 What's happened is?

70
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:52,600
 Recently at the end of December Congress passed a 2.3 trillion dollar relief bill and in it this if you're not familiar with

71
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,640
 American politics or American lawmaking

72
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:02,080
 I don't know if other countries do this it's something that America does and every every stripe of the political divide

73
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,920
 It hates this part, but you can have a bill that's for

74
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:14,480
 Legislation a relief legislation, you know like helping businesses and things like that economy building and then you can just throw in a bill

75
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,080
 You can be like oh, I have this bill that I wrote last summer that I know won't pass otherwise

76
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:25,200
 So I'm gonna put it in this larger bill and you don't have time to read all 5,000 pages of the legislation

77
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,840
 You just go oh my constituents want me to take care of this so hopefully there's nothing

78
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,160
 Totally evil in this bill. They do it all the time

79
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:40,400
 You'll see them pass a bill like a defense bill to fund the military and then there'll be like a bill to build a

80
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,560
 fly fishing arena for 10 dudes in the middle of Alaska

81
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,960
 It happens all the time this time though. It's pretty dope

82
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:53,040
 All those other times it was a total scam and a ripoff shame on you politicians

83
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:58,360
 But this time it's dope what happened was senator Marco Rubio from Florida

84
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:06,200
 Drafted this bill called the Intelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 2021 and this is what this says

85
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,920
 This is groundbreaking stuff the Pentagon and the FBI have

86
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:17,400
 180 days from the passage of the bill. This is this is not conspiracy theory

87
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,200
 You can look at these links. These are all real. This is mainstream news

88
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,560
 I'll have it in the show notes. You can Google it yourself and it'll pop up like CNN

89
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,480
 C-Span military comm all this stuff the Pentagon and the FBI have

90
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:38,400
 180 days from the passage of the bill and it's already passed it passed at the end of December to reveal what they know about

91
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,240
 an identified aerial phenomenon a.k.a

92
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,320
 anomalous aerial vehicles a.k.a

93
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,920
 UFOs

94
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,440
 From the passage of that bill

95
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,560
 I think it was passed on like the 28th to the 29th of December the Pentagon and the FBI have to reveal

96
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,000
 What they know now this bill requires a

97
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,200
 Portion of it to be unclassified material and needs to be available to the public

98
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:13,400
 However, because of the sensitive nature of the matter there is part of the bill also says you can't have a classified component that only like the armed services

99
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:20,680
 Committees see in Congress, but the senators are here's the thing they go listen if something's going on

100
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,680
 That's a threat to national security

101
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:29,660
 Congress needs to know about it if it's something that's going on that's so beyond our capabilities

102
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:34,880
 The elected representatives need to know about it. The military can't keep these secrets

103
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,320
 Here's a couple portions of this bill

104
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,440
 If you're like this in a this to hear you this isn't a policy wonk podcast

105
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,400
 Let me read you this because this is the wording is very very important in this bill

106
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:54,880
 Whether request this is one of the things they're requesting in this bill they want quote the identification of potential aerospace or

107
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:02,040
 other threats posed by the unidentified aerial phenomenon to national security and an

108
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:10,680
 Assessment of whether this unidentified aerial phenomenon activity may be attributed to one or more foreign adversaries

109
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,400
 So it's not necessarily saying we want to know that a bunch of grays are invading

110
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,280
 They're saying we want to know what you know

111
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:23,880
 Does China have this technology does Russia have this technology does North Korea have this technology does?

112
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:32,040
 Question mark have this technology another thing they're requesting is quote identification of any incidents or patterns

113
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,520
 That indicate a potential adversary

114
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:44,000
 May have achieved to break through aerospace capabilities that could put United States strategic or conventional forces at risk

115
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,080
 unquote

116
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:54,840
 So that goes back to that thing because all of the sightings of UFOs they all break the what we know is the laws of physics

117
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,600
 so

118
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:03,600
 Has an earthly adversary gained this technology and you're hiding it from us for whatever reason we need to know

119
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,800
 That hundred and eighty days countdown started in December. It's going to put us somewhere in the beginning of July

120
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,080
 When this report is due you know what's interesting about it like on the one hand I can see

121
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,120
 Congress going we want to know about threats

122
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,680
 To the nation we're elected representatives. We want to know what the threats are

123
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:30,280
 Pentagon tell us what I find really odd about this is that the FBI is particularly called out

124
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,840
 They do say other agencies that are adjacent to the Pentagon and

125
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:41,320
 FBI need to comply to this as well, but those are the two that were named in the it's not even a request

126
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,080
 This is law. They have to do this, but why the FBI?

127
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,520
 You know obviously it makes you think of the X files, right because the FBI is

128
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:54,520
 investigating aliens and ghosts and killbillies eating their own kids

129
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:59,520
 Why like what are they doing doing with the UFO phenomenon?

130
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,880
 Here's an interesting part of this bill what they're requesting from the FBI is quote

131
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:12,520
 detailed analysis of the data of the FBI which was derived from investigations of

132
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:19,240
 intrusions of unidentified aerial phenomenon data over restricted United States airspace

133
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:27,800
 so apparently Mark Aruvio and other people in Congress know that the FBI as

134
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:34,200
 Currently or in the recent past been looking into an identified aerial phenomenon

135
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,560
 over the United States

136
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,120
 Now we always know it's like the military right like that's a given the FBI is particularly called out

137
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,240
 We want all the information you have about

138
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:52,160
 Investigations because they know they're running them. We want that paperwork. We want to know what you know

139
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,740
 So this had popped up in the news

140
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,440
 About a week or two ago

141
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,680
 I think it was towards the end of my break and I was gonna cover it

142
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:07,120
 But Scott's email kind of made me ramp it up because Scott's email added another wrinkle to the case

143
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:13,120
 Seven years ago. There was a reddit thread posted by a man with the account

144
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,120
 Throw away alien now. He's not throwing away aliens

145
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,400
 He's the accounts name that because he goes this is a first line of his post is throw away account

146
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:29,480
 Because I'm afraid if you're not familiar with Reddit a throwaway account as you started up just for one thread

147
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,520
 And then you get rid of it so no one can find out who you really are

148
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:40,100
 He tells a story. He was first abducted when he was 12 years old back in 1987 and it's a really interesting read

149
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:46,560
 It's odd because his account is very nonchalant even though at the beginning he states that he's afraid

150
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,240
 It's very nonchalant the way he talks about it first off. He dispels a bunch of myths

151
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,360
 He says there's no probing

152
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:59,400
 That's everyone's first question right even if like if someone tells you that's why a lot of abductees don't come

153
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:04,440
 Forward because a lot of people go as you get probed. We mean maybe they're not that blunt about it

154
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,480
 But that's always the joke right he goes

155
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,480
 I was abducting when I was 12 and I get abducted every couple years

156
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,480
 Generally once they abduct you they keep abducting you and he goes even the word

157
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,480
 Abduction's not the right thing. He goes you're invited onto the ship

158
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,720
 And we've covered that a lot on this show where the aliens will be like

159
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,760
 Do you want to come with us and people are like no in the aliens are like, okay, and they leave

160
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,760
 And then you have the people who get abducted but they're like I lost time and you wonder at a certain point

161
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,040
 Did they give permission and then they just got in too deep over their head?

162
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,960
 He says you're not really abducted they ask you and then you go along but at that point then they just kind of keep showing up

163
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,400
 Open that door once you're not gonna be able to close it

164
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:51,560
 He says I've seen people cut open like put to sleep and cut open and they fiddle around with people

165
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,400
 But then they sew him back up and the guy's fine

166
00:13:53,560 --> 00:14:00,120
 He goes the worst thing that he can recall really happening to him was them taking tissue samples

167
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,040
 They take tissue samples off your lower back or your buttocks

168
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:09,280
 Which would be interesting because that could be where the probing story comes from but he goes a lot of stuff

169
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,080
 They do is very

170
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,760
 Uninvasive is that a term not non-invasive? I think is the actual term

171
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,880
 Fairly gentle. He says they would show him

172
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:26,000
 Earth television shows and we're talking about great aliens what he's describing is great aliens and he also says this another thing

173
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,880
 We've come across a lot on the show. He goes. They're not really gray

174
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:37,240
 Like they are they're kind of a beige, but their skin that is a suit their bodies. That's a suit. They wear

175
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,240
 It's a super tight

176
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,600
 Space suit and we've come we've covered that a lot on this show. They're not little naked dudes walking around

177
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,240
 It's a really really tight suit they're wearing he says they would show him television shows and they would just watch him

178
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,520
 They would gauge his response to what he's watching Webster

179
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:58,800
 He's like what this show sucks put back on different strokes for those shows even on in 1987

180
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,480
 They're showing him go-bots. He's like what this sucks put back on transformers

181
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,200
 He goes the aliens basically show no emotions

182
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:12,840
 But two of them they would show sadness from time to time and then they would show irritation when you asked them questions

183
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:18,040
 They hated it. They absolutely hated they had asked you questions non-stop as they're running these studies on you

184
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,040
 But if you started asking them questions, they're totally done with them

185
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:28,960
 They don't know one here at all. He also said that although they can beam and this is weird too because I've seen this so many times in

186
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:33,800
 The stories we covered and I never even really questioned it. I didn't really think of it

187
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:40,000
 There's so many times that a great aliens show up and they're beaming telepathic messages into some farmer's head

188
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,280
 Do you want to eat some pancakes and the farmer says sure I'll eat some pancakes?

189
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:50,760
 He says the great aliens can beam telepathic messages into your head, but they can't read your mind

190
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,960
 You have to verbally answer them

191
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:59,080
 That's weird because that happens all the time. I never thought of that before

192
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:06,600
 So many times the people are talking and the aliens are using telepathy because the aliens can't read our minds

193
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,880
 According to throw away alien he says there he goes you can never verbally talk to these guys

194
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,920
 He goes there he described their languages sound and like

195
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,200
 That's dummy song

196
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:25,560
 It was like this weird

197
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,480
 It's weird noise once there was a boy

198
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,160
 He also compared it to like the sound of a trumpet

199
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,720
 I'm not gonna do trumpet sound because I know some of you guys listen to this show while you're falling asleep

200
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:47,040
 Interesting little tidbit to this he says that they actually love earth music two types of music in particular

201
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,640
 I've always theorized do what aliens even be able to comprehend music if you went to an alien planet

202
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:59,160
 Could you comprehend their music like would it make would you be able to tell it was a musical arrangement on another planet?

203
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,760
 I've always been curious about that, but he goes aliens love

204
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,720
 Bluegrass, bluegrass music.

205
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,760
 Come on down and swamp, dam, dam, dam, dam, dam, dam, dam.

206
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,600
 Actually don't know what bluegrass music sounds like,

207
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,880
 but I assume it sounds like that.

208
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,720
 Come on, I'm not gonna keep trying to do bluegrass music,

209
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,480
 but imagine the word swamps in it a lot.

210
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,280
 They also love the sound of this African instrument

211
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,600
 called the Sheikir.

212
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,940
 It's like a Gord, it's a percussion instrument.

213
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:30,420
 So this Gord that has these like strings on it.

214
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,420
 (makes a compression sound)

215
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,920
 (makes a compression sound)

216
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,320
 Come on down to the swamp right now.

217
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,440
 (makes a compression sound)

218
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,400
 I don't know what that instrument sounds like

219
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,840
 either I gotta lift it up.

220
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,840
 But I'm still busy reading about a man

221
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,440
 hiding in a woman's restroom in a coffin.

222
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,240
 Because I don't know, this is interesting

223
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,560
 'cause he says their voices sound like a trumpet.

224
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,100
 This would kind of make sense.

225
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,920
 But he says their voices remind him of a trumpet

226
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,200
 and it also sounds like (makes a compression sound)

227
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,680
 like this hum thing.

228
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,200
 So maybe a blend of the two.

229
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,140
 As much as I talk trash about a gray aliens,

230
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,420
 I will agree with him on this.

231
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:08,100
 He said gray aliens hate jazz.

232
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,260
 They despise jazz music.

233
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,140
 But I can just imagine the aliens are like flipping through

234
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,980
 earth television stations trying to find something

235
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,420
 for this dude to watch and they come across like

236
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,620
 PBS Jazz Hour.

237
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,460
 (laughs)

238
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,500
 They're like ships going out of control,

239
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,260
 everyone's trying to hold their ears and pilot

240
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,100
 an interstellar craft at the same time.

241
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,380
 Hurry up, change it, change it.

242
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,180
 They hate jazz, they hate jazz.

243
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:34,340
 And they hate classical music.

244
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:39,340
 I almost feel like I've had so much hate and anger

245
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:43,240
 towards the grays and then this could bring us together.

246
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,240
 'Cause I also despise classical music and jazz.

247
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,520
 I feel like maybe they are my space brothers.

248
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,000
 Maybe they can come on down and swamp with me

249
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,040
 and listen to some bluegrass music.

250
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,560
 He says they've been here for like 10, 20,000 years.

251
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,580
 He says these monitors on this screen,

252
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:07,100
 he said these monitors that they're looking at

253
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,760
 would show him images of the past.

254
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,740
 So he actually saw them.

255
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,100
 This is really interesting note.

256
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,820
 He said that I saw the aliens at the construction

257
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,420
 of the pyramids.

258
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,600
 He didn't say they were building them

259
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,740
 because we have a lot of good theories

260
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,820
 of how humans could build the pyramids.

261
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,620
 So I think he could have easily just said

262
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,540
 I saw the aliens build the pyramids.

263
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,800
 And then you'd be like, oh,

264
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,140
 you're chasing that support where you zone out

265
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,700
 on the story, all these other claims.

266
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,660
 Well, yeah, they hate jazz.

267
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,500
 I hate jazz.

268
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,620
 That makes sense.

269
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:43,120
 He says that he saw them at the building of the pyramids,

270
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,320
 not building them themselves.

271
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,580
 So that was interesting detail.

272
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,240
 Because again, he could have easily just said,

273
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,180
 if he's making it up,

274
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,440
 make up parts of the popular mythos.

275
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,440
 He also said that he saw footage of this massive stone

276
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,060
 building, like this giant stone tower,

277
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,820
 somewhere in Europe 10,000 years ago.

278
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,860
 And it would have been demolished in the meantime.

279
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,600
 So the whole lost civilization thing,

280
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,300
 that's a really cool visual story on that as well.

281
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,100
 And it's interesting because he,

282
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,540
 that's pretty much the end of it.

283
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,140
 He kind of wraps it up with that.

284
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,900
 And he's basically open to questions.

285
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,460
 And then he has this original thread

286
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,000
 and then at the bottom it says edit.

287
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,740
 He's edited it at a certain point.

288
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,580
 The edit was also seven years ago.

289
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,700
 The last thing he wrote was no more questions.

290
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,900
 They are not happy with me.

291
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,980
 Sorry.

292
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,500
 And the account has never been used since.

293
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,900
 It's only been used on that one single thread.

294
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,220
 It's never been used since.

295
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,020
 He did answer someone's question and they were like,

296
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,740
 what are the aliens think about nukes?

297
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,900
 Do they want to stop war?

298
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,780
 And he goes, no, they don't really care about nukes.

299
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,340
 He goes, at least they never asked me about nukes.

300
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,540
 He goes, at one point,

301
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,180
 they did show me some footage of them abducting

302
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,860
 some soldiers during World War I.

303
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,660
 They did seem pretty curious about human wars.

304
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,940
 They didn't really care about nukes.

305
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,860
 A lot of times nuclear disarmament and environmental stuff.

306
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,820
 Aliens are always trying to wanna clean up our environment

307
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,620
 and stuff like that or disable our nukes.

308
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,740
 Because they never even brought that up.

309
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,100
 And this guy's been being abducted from 1987

310
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,820
 to what, seven years ago, 2013.

311
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,060
 That's a lot of time to be hanging out with gray aliens

312
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,060
 and them never bringing up.

313
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,020
 And he never mentioned the environmental thing as well.

314
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,660
 So that was interesting.

315
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,060
 So what does this have to do with Congress?

316
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,620
 This Reddit thread that was set up seven years ago,

317
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,300
 this account has not been used since,

318
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,820
 he says in this post,

319
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,700
 the gray aliens told me they were gonna make themselves

320
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,340
 know into the world in July of 2021.

321
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,500
 He goes, it's either,

322
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,340
 he goes, it's kinda hard to understand them sometimes.

323
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,540
 You know, with the constant humming in your ear.

324
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:53,540
 He goes, they either said July 8th or July 18th, 2021.

325
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,180
 But he says that's when the gray aliens

326
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,500
 are gonna let everyone know they're here.

327
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,740
 And so the reason why,

328
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,740
 this thread has just been gathering dust

329
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,620
 over the past seven years.

330
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:08,260
 The reason why it's taking flight now, no pun intended.

331
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,860
 The reason why it's in hyperspace now

332
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:15,860
 is because July is six months after the passage of this bill.

333
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:21,260
 Where the Pentagon and the FBI and any adjacent group

334
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:25,900
 has to tell America and more secretive stuff

335
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,820
 to the members of Congress,

336
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:32,820
 but they have to reveal what they know about UFOs,

337
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,900
 unidentified aerial vehicles.

338
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,340
 So a bizarre coincidence?

339
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,020
 Did this guy know this?

340
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,300
 Are aliens such a master of reality

341
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,020
 that they could see into the future and they go,

342
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,740
 well, eventually, you know,

343
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,780
 some dude in Florida is gonna write this bill

344
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,980
 and he's gonna sneak it in during this relief package.

345
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,660
 And we're just gonna tell this kid,

346
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:58,660
 or is it possible that Marco Rubio is a gray alien?

347
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,860
 No, I'm just joking.

348
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,260
 Is it possible that there are aliens

349
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,900
 behind this bill as well?

350
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,580
 I guess that's just as ridiculous as saying Marco Rubio.

351
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,420
 But you know what I mean?

352
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,740
 Like maybe there are forces saying it's time.

353
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:14,700
 Or actually maybe, there's a lot of maybes in this,

354
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,140
 but maybe they know the aliens are coming in July

355
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:20,220
 and this way it kind of gives everyone an out.

356
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,420
 If the Congress announces,

357
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,900
 hey, look it, we know that these things

358
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,900
 are from out of this world.

359
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,300
 And then a bunch of ships flow up and they're like,

360
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,700
 hey, look it, we didn't lie to you.

361
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,420
 We actually told you the truth.

362
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,220
 It's the most likely scenario is

363
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,700
 it's a super weird coincidence.

364
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,820
 Like the rational scenario, super weird coincidence.

365
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,500
 But a coincidence nonetheless.

366
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,420
 And as Garrick once said, I believe in coincidences,

367
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,840
 coincidences happen all the time.

368
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,180
 I don't trust coincidences.

369
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,580
 So we'll see what happens.

370
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,540
 It will it be another date that just passes?

371
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,540
 And that actually, this is interesting

372
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,820
 'cause it won't be.

373
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:00,660
 The Pentagon and the FBI have to reveal that information.

374
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:04,420
 The information could be there is, it's all this.

375
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,060
 It's all Chinese technology.

376
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,300
 It used to be Soviet technology.

377
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,420
 It could be that.

378
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,740
 And that would answer a whole lot of questions.

379
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,160
 Or it could be the Pentagon's straight up go.

380
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,560
 We don't know what these things are.

381
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,680
 They're not from around here.

382
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,640
 So this isn't, Scott goes in his email, he goes,

383
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,840
 I thought it was just one of those,

384
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,440
 one of those many fake into the world things

385
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,600
 that pops up every single month

386
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,200
 in the conspiracy theory community.

387
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,360
 And I go, no, this is real.

388
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,000
 The bill is real.

389
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,280
 So the date won't, something will happen in July.

390
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,000
 The very least we're gonna get information

391
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,300
 from armed services and the Federal Bureau

392
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,280
 of Investigation involving UFOs.

393
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:51,340
 At the very, very least and at the most.

394
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,900
 Come on down and swamp me.

395
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,780
 We're, we see a bunch of UFOs float.

396
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,580
 I'm all like, my galactic brothers,

397
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:01,020
 the first thing they do is they destroy every jazz bar.

398
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,820
 Just doing that, I walk in with the bat.

399
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,100
 I'm like, I'm with the aliens now,

400
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,060
 smashing tubas.

401
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,580
 We don't have time for the full gaming story

402
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,820
 I wanted to tell,

403
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,080
 but I wanted to wet your whistle.

404
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,780
 Wanted to wet your whistle with this one.

405
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,480
 William Bertels, I'm gonna touch the keys

406
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,120
 to the carbon helicopter very quickly.

407
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,920
 We are gonna fly on out to Sacramento, California.

408
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,560
 (imitates car engine)

409
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,600
 At this whole segment, we'll do it Monday

410
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,320
 about how video games may be coming more self aware

411
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,320
 than we think and not super advanced video games,

412
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,640
 but like basic games being played so often

413
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,020
 that they may actually start to turn on the players.

414
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,120
 We've got some cool, cool stories for you

415
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,700
 in involving that, but in the video game realm,

416
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,320
 William Land the Carboner Cofter right here

417
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,380
 by American River College,

418
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,020
 where long time listeners of the show know that I went

419
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,080
 to college, some of my happiest years,

420
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,240
 I've had a lot of them, so it's tough competition,

421
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,760
 but some of my happiest years were at American River College.

422
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,060
 I'd always go to the jack in the box.

423
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,320
 You can take this journey yourself

424
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,160
 if you're in circle.

425
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,040
 You know guys, I'd go to the jack in the box

426
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,120
 and I'd get a chicken teriyaki rice bowl,

427
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,320
 (makes chicken noises)

428
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,400
 drink a Coke, I'd go back to school.

429
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,400
 (laughs)

430
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,200
 Jason, that's not how you're gonna wrap up this episode.

431
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,400
 No, it's not just product placement.

432
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,160
 One time though, I remember I was on a bus for some reason.

433
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,280
 The jack in the box has nothing to do with this story.

434
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,600
 I just really like chicken teriyaki rice bowls

435
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,240
 and I'd also get a large order of jalapeno poppers,

436
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,720
 but in the egg roll.

437
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,840
 But one time I was on a bus driving through this area,

438
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,280
 so there's like a little shopping center.

439
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,280
 There used to be a military surplus store

440
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,160
 with who I could only describe,

441
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,440
 the guy who owned it as a domestic terrorist.

442
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,600
 He was basically Otto from the Simpsons.

443
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
 Every time you walked in there,

444
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,400
 'cause I always wanted to buy pants,

445
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,280
 buy like cool army pants.

446
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:56,320
 You always thought that the Fed thrown away at any point.

447
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,000
 He did not want customers in there.

448
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,760
 I swear he was selling weapons in the back.

449
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,680
 But one time I'm taking a bus through this area,

450
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,680
 and I look out the window as the bus is driving,

451
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,560
 I look out the side window,

452
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,440
 and I see two men walking down the road.

453
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,440
 There's a shorter overweight man and a taller skinny man.

454
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,280
 They, this is, (laughs)

455
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,320
 this is how I'm ending my Friday episode,

456
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,960
 but this story's true.

457
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,760
 Tall skinny man, short overweight man.

458
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,080
 Both of them have mustaches.

459
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,920
 The shorter man is wearing red.

460
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,680
 He's like wearing a red shirt and blue pants.

461
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,240
 And the tall skinny guy is wearing a green cap,

462
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,480
 a green t-shirt and blue pants.

463
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,160
 And I'm like, this guy's kind of look like Mario and Luigi.

464
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,840
 Right?

465
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,000
 (birds chirping)

466
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,160
 (laughs)

467
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,560
 Hold on, hold on, don't look up.

468
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,920
 Don't look up yet.

469
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,720
 Like this guy's kind of look like Mario and Luigi.

470
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,040
 Now the bus is driving.

471
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,880
 If I was in my car, I totally would have stopped

472
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,720
 and asked them, "Hey, are you Mario and Luigi?"

473
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,200
 But I didn't have that power.

474
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,640
 The bus is driving by,

475
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,200
 and I see them in some sort of animated argument.

476
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,800
 Like it's overblown,

477
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,960
 like you know how people argue in a silent film?

478
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,160
 Like that, it's exaggerated argument

479
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,880
 as they're walking down the street.

480
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,880
 And then to make it even more like some bizarre scene,

481
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,160
 Mario, he has a red baseball cap on,

482
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,240
 he takes his cap off and hits Luigi over the head with it.

483
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,520
 And Luigi covers up his head with both hands.

484
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,400
 Like someone just hit him in the head with a baseball bat

485
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,560
 and it's so animated.

486
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,640
 I can't hear anything,

487
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,840
 but he covers up his head with both his hands

488
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,840
 and I see his mouth go, "Ow!"

489
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:53,000
 Like super ridiculous.

490
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,240
 And I remember the bus driving

491
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,240
 and I am craning my neck now

492
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,720
 and I see them just continuing to walk down the street.

493
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:06,160
 I'm pretty sure that was actually Mario and Luigi.

494
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,840
 Now again, it's probably not,

495
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,200
 they're probably not eight bit characters

496
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,040
 in the real world.

497
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,760
 I found the whole thing so bizarre.

498
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,920
 Everything was perfect about it.

499
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,920
 The way they were dressed, the way they looked,

500
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,520
 if anything was different.

501
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,760
 And the thing that pushed it over the edge

502
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,080
 was they're over the edge antics.

503
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,040
 It's like watching a real life three Stooges.

504
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,560
 Like if you took your hat off,

505
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,560
 take your hat off right now,

506
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,000
 go by hat and sit down next to someone

507
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,520
 and hit him on the head with your hat.

508
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,840
 They're gonna be like, "What?

509
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,760
 "What'd you do that for, man?"

510
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,160
 Maybe they're sleeping and they're like, "Ugh, what was that?"

511
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,680
 They're at no point will they hold their head

512
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,680
 with both their hands and go, "Ow!"

513
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,560
 Unless they're a newborn baby.

514
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,600
 Even in the Fontanella and don't do that.

515
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,320
 If the person next to you is younger than a year,

516
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,160
 don't do that.

517
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,840
 Actually, don't do that to any child,

518
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,520
 but there was something so,

519
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,320
 it was like, it was so bizarre.

520
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,440
 It wasn't the most bizarre thing I've ever seen.

521
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,800
 It wasn't even in the top 1,000 bizarre things

522
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,360
 I've ever seen, but it's a good way

523
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,800
 to end the Friday's episode.

524
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,880
 It's a good cliffhanger for Monday's episode.

525
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,320
 Is it possible that you play a video game for so long

526
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,080
 that it becomes self-aware?

527
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:25,080
 And it knows you are a human player

528
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,920
 trying to control its destiny.

529
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,040
 We'll explore that story and more next week

530
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,640
 on Dead Rabbit Radio.

531
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,160

 You can also hit us up at facebook.com/DeadRabbitRadio.

533
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,720
 Yes, I did, I did in Friday's episode on a story

534
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,720
 about an overweight man and a skinny man

535
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,200
 getting hit with a hat.

536
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,600
 Dead Rabbit Radio is the daily paranormal conspiracy

537
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,560
 and true crime podcast.

538
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,520
 You don't have to listen to it every day.

539
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,080
 Glad you guys listened to today.

540
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,880
 I love you guys, have a great weekend, I'll see you Monday.

541
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,460
 (upbeat music)

542
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:01,040
 (upbeat music)

543
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,620
 (upbeat music)

544
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,200
 (upbeat music)

545
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,780
 (upbeat music)

546
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:11,360
 (upbeat music)

547
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,940
 (upbeat music)

548
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,520
 (upbeat music)

549
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,100
 (upbeat music)

550
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,680
 (upbeat music)

551
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,260
 (upbeat music)

552
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,840
 (upbeat music)

553
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,840
 Thank you.
