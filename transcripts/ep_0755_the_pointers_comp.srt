00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
 Today we return to Germany to take a look at some more werewolf facts and fables.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:06,480
 Ahooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:31,480
 And then we travel to Australia to take a look at a terrifying event. We all think about what would happen if aliens invaded. Well, Australia got to experience it firsthand today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:40,480
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. Hope you guys are having fun doing whatever you're doing.

5
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:51,480
 First off, first off coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now, everyone get up out of your seats. Unless you're piloting an airplane, give it up for Klaus. Klaus, everyone give him a round of applause for Klaus.

6
00:00:51,480 --> 00:01:03,480
 Klaus, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode. If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand. Just help spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

7
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:21,480
 Klaus, I hope you brought some old timey clothes, some like vests, and like I don't know, shirts. I'm fully dressed if that is what you're asking. We're going back to old timey Germany. So Klaus, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

8
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:27,480
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We are headed all the way out to old timey Germany.

9
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:45,480
 Now yesterday we talked about old timey Germany. We talked about foxes. We talked about where foxes and belts of fox fur and a guy who became a furry and then loved it so much he just lived in the woods until he got shot in the face. The end.

10
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:56,480
 And it's funny at the beginning of the intro of that episode I go, what would happen if the furry fetish was contagious and I never really addressed that in the story. What I meant by all addressing on this one because we're going to kind of talk about the same thing.

11
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:08,480
 What if, if like someone had a fetish, if they bit you, you got that fetish. So someone's like a leather daddy, they're like walking around and like tight leather gimp suit. They're their repulsive work.

12
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:17,480
 You're all trying to fill out forms. They're like Johnson is the report ready and you're like, ah, this is giant gimp standing next to you. And then he bites you. Arr.

13
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:31,480
 And then you became, he became a leather freak. Wouldn't that be awful? Like, it's already bad enough, I think, to get a fetish. I almost feel like it's something that you're just like, oh no, I'm into smelly feet.

14
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:38,480
 Like, one of that suck. You're smelling a foot right now. You're like, I'm unsubscribing to this show.

15
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:46,480
 Yeah, I mean, like, sure, people who have the fetish enjoy the fetish. I don't want to smell feet. I don't want to smell good smelling feet or bad smelling feet.

16
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:55,480
 But if someone who loved the smelly feet is like sneaking up around me, I'm like walking to the store and he's like, oh, this is what he does during the day and at night, he smells feet.

17
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:05,480
 And then he jumps on my back and bites me and then all of a sudden, like, the next full moon, the next full moon, I'm like hanging outside yoga studio. I do that.

18
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:16,480
 I already do that, but for different reasons. I'm just going to pick up on chicks, but let's say I was trying to smell their feet, right? It'd be awful.

19
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:29,480
 That would be weird. And I think that's really when you look at werewolves and werefoxes like yesterday. It's kind of what it is, right? We talked yesterday, we talked about a school teacher who got turned into a fox and then loved it.

20
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:40,480
 And I thought, well, what if like that translated and like you could get bit by people with fetishes and you become that because I am not a nudist. I don't like walking around naked in public.

21
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:51,480
 I wouldn't want to do it. So if a nudist bit me, I'd be really bummed. And if someone turned me into a fox, I'd be pretty bummed too because those animals are like kind of weak, right?

22
00:03:51,480 --> 00:04:02,480
 But what if a werewolf bit you? That would be dope. Like, oh, Jesus, be like holding in your intestines in the middle of the woods somewhere in Germany being like, oh, this is so awesome.

23
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:12,480
 Get bit by a werewolf. Well, turns out, I guess getting bit by a werewolf to become a werewolf is not. There's different types of werewolves.

24
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:21,480
 Like there's the werewolf you get bit by and then you survive the bite and then you slowly turn into the werewolf. And that was in that awful movie Full Moon High, if you want to know more about that.

25
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:32,480
 But in what the legends in Germany, they'd have wolf belts. You'd get a belt made out of wolf skin and you'd put it on and then you would become a werewolf.

26
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:42,480
 So you get to choose whether or not you want to be naked running around in the woods on all fours, all furring stuff versus not being able to choose.

27
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:54,480
 So I've been recently looking into werewolf legends and I found some really interesting ones. First off, let's travel to Zarnau in Germany.

28
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:02,480
 The year is 1831. We actually have a year for this one because I got it from thinkaboutadox.com and I have more news about that website in an upcoming episode.

29
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:13,480
 It's not good, but in 1831 in Zarnau, Germany, we're riding our horses through the woods, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop. And we see a wolf running around.

30
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:21,480
 And we go to shoot it and I'm like, "No, no, no, don't shoot that dude." Because that wolf is like super mean and stuff.

31
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:31,480
 And you're like, "Wobby is lit. It's carrying a child in its mouth." And I go, "Listen, many a hunter has tried to shoot that wolf, but no one can kill him."

32
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:41,480
 And you're like, "Jayson, you see, he's clearly eating that child. Shouldn't we at least try?" And I go, "Uh-uh, I have all your bullets in my hand. You don't even get to try without me."

33
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:46,480
 And the kids are like, "Help me, help me, help me." And I'm like, "If we help you, it'll interfere with the story."

34
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:56,480
 This wolf is ravaging this countryside and it did kill a child. It ate a child. It was also attacking people and it was just attacking them.

35
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:03,480
 They were like, "Oh no, my brand new shirt." But when the kids didn't have a shirt to rip, the wolf just ate them.

36
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:16,480
 It was also killing cattle, but if you're a werewolf or just a regular wolf and you saw a cow, a moose, and a baby, why would you eat the baby?

37
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,480
 Because it's like one bite. That's like a fun-sized snicker bar.

38
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:30,480
 And I'm assuming there's a lot of fat in there, so there's a lot of calories for the wolf, but generally, elks and cows aren't in houses.

39
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:35,480
 So was the baby like outside? There obviously wasn't a line of a baby and elk in a cow.

40
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:41,480
 So I don't understand why a wolf would go, "Ah, you know what I really want to eat is that child over there."

41
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,480
 When there's like squirrels and stuff to eat. He's eating butterflies? I don't know.

42
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:54,480
 It seems like a child would be a lot of work. Anyways, but whatever the logistics were, he did rip this kid to pieces, right?

43
00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:01,480
 This kid did die. So the people in town are like, "We gotta kill the wolf," despite what this idiot keeps saying.

44
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,480
 He won't let us shoot him and taking all of the bullets. We think you're the werewolf, Jason.

45
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:11,480
 The townspeople finally organized a big hunt. They actually don't think it's a werewolf. They just think it's a wolf.

46
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:18,480
 They organized this big hunt to go kill this wolf and they finally get together and they start surrounding it.

47
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,480
 They're beating the bushes and the wolf's like, "Oh, oh, oh." And he's running over here and then there's more people with guns.

48
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,480
 "Oh, oh." And he goes over here and there's more people with guns. "Oh, oh."

49
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:34,480
 This continues on and on for a while until eventually the villagers have made a perfect circle around this wolf.

50
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,480
 He can't go anywhere and they got their muskets raised. They're about to shoot this wolf dead.

51
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:45,480
 And then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, like magically, suddenly a large man,

52
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:51,480
 described as a large man with a club, appears in front of the wolf.

53
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:58,480
 And they don't say for sure that the wolf disappears or not. I don't know if they think that the wolf turned into the caveman.

54
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,480
 They assume it's a werewolf and they run away. They never saw the werewolf again, apparently,

55
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:08,480
 but they never killed it. They never got vengeance for it, killing the kid and all that stuff.

56
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:14,480
 But yeah, so a werewolf legend, that was written by a guy named JDH Temme.

57
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,480
 He was a German politician and lawyer. He wrote fiction and nonfiction.

58
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:23,480
 So it's possible that this is some short story he wrote and it just became...

59
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,480
 We've seen this happen before with other stuff we've covered on the show. It became part of werewolf lore.

60
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:35,480
 But I thought it was interesting because we do have the difference of not the man turning into the wolf, turning back into the man.

61
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:41,480
 It's almost like, to me, it almost seemed like the caveman was like the wolf's guardian spirit.

62
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,480
 It's kind of weird. It's kind of a weird anomaly to it.

63
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,480
 And as I was looking into werewolf stories, I got really deep in all this German stuff.

64
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,480
 You're like, "Oh no, Jason. Oh no, cancel the podcast now before you ruin it."

65
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,480
 I got old, timey, German-y stuff, okay?

66
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,480
 I'm looking at all this stuff. You guys know about the brother's grim, right?

67
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,480
 There's the Wilhelm grim and then his younger brother, Jacob.

68
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:16,480
 And I came across a tale of...it wasn't a tale, it was a list of superstitions that Jacob Grimm had recorded.

69
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,480
 These are all apparently real that old, timey, German people believed.

70
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,480
 And they're all about male and female. I thought it was kind of interesting.

71
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:32,480
 It's like we can follow the path of the lovers through the type of superstitions that the Germans hopefully used to believe and don't anymore.

72
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,480
 Hopefully they don't believe in men anymore. Men and women.

73
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,480
 So here's a tip for you men out there. It is not good.

74
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,480
 Actually, I think this applies to everyone. It's not good.

75
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:47,480
 It's bad luck if you wake up in the morning and you walk outside, you walk out of the street.

76
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,480
 If you see an old woman, that means you're going to have a bad day.

77
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,480
 Like, damn, I work in a retirement home. I live in a retirement home. All I see is old ladies.

78
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,480
 You're like, "Oh, today's going to suck so bad."

79
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,480
 If you see an old woman, you're going to have a bad day. It's bad luck.

80
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,480
 But if you see a young woman, it's good luck.

81
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:15,480
 So there's that. And according to Jacob Grimm, if you see one old woman, you're boned already,

82
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:21,480
 but if you happen to walk between two old women, you'll have the worst luck ever that day.

83
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,480
 Here's this quote. This is what Jacob Grimm wrote.

84
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:35,480
 "Many men would rather let themselves be beaten to death than to walk between two old women."

85
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,480
 But now we've gotten past the bad luck portion of our day.

86
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,480
 A couple of our listeners have been beaten to death because they did not want to walk between two old ladies.

87
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,480
 Now let's look at the courtship, the way that Germans would court each other.

88
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,480
 If a woman wants to figure out, like, how is my husband going to be?

89
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,480
 She's not married already, right? She's a young maid, and she can just look if she's married and go,

90
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,480
 "Oh, my husband's that slob."

91
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:05,480
 What she has to do is she has to lean. She has to walk backwards against a woodpile, a big old thing of wood.

92
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,480
 And without looking, she has to reach behind her, and she grabs...

93
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,480
 She has to do this on Christmas Eve, too. So if you're doing it right now, you're standing in front of a woodpile now,

94
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,480
 you've got to wait until Christmas Eve. On Christmas Eve, you stand... a young woman, standing against a woodpile,

95
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,480
 she reaches backwards and she grabs a piece of wood and she pulls it out.

96
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,480
 And if it's crooked, then her husband will be a crooked man.

97
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:36,480
 And if it's upright and strong, she will have a strong man, which she will probably need when she is buried underneath all of the logs,

98
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,480
 since she played Jenga in real life.

99
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:45,480
 Also, on Christmas Eve between 11 and 12 o'clock, all single girls wake up. You didn't know this?

100
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,480
 I know the female members of the audience are nodding their head right now. They've been fully aware of this.

101
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,480
 But Christmas Eve between 11 and 12, all single girls wake up.

102
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:01,480
 And to learn whether or not they will marry in the next year, they have to take off all their clothes,

103
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:07,480
 then they have to go into the kitchen, and I'm going to read this to you, because I don't know of any other way to interpret this.

104
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:15,480
 They're in the kitchen, they quote, "stick their heads into the kitchen kettle and watch the bubbling water."

105
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,480
 That's all it says.

106
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,480
 And I don't know if like a little Casper apparition of their lover appears in the boiling water,

107
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:33,480
 but I will guess that many of these women met their husbands at the Pern Ward later that night.

108
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:39,480
 And if, guys, you're getting married right now and you're listening to this podcast, hold up.

109
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,480
 I know you're about to put on your wife's shoes, because that's something we do.

110
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:51,480
 If the groom buckles the bride's left shoe on their wedding day, she will take control of the marriage.

111
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,480
 So maybe you're into that, I don't know.

112
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:59,480
 But if you're not, if you're not and you're listening to this podcast and you're in your wife's a leprechaun

113
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,480
 and you have to buckle her shoes, make sure you start with the right shoe.

114
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:08,480
 It says, it doesn't say to buckle the left shoe first or second, just don't do it.

115
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,480
 Just let her walk around with a floppy shoe for the rest of their day.

116
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,480
 Now we move to the husband and wife things. You guys are happily married.

117
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,480
 And this is where it really jumps up.

118
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,480
 This is where Jacob Grimm is like, okay, let's earn that last name.

119
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,480
 Because the first one, sure, a man got beaten to death because he didn't want to walk in between two old ladies.

120
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,480
 But, you know, the other one was fine. The court, I guess, wanted to get her face boiled off.

121
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,480
 I guess that was pretty grim. Husband and wife.

122
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:44,480
 Quote, "When a woman's neck or throat itches, then she will soon go to baptism.

123
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,480
 If her head itches, it means she will be beaten."

124
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,480
 So that's awful, right? That's quite a ramp up.

125
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,480
 You know, your throat itches, you're trying to clear your throat.

126
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,480
 Maybe you'll see a baby get dunked under water.

127
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,480
 But if your head itches, you're kind of boned.

128
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,480
 If a stranger, this is where grammar is really important. Here's another one.

129
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,480
 If a stranger looks into the parlor on a Monday morning, he, meaning the stranger,

130
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,480
 will cause the husband to beat his wife.

131
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:22,480
 So how I imagine this works is I have a house with my beautiful wife.

132
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:29,480
 And I'm walking around and she's like lounging in the chair in the parlor.

133
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,480
 And some dude walks by and looks into my parlor.

134
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,480
 I go home and beat his wife, right? Isn't that how it works?

135
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,480
 I don't think that that means I beat my wife.

136
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:46,480
 I'm not going to argue this in court. I'm like, "Your honor, German president is very clear.

137
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,480
 I was allowed to go home and beat that man's wife."

138
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,480
 They're like, "What? Are you talking about you lunatic?"

139
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,480
 So yeah, I don't think it's you beat your own wife.

140
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,480
 I'm still talking about it any other way.

141
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,480
 If a dog runs between... These are all about beating women, by the way.

142
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,480
 It's all downhill from here. I got two more to go.

143
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,480
 But if a dog runs between a woman's legs, her husband will beat her.

144
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,480
 Bizarre.

145
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,480
 And this last one, I don't know if Jacob Graham had a bubbling, boiling fetish.

146
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,480
 He's like, "Ooh, which is broom?"

147
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,480
 My favorite part of the story is going into graphic detail.

148
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,480
 Each bubble popped with deliciousness.

149
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,480
 And the brother's like, "We're going to edit this stuff out, you big old weirdo."

150
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,480
 Here's his last thing.

151
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,480
 For as long as the food continues to boil or simmer on the table,

152
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,480
 the cook will be beaten by her husband.

153
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:45,480
 Which I immediately thought, I think this is why I've never seen a German family at a Mexican restaurant.

154
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,480
 Because I can imagine someone bringing out fajitas.

155
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,480
 They're all "chssshhh" and the dude's like, "Ahhh."

156
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,480
 They're like, "Johnny, please, no, don't go with husbands running and beating up the cooks in the kitchen."

157
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,480
 The wife's like, "Oh, why do we go to these Mexican restaurants all the time?"

158
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,480
 "Why does he love fajitas so much?"

159
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,480
 Those things bubble and boil.

160
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,480
 And then you have to beat them for as long as it's sizzling.

161
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,480
 It's all "chssshhh" and it's like 10 minutes later, his arms are getting tired.

162
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,480
 He's like, "Ahhh, ahhh."

163
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,480
 I need to start working out more before I engage in these old, timey, folk tales.

164
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,480
 It goes on to say that child labor is good.

165
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,480
 If you have a shirt that's made by a girl under the age of 7, you'll get good luck.

166
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,480
 You'll be pushing old ladies over in no time.

167
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,480
 If the girl's between 5 or 7 years old who makes your shirt, it actually protects against magic.

168
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,480
 And if she's specifically a 5-year-old girl and she makes your shirt,

169
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,480
 you will receive justice in all legal proceedings.

170
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,480
 So that is some German superstitions.

171
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,480
 Hopefully they don't believe them anymore.

172
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,480
 But we will find out.

173
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,480
 We will find out.

174
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,480
 If there is a Mexican restaurant in Germany, go there.

175
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,480
 Order the fajitas.

176
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,480
 I wonder if they even have fajitas on the menu in Germany.

177
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,480
 They could just be like, "We're not cooking these anymore."

178
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,480
 All of the cooks have like big comic book-sized lumps on their heads.

179
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,480
 They're like, "No, fajitas."

180
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,480
 Klaus, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonicopter.

181
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,480
 We're leaving behind this delicious Mexican restaurant.

182
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,480
 Our arms are tired and our bellies are full of fajitas.

183
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,480
 We are headed all the way out to Australia.

184
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,480
 I said I was going to talk about this on a later episode.

185
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,480
 I'll talk about it right now.

186
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,480
 Think about it.

187
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,480
 Docs.com, a website we've used a lot on this show.

188
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,480
 One of my favorite websites to get information from, it's down.

189
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,480
 As far as I can tell, it's gone.

190
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:42,480
 Caspine Montague and the Patreon Discord was able to find some archives back in September,

191
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,480
 because I was talking about it on...

192
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,480
 We're recording a live episode right now.

193
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,480
 He pointed that out.

194
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,480
 I actually, when I find a website that is that integral to the show,

195
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,480
 I downloaded the entire website to my computer,

196
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,480
 because it just has so much great stuff.

197
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,480
 So even if the archives weren't there, I do have a...

198
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,480
 I have multiple copies of it actually on a computer and then on a hard drive.

199
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,480
 So I'm going to get in touch with the creator and see if they need a backup.

200
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,480
 But yeah, that's a huge...

201
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,480
 It's a huge...

202
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,480
 I mean, we have it backed up so we can still access it,

203
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,480
 but it's such a great site for the show.

204
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,480
 If you want to talk about obscure stories, think about it.docs.com.

205
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,480
 Is it?

206
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,480
 That just makes the work on the show so much easier.

207
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,480
 So I hope that this is just some sort of temporary blip for them.

208
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,480
 But Klaus, go ahead and bring this carbonar copter on down.

209
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,480
 March 1828, so it's still fairly old-timey.

210
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,480
 We're north of Wyngen.

211
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,480
 That's in New South Wales, Australia.

212
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,480
 Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

213
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,480
 And as the helicopter is slowing down and we're looking for a place to land,

214
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,480
 we see smoke billowing out of the ground.

215
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,480
 Like little cave opening.

216
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,480
 [Groans]

217
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,480
 Smokes coming out and then there's like, I don't know, like a daffodil

218
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,480
 and smoke surrounding the daffodil.

219
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,480
 And there's like a duck. There's a duck sitting there and smoke's coming out of his bills.

220
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,480
 The whole area is called Burning Mountain Nature Reserve.

221
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:14,480
 And what happens is a long, long time ago, this coal mine, or this, it wasn't ever even mined,

222
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,480
 underneath the ground there's a ton of coal.

223
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,480
 And 6,000 years ago a fire started and it's just never gone out.

224
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,480
 So all this coal is constantly burning and smoke is shooting out of these holes

225
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,480
 and the ground is turning red and you can walk around on it.

226
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,480
 So it's not like you're gonna get like hot feet or anything.

227
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,480
 Nowadays it's like a tourist attraction.

228
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,480
 The Aborigines thought it was a cursed place.

229
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,480
 And then there was a young man trying to make a fire by the base of the mountain

230
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,480
 and then the evil one came out of the depths and grabbed him.

231
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,480
 He couldn't get away, he's fighting, he can't break free of this creature.

232
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,480
 So he set the entire mountain on fire to warn others not to come near.

233
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,480
 And now it's a tourist destination, but yeah, so smoke comes out of the ground.

234
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,480
 All this coal is on fire.

235
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,480
 And it happened 6,000 years ago, so people never had a chance to really mine the coal.

236
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,480
 You get used to it, right?

237
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,480
 Australia is being settled in by the Europeans.

238
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,480
 They're just like, "Oh, the mountain's on fire?" Whatever.

239
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,480
 But I mean, you can't complain about it.

240
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,480
 It was like that before you got there.

241
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,480
 You're like, "Oh, I want to move. I don't want to be a prisoner anymore.

242
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,480
 I want to confess of my crimes and go back to England."

243
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,480
 Now you're a prisoner, you're stuck here.

244
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,480
 So, and then they have little prisoner babies and then Australia as it is today.

245
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,480
 Today, this mountain is still on fire.

246
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:34,480
 But in March 1828, something happened that gave the people of Wyngen a new view of the word "fire."

247
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:45,480
 A large, silvery, cigar-shaped object appeared in the afternoon sky.

248
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,480
 And all the townspeople went, "Look, look at that.

249
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,480
 Whoa, up there in the sky."

250
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,480
 It's coming down. It's landing at the burning mountain.

251
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:02,480
 And as it's landing, it sets the countryside on fire.

252
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,480
 Everyone run! Fire burning stuff.

253
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,480
 All the vegetation nearby.

254
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,480
 There goes that daffodil.

255
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,480
 All the grass trees are like, "Ugh, they're all catching on fire and stuff like that."

256
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,480
 And then cattle were like, "Maw."

257
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,480
 And they're trying to get away from it.

258
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,480
 All the fire coming off of this intensely hot UFO.

259
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,480
 [Maw]

260
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,480
 Cow burns up.

261
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,480
 Multiple cow burns up. It wasn't just one of them.

262
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,480
 But anyways, that's not the story.

263
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,480
 It's not just about how hamburgers were invented.

264
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,480
 The ship lands, all these cows are burned, all these vegetation is burned,

265
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,480
 and the people in town are like, "What happened? What is that?"

266
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,480
 A couple hours later, because what are you going to do, right?

267
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,480
 You're not going to walk up and investigate it.

268
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,480
 There's like a wall of flame around the thing.

269
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,480
 There's a bunch of dead cattle.

270
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:55,480
 You're not going to be like, "Oh, I wonder what that ship will do to my frail little human body."

271
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,480
 People just kind of stayed in town, and they were curious, obviously.

272
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,480
 They didn't just go back to work.

273
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,480
 Some of them might have.

274
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:07,480
 But a lot of people are just like, "Oh, no, that was super crazy how our entire planet got set on fire

275
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,480
 and all these animals died."

276
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,480
 So the ship is landing there, and then around town, they start to notice really tall people.

277
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,480
 Walking through town.

278
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:23,480
 That's how I imagine tall people sound when they walk.

279
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,480
 They're walking around town, and the towns people are like, "Oh, they're like hiding in their houses and stuff."

280
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:32,480
 Imagine a wild west town, little saloon doors going, "Eee, eee, eee."

281
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,480
 And the casket maker is like measuring the casket, and he's like shaking his head,

282
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,480
 because they're too tall for the caskies.

283
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,480
 Anyways, the bordello, the girls are like, "Ooh, new customers.

284
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,480
 Get in there, ladies, and earn your keep."

285
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,480
 The...

286
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,480
 Anyways, about this is a theater of the mind about an old west town.

287
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,480
 Gene Hackman shows up, shoots Leonardo DiCaprio.

288
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,480
 These tall people are walking through the town, and they don't communicate with the humans at all.

289
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,480
 There's no telepathic communication. They're not talking.

290
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,480
 All they would do is occasionally just point at something.

291
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:13,480
 And then they would start walking again.

292
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,480
 That's way... That is way more menacing, right?

293
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,480
 That's way creepier.

294
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,480
 And if they're like, "We are here for your natural resources.

295
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,480
 We are here to take some of your people and direct us to your nearest bordello.

296
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,480
 We want to see what the hot ladies are there."

297
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,480
 That would be pretty unnerving, too.

298
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,480
 But imagine just you're sitting at a McDonald's one day, you're eating your...

299
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:40,480
 You're eating your Australian made burger, and then you look out the window and there's a tall guy just pointing right at you.

300
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,480
 And then walks away. You're like, "What?"

301
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,480
 And so they're walking through the town and they're pointing at people.

302
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,480
 And around the same time that this is going on.

303
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,480
 So you have the ship that's still located there.

304
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,480
 You have the people, tall people walking through town pointing.

305
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,480
 Townspeople start to realize something.

306
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:08,480
 "Hey, did anyone see where my bucket of milk went?"

307
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,480
 "No, Jonesy, where'd you put it?"

308
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:16,480
 "I put it right here. Right here where that stranger was pointing at earlier."

309
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,480
 "Hey, Bill!"

310
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:24,480
 "You got those two cows that you were hanging out with on Friday nights?

311
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,480
 Did you have no friends?"

312
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,480
 "I don't know where they're at."

313
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:34,480
 They were right here a second ago until that tall man pointed at my cows.

314
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,480
 "Hey, hey, Peter!"

315
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,480
 "Peter?"

316
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,480
 "Huh?"

317
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,480
 "I'm walking through your house and no one's here."

318
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,480
 "There's like some coffee on the stove that was..."

319
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,480
 "Ooh, it's still warm."

320
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,480
 "But nobody is here."

321
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,480
 What had happened was as these guys were walking through town and pointing at stuff,

322
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:03,480
 around the same time things began to disappear, including cattle and humans.

323
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,480
 And then eventually...

324
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,480
 And the story just kind of ends.

325
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,480
 They don't say for sure there's no story about them getting back on the ship.

326
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,480
 They kind of left that part out.

327
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:22,480
 So I don't know if one day the guys weren't there and the ship was gone and they didn't hear it fly away.

328
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,480
 There's no story of the tall guys walking back to the ship and getting on the ship.

329
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,480
 But at some point they just left.

330
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,480
 You can't go there to take the Burning Mountain Nature Reserve and being like,

331
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,480
 "Can I see the spaceship please?"

332
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,480
 And they're like, "What are we talking about you big old weirdo?"

333
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
 So this story was...

334
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,480
 I got it from ThingAboutItDucks.com.

335
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,480
 They've never steered me wrong.

336
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,480
 They got it from the Australasian Post.

337
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,480
 The Australasian Post.

338
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,480
 Which I looked it up.

339
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,480
 It was an actual real newspaper.

340
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,480
 It started off as a real newspaper, I guess is a better way to say it.

341
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,480
 And then it became like a Maxim magazine-ish thing in like the 1940s,

342
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,480
 where it had bikini girls on the cover.

343
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,480
 And then it would run sensationalized stories,

344
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:10,480
 but it also covered stories like politics and news and sports and stuff like that.

345
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,480
 And so they did publish this story.

346
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,480
 Then a website or publication called Strange Nation covered it.

347
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,480
 And then ThingAboutItDucks.com covered it.

348
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,480
 So I think through a little bit, and I wasn't able to find...

349
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,480
 I really looked for the Australasian Post.

350
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,480
 Or I think they changed it to Aussie Post in the end.

351
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,480
 It's out of business.

352
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,480
 It went out of business in 2012, 2013.

353
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,480
 So I wasn't able to find a back issue of it.

354
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,480
 I looked around a lot to see if I could find any more information on this story to back it up.

355
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:41,480
 Because what this story really shows is the raw power of the alien invaders.

356
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,480
 We talk a lot. We've covered a lot of stuff on this story.

357
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,480
 We had the one where the KGB were like shooting at aliens and they massacred a bunch of grays.

358
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,480
 And then the tall guys got up from their command post and they just...

359
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,480
 They were bulletproof. The Russians had to leave the island.

360
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,480
 We covered that. I'll put that in the show notes.

361
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,480
 We've covered a lot of stories where people have had shootouts with aliens.

362
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:08,480
 They're fairly... I wouldn't say common, but in UFO lore, they're not super rare.

363
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,480
 But imagine facing a force that literally... like you just can't fight.

364
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,480
 The thing about these guys is...

365
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,480
 They don't even put up any force of fight.

366
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,480
 They just simply walk and point.

367
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,480
 They didn't have to threaten.

368
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,480
 They didn't have to bargain.

369
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,480
 They didn't have to kill.

370
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,480
 So when their ship landed and they destroyed their local economy,

371
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:40,480
 they just walked through and pointed at stuff, silently pointing at something.

372
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,480
 And it was gone.

373
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,480
 Now, not instantly. It's not like...

374
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,480
 He was playing "Edenimini Mimimo."

375
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,480
 There's a guy at the bar. He's like, "No, not me!"

376
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,480
 Like, he would point. You'd get pointed at.

377
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:59,480
 And like a day or two later, you vanished.

378
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,480
 We don't know how long the invaders were here for.

379
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,480
 We don't know when they left.

380
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,480
 We don't know how many people vanished, how many livestock vanished.

381
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,480
 We don't know this stuff.

382
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,480
 But it just still...

383
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,480
 Whether it was... I guess it doesn't matter if it was one cow and one human.

384
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,480
 It's still terrifying to think that these beings can be so powerful,

385
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,480
 they have to exert no real physical presence.

386
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,480
 Like reptilians have the claws shrink.

387
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,480
 And I've heard stories about like reptilian, gladiator combat, man versus reptilian,

388
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,480
 and things like that.

389
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,480
 Reptilians are constantly getting shot at and they're very muscular, clawed creatures.

390
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,480
 Graze are just big old wimps.

391
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,480
 You could snap their neck if you really thought about it.

392
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,480
 They have some sonic powers.

393
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,480
 We've talked about that in past episodes.

394
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,480
 The lyrons are the new it thing. They're the cat aliens.

395
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,480
 And the insect toys, fighting an insect would be really difficult.

396
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,480
 But again, we're talking about fighting these things.

397
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,480
 Great aliens often have, yeah, sonic powers, but they still have to exert that power on you.

398
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:04,480
 These guys did nothing but point.

399
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,480
 And you were never seen again.

400
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,480
 That's power.

401
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,480
 And I think when we talk about aliens and we fall into this...

402
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,480
 It's fun. I love researching aliens.

403
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,480
 Don't get me wrong, but we start to get trapped in these mindsets.

404
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,480
 Like, this is how we beat up a gray alien.

405
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,480
 This is how we would run away from a reptilian.

406
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:32,480
 We forget. I think we sometimes forget the power level of these things.

407
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,480
 Their ship comes down.

408
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,480
 It's not a silent glide. It's a roar.

409
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,480
 And it scorches the earth.

410
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,480
 It's like a foot stomping on an ant hive.

411
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,480
 And they just walk through town. They point.

412
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:52,480
 They get what they want with no resistance.

413
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:59,480
 We better hope that the mythology is correct, that this Illuminati mythology that the world is secretly ruled by reptilians.

414
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:05,480
 We better hope that's correct, because we have a chance against them.

415
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,480
 You're walking down the street and you see the Queen of England.

416
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,480
 You're like, "You're gonna have a bad day. Your Highness."

417
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:16,480
 Before the government of England arrested me, she supposedly a reptilian.

418
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,480
 I would not actually beat up the Queen of England.

419
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,480
 But, assuming she's a sheep, she has him getting arrested right now.

420
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,480
 I'm like, "Oh, I can subscribe."

421
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,480
 Assume she's a reptilian, right?

422
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,480
 I see this old woman first thing in the morning and I'm like, "Ha ha ha ha ha."

423
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,480
 We better hope we're fighting reptilians or grays.

424
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,480
 Because reptilians, we can beat.

425
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,480
 They have to use weapons. They have to be smart.

426
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,480
 They kidnap people and they hold them in Antarctica.

427
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,480
 They have like troop supply lines and organizations and stuff like that.

428
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,480
 They require us as a food source.

429
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,480
 These other dudes just show up in points.

430
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,480
 They don't have to assume people's shapes.

431
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,480
 They don't have to control the media and implant secret reptilian codes.

432
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,480
 Warning other reptilians of upcoming events like predictive programming.

433
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:13,480
 They just point and they get what they want.

434
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,480
 We better hope that the reptilian theory is right.

435
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,480
 Because otherwise right now, there could be a fleet headed to Earth.

436
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,480
 Australia? That was just a scouting mission.

437
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:35,480
 A fleet headed to Earth, ready to pierce our atmosphere and set the sky on fire.

438
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,480
 They will land. They will disembark.

439
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:46,480
 And they will conquer the planet simply by pointing.
