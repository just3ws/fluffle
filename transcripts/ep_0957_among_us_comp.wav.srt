1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
 A terrifying haunting at a high school reminds us that even though we think someone's head

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,320
 has been cracked open, they might still be alive.

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,280
 It's very specific advice, but it might be applicable someday to you.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,320
 And then we travel to outer space to try to figure out if we're a crewmate or an imposter

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,980
 in the popular game Among Us.

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,840
 But is the popularity of this very simple game natural?

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:35,040
 Or is Among Us actually a CIA plot to get us to vote out the unvaccinated?

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,680
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:48,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,720
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter here, I'm having a great day, hope you guys are having a great

11
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,720
 day too.

12
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,480
 Hope you guys had an awesome weekend.

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,240
 We've got a ton of stuff to cover so we're gonna get started right away walking into

14
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,560
 Dead Rabbit Command.

15
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:07,920
 Everyone get on your feet and give a warm round of applause to Colin M. Woohoo!

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,440
 Yeah, come on in Colin M. Come on in and look it.

17
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,400
 He brought a guest with him.

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,280
 A super sexy alien, huh?

19
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,280
 If you guys were wondering what I'm talking about and you can't see the cover art for

20
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:29,080
 today's episode, for my birthday Colin sent me a statue of a sexy grey alien, I gotta

21
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,080
 admit.

22
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,880
 I might betray humanity.

23
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:37,880
 For this level of alien booty, very very sexy alien, I'm gonna make sure that she appears

24
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,560
 in our live streams coming up.

25
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,160
 Like please don't Jason, it's bad enough to see him looking at the photo.

26
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,960
 Actually I don't know yet, am I gonna take a photo from the front or the photo from behind?

27
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,960
 She's quite sexy.

28
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,800
 I guess I shouldn't out myself with so much as an alien pervert.

29
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,240
 This is your first episode, but if you've listened to the show long enough you know

30
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,360
 that I'm truly an alien pervert.

31
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,760
 Colin you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode, if you guys can't expose my

32
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,840
 fetishes, that's okay too.

33
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,200
 Just help spread the word about this show that really, really really helps out a lot.

34
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,000
 Now Colin, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,920
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

36
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:22,800
 Give us all the way out to Newport Beach, California.

37
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,280
 Nice leisurely drive down to Sunny Sunny Newport Beach.

38
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,120
 Specifically we're gonna head out to Newport Harbor High School.

39
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,440
 Now at Newport Harbor High School, there's a building known as Robbins Hall and that's

40
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,440
 where war headed.

41
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,960
 So put on your Letterman's jacket, grab your backpack.

42
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,080
 We're basically pretending to be high school students and we're all these people walking

43
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,080
 around.

44
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,800
 Clearly we're adults but they have really bad security there.

45
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,440
 We're walking around, we go into Robbins Hall and it's just a series of classrooms like

46
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,360
 most buildings on a high school campus, who would it be?

47
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,920
 But Robbins Hall also is home to Loats Theater.

48
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,600
 We walk in, we're like oh look at what great stage plays could be performed here.

49
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,440
 You could probably do some Hamlet.

50
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,440
 You could probably do Cats.

51
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,240
 They probably just do high school musical over and over again.

52
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,880
 But we're walking around this theater.

53
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,240
 It's actually quite grand, a 700 seat theater.

54
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:20,600
 Now in its heyday, this would be the place you'd go to watch a play and to sit in the

55
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,120
 cheering section of the playhouse.

56
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,080
 But over time it began to get invested with rats.

57
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,920
 There was rats everywhere, cockroaches everywhere.

58
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,160
 They toured the building down in 2007.

59
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,000
 It doesn't exist anymore.

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,800
 However, there was a time when it did.

61
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:43,760
 And when this theater was there, it racked up like all theaters seem to across the country

62
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,640
 and I'm assuming across the world.

63
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:51,040
 Loats Theater also had a ghost story associated with it.

64
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,600
 One day these three boys broke into the school.

65
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,320
 They're like it's our summer break.

66
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,320
 Woo!

67
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,320
 What are we gonna do?

68
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,320
 Let's go to school.

69
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,560
 They broke into the school to drink.

70
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,760
 Which I figure you know you're probably out of prionizer.

71
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,280
 I didn't say how old these kids are but I'm figuring like teenagers or I don't think they're

72
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,200
 like third graders or anything like that.

73
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,840
 Three kids are sitting there drinking in Loats Theater and they're on stage.

74
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,760
 They're goofing off, it's dark and they're drunk.

75
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,760
 It's a bad combination.

76
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,160
 Well two of the boys fall off of the stage.

77
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,000
 This is actually kind of hilarious.

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,680
 I'm probably the worst person to talk about kids dying and becoming ghosts because I always

79
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,320
 find it so funny.

80
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,160
 These two teenage boys are goofing off on stage.

81
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,440
 They're drunk.

82
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,360
 They both fall off the stage and crack their heads open when they hit the ground.

83
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,080
 Now stages can be fairly high.

84
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,040
 They're normally not like two stories or anything like that but you're talking about like you

85
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,080
 try falling off to defend these idiots now.

86
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:56,520
 You try falling 10 feet into an orchestra pit or just onto the hard ground of that front

87
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,080
 row of chairs.

88
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,680
 Both of these guys fall off and they both crack their heads open and they're both laying

89
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,120
 in the darkness going...

90
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,360
 Well probably not saying anything right.

91
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,560
 Their brains are smashed.

92
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,240
 They're probably not talking at all but who knows.

93
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,520
 They're laying there and the third dude is so scared by what happens when he sees his

94
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,640
 two friends fall in the darkness and fall off stage and smash their heads into the ground.

95
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,320
 He takes off running.

96
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,680
 Not running to go get help.

97
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,320
 Not running to a pay phone to call 911.

98
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,280
 He just went home.

99
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,280
 He just went home.

100
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,280
 He just went home.

101
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,280
 He just went home.

102
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,280
 He just went home.

103
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,280
 He just went home.

104
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,280
 He just went home.

105
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,280
 He just went home.

106
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,280
 He just went home.

107
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,280
 He just went home.

108
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,280
 He just went home.

109
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,280
 He just went home.

110
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,280
 He just went home.

111
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,280
 He just went home.

112
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,280
 He just went home.

113
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,280
 He just went home.

114
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,280
 He just went home.

115
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,280
 He just went home.

116
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,280
 He just went home.

117
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,280
 He just went home.

118
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,280
 He just went home.

119
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,280
 He just went home.

120
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,280
 He just went home.

121
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,280
 He just went home.

122
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,280
 He just went home.

123
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,280

 He just went home.

127
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,280
 He just went home.

128

 He just went home.

129
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,280
 He just went home.

130
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,280
 He just went home.

131
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,280

 He just went home.

299
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,280
 He just went home.

300
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,280
 He just went home.

301
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
 He just went home.

302
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,280
 He just went home.

303
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,280
 He's probably going to go get help.

304
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,920
 And as you're sitting there bleeding next to your buddy and his blood's like pooling

305
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,280
 and it's like making a bigger puddle of blood.

306
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,000
 Happy Halloween, guys!

307
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,280
 You and your friends' blood is like pooling together and making an even bigger pool.

308
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:14,320
 You'd be laying there in the darkness and after 20 minutes, then 50 minutes, and then

309
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,600
 two hours, you're waiting for your friend to come back with help and you're just laying

310
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,280
 there in the darkness going, "Where is he?"

311
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:30,920
 Like, I could literally see that being somebody's last words, right?

312
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,720
 They're waiting for their friend to come back with help.

313
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,720
 He never did.

314
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,920
 He never told anyone that this had happened.

315
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,920
 It's a terrifying story.

316
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,560
 I mean, like really, when you step back, you put your bagel down and you think about it.

317
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:50,000
 Like, I could imagine someone's only hope, just ditching them and you're just waiting

318
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,160
 for them until eventually you bleed out, right?

319
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,660
 Terrifying story, terrifying ghost story.

320
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,920
 We don't know how much of it's true.

321
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,120
 The theater's been torn down now.

322
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,960
 That has never stopped hauntings, though.

323
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,960
 We've covered stories.

324
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:09,640
 I always try to remember exactly where this took place, but there was a three-story building

325
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,400
 that had a haunting on the third floor.

326
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,560
 They ended up demolishing the building and building a two-story building and you can

327
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,160
 still hear the haunting, but like you can hear it a couple feet above the roof of the

328
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,440
 new two-story building.

329
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,400
 So simply by demolishing the building, wouldn't get rid of the ghost if it happened in the

330
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,400
 first place, right?

331
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,840
 Like, I'm gonna find any proof of this, but a scary way to start off another spooky week

332
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,360
 of the month of October.

333
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,720
 Call in M. Let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Carbentercopter.

334
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,200
 We are leaving behind Newport Harbor High School.

335
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,160
 Take us all the way out to deep space.

336
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:49,560
 [imitates carbenter]

337
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,600
 Maybe we're gonna meet some sexy aliens.

338
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,320
 I don't know while we're up there.

339
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,560
 You never know what's gonna happen on an episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

340
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:04,640
 We're headed into deep space because we're about to board the ship known as the Skelb.

341
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:10,760
 That is the ship that is world famous among elementary school students, world-round, as

342
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,080
 to where the game Among Us takes place.

343
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,280
 Or one of the maps.

344
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,280
 The Skelb is a ship.

345
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,440
 If you guys aren't familiar with Among Us, you guys are just waking up from a coma because

346
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,840
 you split your head falling off of a stage.

347
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
 Among Us is a video game.

348
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:30,080
 Among Us is a video game and it's basically the movie the thing in video game format.

349
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,280
 I guess there's also like card games or party games called like Mafia and Werewolves attacking

350
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,280
 me or whatever.

351
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,580
 Stuff like that, but Among Us is basically you have let's say eight people.

352
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:45,320
 You have six people who are trying to repair the ship and then you have one or two imposters

353
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,920
 that are killing the other players.

354
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,600
 So it's kind of like a mystery game where you come across by, I don't even know why I'm

355
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
 bothering explaining this.

356
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,160
 I think everybody knows what Among Us is.

357
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:01,360
 Anyways, the video game Among Us, it came out, this is very interesting conspiracy theory

358
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:09,320
 because this is one of those ones that I think we can argue on the details, but there might

359
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,320
 be something here.

360
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,820
 I think we can argue, not on the details, I think we can argue on the motive.

361
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,820
 Let's take a look at this.

362
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,100
 Among Us, it's a video game.

363
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,260
 It's about paranoia.

364
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,140
 It's about not knowing who to trust.

365
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,540
 Everybody looks the same.

366
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:28,540
 Everybody can act the same, but you have a murderer among you whose only goal is to kill

367
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,460
 off everybody and take control.

368
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,260
 But is there a darker conspiracy behind this game Among Us?

369
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,940
 It is one of the biggest games in the world.

370
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:42,440
 Is there something more maniacal pushing this game into the forefront?

371
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:48,160
 Was it just an accidental success like we see sometimes in the world of entertainment?

372
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,120
 Or was this government planned propaganda?

373
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,840
 Let's go ahead and take a look at this new conspiracy theory that I just saw on the

374
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,740
 export the other day.

375
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,180
 The theory is this.

376
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:05,080
 You had the COVID-19 pandemic really starting to hit the national headlines in March of

377
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,080
 2020.

378
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,620
 I think it was in the headlines before that, but that's when like, first it was like, "Oh,

379
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,620
 new disease, whatever.

380
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,100
 How many of these pop up a year or two?

381
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,500
 Oh, I can't leave my house?

382
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
 Like, this is new.

383
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,580
 Like, I've lived through swine flus and bird flus, but I was just, you know, like, walking

384
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,180
 around, I was walking around, eating pigs and eating chickens.

385
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,780
 But now I can't leave my house.

386
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,860
 Like, it really started making waves in 2020.

387
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:32,520
 And the conspiracy theory is this, is that the powers that be said, "Okay, here's the

388
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,520
 game plan."

389
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,220
 I'm so glad I'm not on YouTube anymore because if I was on YouTube, I would just know this

390
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,340
 video would get, I'd get hassled with this video.

391
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:46,420
 But to Spotify, who also likes to rattle my cage, this is not my conspiracy theory.

392
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,420
 Okay.

393
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,060
 Simply reporting on it.

394
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,740
 The powers that be, the government, the new world order, the Illuminati, whatever you

395
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:57,180
 want to call them said, "Okay, we've now done stage one.

396
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,980
 We've released this disease that we created.

397
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,520
 Stage two is we want everyone to get this vaccination."

398
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,840
 We probably should have started with promoting something like that.

399
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,520
 I don't know why we're waiting so long.

400
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,440
 But anyways, we've released this disease.

401
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,000
 It's all over the world now.

402
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,720
 Now we want people to take the vaccination.

403
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,760
 How do we get people to get a vaccination, right?

404
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,000
 We're having people put something in their arm that really, they're going to be nervous

405
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 about.

406
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,880
 It hasn't gone through long-term tests.

407
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:32,340
 So somebody in this powerful group of people said, "How about we find a video game, specifically

408
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,340
 a video game?"

409
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,420
 This conspiracy says it wasn't about finding music or movies or predictive programming.

410
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:45,380
 They said, "What if we found a video game that started retraining people's brains to

411
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:49,820
 look at other people suspiciously?"

412
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:57,820
 And we use this game to start to program people to say the majority of people are the vaccinated

413
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:02,000
 ones who are vaccinated against this COVID-19 disease.

414
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,440
 And the people who don't get vaccinated are literal monsters who, by simply being around

415
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,320
 us, can kill us in any moment.

416
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,160
 In short, ladies and gentlemen, they'd be sus.

417
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:23,960
 I'm CIA and the Illuminati and everyone's clapping.

418
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,940
 So they decided to do this.

419
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,180
 They decided to take a video game to promote this ideology.

420
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,140
 And they happened to find the perfect one.

421
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,140
 They didn't...

422
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:40,180
 The conspiracy theory is not that the government created among us, is that they started looking

423
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,740
 for a game and the game they found was Among Us, which had come out in 2018.

424
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,840
 And that game has a really interesting pedigree.

425
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,000
 It was created by a small group of people called InnerSloth, that's the name of their

426
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 gaming company.

427
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,800
 It came out in 2018, it was an app, and it was a total bomb.

428
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,120
 At a certain point, they were like, "Why are we even doing updates to this game?"

429
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,880
 They were losing money on the game.

430
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,760
 I was reading this Wikipedia article and they were saying, "We had enough money in savings

431
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,440
 that let us keep going, but the game wasn't selling.

432
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,600
 We weren't making any money from the game."

433
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,980
 However, we had a super dedicated fan base.

434
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:22,340
 They said their concurrent players at any one time back in 2018 when the game first

435
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:26,780
 came out was only 30 to 50 people.

436
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,340
 They really, really liked the game, so we kept pushing updates and fixing bugs and stuff

437
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,300
 like that, but we're like, "Wow, this game is not taking off at all."

438
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:39,620
 And it doesn't until mid-2020.

439
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:45,880
 Now the conspiracy theory is that the powers that be found this game.

440
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,860
 They found a game that nobody was playing and they went to InnerSloth and they said,

441
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,720
 "We will give you the capital.

442
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,520
 We're going to give you this massive cash influx."

443
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,600
 However, we want you to make some changes to the game.

444
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,960
 One of those changes was that the original version of Among Us had no sound effects.

445
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,280
 And InnerSloth, the company said, "We didn't have sound effects because we didn't want

446
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,280
 to give away."

447
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,260
 Like if something was happening in another room, if you heard the sound effect, then

448
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,860
 you would know that someone just got killed over there and you could run over there.

449
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:20,300
 So originally the game had no sound effects, which is funny because nowadays all the sound

450
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,300
 effects in the game are iconic.

451
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:27,020
 The theme song, the sound of the doors, the sound of the killings, the heads getting chopped

452
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:31,620
 off, they go, "We want you to put in these sound effects."

453
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,340
 That's one of the things we want you to put in the sound effects.

454
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:39,320
 And according to this conspiracy theory, the sound effects were, quote, "MK Ultra

455
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,280
 Audio Bites."

456
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,720
 So these weren't just random sound effects that were being generated by the studio or

457
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,240
 they were getting to license or anything like that.

458
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,800
 These were actually given to them by the government.

459
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,040
 The sound effects, again, here's the thing, I've never heard an MK Ultra Audio Bits.

460
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,080
 So I mean, for all I know, this is how they programmed Britney Spears.

461
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,060
 They made her listen to doors opening for hours and hours and hours.

462
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,060
 Who knows, right?

463
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:10,260
 But anyway, so that's part of the conspiracy theory that the sound effects are actually

464
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:15,180
 MK Ultra Audio Bites, which I mean, if that's the case, then I guess they're using 8-bit

465
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,580
 sounds to do all this stuff.

466
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,380
 But they promised, interstil off a ton of money, they said, "Listen, we want to use

467
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,540
 this game because it's all about paranoia.

468
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:26,580
 It's all about punishing the people who aren't part of the majority."

469
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:32,320
 Because again, the crewmates always outnumber the imposters and it's the goal of the crewmates

470
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:38,280
 to vote out, to get rid of the dangerous people among them.

471
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:43,480
 That's why they called it that.

472
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,480
 Then you have that done, right?

473
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,960
 So they go to interstil off and they say, "Hey, we're going to pay you a ton of money.

474
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,120
 Get this game fixed up.

475
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:55,600
 Put in some new party hats and you need to put in these MK Ultra Audio Bites."

476
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,700
 The other part of this thing, because that's a super fascinating conspiracy theory, right?

477
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,780
 I don't know if it holds any water.

478
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,780
 Probably doesn't.

479
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,280
 I read it on the X-word last night.

480
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,940
 A couple of people, we'll get to that.

481
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,500
 A couple of people talked about it too, but everyone's anonymous.

482
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,940
 Who knows what's the truth?

483
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,260
 Interesting conspiracy theory, but that would only be half of it, right?

484
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:20,300
 You can have the CIA or MK Ultra groups or Illuminati or whatever create something.

485
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,660
 The question is, can you sell it?

486
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,660
 That's always the big thing.

487
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,800
 I see music videos all the time with full of satanic Illuminati imagery.

488
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,800
 They totally flop.

489
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,520
 I can name artists you would have no idea who Ivy LeVon was.

490
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,520
 You're like, "Who?"

491
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,520
 Who?

492
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,720
 But I mean, if the Illuminati thing is true, her video's full of it.

493
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,480
 She has this video called Biscuit where she keeps talking about you going down on her.

494
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,920
 And it's the weirdest thing.

495
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,760
 I think maybe once a month I watch this video, because it's so bizarre.

496
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,820
 I'll get back to the amongst thing.

497
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:02,620
 But Ivy LeVon is all full of the satanic imagery, and yet every so often a little biscuit shows

498
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:07,580
 up with arms and legs like an egg McMuffin minus the egg and it's dancing.

499
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,820
 And she's like, "Kiss my biscuit.

500
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,340
 Kiss my biscuit.

501
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,340
 Kiss my biscuit."

502
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,340
 And I'm like, "What?"

503
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:17,780
 I remember when I first saw it like 10 years ago, I go, "What in the world is this?

504
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,940
 This is like pure Illuminati."

505
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:24,160
 I might have even seen it on Vigilant Citizen, which always goes over these music videos

506
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,640
 and shows all the Illuminati symbolism, but she's gone nowhere with her career.

507
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,800
 I mean, she's a lovely woman.

508
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
 Her music is fine.

509
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,920
 I don't necessarily want to kiss your biscuit.

510
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,960
 But you can put all this Illuminati stuff in that.

511
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,760
 You can have all this government-controlled stuff.

512
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,880
 If that's true, I mean, again, she could just really be in a witch and have this spooky imagery.

513
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,380
 But what I'm saying is like, you can create, if the government creates a product that doesn't

514
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,700
 necessarily mean it's going to sell.

515
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,460
 Doesn't necessarily mean people are going to buy what you have.

516
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,860
 So you need to do the other thing.

517
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:05,480
 So Inner Sloth now has this, allegedly, has this infusion of cash from these dark forces

518
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,480
 of the government.

519
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:12,500
 I know I keep using these words kind of interchangeably, CIA, and the powers that be.

520
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,660
 Next step is to sell it.

521
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,080
 But the game had been out since 2018.

522
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,960
 You couldn't really market it as a new game.

523
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,780
 People would know about it.

524
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,920
 So what they did is they really did the best thing they could do.

525
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,520
 They began to pay off streamers.

526
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,120
 They began to locate Twitch streamers.

527
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,120
 That's not hard to locate, right?

528
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,620
 You know exactly where they're at.

529
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,620
 They have channels.

530
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:36,120
 And you said, "Listen, we're going to pay you X amount of money and you're going to play

531
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,800
 this game and you're going to talk about how awesome it is."

532
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,000
 Now that happens, right?

533
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,120
 That already happens.

534
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,700
 Other companies all watch Omerekker a lot playing games.

535
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,980
 And a lot of times they'll be like, "Hey, this company wants me to play this game."

536
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,220
 And he's like, "Wee!

537
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,180
 This game is so awesome!"

538
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,420
 You know, because you're getting paid to play the game.

539
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,620
 It's a way to advertise your game.

540
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,180
 But again, Inner Sloth had been around.

541
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,460
 This game was losing money.

542
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,340
 And then all of a sudden you have all these streamers playing it.

543
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,620
 And the idea is they weren't paying streamers to play it.

544
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:09,340
 Some other group was.

545
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:15,720
 And so in August really, it was July, August of 2020 is when among us just skyrocketed

546
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,440
 in popularity.

547
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,640
 Everyone was playing this game.

548
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,760
 It was being played by all the major streamers.

549
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,360
 It became a hit.

550
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:32,440
 And the whole purpose of this was ramping up to the release of the vaccine.

551
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:39,320
 And it was all set up to brainwash people into not only getting the COVID-19 vaccine,

552
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:44,980
 but to hating those who don't.

553
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,420
 It's an interesting conspiracy theory.

554
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,420
 I just saw it pop up.

555
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,940
 It's not the only one.

556
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,940
 It's not the only one.

557
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:55,700
 It's funny, as I was getting ready to record this episode, I was talking to St. Strand.

558
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,940
 He was in the live chat.

559
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,780
 We do the live episodes on Sunday.

560
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:06,500
 And he said that he had heard another conspiracy theory linked to among us as well, that it

561
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:12,280
 was all setting us up for the election, the 2020 election, specifically voting people

562
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,600
 out.

563
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,600
 You know what?

564
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:19,560
 The whole thing was to train people to, for you to win, you have to vote people out.

565
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,320
 So it's training people to go, "Let's get rid of Trump."

566
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,320
 We got to vote him out.

567
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,000
 You don't win the game by voting people in.

568
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,480
 You win the game by voting people out.

569
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,600
 And so it doesn't matter what candidate we run against.

570
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,600
 Trump, if we can program an entire generation of people to win by voting out, then we can

571
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,980
 win this election.

572
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,820
 These are all really interesting conspiracy theories, right?

573
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,340
 And then there's some less interesting ones.

574
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:49,460
 Also on this same post someone said that Five Nights at Freddy's was designed to make people

575
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,340
 want to have sex with furry robots.

576
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,340
 Okay.

577
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,340
 So now I can.

578
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,220
 Like, I don't know anything about that conspiracy theory.

579
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,940
 But again, eventually people just, it's, it's, whenever you look at conspiracy theories,

580
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,820
 they tend to get goofier and goofier the more you look at them.

581
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,020
 But anyways, we have two conspiracy theories here.

582
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:10,600
 The first one is, was Among Us designed to get people to not only get the vaccine for

583
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:15,200
 COVID-19, but to hate people who don't?

584
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,960
 It's a super interesting conspiracy theory.

585
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:23,640
 I personally don't feel it holds a lot of water because Among Us is a totally different age

586
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,120
 group of who was originally getting the vaccine or those first waves of vaccine.

587
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:33,100
 Like you couldn't, you couldn't design a game that would turn off boomers more than Among

588
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,860
 Us.

589
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,860
 And yet they did.

590
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,860
 Like, you know what I mean?

591
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:42,720
 Like if the vaccine was, if those first waves of vaccine were targeted at kids and teens

592
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,800
 and young adults when they weren't, they were targeted at people my age and older.

593
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:51,220
 Like you need to get it now or you're going to die.

594
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:56,280
 Like that was that first wave of vaccines and it was all for like public service workers

595
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,900
 and healthcare workers and airline.

596
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,680
 I actually think the airline pilots thing came later.

597
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,600
 But in the beginning it was like, you work with the public, you have to get this.

598
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,980
 If you want a certain job with the government, you have to get this.

599
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:13,500
 And it was people who were so far removed from the Among Us game by age, by interest level

600
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,640
 that I don't think it really holds water.

601
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:23,120
 As far as that goes.

602
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:28,540
 I know nowadays that younger people do get vaccinated, but that's not the conspiracy

603
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,540
 theory.

604
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:34,340
 The conspiracy theory is that it was getting ready for vaccinations in whole.

605
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,900
 And I don't think that it did that.

606
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:42,580
 Again, that game was targeted so young that I just don't get that.

607
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:48,940
 But I think the conspiracy theory is interesting in the, oh, and let me give InnerSloth a little

608
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,940
 more credit too.

609
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:54,240
 And actually, like I said, I was reading about InnerSloth, they actually did lay this out.

610
00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:00,840
 They said, yeah, our game was not selling well until the streaming community took it.

611
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:06,920
 And they said, and really it happened in Mexico, South Korea and Brazil first.

612
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,980
 The streamer, they said the game was always more popular in those countries than it was

613
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,880
 in the United States.

614
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,460
 Streamers in those countries started streaming it.

615
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:21,660
 And then late into the game, you had a U.S. streamer called Soda Poppin in July.

616
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,500
 He started playing it and then other people started playing it.

617
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:30,300
 And I remember, I was watching the Among Us stuff and I was thinking this is a really

618
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:37,180
 good game for COVID because again, in July, August, September of 2020, people were still

619
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:41,140
 really iffy about being around other people, social distancing.

620
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,140
 What can you do?

621
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,620
 Schools were shut down.

622
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,580
 And this was a game you could get on where you could be with your friends.

623
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,220
 It was a social interaction game.

624
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,820
 It was a party game.

625
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:53,500
 So actually, like watching the streams and watching these people have fun, watching my

626
00:26:53,500 --> 00:27:00,020
 virtual friends hang out, I understood the appeal of it and I can understand why specifically

627
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:04,740
 kids and young adults, you know, teenagers were in on it because their social network

628
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,860
 had been completely destroyed.

629
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,940
 You had people still working and maybe they were working from home and stuff like that,

630
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,180
 but the kids, they had nothing.

631
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,560
 Their schools were all shut down.

632
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,900
 So I understood like from a social aspect why the game was so popular.

633
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:22,820
 But going back to the conspiracy theory, I don't really agree that it was a push for

634
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:27,820
 the COVID vaccine because I just don't think the age groups line up.

635
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:36,100
 However, if we want to put on our conspiracy caps, it may be a push for something because

636
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,740
 it did come out of nowhere.

637
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,540
 And again, I was surprised to find out that the game was a couple of years old because

638
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:50,520
 that's very, very rare that a game starts off a dud for two years and then becomes a

639
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,520
 huge hit.

640
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,520
 Just say the same thing.

641
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,520
 It's hard for movies to do that.

642
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,720
 It's hard for albums to do that.

643
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,160
 Unless it's like from an artist, like a classic artist who put in an album that bombed in

644
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,640
 the 70s and then it's rediscovered in the 90s.

645
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:08,880
 That type of stuff does happen or you have an artist like Meatloaf who blows up in the

646
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,660
 late 80s and then all of his old stuff becomes good again.

647
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,980
 Not good again, but people go back and rediscover it.

648
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,660
 You have stuff like that, but there's usually some sort of spark.

649
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:21,980
 It sure could have been the people streaming the game in Brazil and South Korea and Mexico,

650
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:24,580
 but it's rare.

651
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,020
 It's rare that this happens.

652
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:29,300
 Not impossible, but it's rare.

653
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:35,980
 It could be that the game is designed for something.

654
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:43,800
 It definitely is something that I think some sort of other group entity would want to put

655
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,280
 its weight behind.

656
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,960
 But I just don't know what.

657
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,280
 I don't know what it could be.

658
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,440
 I do kind of like that idea that it was about voting somebody out.

659
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,480
 But even then the game skews so young.

660
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,680
 It's not like that seventh grader's going to be like, "I hope I get to vote this election."

661
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,680
 Because they didn't.

662
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,000
 They didn't get to vote the election.

663
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,420
 There's no doubt in my mind that a lot of our entertainment is funded by government entities

664
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:16,540
 or groups that have a unstated purpose to us.

665
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,980
 They know it, but they're not telling us.

666
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:23,300
 I do think, and people could say this is a conspiracy theory, I do think though that

667
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:27,380
 there is a connection, there's a through line between the war movies of the 50s, 60s, and

668
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,980
 70s, the war cartoons like G.I.

669
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:33,860
 Joe and Transformers and stuff like that, the 80s and the 90s, and then the first person

670
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:37,840
 shooters of the early 2000s to today.

671
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,040
 I think it, I do honestly believe that the government encourages that type of media to

672
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:48,880
 be created and helps disseminate it to create the new generation of future soldiers.

673
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,760
 It's the reason why the U.S. government will work with Michael Bay to make a Transformers

674
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,760
 movie.

675
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,760
 You're like, "Why do they care?"

676
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,400
 Yeah, Michael Bay has a bunch of American flags in his shots, but why are they giving

677
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,280
 him jets?

678
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:03,840
 And a lot of the military in the Transformer movies, specifically those first three, you

679
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,460
 see, are active duty military.

680
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:10,260
 Why is the U.S. military helping out these Transformers movies?

681
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,860
 Because it gets people to sign up, it makes war look cool.

682
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,860
 And I like those movies.

683
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,860
 I like G.I.

684
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,860
 Joe, I like first person shooters.

685
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,180
 I'm not sitting on a pedestal saying all this stuff is bad.

686
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:24,500
 I enjoy all that entertainment too, but I also feel I know what the motivation is behind

687
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,500
 it.

688
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,820
 It's not just, "Let's create some cool entertainment."

689
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:32,140
 I do believe the government does make those things and encourage those things to create

690
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:38,160
 the new generation of fighting soldiers.

691
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,200
 And among us though, it would be a more sinister thing.

692
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,680
 I guess going war and blowing up people is pretty sinister too if you're on the other

693
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,920
 side.

694
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,280
 But among us is all about, it's not about, you know, G.I.

695
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,680
 Joe is saying the other is this terrorist organization trying to destroy peace around

696
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,680
 the world.

697
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,840
 Among us is, you don't know who the bad guy is.

698
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,840
 They want to blow you up.

699
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,960
 They want to take over the ship.

700
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,340
 They want to destroy peace as well.

701
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,300
 But they look exactly like you.

702
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:08,460
 They act exactly like you until they eat you.

703
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:12,940
 And the main strategy of the game is to lie to your friend's face.

704
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,700
 If you're playing with your friends, which is the way the game I think is kind of designed

705
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:25,020
 to be played, people that you know very well, you have to lie to them and convince them

706
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,260
 you're not the imposter.

707
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,540
 So why would, if this conspiracy theory is true, why would the government do that?

708
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:35,280
 Why would the government or some sort of shadowy organization want to promote you lying to

709
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,960
 your friends?

710
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:43,520
 And I think the answer really is simple when you state it like that, is that I think every

711
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:48,920
 government benefits from a paranoid population.

712
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:54,920
 Not paranoid against the government, not Mel Gibson from conspiracy theory, but paranoid

713
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,240
 against each other.

714
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,060
 Right?

715
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:03,460
 If you can't trust your best friend, you guys are playing a video game and he lies to you

716
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:09,100
 and he tricks you and you lose, sure, you're just like, "Oh man, you got me.

717
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,260
 I totally believed you."

718
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,740
 But I think that does put a little wrinkle in your brain.

719
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:21,840
 I think it actually does over time make you trust your friend less.

720
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,840
 Because this isn't a party.

721
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,740
 I mean, I keep calling it a party game, but you know, a party game, I went over to some

722
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:30,600
 buddy's house a couple years ago and they had this card game called Secret Hitler.

723
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:36,000
 We sat around the table and we played it twice and then we went and like drank an eight chips

724
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,780
 and listened to music.

725
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:42,780
 People spent hours playing among us.

726
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:48,960
 Hours lying to people, being fooled, right?

727
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,000
 Being tricked by someone you trusted explicitly.

728
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,600
 Because before you guys started playing the game, you guys were talking about movies and

729
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,600
 stuff like that.

730
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,540
 You played the game, you guys are probably going to be playing Warhammer or something

731
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,540
 like that.

732
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:06,980
 But while you're playing that game two, three hours, you're being lied to and you're lying

733
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:12,940
 to people who in any other situation, you would trust them explicitly.

734
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:21,100
 But now you're in a game where you're lying to them and you're trying to fool them.

735
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:25,320
 And when you succeed, their trust level of you goes down.

736
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,960
 If it was a party game you played once a year, it wouldn't affect you.

737
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,920
 But if it's a game you're playing over and over and over and over and you're getting

738
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:38,360
 better and better and better at it, it will change the dynamic.

739
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:42,320
 It may not even be noticeable at first, right?

740
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,840
 But over time, you would stop trusting your friend.

741
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,600
 And when it came down to something when your friend said, "Hey, no, no, no, you got to

742
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,400
 trust me."

743
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:57,900
 Even though you know Among Us is just a game, you would think, "Maybe."

744
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,500
 And you may not even be able to connect to you.

745
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,000
 You may, I don't think you would logically say, "Well, listen, you're telling me to

746
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,460
 trust you right now, but you lied to me three months ago when we were playing Among Us.

747
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,660
 I don't think you could connect it like that."

748
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:13,420
 But I think it would do something to the trust center of your brain.

749
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:17,700
 And you would go, "Your best friends would have become less trustworthy."

750
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:22,560
 You would become less trustworthy to them, because the way to win is to become the best

751
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,500
 liar possible.

752
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,480
 So it may not be a conspiracy theory to get us to take the COVID vaccine, because that's

753
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,480
 done.

754
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,960
 That whole, like, that's pretty much done.

755
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,080
 Everyone who wanted the vaccine's gotten it, and it's pretty much over.

756
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,760
 The mandates are gone, everything.

757
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,280
 People don't even make you show your card now when you walk around.

758
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,280
 Like, that's over with.

759
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,760
 But the game's still running strong.

760
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,660
 The 2020 election, it's over with.

761
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:52,460
 The game's still running strong.

762
00:34:52,460 --> 00:35:00,300
 But a game that inspires you to not trust your neighbor, to not trust your best friend,

763
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:07,940
 and to also look at your best friend and lie straight to their face.

764
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:16,160
 You both deceive and are deceived, build a paranoid society.

765
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:21,200
 Not paranoid at the machinations behind the halls of power.

766
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:26,480
 Not paranoid at the conspiracy theories that threaten to control the entire world.

767
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:34,040
 But paranoid of the people who you spend every single day with.

768
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,880
 That doesn't just sound like any old video game.

769
00:35:37,880 --> 00:36:03,700
 That sounds like a blueprint to slowly take over the world.

770
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:18,280
