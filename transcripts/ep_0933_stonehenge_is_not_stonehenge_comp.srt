00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,500
 When a young man lays down for a nap and wakes up with a severe pain in a delicate part of the body,

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:16,500
 he's forced to ask himself, "Is this the work of aliens or just random perverts?"

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,500
 And then we take a look at the conspiracy theory that will enrage Druids the world around.

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,000
 Is it possible that Stonehenge was built in the 1950s?

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,500
 [Music]

7
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,500
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,500
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,500
 Hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing.

10
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,500
 We got a lot of stuff to cover so let's go ahead and get started right away.

11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,500
 First off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

12
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,500
 Everyone give it up for our newest Patreon supporter,

13
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,500
 Natalie Peterson. Wooo! Yeah, come on in Natalie.

14
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,500
 Come on into Dead Rabbit Command. I'm so happy to have you here.

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,500
 Natalie, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

16
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,500
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it. Trust me, I do.

17
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,500
 Just help spread the word about the show that really, really, really helps out a lot.

18
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,500
 I got a lot of new Patreons over my summer break and Natalie is one of them.

19
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,500
 I gotta be honest, Natalie, you dodged a bullet.

20
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,500
 You may think you're in an episode where a guy keeps waking up with anus pain.

21
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,500
 That's bad luck for being a new Patreon.

22
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,500
 There is an episode coming up. I don't know if it's this week or next week.

23
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,500
 But whatever Patreon has to be part of that episode, their name will live on in infamy.

24
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,500
 So don't look so glum that you're in this one.

25
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,500
 I know you're like, "What? I hate Stonehenge."

26
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,500
 So that story is actually really interesting.

27
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,500
 But before we get to the really interesting story,

28
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,500
 Natalie, I'm going to toss you the Hair Hang glider.

29
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,500
 We're going to jump off the highest point of Dead Rabbit Command.

30
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,500
 And we're going to glide all the way out to some dude's house.

31
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:02,500
 [Dude's house sounds]

32
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,500
 We're going to this guy's house online.

33
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,500
 He goes by the handle "Individual targeted."

34
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,500
 So yeah, this is a gangstalking story.

35
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,500
 This is a gangstalking story, through and through.

36
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,500
 But the question is, who's gangstalking this guy?

37
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,500
 You're like, "There's nobody. These people aren't saying."

38
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,500
 That's the point. No one's gangstalking him.

39
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,500
 Yeah, but this guy has an interesting spin on this mental illness.

40
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,500
 He doesn't know if he's being gangstalked by humans,

41
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,500
 or by our not-so-friendly visitors from above.

42
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,500
 We're going to walk into this dude's house.

43
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,500
 We're the gangstalkers. We've added ourselves. Hello?

44
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,500
 We're going to walk into this dude's house,

45
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,500
 and we're going to go ahead and call this guy Joey.

46
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,500
 I don't know his real name.

47
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,500
 If that's your real name, it was just the guy that's freaking him out right now.

48
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,500
 "Individual targeted" posts a lot on these gangstalking subreddits.

49
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,500
 But we're sitting around in this dude's house,

50
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,500
 and we're seeing him sleep.

51
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,500
 He's taking a little nap on his couch.

52
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,500
 Now, that's great. I love napping.

53
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
 I actually just woke up from a nap to record this episode.

54
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,500
 Napping might be one of my favorite pastimes I do throughout the day.

55
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,500
 I love them.

56
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,500
 But I love naps because they're refreshing.

57
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
 They're like, you know, taking an hour-long nap.

58
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,500
 They're refreshing. I feel relaxed.

59
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,500
 I'm relaxed when I get up.

60
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,500
 I usually have some cool dreams.

61
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,500
 Um, this is how his naps go.

62
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,500
 This is the title of his post on this subreddit.

63
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,500
 "Does anyone else have vague nightmares of being abused

64
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:39,500
 and then wake up with anal pain?"

65
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,500
 This is the very first line of his post.

66
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,500
 "I am paranoid that someone is intruding into my apartment,

67
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,500
 abusing me and abusing me whenever I take a short nap."

68
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,500
 Now, a man's home is this castle, right?

69
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,500
 You have the right to be safe.

70
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,500
 Everyone has the right to be safe wherever they're at.

71
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,500
 That's true. I'm not victim-blaming this guy.

72
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,500
 I just want to know how many short naps in a row

73
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,500
 would you have to take?

74
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,500
 Kind of the answer for me would be one,

75
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,500
 maybe two, to find out there's a correlation.

76
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,500
 How many short naps would you have to take

77
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,500
 and then wake up with anal pain before you go,

78
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,500
 "Hmm, I really, really like short naps,

79
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,500
 but the anal pain is kind of a downslate."

80
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,500
 I would just stop.

81
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,500
 The first thing I... Here's what I would do in this situation.

82
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,500
 If I woke up from a nap, my butthole hurt.

83
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,500
 I would assume it was a coincidence the very first time.

84
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,500
 I'm assuming this guy lives alone, like I live alone.

85
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,500
 The first time I would wake up and I had severe anal pain,

86
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,500
 I want to put two and two together.

87
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
 If it happened again, the next day I'm taking another short nap

88
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,500
 and I wake up because he says this pain lasts for 30 minutes.

89
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,500
 It's not like you woke up and you go,

90
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,500
 "Ow, like maybe a spider bit you on the butthole."

91
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,500
 This is a lingering...

92
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
 He's like, "Hope-time to watch Big Bang Theory."

93
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,500
 He's just standing up.

94
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
 He doesn't even want to sit down in the chair.

95
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
 You wake up from a nap and for the next 30 minutes

96
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
 your anus hurts.

97
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,500
 If that happened to me twice, I would go to the doctor.

98
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,500
 I would stop.

99
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,500
 Stop taking short naps.

100
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,500
 He doesn't say this happens at night during long nights of sleep.

101
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,500
 I would stop taking naps if it happened twice

102
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,500
 because now there's a correlation.

103
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,500
 Every time I take a short nap, my butthole hurts.

104
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,500
 I would go to the doctor.

105
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,500
 That would be my first thing.

106
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,500
 My butthole hurts.

107
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,500
 I would have it checked out, right?

108
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,500
 Maybe I got like some giant pinworm infection

109
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,500
 or maybe, I don't know, there's a terrible living in there.

110
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,500
 The only move is when I'm sleeping.

111
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,500
 I don't know.

112
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,500
 How many times did you...

113
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,500
 No matter how much I love short naps,

114
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,500
 if my butthole hurt when I woke up...

115
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,500
 And to be fair, any part of my body hurt

116
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,500
 after I woke up from taking a short nap over and over again.

117
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,500
 I'd stop taking short naps,

118
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,500
 but this guy must really love the naps.

119
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,500
 Must really, really love the naps.

120
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
 Now, here's the other thing though.

121
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,500
 Let's say you go to the doctor and the doctor goes,

122
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,500
 "Jason, I can't tell why your butthole hurts."

123
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,500
 As I'm sleeping, as I'm sleeping in the doctor's office,

124
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,500
 I'm like, "Just watch me.

125
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,500
 Watch me and see what happens."

126
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,500
 He does that.

127
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,500
 He doesn't do it with the doctor present.

128
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,500
 He begins setting video cameras up everywhere

129
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,500
 because what he's worked...

130
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,500
 I would not work under the assumption

131
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,500
 that another person was doing that to me.

132
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,500
 I wouldn't even think that.

133
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,500
 If I'm living alone,

134
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
 I wouldn't think someone was breaking into my house,

135
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,500
 putting their finger up my butthole,

136
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,500
 and then leaving, and me not knowing.

137
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,500
 That's my working assumption,

138
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,500
 but he goes, "I put cameras up everywhere

139
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,500
 because I wanted to videotape the phenomenon.

140
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,500
 I wanted to be able to have a hidden camera

141
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,500
 that would show someone, or will learn very quickly,

142
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,500
 some thing sneaking into my Natalie's car.

143
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,500
 She's totally just left.

144
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,500
 She's waiting for the next story.

145
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,500
 She's already at Stonehenge with the camera

146
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,500
 taking pictures and doing the whole tourist thing."

147
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,500
 He thinks someone or something

148
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,500
 is assaulting his butthole while he's sleeping.

149
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,500
 Now, he sets these video cameras up.

150
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,500
 Okay, cool, right?

151
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
 Because now we can see what's going on.

152
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,500
 Is there a guy dressed up as a burglar from the 1950s

153
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,500
 with the striped shirt and the little beanie coming in?

154
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,500
 And he's like, "Hehehehe."

155
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,500
 Or are you doing it?

156
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,500
 That's also an option too.

157
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,500
 What if you're such a deep sleeper,

158
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,500
 you're putting your own finger up your butthole?

159
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,500
 I don't know.

160
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,500
 Well, here's the thing.

161
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,500
 According to him, I wish he would show his pr-

162
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,500
 Not that I want to prove it,

163
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,500
 but just a three hour video of this guy napping

164
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,500
 and then him scratching his butthole in the-

165
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,500
 He says that right when-

166
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,500
 Well, he doesn't know exactly when this happens,

167
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,500
 but he goes, "I'll record myself sleeping."

168
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,500
 And then in the middle of it,

169
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,500
 the footage will be distorted or cut.

170
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,500
 Like someone shut the camera off,

171
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
 went and played with his anus,

172
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,500
 and then turned the camera back on,

173
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
 which is very polite of them to actually turn

174
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,500
 the camera back on.

175
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,500
 If you think about it, I would have just left it off.

176
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
 I would never engage in this behavior to begin with.

177
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
 Let me just say that.

178
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,500
 But he says that the footage is always missing.

179
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:50,500
 So now this is where this almost becomes a-

180
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
 This is a mental illness, right?

181
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,500
 The reality is warping.

182
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,500
 Here's the thing.

183
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,500
 He's either mentally ill, he's making it up,

184
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,500
 he's some sort of troll,

185
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,500
 or he's being visited by humans or aliens.

186
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,500
 And in this story, I'm kind of leaning

187
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,500
 as much as I'm a believer in the paranormal,

188
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,500
 I'm kind of leaning towards mental illness,

189
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,500
 or he's making this up.

190
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,500
 But he says that the video isn't existing.

191
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,500
 I'm wondering, like, I'm always intrigued by mental illness, right?

192
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,500
 If I recorded eight hours of me sleeping,

193
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
 first off, super boring, right?

194
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,500
 Secondly, like I'm watching it,

195
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
 and if I saw like a-

196
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,500
 If I saw something go wrong with the film,

197
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,500
 would I immediately assume someone had edited it out?

198
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,500
 I don't think I would.

199
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,500
 And I would think someone who is mentally ill,

200
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
 there may not even be a break in the film.

201
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
 It may be three hours of them sleeping,

202
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,500
 but they go, "Oh, did you see that moth that flew by?"

203
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,500
 and then it wasn't there anymore.

204
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,500
 Someone was like, "Do you hallucinate the jj?"

205
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,500
 or does he see small details?

206
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
 And then he figures it was edited out,

207
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,500
 or what? I don't know.

208
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,500
 But individual target says,

209
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,500
 "Someone's messing with the video tape

210
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,500
 so I can't even prove that people are putting their finger

211
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,500
 up my butthole."

212
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,500
 Now, there's a bunch of obvious-

213
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,500
 Gangstalking is not an isolated event.

214
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,500
 There's a bunch of other gangstalkers on the subreddit,

215
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
 and they're talking about it.

216
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,500
 And there's this guy, he goes by the name

217
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,500
 "Errorzellusidea532"

218
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,500
 and he has an answer for this.

219
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,500
 He says it's humans.

220
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,500
 Errorzellus goes,

221
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,500
 "I actually got three possible theories that could be

222
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,500
 what's going on.

223
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,500
 One, gangstalkers are just perverts in general.

224
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,500
 They love to do perverted stuff.

225
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,500
 So yeah, they're watching you sleep,

226
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,500
 and they wait for you to fall asleep,

227
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,500
 probably pumping some sort of gas

228
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,500
 into your house to keep you asleep,

229
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,500
 and then they're putting stuff up your butthole

230
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,500
 while you're asleep.

231
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,500
 Because they're perverts.

232
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,500
 Because they're perverts.

233
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,500
 Two, he says they do all that stuff,

234
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,500
 but the reason why they stick stuff up your butthole

235
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,500
 isn't because they're perverts.

236
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,500
 It's because they find it funny.

237
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,500
 And then three, the other possible scenario,

238
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,500
 which is the least unlikely,

239
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,500
 right there all, they're all pretty unlikely.

240
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,500
 But the third one is, is that the gangstalkers

241
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,500
 wait to see you fall asleep,

242
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
 and then they pump gas in your house to keep you to sleep,

243
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,500
 and they sneak in and they do stuff with your butthole.

244
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,500
 So then they can find people who are against anal sex

245
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,500
 and show them photos of them doing stuff with your butthole

246
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,500
 and saying, "Don't you hate this guy?

247
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,500
 You, I heard around town you don't like anal sex."

248
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,500
 And the neighbor's like, "Yeah, I hate anal sex."

249
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,500
 And then the gangstalker goes, "Look at this picture of your neighbor

250
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,500
 with eight toothbrushes up his butthole."

251
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,500
 We were trying to go for nine,

252
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,500
 but someone forgot their toothbrush at home.

253
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500
 Isn't that disgusting?

254
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,500
 Look at this photo of him with all this stuff up his butt.

255
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,500
 And then that makes your neighbors hate you.

256
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,500
 And maybe they become gangstalkers as well.

257
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,500
 I find that very...

258
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,500
 Sorry, this whole thing sounds.

259
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,500
 The fact that an adult would type that out in all seriousness

260
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,500
 and say they find people who hate anal sex

261
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,500
 to show photos of them putting stuff in your butt

262
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,500
 to make them hate you.

263
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,500
 If I hated anal sex,

264
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,500
 I have hated anal sex so much I wanted to beat up people who engaged in it.

265
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:15,500
 And a stranger came to me with photos of my neighbor's butthole.

266
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,500
 Why is the conversation even continuing?

267
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,500
 You figure I'm going to pummel that guy too.

268
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,500
 If someone's like, "Hey, I heard you hated human butts."

269
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,500
 Look at these pictures of what...

270
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,500
 That's not going to go well.

271
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,500
 But in this world, and not our world, the real world,

272
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,500
 but in this weird, fictional, mental weirdness world,

273
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,500
 that's a thought that you would feel comfortable putting out on the internet

274
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
 and people going, "Yeah, you're right."

275
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,500
 I could totally see people who hate anal sex joining

276
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,500
 in your crusade of more anal sex.

277
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,500
 It doesn't make any sense.

278
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,500
 So that in and of itself, individual targeted stories,

279
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,500
 was just bizarre.

280
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,500
 I read that.

281
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,500
 And on one hand, you know, obviously you feel kind of bad for the guy, right?

282
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,500
 You can't get a good nap in.

283
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,500
 He wakes up.

284
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,500
 There's something in his butthole.

285
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,500
 He never wakes up.

286
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,500
 There's anything in his butthole.

287
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,500
 His butthole just hurts.

288
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,500
 And I don't think he really knows how to go about it,

289
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
 other than to post about it online.

290
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,500
 And then we have this.

291
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,500
 This is where you're like,

292
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,500
 "Okay, this guy's just off the rocker."

293
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,500
 He posts this and he says that, quote,

294
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,500
 this is his other post we have, quote,

295
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:29,500
 "An invisible and non-material person seems to be living in my apartment."

296
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,500
 Now, that's totally fine, right?

297
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,500
 That's a ghost.

298
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,500
 That's normally what we call those guys.

299
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,500
 Ghost, right?

300
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,500
 I believe that a ghost can be walking around in your house.

301
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:43,500
 But this is where you start to see, again, like, mental illness.

302
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,500
 Because even if someone, even if you don't believe in ghosts, right?

303
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,500
 There's a lot of people who don't believe in ghosts.

304
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,500
 They're friends who believe in ghosts and they talk about,

305
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,500
 when their mother died, they saw her spirit,

306
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
 or they dreamt about a close relative.

307
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,500
 And you don't go, that person's obviously mentally ill, right?

308
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,500
 If someone goes, "Yeah, when I was 15,

309
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,500
 I was walking by a spooky graveyard and I thought I saw a ghost."

310
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,500
 Or even when I was 38.

311
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,500
 Today, I just turned 38.

312
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,500
 Happy birthday to me.

313
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,500
 And you were walking by a graveyard and you saw a spooky ghost.

314
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,500
 I think even your friends who don't believe in ghosts

315
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,500
 won't think you're mentally ill.

316
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,500
 But it's a combination of all this stuff, right?

317
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,500
 It's the previous post about the butthole.

318
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,500
 It's this one.

319
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,500
 An invisible non-material person seems to be living in my apartment fine.

320
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,500
 It's a ghost.

321
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,500
 But then they start saying that this is where the paranoia kicks in.

322
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,500
 Despite the fact that there's someone living in their house that they can't see.

323
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,500
 He said, "My upstairs neighbor saw apartments."

324
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,500
 I'm assuming.

325
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:44,500
 My upstairs neighbor seems to mimic my location 24 hours a day.

326
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,500
 So like, if I'm in the living room, my upstairs neighbor's in the living room.

327
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,500
 And then at night time, when it's time to go to bed,

328
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,500
 we both go into the bedroom at the same time.

329
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,500
 And then sometimes when I'm in the bathroom,

330
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,500
 I can hear him in the bathroom.

331
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
 So that's that gangstalking thing, right?

332
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:02,500
 Gangstalking is meant to drive you insane by making you look insane.

333
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,500
 But that's paranoia.

334
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
 And then just to have this all off, right?

335
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,500
 We're gonna wrap it up like this.

336
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:14,500
 This poor guy, he says that like the delivery man says that he thinks a woman and a dog live there.

337
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,500
 And I'm like, "What?

338
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,500
 Why is he talking about delivery man on it?

339
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,500
 He might be a gangstalker.

340
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
 He knows where he live."

341
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,500
 He said, "Yeah, I think there's someone living in my house that I can't see."

342
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,500
 And the delivery man has said multiple times that he thought there was a woman and a dog in my house.

343
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,500
 But there's no woman or dog in my house.

344
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,500
 Weird, right?

345
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,500
 And then that's not even the weirdest part.

346
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
 Again, maybe ghosts, right?

347
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,500
 And then to wrap all this up,

348
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,500
 the combination of these last two statements is really telling.

349
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,500
 It makes me think, one, he either has a terrible doctor,

350
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:53,500
 or two, he's being more honest online than he is with his doctor.

351
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,500
 Because this is how he wraps up his post.

352
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,500
 He thinks that the invisible person's walking around his house.

353
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,500
 Quote, "I've seen psychiatrists."

354
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,500
 So plural, right?

355
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,500
 More than one.

356
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,500
 "I've seen psychiatrists and they don't think I need any medication."

357
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
 Next sentence.

358
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:17,500
 "My leading hypotheses are that either I'm living with some sort of dimensionally liminal being,

359
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:26,500
 or my neighbors are somehow temporarily capturing my consciousness in another vessel for some time as I sleep."

360
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,500
 Unquote.

361
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,500
 There's not a psychiatrist in the world.

362
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:36,500
 If you walked into an office, unless they're sitting there playing Candy Crush on their phone,

363
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,500
 if you walked into their office,

364
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
 if you said, "I think there's a ghost in my house,"

365
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,500
 they won't even blink. That's such a common thought.

366
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,500
 But if you started talking about your neighbors were taking your consciousness while you were sleeping,

367
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:54,500
 if you mentioned setting up video cameras all around your house to capture someone sticking stuff up your butt,

368
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,500
 and they still don't prescribe you anything or to do what at therapy at the very least, right?

369
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,500
 They don't have to medicate you, but something that's...

370
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:09,500
 I mean, has someone who's never taken any psychiatry classes that seems like malpractice,

371
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,500
 especially when they're roping their neighbors into it.

372
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,500
 I got a story coming up that you guys probably saw in the news,

373
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:20,500
 where gang stalking is becoming extremely violent, extremely fast.

374
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,500
 I'll cover that one later in this week, or maybe next week.

375
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,500
 I don't want to do too much gang stalking stuff.

376
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,500
 I mean, again, like going back to whole camera stuff,

377
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:35,500
 just the conspiracy, these people can whip up earlier, like throughout these posts and responses and stuff like that.

378
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,500
 If I remember correctly, Joey was saying,

379
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,500
 "I put these hidden cameras up and the footage is edited."

380
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,500
 The footage is edited. It doesn't actually show the stuff they're putting in my butthole.

381
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:51,500
 And then people are saying, "Well, yeah, that's because the gang stalkers know where you put the cameras."

382
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:56,500
 Now you have to hide even more cameras without them knowing.

383
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,500
 So that's not going to work either, right?

384
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,500
 Because it doesn't make any sense.

385
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,500
 How do you hide a camera in a place where people are constantly watching you

386
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,500
 and the hidden cameras you have now, they already know where they're at and that it,

387
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,500
 but it's just this delusion keeps feeding in on each other.

388
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:19,500
 And if this dude went to a psychiatrist and said, "Hey, please play this first half of this podcast,"

389
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,500
 they would get the help they needed. I don't think they're being honest.

390
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,500
 I think that someone is this dude's neighbor.

391
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
 Someone is living upstairs from this guy.

392
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:34,500
 And imagine, like, knowing that the guy below you thinks that you are part of a plot

393
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,500
 to put stuff in his anus while he's sleeping.

394
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,500
 Imagine that's going on. You have no idea.

395
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,500
 You're just watching sitcoms, eating pizza pockets.

396
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:46,500
 And the next thing you know, this dude comes barreling through your door with a crowbar,

397
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,500
 beat you to death.

398
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,500
 I mean, I guess that's...

399
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,500
 It went from zero to 60 real quick, but I have a story coming up.

400
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,500
 Maybe we'll do it Friday because I've talked about it a couple of times.

401
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,500
 What happens when gang-stalking conspiracy theories go bad?

402
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,500
 It was big news.

403
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,500
 Multiple people died.

404
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,500
 And it happened like two weeks ago.

405
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,500
 And I imagine it's only going to be getting worse because of conspiracy theories like this,

406
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,500
 but that is not the Dower Hindean.

407
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
 I thought I was going to end on that story.

408
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,500
 Natalie, would you please come back and pick us up out of this neighborhood?

409
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,500
 We're leaving behind this apartment complex.

410
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,500
 Just as the police sirens are showing up, we didn't see anything.

411
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
 We're not going to be witnesses in any trial.

412
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,500
 You're going to take us all the way out to Stonehenge.

413
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,500
 [imitates sirens]

414
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:40,500
 Specifically, we're headed out to the Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire, England.

415
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,500
 There's a lot of grass, a lot of like, just like rolling hills,

416
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,500
 probably some chipmunks just chilling there, catching a little tan, eating some...

417
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,500
 I guess there are no nuts.

418
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,500
 I guess there's no trees around that I can see in any of these photos.

419
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,500
 But you guys know Stonehenge.

420
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,500
 It's a very, very famous series of rocks.

421
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,500
 It's probably the most basic way I can put it.

422
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,500
 It's featured in Transformers 5, The Last Night Stonehenge.

423
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,500
 And we're walking around Stonehenge.

424
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,500
 It's these giant rocks.

425
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,500
 We're like looking at them and stuff like that, taking pictures.

426
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,500
 I'm like trying to push one over.

427
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,500
 Like, Jason, no, no, someone was like, "No, I can do it. I'm a big boy."

428
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,500
 This was a conspiracy theory that I just...

429
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,500
 I was like scrolling through stuff and I saw a single sentence and I go, "Huh?"

430
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
 And I dug.

431
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,500
 I started digging around on the internet and this one is true.

432
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:36,500
 With a caveat, and the introduction I said was Stonehenge built in 1954.

433
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,500
 Or was Stonehenge built in the 50s is what I said.

434
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,500
 That is a conspiracy theory that's been going around.

435
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,500
 It started off a long time ago.

436
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,500
 I think it was like a Cold War era conspiracy theory.

437
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,500
 Basically, it was from Russia.

438
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,500
 And they were saying, "Look at Britain says that they're this race.

439
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,500
 They think that they're mass civilization. They can stack rocks up."

440
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:03,500
 They think that they're from these olden times that it was actually built in 1954.

441
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:10,500
 There's these series of photos of cranes moving around the rocks of Stonehenge.

442
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,500
 Those photos are real.

443
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,500
 Totally real.

444
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,500
 This is a really cool story.

445
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:23,500
 Stonehenge is not Stonehenge.

446
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:28,500
 Now, while it was not built in 1954, we know it wasn't built in 1954,

447
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,500
 the conspiracy theory is half true.

448
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,500
 Let's take a look at this.

449
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:39,500
 Back in 3000 BC is when Stonehenge was first created, but it wasn't the stones.

450
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:44,500
 In 3000 BC, it was basically a giant circular ditch.

451
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:50,500
 Then over time, over a course of hundreds of years, they start putting up these wooden monuments.

452
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,500
 In 2500 BC, that's when the first stones were set up.

453
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,500
 And that's really when it started to become known as what we know as Stonehenge.

454
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:04,500
 So still a monument that at this point is, what, 4,500 years old?

455
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:10,500
 But there was an article written for the magazine, "The New Scientist," by Emma Young.

456
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:16,500
 And it talks about how, quote, "Virtually every stone was re-erected, straightened,

457
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:21,500
 or embedded in concrete between 1901 and 1964."

458
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:28,500
 There's been a lot of reconstruction work on this thing, and they straight up moved rocks.

459
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,500
 Rocks are in positions they're not supposed to be.

460
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,500
 These slabs are in positions that they were not in.

461
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,500
 We can look at diagrams from the 1700s.

462
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,500
 Then we look at photos from today, and it is not the same.

463
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,500
 These huge rocks, these monuments, were moved around,

464
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,500
 and most of them were moved around in the 1920s.

465
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:52,500
 Generally speaking, that's considered too much of a restoration.

466
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,500
 There's a quote that goes around a lot when you look into this.

467
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:01,500
 It says, quote, this is also from the New Scientist article, but I found this a lot of places on the line.

468
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,500
 It says, quote, "The 1920s restoration was a most vigorous," said Christopher Chippendale

469
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,500
 of the Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.

470
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:18,500
 Going back to quoting Christopher here, "The work in the 1920s under Colonel William Crawley is a sad story."

471
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:26,500
 Now what's really interesting is I actually spent a lot of time looking to see what they meant by a sad story.

472
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,500
 What did this mean? Where's this coming from?

473
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:42,500
 And there is no document that I could find that says these are all of the things that Colonel William Crawley did. Zero.

474
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:48,500
 There's not a list. I go, "Oh, it's a sad story," then they must say, "He moved this rock five meters,"

475
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,500
 and this one should have been this way, but nothing.

476
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:55,500
 Now you could just say, "What's the big deal?" Right? It's a bunch of rocks in the middle of nowhere.

477
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,500
 Like, who cares if they moved one five feet and they moved this one?

478
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:04,500
 Well, the thing, here's my thing about Stonehenge. I always heard, this was kind of the idea,

479
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:10,500
 some druids built it, which is not true. There's all of the stuff that I thought I knew about Stonehenge.

480
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:17,500
 Just is not true, or it's just theories. Nobody knows for sure, but it was created by these druids.

481
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:23,500
 It was created by this early culture. That part's true. I mean, the ditches and the rocks begins showing up earlier, you know, in the B.C.'s.

482
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:32,500
 But it was supposed to mark the celestial moments in the sky. You could sit there and it would line up perfectly to the equinox.

483
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:37,500
 Everything will line up perfectly if you have a crane. Everything.

484
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:44,500
 Everything could line up perfectly to whatever theory you wanted to if you moved rocks. Right?

485
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:53,500
 It's so weird to me. It's so weird to me that I don't even remember, it might have been on the export, it might have been on Reddit.

486
00:23:53,500 --> 00:24:00,500
 I don't remember where someone just wrote out the sentence, "You do know that Stonehenge isn't in its original position."

487
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:05,500
 And I go, "Huh? I never heard that before." And then you go, "Oh, I'm sure they restored some stuff."

488
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:11,500
 They straight up moved structures. And you can look at drawings from the 1700s versus photos from today.

489
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:17,500
 Some of them are very recognizable. You see that there are other ones are completely moved or absent.

490
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:25,500
 And what's interesting too is that we can look at those drawings from the 1700s. Who knows what it looked like in the 1500s?

491
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:33,500
 Or the--or 1000 A.D.? The Stonehenge you go to today is not the Stonehenge that was built in 3000 B.C.

492
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:39,500
 All of this stuff about, "There's no way. How did they move these boulders? How did they do this? How did they do that?"

493
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:45,500
 Well, we've mo--we've adjusted it so much it's hard to even analyze any of that stuff. Right?

494
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:50,500
 Yeah, they did get the rocks to build Stonehenge from really, really far away.

495
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:57,500
 But the rocks you go see now at Stonehenge, guess what? They're part concrete.

496
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:07,500
 So many people were visiting Stonehenge and taking home souvenirs, i.e. they were chipping pieces of the rock off to take home with them.

497
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:15,500
 Part of the restoration was they had to fix it. I mean, there's a giant chunk--there's a photo of like a giant chunk missing off one of the rocks.

498
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:22,500
 And they just filled it with concrete. So it looks nice. I mean, it's also very safe. You don't want to chipped off rocks sitting there.

499
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:28,500
 And here's the thing. You have to do restoration on sites like this. I totally get that.

500
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:35,500
 But what's super interesting is this article in "The New Scientist" it was called "Concrete Evidence".

501
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:48,500
 It was published back in 2001. And in it, they are talking about--in the 1960s, the World Heritage Foundation, right?

502
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:56,500
 The people who were in charge of maintaining Stonehenge, they put out a brochure, basically like a tour guide book.

503
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:04,500
 And there was a debate back then. They go, "Should we list--should we explain everything that's done and how we've done all these restoration projects?"

504
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:12,500
 Over the years. And the vote was, "No. We're not going to include in this book explaining the history of Stonehenge anything we've done about it.

505
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:19,500
 We're not going to talk about that." And it reminds me of that episode I did a long time ago called "The St. Bernard Conspiracy".

506
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:29,500
 I'll put it in the show notes, but basically, the St. Bernard you see today is not the original St. Bernard's that were being used to rescue people in the mountains.

507
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:38,500
 And there was a very famous St. Bernard dog who rescued tons of people. I forgot his name, but I have a tattoo on my back. He was my favorite dog ever.

508
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:47,500
 But I can't see my back right now. He was a famous dog. He was taking people out of the mountains like we know St. Bernard's stereotypically doing, bugs bunny cartoons.

509
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:53,500
 And when he died, they stuffed him and they put him in the monastery, St. Bernard's monastery.

510
00:26:53,500 --> 00:27:02,500
 Well over the years, over the centuries really, people would go there and they would visit the monastery. I think it's like a brewery as well.

511
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:09,500
 And they would see this stuffed image of this St. Bernard dog and people would complain, "That's not what a St. Bernard looks like."

512
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:15,500
 It's not what they look like because over time they stopped breeding them to look like that because they stopped doing rescue dogs.

513
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:21,500
 So they made them very big and hearty because they weren't running through snow. You can't have a dog that big would just sink through the snow.

514
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:30,500
 So people were coming and seeing the first generation of St. Bernard's, but now we're on generation two. Now we're on these giant guys, the Beethoven's of the world.

515
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:36,500
 So what they did, and the monks got, so this is true, the monks got so tired of answering these questions.

516
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,500
 Well, you know St. Bernard's used to look like this and people being disappointed.

517
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:47,500
 They took this dog's stuffed body, broke its bones, and made it look like a modern day St. Bernard.

518
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:57,500
 They reformed his carcass so it would appease the tourists. So now if you showed up and you saw it, you'd be like, "Oh, St. Bernard, just like he was back in the day."

519
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:02,500
 That's not a conspiracy theory. That's 100% true. That happened. And this is what that reminded me of.

520
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:11,500
 The changes could have been small, right? I understand if a slab is tipped over, or a slab's about to get tipped over, you're going to reinforce it.

521
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:20,500
 I don't have any problem with pouring concrete. I don't have any problem with any of that stuff. I'm pro-saving people's lives from being squished.

522
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:30,500
 What is interesting is they will not tell us exactly what was done. We have a series of photos, and they'll say, "We moved this and we did that and we erected that."

523
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:38,500
 The thing about the concrete being poured, I had to find that as well. Even in Emma's article, "Concrete Evidence,"

524
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:45,500
 she did not have the part about the concrete. Some of the rocks are modern stone because they've worn down so much.

525
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:51,500
 And just to show that things never change. I thought this was so fascinating. We're going to wrap it up like this.

526
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:59,500
 Just to show that things never change. When this construction was being done back in 1920, the Salisbury Times back in 1920,

527
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:05,500
 when they were doing this reconstruction, it wasn't the first time they were doing it either. When they were doing this reconstruction in the 1920s,

528
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:10,500
 the Salisbury Times covered it and they gave the reader a very important message.

529
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:16,500
 If you have any questions about this process that's going on, shut up.

530
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,500
 Let me read you this quote.

531
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:26,500
 I've actually been trying to read the exact quote for like six minutes now. It's really hard. It's a pretty dense quote, just grammatically.

532
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,500
 It's in a newspaper in the 1920s. They wrote like a bunch of weirdos.

533
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:38,500
 But what it said, it's so interesting. This quote says, "Listen, there was reconstruction 19 years ago and they did it to save this giant stone slab.

534
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:43,500
 It would have fallen over like the one next to it and it would have just smashed an app." So this restoration work is good.

535
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:50,500
 And then it goes on to say, "If you don't agree with this restoration work, you're a bigot."

536
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:55,500
 They actually use that word twice.

537
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:02,500
 They say, "Listen, you don't need to be a quote bigoted conservative to feel that the first time you're hearing this,

538
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:07,500
 they're a little bit of mistrust that they're reorganizing stuff. That's the first time they use bigot."

539
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:14,500
 And then they go, "Listen, but if you've been to Stonehenge and you see the work that they're doing, you would have to be a bigot."

540
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:20,500
 They use the word again. "You would have to be a bigot to not agree with them."

541
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:34,500
 And they say it would be, quote, "Very bigoted indeed to deny that it is really necessary and is being done reverently and carefully with a determination neither to add nor subtract anything."

542
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:42,500
 Don't question the narrative. If you do question the narrative, you're a bigot.

543
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,500
 That's nuts.

544
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:54,500
 That's insane. If you walk down there and you see people moving around Stonehenge and you go, "Well, that's weird. I thought it was like that yesterday. You're a bigot."

545
00:30:54,500 --> 00:31:01,500
 That's insane. If you question what you're looking at with your own eyes, you're a bigot.

546
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,500
 You don't want to be a bigot, do you?

547
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,500
 Well, then, this is needed.

548
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:15,500
 And we do not have access to it. Someone has access to it, but we do not have access to all of the changes that were being made back then.

549
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:25,500
 But if you saw the change being made with your own eyes, you were there and you questioned it. You were a bigot. Don't ask questions. The government knows what it's doing.

550
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:32,500
 And here we are 100 years later, and I can't even find this stuff online of what was actually moved.

551
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:46,500
 I'm sure Stonehenge as a sacred site meant a lot to the people who initially constructed it. And I'm sure throughout the ages, you had other people in the area who also found some sort of solace in this structure,

552
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:58,500
 whether it be a series of ditches, whether it be a monument of stone or even just wood, whether it was a place where people gathered to talk or a place people came to,

553
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:06,500
 to study the glories of the universe. I'm sure all of these people throughout time found their own peace at Stonehenge.

554
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:12,500
 But their Stonehenges are not the Stonehenge that stands today. It's a tourist trap.

555
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:22,500
 You know what I mean? That's so insane. This is one of those things that I never once thought of, and now it's kind of tarnished the memory of Stonehenge.

556
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:30,500
 And you know what's so funny is if they had put this in their guidebook in the 1960s, people would have been like, "Oh yeah, that makes sense. Restoration. That makes sense."

557
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:42,500
 It's the fact, it's the, this is always the rule in journalism. It's not the crime, it's the cover-up that gets you in trouble. Doing this restoration, we understand.

558
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:51,500
 It's not the crime, it's the cover-up. What did they do at Stonehenge? And you can't tell me that it's lined up to meet the equinox, because you lined it up to meet the equinox.

559
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:57,500
 And maybe you didn't. Maybe it was always lined up to the equinox, but I don't know that because you won't tell me what you moved.

560
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:07,500
 And by me just asking the question, "I'm a bigot? I'm a bigot? I'm questioning the government?" Because I want to know, it's so, this is so weird.

561
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:14,500
 This is one of those conspiracy theories that I love kind of combing through, because it was just someone typed this out online.

562
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:21,500
 Some anonymous person said, "You know, Stonehenge is different than it used to be, and it led me down this rabbit hole." And that's absolutely true.

563
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:27,500
 The Russians got it wrong. It wasn't built in 1954. It went through one of a series of...maintenances.

564
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:35,500
 And while that is an intriguing conspiracy theory that can easily be shot down, this one can't. Stonehenge is not the same.

565
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:40,500
 It hasn't been the same for over a hundred years. And really, for thousands of years, it changed and changed.

566
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:46,500
 But those were...that's when it served a different function now. It is a tourist trap. Absolutely insane.

567
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:52,500
 I just ran across a little sentence online and it led me into this conspiracy theory. Not a conspiracy theory. It's true.

568
00:33:52,500 --> 00:34:02,500
 They changed it and why are they hiding the information from us? Stonehenge is not Stonehenge. It's never been Stonehenge in any of our lives.

569
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:14,500
 So from the modern-day druid who goes out there to someone trying to realign their new-age chakras to just the tourist who wants to go and take pictures and buy a coffee mug.

570
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:25,500
 I've been to Stonehenge. It's a lie. It's a blatant lie. And if you say it's a lie, you're a bigot.

571
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:34,500
 Don't question the narrative, even when you see it changing right in front of you.
