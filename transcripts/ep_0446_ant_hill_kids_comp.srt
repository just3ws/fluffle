1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Are you worried about the coronavirus? Well, don't.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,500
 Witches are going to save us all.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,000
 And then we take a look at an incredibly disturbing story.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,500
 Okay, and I would recommend anyone who wants to have a good day not listen to it.

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,500
 The second part of this episode will be about the anthill kids.

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,500
 Today on Dead Ravirating.

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
 *I'm a walk big doll*

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,500
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Ravirating.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,500
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Now because of this episode, the second half of this episode is pretty disturbing.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 We're not going to give a shout out to a Patreon this episode.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 I don't know anyone who'd want to be like, "Oh gee, I'm so glad I'm helping Jason support that one."

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,500
 What? What is this episode?

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 We're not going to use that carboner copter just yet.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,500
 We're going to get a cauldron full of witches brew.

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,500
 We're stirring it with that giant wooden spoon your grandma used to spank you with.

18
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,500
 Gives it extra evil magic.

19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,500
 And then we look into this bubbling cauldron.

20
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,500
 It's made of iron, cast iron.

21
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,500
 But I mean what's in it is like bubbling water and stuff and then there's like frog legs.

22
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:50,500
 A vulture flies by, drops a turtle into it, pssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

23
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,000
 We were wrong. We were wrong all along.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,500
 We should have looked to the crows, to look to the crazy old ladies in their houses on Zoom holding rituals.

25
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:08,000
 Yes, witches don't have to worry about social distancing right now because they can fly six feet apart on their brooms.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 But that doesn't exist. That doesn't exist, right?

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 It's just a stereotype. It's a funny one, but it's still just a stereotype.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,500
 No, witches today use Zoom.

29
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:24,000
 They use the little messaging app thing on their computers and they talk to each other and they cast these spells.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Spells that are supposedly thousands of years old that required old women to dance naked in a grove of trees can conveniently be done in their own homes online.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Get that, right?

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,500
 I mean either magic is real and it's a ritual or you can just walk in a room and go magic and then stuff happens.

33
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:52,500
 So yes, now that all the Panera breads have been shut down and they have no place to eat and/or work, they're at home on Zoom meetings casting these spells.

34
00:02:52,500 --> 00:03:00,500
 So Elizabeth Lovegood and Monica Moonstone and Jimmy, he's the odd bird, Jimmy.

35
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,000
 They're all casting these spells using Zoom.

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 They're also, their goal is to cure coronavirus.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 They're also, this is what I thought was weird. Here's a little Twilight Zone thing for you.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 While they're trying to cure coronavirus, there's another group that's trying to aid the effort against this virus.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,500
 They're also trying a spell called "bind Trump".

40
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:26,500
 Now I don't like to get political, but they want to cast a spell that'll bind Trump and all who abet him.

41
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,000
 All who abet him.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 So let's take out Trump, let's take out his supporters.

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,500
 They're getting ready to do a new one of these spells on May 20th.

44
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,500
 Here's a little Twilight Zone moment for you.

45
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:42,000
 Imagine May 20th half the United States freezes in place.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Now to be fair, we probably wouldn't know because we're still having a quarantine.

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Your dad just frozen.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 "Hey dad, dad, can I change the channel?"

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 "Dad, dad, seriously, what are you doing?"

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Wouldn't that be weird though? I mean, obviously it's not going to work.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,500
 Stupid, but that would be bizarre if all of a sudden 43 million Americans freeze in place.

52
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,000
 I think 43 million voted for him, 43 million voted against him, the rest of America just didn't care.

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 That's pretty much how it happens here, but imagine if mass seizures take place on May 20th.

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 But it's not because the whole thing is ridiculous.

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 And so is this ability of them able to cure coronavirus.

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 But you know, any port in a storm, whatever, people want to pray, people have their faith.

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 That's cool, I get that.

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,500
 But then again, let's also make fun of these guys.

59
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,500
 So there's a specific witch named Willow Rose.

60
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,000
 I'm going to bet money. That's not her, that was not her birth name.

61
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 I could be wrong, I could be wrong on this, but I got five bucks saying her, she was born Tabitha McGillicuddy.

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,500
 But anyways, Willow Rose, we will call you by that name, Willow Rose.

63
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,000
 She's what's known as an herbal witch, which was the name of my drug dealer back in high school.

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 I smoke cloves all the time.

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 She has this, this totally perfect way.

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,500
 So this, you know, this disease is everywhere, people are dying of it.

67
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:05,500
 It's not, not super cool to get, even if you get it, it can be real sucky afternoon or 14 sucky afternoons.

68
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,500
 But don't worry, Willow is on the case.

69
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,500
 At least it depends on how well you know Willow Rose.

70
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,500
 Here's how she starts off this article.

71
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:24,000
 "I personally have cast the circle around my home and loved ones, calling on earth to absorb the virus and transform it into something harmless."

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,500
 So she starts off talking about how she's cast like a protective bubble over her house and a protective bubble over her loved ones.

73
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,000
 Thanks a lot, Willow.

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,500
 I mean, I guess if I had known her, I might be considered one of her loved ones, but also the thing is too, so like, what if I'm like walking on the street?

75
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,500
 Does the bubble move? Can I move out of the bubble?

76
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:52,500
 Technically, I shouldn't be walking on the street, again, the quarantine thing, but it's nice to know that the people who have the power to create these bubbles aren't just making a bubble all over the planet.

77
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:59,500
 Or just creating small bubbles around the coronavirus and not, "Yeah, why are you isolating me, bro? Isolate the virus."

78
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,500
 Magical person.

79
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,500
 Also, here on her, this website, the Willow Rose is writing this article for it.

80
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,500
 She has this amazing concoction.

81
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,500
 A brew, if you will.

82
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,500
 Straight from the bowels of hell.

83
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,500
 Listen to this amazing coronavirus fighting.

84
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,500
 Coronavirus fighting spell.

85
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,500
 Brew, whatever you want to call it.

86
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:37,500
 Okay, herbal witch, Willow Rose, talking about creating bubbles, talks about calling upon the fire to go and burn up all the coronavirus and the wind to like blow it away and then the water to just kind of sit there.

87
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,500
 Do nothing and then earth to just kind of shrivel in shoulders.

88
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,500
 Anyways, here's a concoction.

89
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,500
 You have to have some ingredients.

90
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,500
 Ingredients, right?

91
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:54,500
 So you got your ear of newts and your eye of hobbit or whatever, you got all this stuff laying around.

92
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,500
 What you need for this, here you go.

93
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
 Quote, get ready, write this down.

94
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:06,500
 Quote, the proper ratio is one third cup of bleach per one gallon of water.

95
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,500
 So she's basically telling us how to make disinfectant.

96
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,500
 You're a witch, dude.

97
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,500
 I know how to make, I know how to dilute bleach.

98
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,500
 And if I didn't, I could go on Google and type in how to dilute bleach.

99
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,500
 What I don't know is how to create a bubble over myself or my love.

100
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
 Teach me that spell.

101
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,500
 Teach me the bubble spell.

102
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
 I know how to dilute bleach.

103
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,500
 It's on the bottle.

104
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,500
 If I buy bleach, you turn the bottle slightly.

105
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,500
 It's all.

106
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:40,500
 For those who seek the spell, Clorox thinks you should dilute this awful concoction.

107
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
 Like obviously I know how to do that, bro.

108
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,500
 You're casting spells.

109
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,500
 What are you holding back?

110
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,500
 I got witches doing zoom meetings, zooming around on their brooms.

111
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,500
 I got you knowing how to create force fields.

112
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,500
 Got an invisible woman over here.

113
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,500
 You're telling me to dilute bleach.

114
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,500
 Lame.

115
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,500
 Give me some real magic.

116
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:04,500
 She does also say that she learned that bleach trick working in food service.

117
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,500
 So my Panera bread joke probably wasn't that far off.

118
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
 But then she goes in this weird thing.

119
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,500
 So you have the bleach, which is fine.

120
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,500
 You mix the bleach and the water.

121
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,500
 But that's not witchy enough, right?

122
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,500
 This is a witch website run.

123
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,500
 So she says you add, she likes to add mint or lemon rind.

124
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,500
 Because they both have magical properties and they both smell good.

125
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:32,500
 Dude, what if the lemon rind already has COVID-19?

126
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,500
 You've just killed us all because you wanted it to smell good.

127
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
 What's the magical property of a lemon rind too?

128
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,500
 I mean, the magical property is you don't have to worry about the gross lemon hanging out in your kitchen anymore.

129
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,500
 It's gone.

130
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,500
 Throw the rind away.

131
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,500
 But she doesn't leave us totally hanging.

132
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:56,500
 She doesn't leave us totally hanging because she does tell us that her imaginary friend is working on this as well.

133
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:03,500
 She does tell us that the topa that she's created in her mind has a magnifying glass and is walking around and trying to figure everything out.

134
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,500
 Here's a quote from her, which again, to be fair,

135
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:13,500
 to be fair, to be fair, when I say it's an imaginary friend, it's not in looking around with the magnifying glass.

136
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
 It's not Sherlock Holmes.

137
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,500
 It's a panther.

138
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,500
 So that's even dumb.

139
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
 That's even dumber, right?

140
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,500
 If I have a magical being to help me out, I'd want one with thumbs.

141
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,500
 I'd want one that could like do stuff.

142
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,500
 I want to be like, come to me, alley cat.

143
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,500
 Wow, it's the hairs all sticking up.

144
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
 It's all dirty and stinky all the time.

145
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,500
 What did you learn?

146
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,500
 Well, I only learned stuff in alley ways and garbage cans.

147
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,500
 So, uh, it's like you didn't tell me like about what the governor's evil plans were.

148
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,500
 Well, unless the governor was in alley talking about it.

149
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,500
 Nah, why would you have a panther to be your magical animal?

150
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,500
 It's can't do nothing except panth.

151
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,500
 It can't do nothing except like, like hang out in jungles and stuff.

152
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,500
 Hey, panther, do you have any information for me?

153
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,500
 Yes.

154
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,500
 Yes, I learned that tourists are really yummy when I eat them.

155
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,500
 But her magical panther is on the case.

156
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,500
 Now, of course, your question is my question.

157
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,500
 What in the world is this panther supposed to do?

158
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
 She has an answer for that.

159
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:17,500
 Quote, "I won't reveal the details of how or where I've put this spirit to work.

160
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:22,500
 I have been told by those trying to approach me energetically for healing purposes

161
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,500
 and who have no idea this spirit resides with me,

162
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,500
 that there was a large and menacing cat keeping them away."

163
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,500
 So, so wait a second.

164
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:39,500
 So your panther is helping you cure COVID-19 and scaring away people who need your help.

165
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,500
 Because remember, she's saying people are coming to her to get healed,

166
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:50,500
 but instead there's just a giant cat bouncer wearing a white tank top shaking its head.

167
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,500
 Which even then, a cat bouncer, it doesn't have thumbs.

168
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,500
 What's it really going to do to me?

169
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,500
 I guess maul me and eat me.

170
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,500
 But, you know, if he had thumbs, he could hold me down while I was doing that.

171
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,500
 That's not helping, dude.

172
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,500
 People are trying to come to you.

173
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,500
 Imagine if you were like, had to go to the ER because you had COVID-19.

174
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,500
 There's a bunch of pit bulls in the waiting room.

175
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,500
 But, but she's not leaving us high and dry, even though we need her cleansing power

176
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,500
 and there's fears to be a giant monster, monster cat preventing us.

177
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,500
 She gives us a song to sing so we know how long to wash her hands.

178
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,500
 Now, this is common.

179
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,500
 They popped up on YouTube.

180
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,500
 They got old real quick.

181
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:30,500
 Hey, everyone, look at my song where I'm singing Staying Alive, but the,

182
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,500
 I'm calling it Staying Alive because you might die of COVID-19 and it's 20 seconds long

183
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,500
 and people are like, oh, this song is so great.

184
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,500
 And then someone else is like, oh, I'm doing that song Just Dance by Lady Gaga,

185
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,500
 but instead of just dance, it's just hands and it's about washing your hands.

186
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,500
 Oh man, that got old quick.

187
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,500
 Didn't it?

188
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,500
 Are people still doing that stuff?

189
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,500
 Oh, I'm doing that Lincoln's Park song Numb.

190
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,500
 But now it's Numb Your Fingers from Hot Water and it's 20 seconds long.

191
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,500
 She has the same thing.

192
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,500
 Now I'm going to read you this song and I'm going to see if you can figure out what's wrong with it.

193
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:05,500
 This is to the tune of Row, Row, Row Your Boat or Boat as it is.

194
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:10,500
 I added an extra boat because I wish I had a boat right now to row away from this madness.

195
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:17,500
 Here's the song, a 20 second hand washing Diddy as she calls it for kids of all ages to the tune of Row, Row, Row Your Boat.

196
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,500
 Isn't the song just called Row Your Boat?

197
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,500
 I didn't know the song was called Row, Row, Row Your Boat.

198
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,500
 That's kind of... anyways, here we go.

199
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,500
 I wonder if I can find an instrumental for this.

200
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,500
 Wash, wash, wash your hands, don't be in a hurry.

201
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,500
 Take your time and do it right so mom won't have to worry.

202
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,500
 What? That's kind of dark.

203
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
 Like the mom's like crying in the other room.

204
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,500
 She's like, oh my god, will my child die?

205
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,500
 And especially because like I'm older.

206
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,500
 So my mom's like in her 60s and she's like worried about her young man.

207
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,500
 I'm still always be her little boy.

208
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,500
 She's crying at home.

209
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,500
 I hope Jason's gay.

210
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,500
 Kind of dark.

211
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,500
 Anyways, next verse.

212
00:12:54,500 --> 00:13:00,500
 Wash, wash, wash your hands and scrub beneath the nails.

213
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,500
 If you wear rings then wash underneath.

214
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,500
 Good.

215
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
 High G never fails.

216
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,500
 I usually take my jewelry off before I wash my hands.

217
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,500
 I only have a ring, but it's...

218
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,500
 I guess, you know what?

219
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,500
 To be fair, this is for a witch.

220
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,500
 So they have all their enchanted rings.

221
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,500
 They have the ring that if they take it off, Satan claims their soul.

222
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,500
 They have the ring that if it's off for more than a minute they become an old crown.

223
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,500
 So that makes sense.

224
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,500
 You would have to point that out to them.

225
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,500
 But I think most people, they wouldn't have to do that.

226
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,500
 And also you figure, you're singing this song, at this point we're halfway through.

227
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,500
 So you're about 10 seconds in and you only have 10 seconds left to finish washing your hands.

228
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,500
 They should have started it off.

229
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:40,500
 Take off your ring and wash, wash, wash your hands because now I'm halfway through dude.

230
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,500
 I'm in a rush.

231
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,500
 Here's the last verse.

232
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,500
 Wash.

233
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,500
 I hope this really isn't a spell.

234
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,500
 Now that I think about it, I will end up giving half of America a seizure because on May 20th,

235
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,500
 because this is a binding spell.

236
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,500
 Wash, wash, wash your hands.

237
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
 Wash until they're clean.

238
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,500
 Okay, this one is creep.

239
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,500
 This one is like, this one can give people mental problems.

240
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
 Especially remember this is for kids of all ages.

241
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,500
 And really, let me say this.

242
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:14,500
 The big problem with this and just wash your hands and numb your fingers and all that other songs,

243
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
 it's just easier just to count to 20, right?

244
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,500
 Do you have to sing a song?

245
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,500
 If you are going to sing a song, just sing "Row, Row, Row Your Vote".

246
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,500
 Which actually doesn't have an ending now that I think about it.

247
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,500
 It doesn't just go on and on and on forever.

248
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,500
 Sing "Happy Birthday Song".

249
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,500
 There's other ways.

250
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
 I don't have to learn the lyrics to a new song.

251
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,500
 That's funny so you can get some views on YouTube.

252
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,500
 But this one.

253
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,500
 So we've been told that mom is already worrying about her little boy or...

254
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,500
 Jason's okay.

255
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,500
 We've also learned halfway through washing her hands.

256
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,500
 Oh crap, I've got to take my ring off.

257
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,500
 Now here's this part.

258
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,500
 Wash, wash, wash your hands.

259
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,500
 Wash until they're clean.

260
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,500
 Get all the spots then rinse away the germs that can't be seen.

261
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:07,500
 If you can't see them, but you have to wash until they're clean.

262
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,500
 But you can't see them.

263
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,500
 So you've got to keep washing and you can't see them.

264
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,500
 So you've got to keep washing.

265
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,500
 That last verse is a curse spell.

266
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,500
 To give people OCD.

267
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,500
 Wash until they're clean.

268
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,500
 They can't be seen.

269
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,500
 Wash until they're clean.

270
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,500
 You can't be seen.

271
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,500
 Wash until they're clean.

272
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,500
 They can't be seen.

273
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,500
 Wash until they're clean.

274
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:40,500
 So it's possible that this ridiculous article written by an herbal witch was giving us some tips on how to protect ourselves.

275
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:48,500
 Not good tips, just dilute bleach and wash your hands until the skin falls off while she has bubbles and panthers to protect her and her loved ones.

276
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:53,500
 But it's possible that this was less of an article and more of a curse.

277
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,500
 Maybe someday there will be someone sitting in a mental hospital.

278
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,500
 We'll be walking by with our clipboards because we work there all of a sudden.

279
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,500
 We're writing down notes and we see someone in the corner of the room going wash until they're clean.

280
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,500
 Wash until they're clean.

281
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
 Wash until they're clean.

282
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,500
 And then they look at the camera.

283
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,500
 Wash until they're clean.

284
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:20,500
 When the camera gets closer and then push cut to black credits roll directed by Jason Carvander.

285
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:25,500
 Anyway, so that is the end of our witches fighting the coronavirus.

286
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:31,500
 Now that went on for a while because this next part is super gross.

287
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,500
 This next half of this episode is pretty disgusting.

288
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:43,500
 So if you don't like disgusting stuff, I recommend and when I'm saying disgusting, this isn't Dude Pupinous Pants and throwing at people in McDonald's.

289
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:50,500
 This is closer to the story about the bear who was eating people in the Japanese village, but even worse.

290
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,500
 So if you're if you're not into that type of stuff, I'll see you tomorrow.

291
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:58,500
 You have to say and for the remaining sickos out there.

292
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,500
 Welcome.

293
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,500
 No, it's just there is certain people different people have a different level of what they can stand.

294
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,500
 This next story, it's true.

295
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,500
 It's true crime.

296
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,500
 It's nightmare fuel.

297
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:13,500
 So if you're not into that type of stuff, if you want to keep your brain clean from images of evil, I will see you tomorrow.

298
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,500
 Enjoy.

299
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,500
 I hope you enjoyed that fun witches story.

300
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:22,500
 Maybe went on a little bit longer than it needed to be, but I wanted a good cushion for what's coming.

301
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,500
 This story was actually a recommendation on Gmail from Abdullah and his mom listens to the show.

302
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:32,500
 But they've been listening for a long, long time and he recommended the story to me a while ago.

303
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:39,500
 And I read it and I thought, no, no, that's pretty gross, but it stuck with me.

304
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,500
 It stuck with me.

305
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,500
 And I think it's an interesting story and I think it's in a way an important story.

306
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,500
 Let's hop on board that carbon or copter.

307
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,500
 We are headed up to Canada.

308
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,500
 And thank you for the recommendation to Abdullah.

309
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,500
 It's disgusting as it was.

310
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,500
 I appreciate it.

311
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,500
 We're headed up to Canada.

312
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:02,500
 In 1977, a cult is founded by a man known as Rock Thywall.

313
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,500
 I don't know how to pronounce his first name or his last name and I could care less.

314
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,500
 He's a piece of garbage.

315
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,500
 He dropped out of school in the seventh grade.

316
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,500
 He's having trouble.

317
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,500
 He drops out of school and he spends his time reading the Bible.

318
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:20,500
 Now, the Bible is a source of inspiration for millions, a billion people.

319
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:25,500
 But like any dense text, it's very, very open to interpretation.

320
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,500
 And the problem is, and I think that's why you have to have scholars.

321
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,500
 You are totally free to study the Bible, any religious text you want yourself.

322
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,500
 I think there's a lot of worthwhile stuff to it.

323
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:41,500
 But when we come across questions, it's good to have scholars who can interpret things for us

324
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,500
 or help us interpret them.

325
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,500
 I think it's very, very important to have.

326
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,500
 Because it's a dense book.

327
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,500
 And there's a lot of imagery and there's a lot of things in it that don't make sense.

328
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,500
 And you should read it a couple of times if you're interested in it.

329
00:18:54,500 --> 00:19:01,500
 Because if you don't, you tend to interpret it in very egotistical ways.

330
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,500
 Now, there are different interpretations.

331
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,500
 Some people can say that this verse means this or this verse means that.

332
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,500
 That's fine.

333
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:16,500
 But what happened with Rock, what happened with this idiot, was that he kept thinking that the book was telling him an apocalyptic vision.

334
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:22,500
 Again, that is not super rare, but he begins to see himself as a major player in the end of the world.

335
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,500
 Originally, he's a Catholic. He transfers to Seventh-day Adventists.

336
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,500
 He begins to get older. He's a very charismatic man.

337
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,500
 He begins speaking knowledgeably about the Bible for people who don't know the Bible.

338
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:40,500
 You mix Charisma with a holy text and people who don't really know what the text really says.

339
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,500
 Bad things start to happen.

340
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,500
 Everyone in life wants a purpose.

341
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,500
 It's just part of the human condition.

342
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,500
 Some people find the purpose in being a parent. Some people find the purpose simply in being a good employee.

343
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:56,500
 And sometimes people look down on that. "What? That's all that you wanted? You wanted to work at the same job for 40 years?"

344
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,500
 Yeah, that's all they wanted.

345
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,500
 But some people never find their purpose.

346
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
 They die never knowing what they were put here for.

347
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:09,500
 Or, that's sad, but I think even worse is knowing what you were put here for and not being brave enough to do it.

348
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,500
 But the people who were joining Rock's Cult, they just were completely lost.

349
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,500
 Men and women and children. Children really didn't have a choice, right?

350
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,500
 The parents are going to do it. They're kind of stuck.

351
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,500
 They begin to hang out with him.

352
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:29,500
 Now, he had a pretty strict setup. It's all about healthy eating, no drinking, no smoking, no drugs.

353
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,500
 Let's live a healthy lifestyle. We can be good together.

354
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:39,500
 But with the Seventh Day Adventist Church, they start to look at him and go, "He's not one of our ministers.

355
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:45,500
 He seems to be doing his own thing within the confines of our church. It's almost like he has a shadow church, a separate church."

356
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,500
 They start to cut ties with him.

357
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:52,500
 And around the same time, he starts to be very vocal about his apocalyptic prophecies.

358
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,500
 This is taking place in the 70s.

359
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,500
 This is past Charles Manson. I believe it's past Johnstown as well.

360
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,500
 I don't know the date of that off the top of my head, but the Colts wore a no one thing of this time.

361
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,500
 Mooneys were around all that. Nobody believes they're in a cult when they're in a cult, though.

362
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,500
 And generally, people in cults are fairly smart.

363
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,500
 People in cults tend to be people who think they're too smart to join a cult in the first place, because they can't get fooled.

364
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:20,500
 A lot of times when we look at membership of cults, they're not yokels. Some of them might be.

365
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,500
 But for the most part, they're at least of average intelligence.

366
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:29,500
 So anyways, he decides that this isn't where they're at right now. Let's move out to middle of nowhere.

367
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,500
 We're going to start a commune. We're going to have healthy living.

368
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,500
 We are going to prepare for the eventual end of the world. So they start this commune out in the middle of nowhere.

369
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,500
 And he's sitting on this hill one day and he sees all of his followers.

370
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,500
 At this point, he had about 30 people in his group.

371
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:51,500
 12 adults, 22 children. Some teenagers, some younger, but basically families.

372
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:59,500
 And he's sitting on this hill one day and he's watching his little people build this town that they're eventually going to settle in, have this commune set up.

373
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,500
 And he referred to them as ants. They look like ants on an ant hill.

374
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,500
 So he began calling them the ant hill kids.

375
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:15,500
 Which is an interesting name for a cult. A lot of times they're like the last light of the brotherhood, or you know, the setting sun, something like that.

376
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,500
 The ant hill kids. He calls them that.

377
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:23,500
 And he would give his sermons. Very, very charismatic. People loved being there. People were growing their vegetables.

378
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:30,500
 He was growing this healthy lifestyle and then he has the revelation.

379
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,500
 The curtains are drawn back.

380
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:43,500
 And he actually sees that the world will end. Not in some far off time, but in February 1979.

381
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,500
 He starts to put some strict rules into place.

382
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:53,500
 The members of the ant hill kids cannot talk to friends and family who are not in the group. That's cult 101.

383
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:59,500
 That is so ingrained into cult behavior that that is what abusive relationships do.

384
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:06,500
 It's so bizarre. Because there's not really, as far as I know, there's not a manual on how to be an ass.

385
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:10,500
 But you start to see that behavior just kind of generalized.

386
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:15,500
 Whenever you talk to someone who's been in an abusive relationship, 98% of the time,

387
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:21,500
 looking back on it, they don't know that they're getting into it, but looking back on it, one of the first red flags is

388
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,500
 they were no longer able to contact anyone else.

389
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,500
 Or they can only contact them as long as their boyfriend or their girlfriend said it was okay, stuff like that.

390
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,500
 Cults do the exact same thing.

391
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,500
 Limit exposure to the outside world. You don't have to worry about wrong think.

392
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,500
 So that was the first thing.

393
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:41,500
 And eventually February 1979 comes along and spoiler alert, the world doesn't end.

394
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,500
 So people start to get upset.

395
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:50,500
 If you are going to start a cult, and I recommend you don't, but if you are going to start a cult, set the prophecy way far ahead.

396
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:55,500
 I understand why you want to set the prophecy now, because it gives everything a sense of urgency.

397
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,500
 But that day will come and you will be wrong.

398
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,500
 And then you got to deal with this.

399
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:08,500
 A lot of times what happens when the prophecy is set and it doesn't come to fruition, is you lose a bunch of members.

400
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,500
 You tend to lose almost all your members and then you have the diehard stick around.

401
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,500
 That didn't really happen this time.

402
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,500
 Maybe it's because they were in the middle of nowhere.

403
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,500
 Maybe it was because contact had already been cut off.

404
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,500
 But it doesn't come around. People are a little upset.

405
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,500
 And that's when Rock realizes that he needs to really consolidate control.

406
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,500
 Anyways, so this is when things really go downhill.

407
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,500
 And again, if you've listened to the episode this long and you're like, "This isn't that disgusting."

408
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,500
 Ugh.

409
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,500
 He starts drinking.

410
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,500
 Now remember that whole healthy living thing?

411
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,500
 No, no, no. That's only for the peons, you see.

412
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,500
 The leaders can drink.

413
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,500
 Not you.

414
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,500
 So he's drinking to the point he develops a serious alcohol problem.

415
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:52,500
 He makes it so the cult members can't even talk to each other unless he's present.

416
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,500
 They can't sleep with each other unless he gives them permission.

417
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,500
 But to make sure things don't get too crazy, right?

418
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,500
 You're not going to deprive people of sex.

419
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,500
 He says he can sleep with the women.

420
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:08,500
 In fact, he has to sleep with every single woman in the group.

421
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,500
 God commanded it.

422
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,500
 God commanded it.

423
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:17,500
 He begins spying on people and then he would confront them saying that God told them what they had said or what they had did.

424
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,500
 He's consolidating his power.

425
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,500
 How else would anyone know what we said?

426
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,500
 God must have told them that.

427
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,500
 One of the ways they raised money was to go out into town and sell baked goods.

428
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,500
 And they had quotas.

429
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,500
 Did it mean the quota?

430
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,500
 You were punished.

431
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,500
 You talked without permission?

432
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,500
 You were punished.

433
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,500
 You slept with someone without permission?

434
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,500
 You were definitely punished.

435
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,500
 You questioned him?

436
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,500
 You were punished.

437
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,500
 There's a sliding scale to what a human will endure, right?

438
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:51,500
 If you walked into a room and someone hit you over the head with a sledgehammer,

439
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,500
 assuming you survived the attack, you'd leave the room.

440
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,500
 But if you walked into a room and he stepped on a tack,

441
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,500
 it would suck.

442
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,500
 You continue to hang out in the room and you get stung by a bee.

443
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,500
 Hang out in the room a little bit longer.

444
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,500
 A kernel gets stuck in between your gum line and your tooth.

445
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,500
 So eventually you've been in the room for two years

446
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,500
 and you get hit on the back of the head with a sledgehammer.

447
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,500
 You've been acclimated to the pain of that room.

448
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,500
 It's another thing we see in cults.

449
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,500
 They never jump to the most extreme thing first.

450
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,500
 And it's, again, abusive relationships.

451
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,500
 It's never...

452
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,500
 You're not getting punched on the first date, right?

453
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,500
 Punishments began with getting hit with a belt.

454
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,500
 You get hit with a belt.

455
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,500
 Pluck your hair out one by one.

456
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,500
 An annoyance? Not fun?

457
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,500
 It would hurt a little bit.

458
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,500
 Sometimes rock would just walk up and poop on you.

459
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,500
 Which, that's kind of funny, right?

460
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,500
 Like, it wouldn't be funny if it was happening to me,

461
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,500
 but if someone goes, "Listen, I can hit you with a belt,

462
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,500
 or I can poop on you."

463
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,500
 I'd be like, "How big's the belt?"

464
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,500
 Right, like, 'cause I really don't care.

465
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,500
 Eventually the torments escalated.

466
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,500
 And again, these people are committing fairly minor violations

467
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,500
 of this guy's made-up law.

468
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,500
 He started making them eat poop.

469
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,500
 Now, it's funny. I actually got a comment not too long ago,

470
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:08,500
 and they were like, "Jason, please stop doing poop stories."

471
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,500
 And I was like, "Oh, I've only done like three in the past,

472
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,500
 like two months."

473
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,500
 Didn't realize this was also a poop story.

474
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,500
 They were being made to eat their own poop, or other people's poop.

475
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,500
 They're also being made to eat dead animals, like dead mice,

476
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,500
 which, again, I'd be like, "How big's the mouse?"

477
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,500
 Like, I'd much rather just eat the mouse at that point.

478
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,500
 But then, of course, it gets worse.

479
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,500
 Because it not only became not only an issue of punishing someone,

480
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:36,500
 but another member of the cult proving loyalty to rock.

481
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,500
 So when someone broke a rule, he would no longer walk up and poop on them.

482
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,500
 He would give you a pair of bolt cutters,

483
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,500
 take off one of their toes.

484
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,500
 That person lied to me. Take off one of their fingers.

485
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,500
 Members of the Anhill Kids were being dismembered.

486
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,500
 It's 1982.

487
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,500
 This has been going on for years.

488
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,500
 Keeps escalating.

489
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,500
 "You broke a rule. We're gonna break your legs."

490
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,500
 Rock walks in with a sledgehammer.

491
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,500
 "No, I have a better idea."

492
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:13,500
 "You broke the rules. You have to break your own legs with a sledgehammer."

493
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,500
 So there, surrounded by fellow cult members,

494
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:21,500
 looking up at your leader, smelling the alcohol on his breath,

495
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,500
 he hands you a sledgehammer,

496
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:29,500
 and you smash one of your own legs until it's broken.

497
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,500
 And then things get really bad,

498
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,500
 because Rock begins to see himself as a non-caporial being,

499
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,500
 a healing spirit.

500
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,500
 He doesn't need medicine to cure you.

501
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:46,500
 He can heal you himself, so he begins to do impromptu and unneeded surgeries.

502
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,500
 At this point, we're in the late 80s,

503
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,500
 and there's a woman named Gabrielle LaValley,

504
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,500
 who has been being punished this whole time.

505
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,500
 She's being burned.

506
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:01,500
 She had a hypernarmic needle inserted into her back and broken off.

507
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,500
 Teeth pulled out.

508
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,500
 After she had one of her breasts cut,

509
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,500
 chunks of one of her breasts cut off,

510
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,500
 and she escapes.

511
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,500
 She leaves the compound.

512
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,500
 And then the weirdest thing happens,

513
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,500
 and I've seen this happen in other cult stories too.

514
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,500
 She comes back.

515
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,500
 She comes back.

516
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,500
 Now, I don't know if it's because it's like that abused again.

517
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,500
 I think there's so many parallels.

518
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,500
 You leave an abusive relationship, he sweet talks you back.

519
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,500
 I don't know if it's that.

520
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,500
 I don't know if she left, and they were in the middle of nowhere,

521
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,500
 and she had to return, or she left and realized that there was nothing out there for her,

522
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,500
 the abusive love of the compound.

523
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,500
 Because love filled with hate is better than no love at all.

524
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,500
 I don't believe that. Absolutely.

525
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,500
 I absolutely believe a life that is loveless

526
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,500
 is better than a life filled with false love,

527
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:55,500
 which is what this is, in which abusive relationship would be the same thing.

528
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,500
 It's better to just die alone.

529
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:02,500
 And to be in a relationship with someone who despises you so much that they hurt you

530
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,500
 physically or emotionally, or both hurt your soul.

531
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,500
 Anyway, she comes back.

532
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,500
 Did you imagine?

533
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,500
 You had eight teeth pulled out.

534
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,500
 Watching this stuff happen to these kids, watching this stuff happen to adults.

535
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,500
 Part of her breast removed.

536
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,500
 How would you even get a hyperneuromagnetal out of your back?

537
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,500
 Anyway, she comes back.

538
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,500
 She's welcome back into the compound, obviously.

539
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,500
 They're not going to keep her outside.

540
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,500
 They don't have a ton of members.

541
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,500
 Of course, he's sleeping with the women, so they're having more kids,

542
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:36,500
 but it takes a while to get a real group going.

543
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:42,500
 You know, these kids, you have to age up to become super brainwashed soldiers in this cult.

544
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:46,500
 See, they bring her back, but of course, she's going to be punished.

545
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,500
 What I find interesting is, remember, these people are selling baked goods in town,

546
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,500
 and I find it weird that the people in town weren't picking up on a lot of these clues.

547
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,500
 To be fair, the police did want to investigate this.

548
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,500
 They were seeing some of the way that the people were dressed,

549
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,500
 the kids were dressed when they came into town.

550
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,500
 Locals were like, "I think something's going on out there."

551
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,500
 The police, though, were stymied because they were a religion.

552
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,500
 They couldn't go into a full investigation.

553
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,500
 Those laws have changed for the most part.

554
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,500
 Local police are still a little iffy to go kick down the door of a church,

555
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,500
 but now they're a little more aware that this type of stuff could be going on.

556
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,500
 But again, you're supposed to be selling baked goods.

557
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:30,500
 It's kind of hard to, with this image,

558
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,500
 you figure out eventually she would have went to go sell you some cookies.

559
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,500
 You notice something was off about her.

560
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:40,500
 She comes back to the compound. Gabriella, they take off a couple of her fingers with bolt cutters.

561
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:45,500
 Then they hold her arm down and stab a knife through her hand into the table,

562
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:49,500
 which to be honest, I've seen in action movies, things like that.

563
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:54,500
 I guess I knew it was possible, but the amount of force it would take to put a knife through

564
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,500
 the hand and pin it to a table would be an amazing amount of force.

565
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,500
 You'd have to pull a hammer out at some point to really get it in there.

566
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,500
 But that's nothing. This has happened before.

567
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:10,500
 This cult has done worse and they plan to do even worse this time.

568
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:15,500
 They took a chainsaw and cut off her arm as she's pinned to the table.

569
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,500
 Don't you think the townspeople would have realized these people were missing fingers,

570
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,500
 missing teeth, missing an arm?

571
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:27,500
 There's photos of them just smiling, hanging out with the leader.

572
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:34,500
 1987, the townspeople do have enough and the police finally go into the compound.

573
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,500
 Take a look around.

574
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:42,500
 Remove 17 kids. They said this filthy environment these kids aren't being taken care of.

575
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,500
 17 kids are removed from the compound.

576
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:50,500
 But can't do a full investigation. They are a church, a separation of church and state.

577
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,500
 Everyone else is left there.

578
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:58,500
 Now can you imagine being in that compound at that time and watching those cops come in?

579
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,500
 Now the part of you you haven't seen, you've been there since 1977.

580
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,500
 It's 1987. You've been in there for 10 years.

581
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:09,500
 Sure you've been on the street corner selling Susie Q's and stuff like that, but

582
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,500
 now you have police coming in. Part of you scared, but part of you is hoping,

583
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,500
 wishing that this is the end.

584
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,500
 So you don't betray your leader, but it just ends.

585
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:22,500
 All of this ends. Maybe not for you, but at least for your kids.

586
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,500
 But then the cops round up those 17 kids and the whole time you're hoping,

587
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,500
 they'll turn around, they'll see something.

588
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,500
 This will all be over, but they leave with those kids.

589
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:39,500
 Those doors shut. You're still in that compound.

590
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:44,500
 1989, Solange Boylard.

591
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,500
 She's sick to her stomach. She's not feeling good,

592
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:53,500
 which is totally fine because their leader is a healing spirit.

593
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,500
 He's got it. He can take care of this.

594
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,500
 Now healing spirits don't need anesthesia, right?

595
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,500
 They got the power in them.

596
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,500
 You're not going to feel a thing.

597
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:11,500
 They give her an enema with molasses and olive oil.

598
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:15,500
 That doesn't work, obviously. Just something disgusting.

599
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,500
 Now remember, she's just complaining about stomach ache.

600
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:23,500
 So Rock cuts her stomach open, begins pulling her intestines out with his bare hands

601
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,500
 and rips them.

602
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,500
 The healing power of Rock, your dear leader.

603
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,500
 No anesthetic, remember?

604
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:37,500
 Gabriella, who once escaped, now has one arm, is ordered to sew up Solange,

605
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,500
 which must have been a hard to do with one arm.

606
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,500
 He probably picked her because it was so difficult for her to do.

607
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:51,500
 The next step of this miracle cure is to put a long hose down Solange's throat

608
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:56,500
 and then blow hard.

609
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:03,500
 It takes her a day to die, but she does die.

610
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:08,500
 And it's an affront to this great mystical being.

611
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:12,500
 This healer of men, this all-powerful leader.

612
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:18,500
 But he has a way to bring her back to life, to prove that God is on his side.

613
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:24,500
 He drills a hole in her skull and himself and all the other men in the compound

614
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:29,500
 ejaculate into her brain.

615
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,500
 Doesn't work, obviously.

616
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:35,500
 So they bury her body off the compound grounds.

617
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,500
 And as far as Rock is concerned, he just goes about his daily business

618
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:47,500
 of tormenting, terrorizing, and creating a life of fear for all of his followers.

619
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,500
 Gabriella escapes again.

620
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,500
 This time she doesn't return back home.

621
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,500
 Police, though, do.

622
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,500
 They dig up the body.

623
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,500
 They arrest Rock.

624
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,500
 They arrest some other members of the cult.

625
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,500
 Children are taken into protective custody.

626
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,500
 Rock is sentenced to life in prison.

627
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,500
 And he got life in prison.

628
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,500
 Because you can imagine how popular this dude was, right?

629
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,500
 February 28, 2011.

630
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,500
 So he got arrested in 1989.

631
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,500
 So he was there for a while.

632
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,500
 He was there for quite a long time.

633
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:22,500
 But February 28, 2011, this guy named Matthew Gerald McDonald.

634
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,500
 60 years old.

635
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,500
 Rock was 63 by the time 2011 came around.

636
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,500
 Matthew, who's 60 years old, by all definition, an elderly man,

637
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:34,500
 walks up to a guard station one day, puts a knife down on the counter,

638
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,500
 and says, quote, "That piece of shit is down on the range.

639
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,500
 Here's the knife.

640
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,500
 I've sliced them up."

641
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,500
 That was his life sentence.

642
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,500
 To go from being a man who had all of these people enthralled,

643
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:54,500
 to being an inmate number, getting deloused, getting pushed around by COs,

644
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,500
 being belittled by other prisoners.

645
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,500
 All that power he had gone.

646
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,500
 He's now on the other side of the coin.

647
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:04,500
 He's now the pathetic little follower.

648
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:11,500
 Colts are a fascinating subject, because it really is this idea of this one man

649
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,500
 having complete control over other people.

650
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,500
 And we see cult-like activities in politics.

651
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,500
 We see it in industries.

652
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,500
 You could say, like, Elon Musk has a cult following,

653
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,500
 or Steve Jobs has a cult following.

654
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,500
 You could say Trump has a cult following, or Bernie Sanders has a cult following.

655
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:33,500
 But when we use those examples, they're cult-light,

656
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,500
 or cult with little asterisks next to it.

657
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:41,500
 The Anheal Kids is an actual definition of a cult.

658
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:47,500
 It's a subset of a major religion that turned from light to darkness like that.

659
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:54,500
 Within two years, people were getting beaten after they tried establishing a heaven on Earth

660
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,500
 to spend their final days before Jesus returned.

661
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,500
 It's fascinating. It's one of those things that I think a lot of people...

662
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:04,500
 I believe that cults are the thinking man's serial killer.

663
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,500
 I think a lot of people are into serial killers, and that's fine.

664
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,500
 I was never a huge fan of them, or read a lot of true crime,

665
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:14,500
 but I think serial killers, for the most part, it's like, "Eh, it just gets old."

666
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:19,500
 You profiled one serial killer, you profiled them all, as Dana Scully once said.

667
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,500
 Cult, as even though they share a lot of similarities with other cults,

668
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:27,500
 I find more fascinating than serial killers, because it really takes two elements.

669
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:33,500
 A cult leader, and an otherwise normal human being to follow the cult leader.

670
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:37,500
 And that otherwise normal human being has to be able to endure things.

671
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:43,500
 That me telling you, basically this episode was a list of horrible events, right?

672
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,500
 And it is in linear order.

673
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,500
 And to be honest, I left some out.

674
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,500
 And it requires a normal person to wake up every day

675
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:56,500
 and to watch these events happen, and to simply disregard them.

676
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,500
 Even when they were happening to themselves.

677
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,500
 And again, I think that's why cults are a...

678
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,500
 Serial killer is just kind of an event that happens.

679
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:10,500
 Cult are an interesting thing, because you can tie it into the cult of Apple,

680
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,500
 where you need to have all the Apple products.

681
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,500
 But you can also, again, that's like a cult light thing.

682
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,500
 A cult is really just a...

683
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:24,500
 More people involved of an abusive relationship.

684
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,500
 All of these cults activities and tricks and stuff are the same thing

685
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:31,500
 that people use when they want to control people in an abusive relationship.

686
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:37,500
 And to people outside of the relationship, it seems absolutely nuts they're still together, right?

687
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,500
 But, yeah, cults are basically an abusive relationship.

688
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,500
 It's your abusive boyfriend, your abusive girlfriend,

689
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:47,500
 but you're sharing that significant other with 20 other people.

690
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,500
 But the tactics are the same.

691
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,500
 So that's the story of the Anheal Kids.

692
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:55,500
 I hope I didn't ruin your day just by reading out a list of horrible things.

693
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,500
 Because that's basically...

694
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,500
 Basically what it was.

695
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,500
 But I think we cover a lot of monsters on this show.

696
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,500
 We cover a lot of high level conspiracy theories on this show,

697
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,500
 but sometimes it's important to take a look at true human evil.

698
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,500
 It's not something I want to do all the time.

699
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,500
 I think that would be a different podcast,

700
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,500
 but it's something that we should look at from time to time.

701
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,500
 True human evil.

702
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,500
 Because I think it's important for us to be aware of it as well.

703
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,500
 Whether it's a cult, whether it's some crazy cult like this,

704
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:26,500
 or there is an abusive relationship going on at your workplace,

705
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,500
 at your school, at your hometown,

706
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:34,500
 we can look for those signs when you see the person come in and they're like,

707
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,500
 "Hey, how'd you break your wrist?"

708
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,500
 "Oh, it's nothing."

709
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,500
 "It's golfing."

710
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,500
 "What?"

711
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,500
 "Golfing, how'd you break your wrist?"

712
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,500
 "Oh, I was just doing the laundry and I fell down."

713
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,500
 "Broke my ankle."

714
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,500
 "Both of them."

715
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,500
 If the people in town had been asking this question,

716
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,500
 it's really been pushing for an investigation.

717
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,500
 It's possible that lives would have been saved.

718
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,500
 Limbs would have been saved.

719
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,500
 Psychological torment would have been saved.

720
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,500
 So just because we're not in the relationship,

721
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,500
 just because we're not in the cult,

722
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,500
 doesn't mean our duty is to do nothing.

723
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:06,500
 It's good for us to look around at people who may need our help.

724
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,500
 Because they may be trying to leave that relationship.

725
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,500
 They may be trying to leave that compound.

726
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,500
 But if they think there's nothing for them on the outside,

727
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:19,500
 they will stay there, no matter how bad it gets.
