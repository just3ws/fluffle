1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 A man in Iran has a plan, but nobody knows what it is.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,680
 And then we take a look at a bizarre new conspiracy that I just made up.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,680
 Why didn't make it up?

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,120
 I just discovered, I meant to say.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,440
 I'm not gonna say that it answers the questions to everything, like I did yesterday's conspiracy

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:26,280
 theory, but I will say you will find yourself chilled to the bone when we take a look at

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,040
 the Saint Bernard conspiracy.

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,040
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:41,040
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,200
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,040
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,800
 Insomnia is still in full swing, I'm recording this episode at 1 in the morning.

13
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,920
 Which I think you expect most paranormal podcasts are recorded late at night.

14
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,920
 I normally do them in the sun.

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,600
 Normally do them on a nice sunny day.

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,600
 But I can't sleep.

17
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,600
 So I'm up.

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,160
 And here we go, we're recording today's episode.

19
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,600
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Rolf.

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,280
 Everyone kind of pausing before I pronounce his name again.

21
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,200
 Everyone give a round of applause to Rolf.

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,360
 Oh, damn it.

23
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,360
 To Rolf.

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,360
 Sorry.

25
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,360
 R-O-L-F.

26
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,320
 So it's like wolf, but with an R in front of it.

27
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,960
 Long time listeners of the show.

28
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,760
 I've been able to hide it for quite a while.

29
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,800
 Long time listeners of the show know about my speech impediment.

30
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:36,840
 So thank you, Rolf, for bringing that once again to the forefront.

31
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,760
 You're going to be our captain or he's all standing there.

32
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,360
 Not on a con, it's okay.

33
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,480
 He's a little ashamed that he exposed this secret once again.

34
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,280
 Rolf, you're going to be our captain.

35
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,520
 I don't want to be on this episode, bro.

36
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,520
 Come here.

37
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,520
 Come here.

38
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,720
 Rolf, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

39
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,280
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

40
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,160
 Just help spread the word about the show.

41
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,960
 Really, really helps out a lot.

42
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:00,960
 So R-O-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-

43
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:10,120
 So Rolf, and actually before we continue, let me go ahead, today's Fan Art Friday, so

44
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,840
 you'll see that we have new art for today.

45
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,160
 And today's art is by Lux D. Wakari on Twitter.

46
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,240
 Friend of the show Lux created this artwork of Mormon Bigfoot.

47
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,680
 So I really appreciate it.

48
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,680
 It's totally awesome.

49
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,000
 We got a little classic Bigfoot pose holding the Book of Mormon a little tight.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Really appreciate that, Lux.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,080
 So that is our selection for Fan Art Friday.

52
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,760
 Okay, now Rolf, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the dead rabbit, Durgible.

53
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,960
 We are leaving behind the land of Sleepy Time, which I'm currently on the border of, and

54
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,280
 we are headed out to Iran.

55
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,240
 Durgible is flying through the Sleepy Time Mountains over the Sleepy Time Clouds, past

56
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,240
 the NAP Gorge.

57
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,080
 I don't know, they ran out of names.

58
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,600
 The map makers aren't very good in Sleepy Land.

59
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,000
 We're headed back to Iran.

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,240
 The year is 1990.

61
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,640
 There's a man named Hossein Sabzian.

62
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,080
 And Hossein is riding on the bus one day, like he normally does, just taking the bus.

63
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:15,000
 And he's holding a copy of the script for a movie called The Cyclist, made by a very

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,120
 famous director known as Mozan Makhamblath.

65
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,920
 He's a huge cinema fan.

66
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,920
 He loves cinema.

67
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,840
 I love cinema too, but you'll never catch me walking around with a script for a cheerleader

68
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,360
 massacre too, or any of my other favorite movies.

69
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,600
 Might wear a Transformer shirt, but that's beside the point.

70
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,960
 This guy really loves movies, and he has a script for one of the movies of one of Iran's

71
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,560
 most famous directors, and he's on the bus.

72
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,680
 And there's a woman next to him, and she goes, "Oh, oh, you know, you have that book.

73
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,680
 You have the book.

74
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,680
 Give me the book."

75
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,120
 It's the only copy of the script they're shooting the movie across town.

76
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,280
 She's like, "Oh, you have that book, The Cyclist.

77
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,280
 You have that script."

78
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,920
 And he's like, "Oh yeah, yeah I do.

79
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,600
 I happen to be holding the script for The Cyclist."

80
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,800
 So the movie had come out like three years earlier.

81
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,680
 Again, it wasn't Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

82
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,160
 They weren't trying to get the script to the director.

83
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,640
 It was like a published version of the script.

84
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,480
 The woman's like, "Oh, you know, I'm a huge fan of that movie, The Cyclist."

85
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:19,240
 And this is what fascinates me about this story, is the split second decisions.

86
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:25,480
 And she goes, "Hey, I really, really liked that movie.

87
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,240
 Turns to her and says, 'Oh, I'm glad you liked it.'

88
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,240
 I directed it."

89
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,160
 She's like, "What?"

90
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,840
 He goes, "My name is Mosin Maklaboth."

91
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,400
 She's like, "I'm pretty sure that's not how you pronounce the name."

92
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,320
 So I think you'd be proud of me, but she doesn't pick up on it because he actually pronounces

93
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,320
 it correctly.

94
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,320
 She's like, "Oh my."

95
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,600
 He's like, "Yeah, I'm actually just taking this bus because, you know, my chauffeur, I

96
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,000
 gave him the day off, so I'm on this bus today."

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,280
 But I directed this movie.

98
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,400
 That is why I have this script that you could buy at Barnes & Noble, but I loved it so much

99
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,440
 I wouldn't have bought it at Barnes & Noble.

100
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,120
 So he begins to pass himself off as this famous director.

101
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,680
 Now this is 1990, so it's not like she could pull out her phone if she was suspicious and

102
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,200
 hold up a picture of him or anything like that.

103
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,040
 And also, she's probably just taking him at his word.

104
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,560
 She definitely takes him at his word because she invites him home.

105
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,920
 This woman, she's a married woman with two kids, says, "Hey, why don't you come home?"

106
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,480
 And my kids love film.

107
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,480
 They actually want to be in movies.

108
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,480
 And he's like, "Oh, great.

109
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,960
 I'll put him in my next movie."

110
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,640
 So his deceit, the first thing was just kind of a knee-jerk reaction, but now he's building

111
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,640
 on this deceit.

112
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,680
 He starts hanging out at the house.

113
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,000
 Starts hanging out at the house of the Anakaw family.

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 So he's meeting there.

115
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,160
 He's meeting, that was Mrs. Anakaw.

116
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,160
 He's meeting the kids.

117
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,160
 He's like, "Oh, you guys want to be in movies?"

118
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,800
 They're like, "Oh, yeah, movies are super dope."

119
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
 He's always hyping them up.

120
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,680
 He's like, "Hey, let's do some casting.

121
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,840
 Let's figure this stuff out."

122
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,000
 He's like bringing in green screens and stuff like that.

123
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 He's hyping them up.

124
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,080
 He's saying, "Oh, yeah, I'm going to put you in this movie."

125
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,080
 And I should be fair.

126
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,560
 These movies, I read the synopsis of the movie, The Cyclist.

127
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,360
 If a director came to my house and was like, "Hey, you want to be in the new G.I. Joe movie?"

128
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,760
 I'd be like, "Yeah, dope, dude."

129
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,200
 But this guy made art films and stuff.

130
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,360
 He made a movie called The Cyclist about this dude in Afghanistan who was trying to pay for

131
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,800
 his wife's medical treatment.

132
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,160
 It's fascinating, but I wouldn't want to be in it.

133
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,160
 Kind of boring.

134
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,960
 Even though it's about the human condition.

135
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,160
 This guy in Afghanistan is super poor and he's trying to pay for his wife's medical condition.

136
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,880
 He used to be an endurance athlete.

137
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,320
 And at one point he tries faking his death by hiding under a car and they find him.

138
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,320
 They're like, "Dude, we just saw you crawl under the car."

139
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,960
 Obviously, crawling under the car doesn't kill you unless Pennywise is under there.

140
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,480
 The circus promoter says, "Tell you what, you can raise money for your dying wife if

141
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,480
 you ride a-

142
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:48,760
 If you ride a bicycle around in a circle for seven days straight, we'll make a big promotion

143
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,760
 of it.

144
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,960
 And you can raise money for your wife."

145
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,320
 So it's about this poor Afghanist Danny dude riding a bicycle around in a circle for seven

146
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,320
 days.

147
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,320
 That's the whole movie.

148
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,320
 The movie's not seven days long.

149
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,320
 Don't worry.

150
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,320
 It's like two hours.

151
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,040
 But he's riding the bike around in the circle and then people start setting up vendor shops

152
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,160
 around him and it becomes this big circus, which is what the promoter expected.

153
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,880
 And then you have people show up and gamble on him and people are trying to sabotage him

154
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,880
 and stuff like that.

155
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,840
 And he's riding his IV bag and he's just riding his bike.

156
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,840
 He can't sleep.

157
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,040
 His eyes are propped open, I guess.

158
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,800
 I think they'd have to be.

159
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,360
 He just rides around in a circle for seven days and at the ending, I watched the ending,

160
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,200
 he's riding around in a circle so many times that he's exhausted.

161
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,680
 He's done the seven days but he's so exhausted he can't hear everyone going, "You did it,

162
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,840
 you did it, stop, stop."

163
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,000
 And like some little dude runs out of the crowd and's like trying to get him off the

164
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,840
 bike to like, but he can't.

165
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,680
 He's stuck in that cycle.

166
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,080
 And then his spoiler alert.

167
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,560
 I'm pretty sure his wife dies because they show her going, "Ugh."

168
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,880
 Which is the universal sign of somebody dying, right?

169
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,880
 When they go, "Ugh."

170
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,400
 But maybe she just had a sprit.

171
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
 I don't know.

172
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
 Ah.

173
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,400
 And it was a translation error.

174
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:00,080
 But the point is, is that like he was trapped in that cycle and how society was using him.

175
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,080
 Fascinating.

176
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,080
 I wouldn't want to be in it.

177
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,080
 It's not my type of movie.

178
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,680
 And now if in that movie he's riding a bicycle around and then like two feet away, there's

179
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,280
 a cheerleader's getting massacred.

180
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,280
 I'm in.

181
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,280
 I'm in.

182
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,280
 I know.

183
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,480
 But these kids are like, "Oh yeah, dude.

184
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,560
 We totally love like Paul Thomas Anderson and all that art house garbage.

185
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,280
 What's being this?

186
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,280
 Let's totally do this."

187
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,360
 I like Paul Thomas Anderson.

188
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,200
 But we're just going to be black and white.

189
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,920
 And he's like, "Of course it's going to be."

190
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
 Yes!

191
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,920
 Awesome.

192
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,920
 Woo!

193
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,920
 No one's going to watch this movie.

194
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,920
 It's going to be great.

195
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,920
 And this goes on for about two weeks.

196
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,920
 He keeps swinging by the house.

197
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:33,720
 And he's like, "Hey guys, want to talk about that movie that we're going to make?"

198
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,720
 So funny.

199
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,640
 How can you keep pulling off this fraud?

200
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,240
 How does he not feel super guilty every time he walks into that house?

201
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,680
 He's just making up these lines.

202
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,080
 And there's one person who knows that this dude's lying.

203
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,360
 It's the dad of the family, Mr. Onakar.

204
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,320
 Is like, "This dude's not a director."

205
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,760
 "This dude's not a- I can guarantee."

206
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,760
 "Oh no.

207
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,720
 Why are you being so mean, Bill?"

208
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,080
 It goes to the point where he finds a journalist who apparently had worked with Mosin or had

209
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,320
 covered him at some point.

210
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,960
 Because again, you could have pulled up the internet and show photos and be like, "It's

211
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,560
 obviously not him."

212
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,640
 They did have a- the dad will call him Bill.

213
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,960
 Did go get a magazine and brought it home and goes, "Look it.

214
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,960
 Here's a picture.

215
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,080
 This guy is way younger than the dude in our living room."

216
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,080
 "Oh Bill.

217
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,920
 What being such a spoil-spoil, you'll never be in the movie if you get- of course I'm

218
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,920
 not going to be in the movie.

219
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,400
 There is no movie."

220
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,800
 Bill eventually brings a journalist into his house and he goes, "Hey, do I have a story

221
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,800
 for you?

222
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,240
 There's a guy who keeps swinging by my house pretending to be the famous film director

223
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,240
 Mosin."

224
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,240
 The journalist comes in and they're just kind of waiting around.

225
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,800
 The journalist is like, "When's he going to get here?

226
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
 Are you sure he's coming?"

227
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,240
 And Bill's like, "Yeah, he's coming.

228
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,760
 He comes all the time."

229
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,640
 Sure enough, front door opens.

230
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:51,880
 Hossain walks in and the journalist is like, "That is 100% not that film director."

231
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,680
 So they call the cops and the journalist is just sitting there the whole time drinking

232
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,760
 his tea like some sort of pond villain because the second the cops show up, the journalist

233
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:06,160
 begins taking photos of this man getting yanked out of the house for fraud.

234
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,360
 That was a big story in the newspaper that day.

235
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,720
 Now in another part of Iran, there was a film director named Abbas Kirastami.

236
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,480
 He's making a movie, he's making probably some black and white art house movie about,

237
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,040
 I don't know, the human condition, something I wouldn't watch.

238
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,040
 Something I wouldn't watch.

239
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,680
 I'd watch one about the transformer conditioning.

240
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,320
 Across town he's shooting this movie and he's reading the newspaper at the same time,

241
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,320
 not a very good director.

242
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,720
 They're like, "Aren't you going to see what's going on?"

243
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,240
 Nah, I'm reading the newspaper today.

244
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,320
 He's reading the newspaper and he reads this article about Hossain and about the family

245
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,280
 and about pretending to be the director and Abbas goes, "Okay guys, this movie's done.

246
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,440
 We're not making this movie anymore.

247
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,440
 We're putting it on hold."

248
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
 And everyone's like, "What are you talking about?"

249
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,760
 He's like, "There's a movie I have to make right now."

250
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,440
 I don't think Hossain was thrown in jail, but he was charged with fraud.

251
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,360
 And that was a sticky issue because the only thing that he actually got from them was at

252
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,120
 one point he asked one of the sons for cab fare home, which, you know, what is that,

253
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,720
 like 20 bucks, something like that, 15 bucks.

254
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,360
 The idea was that he was planning on defrauding them for a large amount of money.

255
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,720
 That was kind of the working theory, but I don't think he was in jail.

256
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,920
 I think they arrested him and they're like, "You got to come back to trial.

257
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,280
 I'm not really sure how the Iranian justice system works."

258
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:24,480
 But Abbas does visit Hossain and he goes, "Hey, I want to make a movie about it.

259
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,360
 I want to make a movie about what's going on right now, but I need you to do something.

260
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,040
 I need you to rush the trial."

261
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,040
 Because I got another movie.

262
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,160
 They're still thinking I'm on the set.

263
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,760
 He made a big dummy out of straw and put it in the director's chair and they were like,

264
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,920
 "Abbas, how do you like this shot?"

265
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,720
 There's a little tape recorder, "Good shot, move on."

266
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,400
 He's like, "Dude, I got to finish that other movie, but I want to shoot this one so you

267
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,360
 need to move the trial date up."

268
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,920
 Then he talks to the judge and he goes, "Hey, can I put cameras in your courtroom?"

269
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,760
 And the judge is like, "Yeah, sure."

270
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,760
 Abbas goes to the family and says, "Hey, how would you guys like to be in a movie?"

271
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,200
 So that goes to trial and the judge is looking at all this stuff.

272
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,440
 He sees this young man, he's a father, Hossain's a father, and he goes, "You know, there really

273
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,920
 no crime to play."

274
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,160
 Yeah, he borrowed some money.

275
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,960
 He goes, "Can we drop the charges?"

276
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,760
 He asks the family, he says, "He didn't really do anything wrong."

277
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,640
 Like, he lied and that's wrong, but can you drop the charges?

278
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,360
 And Bill said, "You know, I will drop the charges against him if he promises to become

279
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,080
 a productive member of society."

280
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:28,480
 I.e. quit being a bum, line of people on buses, and Hossain accepts that.

281
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,440
 And the whole time Abbas, the director, is like, "Oh yes, a perfect happy ending for

282
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,000
 my story."

283
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,320
 Then the film comes together.

284
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,760
 This was Abbas's goal.

285
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:44,280
 He ended up having Hossain and the family reenact everything that happened before.

286
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:51,560
 So it's a film/documentary that's reenacted by everyone who was in it.

287
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,760
 And the movie is called Close Call.

288
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:00,400
 It's an interesting idea that you have basically a true crime case involving everyone in it.

289
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,440
 Now this is one of those few crimes that you could actually do that in.

290
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,240
 You wouldn't want to do this in a murder trial.

291
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,000
 You're like, "Hey, remember you used to live your son-in-law until he butchered your daughter?"

292
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,440
 We want to reenact like three Christmases before the crime.

293
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,440
 Let's bring them.

294
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,440
 No, we're not going to do that.

295
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,440
 We're going to do it perfectly.

296
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:22,440
 And to put a cherry on top of this happy ending true crime/documentary film, when Hossain wins

297
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,520
 the trial or doesn't end up being sentenced, who's waiting for him in a car outside the

298
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,760
 courthouse?

299
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,720
 Director Mosin Maklumbaf.

300
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,720
 He drives Hossain to the family's house.

301
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,320
 They all sit around and chat.

302
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,320
 And that's in the movie too.

303
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,560
 That's the stinger at the end of the credits.

304
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,440
 Like, you think it's a happy ending.

305
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,000
 And then Mosin's sitting in his car and it's raining.

306
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,160
 There's just a close-up on his face and he goes, "Nobody impersonates me!"

307
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,360
 And he cocks a gun and walks into the house.

308
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,360
 Then it just ends.

309
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,360
 It's a setup for close call to end game.

310
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,640
 Though there was an interesting story.

311
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,760
 Went on a little bit longer than I anticipated.

312
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,440
 But I found it very fascinating.

313
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,480
 Now someone needs to make a movie about the movie close call.

314
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,760
 Let's see if we can inception this thing as far as we go.

315
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,080
 And I wonder what this guy's up to now.

316
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,640
 I didn't like the look anyway.

317
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,640
 I don't know.

318
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,640
 Actually it's funny.

319
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,640
 The story took place in 1999.

320
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,840
 I wonder what would happen to all these people by now.

321
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:25,360
 I know Mosin left Iran because the government didn't like him that much.

322
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,720
 So hopefully everyone's doing well.

323
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,720
 I don't know.

324
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,280
 The seven ominous are just like, "I hope they're all alive."

325
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,640
 But unfortunately we can't investigate that.

326
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,200
 Rolf, call in that carpenter copter.

327
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:45,280
 We are leaving behind Iran and we are headed out to the Swiss Alps.

328
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,080
 Snow and gotta navigate between the snowflakes.

329
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,080
 He's a really good pilot.

330
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,080
 That's actually possible.

331
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,880
 Everyone's getting sick in the back seat.

332
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,880
 But it's okay.

333
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,800
 I want to not get snow on my carpenter copter.

334
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,800
 It lands.

335
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,800
 We landed a bunch of snow.

336
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,800
 It was fruitless.

337
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,800
 It's covered in snow now.

338
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,280
 We're in the western Alps.

339
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,480
 We're walking through.

340
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,640
 We're walking through the snow.

341
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,800
 We parked kind of far away from the lodge.

342
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,800
 Good job, Rolf.

343
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,040
 He's like, "Dude, you just told me to land in the Alps.

344
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,040
 You're walking through the snow."

345
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,840
 We're all getting super cold.

346
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:20,200
 We're all getting super weak.

347
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,040
 And then we all fall down.

348
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,840
 We're all laying in the snow now and we're about to die.

349
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,040
 This is the last episode of Dead Rapper Radio.

350
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:34,280
 And then out of the snow we see something coming towards us.

351
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,440
 Walking with big old feet and stuff.

352
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,440
 I don't have a lot of time.

353
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,320
 I don't know why I'm building up this segment.

354
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,200
 The last story went on too long.

355
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,520
 It's a Saint Bernard.

356
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,720
 It's a big old dog.

357
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,440
 He has a little cask around his neck, a little wooden barrel.

358
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,640
 And I'm like pushing out of the way.

359
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,640
 I'm like, "I need the brandy.

360
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,640
 I need the brandy."

361
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,040
 Glug glug glug glug glug.

362
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,720
 That's the story of the Saint Bernard's.

363
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,440
 I think most people know what they are.

364
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,880
 They are a dog breed that was bred by monks to rescue people.

365
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,120
 But is that true?

366
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,680
 Everything you know about Saint Bernard's is wrong.

367
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,320
 You're like, "Jason, I barely know anything about Saint Bernard's."

368
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,680
 So now Rolf opens up the secret entrance that's built into the Swiss Alps.

369
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,360
 We're going to go into a nice warm tunnel that leads into...

370
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,760
 Why am I building this up so much?

371
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,760
 We're in a room.

372
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,800
 We're in a room with a big old board room and I have all of these charts and strings

373
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,920
 and tax and everything tied up like a conspiracy theorist.

374
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,880
 And I turn to you and I go, "Fact, Beethoven would have died in the Alps."

375
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,880
 Where is this going?

376
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,880
 Check in your watch.

377
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,160
 I go, "Good, there's only 15 minutes left of this butt cat."

378
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,600
 "Fact, Beethoven would have died in the Alps.

379
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,520
 Beethoven is the stereotypical Saint Bernard.

380
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,360
 He's a big old slobbery mutt.

381
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,880
 But he would have died in the Alps.

382
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,760
 The dogs were first bred in the 1660s.

383
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,760
 There was no Saint Bernard dog before then.

384
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:03,160
 Dogs at the great Saint Bernard pass in Switzerland began breeding these large dogs.

385
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,360
 What the dogs would do is they would actually go out on their own.

386
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,360
 They were never trained.

387
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,040
 They would just wander through the wilderness looking for people and if they found someone

388
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,800
 they would lick them up, wake them up.

389
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,800
 I don't think...

390
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,880
 If I'm almost dead, I don't think a dog will lick me.

391
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,880
 It's going to wake me up.

392
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,880
 I'm going to need more than that.

393
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,120
 Well, that's why they carry the brandy.

394
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,120
 Or do they?

395
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,120
 They'll lick you.

396
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,120
 They'll try to wake you up.

397
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:30,280
 And if you're able to, they'll lead you back to the monastery or some form of shelter.

398
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,640
 If they can't rescue you, they run home and get help.

399
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,360
 So they're actually very, very intelligent dogs.

400
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,640
 But they were bred to assist the monks and then they were doing these rescue missions.

401
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,440
 But that's not Beethoven.

402
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,960
 That part of the story is real, but that's not Beethoven.

403
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:53,380
 What happened was between 1816 and 1818, massive avalanches were striking the region and scores

404
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,560
 of these Saint Bernard dogs were being killed.

405
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:00,040
 Now, remember, this species did not exist outside of this monastery.

406
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,080
 So the monks go, "Listen, we have two choices.

407
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,080
 We can keep...

408
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,440
 Maybe the dogs aren't as smart as we thought.

409
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,440
 They keep getting crushed by avalanches.

410
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,000
 We can keep letting them run out or we can save the species."

411
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,160
 So they begin to crossbreed them with other dogs.

412
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,920
 But during this crossbreeding process, what happened was the dogs got bigger, the dogs

413
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,120
 got hairier.

414
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,220
 They got more sturdy, but they stopped being able to do rescue missions.

415
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:31,940
 The Saint Bernard dog that was rescuing people, that we think of, was a lean dog.

416
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,460
 A very, very lean dog.

417
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,540
 The old ones were 80 to 100 pounds.

418
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,300
 The Saint Bernard's you know of?

419
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,940
 180 to 290 pounds.

420
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,180
 Beethoven was a big old dude.

421
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,300
 He would have died in the Alps.

422
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,460
 The snow would have just frozen his fur.

423
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,460
 Fact.

424
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,400
 The Saint Bernard's just going to dispute Saint Bernard's fact.

425
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,560
 Yes, but it's leading up to somewhere.

426
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,560
 Fact.

427
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,160
 Saint Bernard's did not carry Brandy on their necks.

428
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,660
 It's a very common misconception.

429
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,600
 Here's some drinking Brandy as I turn and I'm like, "Let me take a little sip to give

430
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,280
 my next story idea."

431
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,040
 They did not carry Brandy on their necks.

432
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,880
 That was like something that came out of literature.

433
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,840
 But what happened was people would come.

434
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,040
 You can visit the Saint Bernard Monastery, a hostel is what it actually is, but it's

435
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,040
 run by monks.

436
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:20,500
 So, here today you can visit this place and see these dogs that are still around.

437
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,700
 They have the dogs with little casks around their necks walking around.

438
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,420
 People are like, "Oh, that's so adorable.

439
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,780
 Saint Bernard, look how huge it is.

440
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,780
 Can it play the piano?"

441
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,780
 And they're like, "What?"

442
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:32,500
 Did Saint Bernard-- Beethoven didn't play the piano, the dog, not the player.

443
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,980
 He was just like a dog running around.

444
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,140
 Why did I think he could play the piano?

445
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,460
 Anyways, click, click, click.

446
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,380
 They're taking photos of these non-piano playing dogs.

447
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,020
 But they never had casks.

448
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,260
 That was a myth.

449
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,740
 What happened for years people would come to the hostel.

450
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,360
 See these dogs walking around and they're like, "Where are the casks?"

451
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,560
 And the monks would have to spend five minutes each time going on.

452
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,560
 No, no, no, that was a legend.

453
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,920
 That was started from some Looney Tune cartoon or some etching in a book.

454
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,280
 I want to see the casks.

455
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,920
 They had to have that conversation so many times.

456
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,420
 The monks were like, "Damn it!

457
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,880
 Let's just put casks on all the dogs.

458
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,600
 Let's just put them everywhere."

459
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,560
 There was one dog who apparently had some sort of vial on him, but that was only in like

460
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,320
 one source where they talked about his vial.

461
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,840
 And that may have been the source of where that story came from.

462
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,300
 Now when you talk about Saint Bernard's, there's two famous ones.

463
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,700
 There's Beethoven and then there's Barry.

464
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,860
 Barry's the most famous of all Saint Bernard's.

465
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,180
 He saved up to 40 people.

466
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:31,180
 His most famous rescue was caught in a wood etching where he saved a little kid.

467
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,420
 There's a little kid hanging on his back.

468
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,020
 What happened was the dog came over.

469
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,860
 I'm licked up the kid's face.

470
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,860
 Kid woke up.

471
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,820
 Can't feel his toes, but he's awake now.

472
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,420
 He crawls onto Barry's back and Barry marches him back to the house.

473
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,560
 A very, very famous doggy.

474
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,880
 And a very noble doggy, so good job Barry.

475
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:56,320
 There's a memorial plaque for Barry at the Symetra des Chains Petsimitarie in France.

476
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,080
 And it says he saved the lives of 40 people.

477
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,120
 He was killed by the 41st.

478
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,520
 Bitter snowy day.

479
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,720
 Barry's walking through the snow.

480
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,440
 He sees a boot sticking out of the snow.

481
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,720
 He's like, "Oh, time to get to work.

482
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,560
 This is what Barry does best."

483
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,560
 He goes onto this dude.

484
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,380
 He starts licking his face.

485
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,740
 The dude he was getting licked is a French soldier who got lost.

486
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,900
 Now he's out.

487
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,300
 He's cold and he wakes up.

488
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,900
 There's something licking his face in the wilderness in the middle of nowhere.

489
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,380
 He doesn't know Barry's reputation.

490
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,540
 He doesn't have Facebook.

491
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,260
 He thinks it's a wolf.

492
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,260
 So he grabs his bayonet.

493
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:38,300
 He makes that noise too.

494
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:43,020
 He stabs Barry in between the ribs, killing him on the spot.

495
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:48,400
 And French dude gets up and goes, "Ah, that is what the French do best, killing innocent

496
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,400
 dogs."

497
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,960
 Then I imagine he takes it back to the monastery and he's like, "Look, I killed your vicious

498
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,200
 wolf and it's been braying on people."

499
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,200
 Barry!

500
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,800
 That's a lie!

501
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,000
 That is 100% not true.

502
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,440
 They have a plaque telling the story of Barry.

503
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,440
 And it's not true.

504
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,200
 Barry is real.

505
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,800
 He retired, dude.

506
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,760
 He's like, "Spend the rest of his time and burn."

507
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,760
 He retired.

508
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,660
 He's like sitting there with my ties on the beach.

509
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,660
 He didn't get bayoneted by a French soldier.

510
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,320
 This, it's all lies.

511
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,260
 It's all lies.

512
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:31,780
 And to make things even worse, Barry's body is at a natural history museum in Burns,

513
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,780
 Switzerland.

514
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,780
 He's a national hero.

515
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,700
 He saved a bunch of people, right?

516
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,020
 But here's the problem.

517
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:42,840
 People are coming to see Barry and he's not a Saint Bernard.

518
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,840
 He is.

519
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,500
 He's one of the original Saint Bernard's, but he doesn't look like Beethoven.

520
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,560
 And you know people need to have that recognition thing.

521
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,560
 It's super weird.

522
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,740
 It doesn't look like, they'd come there and they'd be like, "Why, was that like a big

523
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,740
 greyhound or something?"

524
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,600
 No, no, that's one of the original Saint Bernard's.

525
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,880
 Ah, look, another like Beethoven.

526
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,040
 The People in Natural History Museum was like, "Oh, I wish that movie was never made."

527
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,620
 So what did they do to Barry?

528
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,980
 They could either again explain every five minutes, "Well, this is what Saint Bernard

529
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:20,320
 used to look like," or they took Barry's body and broke its skull open and rearranged

530
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:27,480
 the skull to give it a bigger Saint Bernard shaped head of what you would expect a Saint

531
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,420
 Bernard to look like.

532
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,060
 And they made him bigger.

533
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,060
 They made him taller.

534
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,700
 Put him back on display.

535
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,700
 Little cask on his neck.

536
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,520
 Everyone's like, "Ooh, a Saint Bernard."

537
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,360
 Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.

538
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:47,600
 So Jason, you say to me as I turn around now I'm smoking a clove cigarette in our smoke

539
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
 field room.

540
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:54,320
 You're like, "Oh, Jason, please stop smoking in your conspiracy chamber."

541
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,320
 What do you have?

542
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,320
 What's your question?

543
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,320
 What's going on?

544
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,320
 You go, Jason.

545
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,040
 So is your conspiracy, your great Saint Bernard conspiracy that Saint Bernard's that we know

546
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,420
 of today don't exist and they bashed open the Sporodox head to please tourists?

547
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,420
 Well, no.

548
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:12,660
 That's all the setup for what I'm about to say because I wanted to show a history of

549
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:17,020
 lies and deceit from the Saint Bernard people.

550
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:22,900
 There's this story in the Swiss Alps of a classic cryptid called the Barbagazi.

551
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,260
 It's a little gnome type of guy.

552
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,820
 It's only about one to three feet tall.

553
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,660
 Some people say it's like a baby bigfoot.

554
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:34,760
 Some people say their white fur that they're seeing wearing is exactly that they're wearing

555
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,760
 it.

556
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,760
 It's white fur clothes.

557
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,920
 They're more of a gnome than some sort of ape.

558
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,500
 But both parties agree they have massive feet.

559
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:48,340
 They love to ski down avalanches, which I would too if I had massive feet.

560
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:53,200
 Their feet actually work like snowshoes, which is an interesting evolutionary quirk.

561
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,000
 Their name literally means frozen beard because they have icicles for a beard.

562
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,620
 So one of the details is when people have caught these things over the centuries, they'll

563
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:06,340
 bring them down and they'll die on the way, but then you're not just going to be like

564
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,980
 let's give this guy a respectful burial.

565
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,140
 You're going to be like let's show them off to our friends.

566
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:14,460
 The icicles would melt and they would actually have a real beard underneath them.

567
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:19,820
 I was reading this article by Florent Barare for a website called strangereality.blog.

568
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,820
 It's really cool.

569
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,100
 I just started getting into it, but it seems to be a really cool website.

570
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,600
 They're just talking about this Barbagasi.

571
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,240
 This little baby bigfoot.

572
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:35,280
 And I came across an interesting note which made me research the St. Bernard.

573
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:39,680
 It said that there were people in the Swiss Alps who believed that the St. Bernards never

574
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,920
 rescued anybody.

575
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,080
 That it's all made up.

576
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:51,800
 These travelers who are being rescued are actually rescued by the Barbagasi.

577
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:56,780
 Because even though they cause avalanches, they also tend to whistle and alert humans

578
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,780
 to avalanches.

579
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,780
 Also them going weee!

580
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,780
 Weee!

581
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:02,180
 Probably is a good alarm as well.

582
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,220
 They actively try to help humans.

583
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,820
 They'll dig them out of the snow.

584
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,340
 They're stories of that.

585
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:12,100
 So there are people in the Swiss Alps who believe that the whole St. Bernard thing is

586
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,060
 a myth.

587
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:17,420
 There's dogs running around and sure they probably licked a couple of people awake,

588
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:21,400
 but it was truly the Barbagasi who were saving these people.

589
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:26,960
 If I take a seat, have the conference table with you, all of us are seated there.

590
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,080
 Ladies and gentlemen, put your conspiracy caps on for a moment.

591
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,080
 They're underneath your chair.

592
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,240
 You can take it home with you.

593
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,400
 It's a gift.

594
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:39,360
 What if this phenomenon isn't simply about the Barbagasi?

595
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:45,960
 What if a ton of rescue efforts are aided by the supernatural?

596
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:52,740
 How many times do we hear about searchers looking for a missing kid or a lost body or

597
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,980
 something like that?

598
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:57,240
 And then it shows up and people go "Well that's weird.

599
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,380
 We already searched that area."

600
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:04,420
 Now sometimes, and oddly enough it's a few amount of times.

601
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,420
 Sometimes.

602
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:08,580
 The killer then drops the body off at a place that's already been searched.

603
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,020
 For the most part, that doesn't happen.

604
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,620
 For the most part, the searchers just go "We must have missed it."

605
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,960
 What if there is a supernatural element?

606
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,640
 Person was not killed by supernatural means.

607
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,040
 The person was killed by a human.

608
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,760
 But it wasn't an inaccessible place.

609
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:29,440
 And there is some sort of supernatural force that then moved it to a location where it

610
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,360
 would be found.

611
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,440
 We've talked about before on this podcast the third man aspect.

612
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,360
 People up on mountains start hearing voices and seeing people that helps them move on.

613
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:43,360
 That's definitely, most likely, that actually definitely, that's most likely a supernatural

614
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,480
 thing.

615
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,220
 What if all of these things are supernatural?

616
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:51,980
 What if it's to the point that all of these like rescue ranger groups, not the cartoon,

617
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:56,980
 but you know like people who ride horses looking for people who are stranded helicopter rescue

618
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,820
 teams up in the mountains divers.

619
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,740
 What if it's all a cover?

620
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,620
 What if all of these dudes just sit at home and drink coffee all day?

621
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,620
 They're super jittery.

622
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,380
 They're like "Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I totally rescued all these people.

623
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,380
 Rescued 40 of them."

624
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,860
 And then the 41st one stabbing the guts.

625
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,100
 People are like "What are you talking about?"

626
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,340
 What if it's all a cover?

627
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:19,080
 What if it's all government funded propaganda so we don't look into the truth?

628
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:25,280
 I actually have a friend who works mountain rescue in Mountain Hood, but he's in on it

629
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,280
 too.

630
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,280
 He's in on it too.

631
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,280
 I never saw him.

632
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,480
 I never actually, he talked about walking up the mountain all the time, but I never saw

633
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,480
 him doing it.

634
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,480
 So he's in on it too.

635
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,440
 You have to show me a photograph, a time-dated photograph of you on the mountain friend.

636
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,400
 Otherwise you're far to the conspiracy.

637
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,540
 What if this is true?

638
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:49,340
 Now of course I'm pushing it to the farthest extreme and saying all rescue operations are

639
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,660
 fake.

640
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:56,060
 But then you always have these weird beats of engineering where we had that, what was

641
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,060
 it, deep water horizons?

642
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:02,660
 It started pumping in like millions of gallons of oil a day into the Gulf and everyone's

643
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,340
 like "Oh crap, what do we do about that?"

644
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:07,500
 They were a little more concerned about that, but they're like "Oh, let's just put this

645
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,500
 concrete thing on."

646
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,780
 They worked on it.

647
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:13,120
 What if the whole time the government's like "Hmm, how are we going to figure this out?

648
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,840
 There's a bunch of mermaids down there already, like lousy humans.

649
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,840
 Huh?

650
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,840
 Huh?

651
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,840
 Huh?"

652
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,840
 Sealing it shut.

653
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,840
 What happened to all that oil by the way?

654
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,840
 What happened to all that oil?

655
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,840
 Fukushima!

656
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,360
 Remember they were supposed to irradiate all the oceans and we'd all be dead by now?

657
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,600
 We're supposed to be dead in 2015, all the fish are dead.

658
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,360
 And then we all get irradiated, turned into mutants.

659
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,240
 Hopefully I'm a cool mutant turtle.

660
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,240
 Probably not.

661
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,320
 Probably just be one of the ones with all the tumors.

662
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,800
 What if the true rescuers in our world are supernatural?

663
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,740
 And the government would actually want to cover that up.

664
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:50,500
 You would want to cover that up, because it would show that they had little to no control

665
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,620
 over really anything.

666
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:56,620
 They can send, they can pass taxes and tell you where the gas main goes in your yard.

667
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:01,300
 But if all the life and death decisions were made by whether or not you got saved by a

668
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:06,740
 unicorn or a chupacabra, then what does the government have to do?

669
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,960
 What would the government be able to do other than just tell you where to go?

670
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,400
 I'd be like, I'm home for the unicorn bro, he saved my uncle's life.

671
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:20,440
 It sounds like a far fetch theory and it sounds like a joke, but there are people, I'm pushing

672
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,440
 it a little far.

673
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,440
 I'm pushing it a little far.

674
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,800
 But let's go back to the original thing.

675
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,120
 I do think it's interesting that there are people in that area who don't believe that

676
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,400
 the St. Bernard's actually saved anyone.

677
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:34,680
 And we can look at all the times that we've been lied to about by St. Bernard's.

678
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,680
 They don't play pianos.

679
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,180
 They've never played pianos.

680
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:43,180
 We can talk about all the times that we've been lied about St. Bernard's.

681
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:46,020
 And then when they make this claim about them rescuing people and you have people in the

682
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,860
 area being like, nope, that's not what happened.

683
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:52,020
 One time I saw two little gnomes dig a guy out and carry him home.

684
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,020
 I didn't see no dog.

685
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,860
 Two little guys when they were standing next to each other kind of took the shape of a

686
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:01,060
 dog and the snow and the flurry, but I didn't see a dog.

687
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:06,000
 Is it possible that our world is more ruled by supernatural than we think?

688
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,880
 And yeah, we have the story of angels and demons and this eternal cosmic conflict, but

689
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,840
 I'm talking about just day to day stuff.

690
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,480
 Yesterday we talked about where stuff goes in your house and whether or not aliens take

691
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,480
 it.

692
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,480
 What if the reason why you're safe is because of not a guardian angel, but because there's

693
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,680
 some root cellar elf?

694
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,480
 You happen to build your house on top of it and he really likes you, so he's keeping

695
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,200
 you out of harm's way.

696
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,660
 Before when tragedy does strike and people are concerned about finding someone's body,

697
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:38,860
 that it's really Bigfoot being like, oh, poor child.

698
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:42,580
 That got dark really, really fast.

699
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,260
 Let me change that.

700
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:50,380
 Oh, poor elderly man, lived a good life, but still sad too Bigfoot.

701
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:53,300
 Bigfoot walks and he sets him down on like a grass.

702
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,860
 He could have taken him home, but you know that's too obvious.

703
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:59,460
 Bigfoot sets him down on the grass where the rescuers will find him instead of him being

704
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,840
 cramped up and rotting underneath some rock somewhere.

705
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,400
 Bigfoot like that gross.

706
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,720
 That might house me getting rid of old man smell.

707
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:15,080
 Is it possible that rescue efforts are led not by man, but by creatures?

708
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:21,240
 We have one incident here, the Barbagazy, that we can say possibly.

709
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,520
 And if we can put a pin in that story, doesn't that mean we should be able to take a closer

710
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,240
 look at all rescue stories?

711
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:34,020
 To see if they also fit the same pattern of constant lies being told about the so-called

712
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,020
 "rescuers."

713
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,580
 Sorry, Barry, I'm sure you were a good dog.

714
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:42,460
 But maybe the creatures and the cryptids in the woods aren't necessarily our enemy.

715
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,460
 Maybe we just interpret them that way.

716
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:48,780
 Maybe it's propaganda from the rescue industrial complex.

717
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,260
 Who knows?

718
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:54,780
 All I know is that St. Bernard's are not St. Bernard's.

719
00:32:54,780 --> 00:33:19,960
 That is the ultimate fur pill.

720
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:40,520
 I'm not sure.

721
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:50,520
