1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,960
 A man believes that he can talk to ghosts using running water from a kitchen sink.

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:16,320
 And then we end the week by taking a bizarre journey and looking at this woman's life as

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,740
 she is living it right now.

4
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:29,120
 Is it possible that she has connected with an entity that is giving her instructions?

5
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:37,100
 Or did a blood disease boil her brain today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:47,420
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,340
 I'm your host Jason Garvin, and I'm having a good day.

8
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,620
 I hope you guys are having a good day too.

9
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,780
 I hope you guys have some awesome plans for the weekend.

10
00:00:53,780 --> 00:01:00,420
 Just a quick reminder again, May 14th I will be at the McMinnimin's UFO Festival in McMinnville,

11
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,660
 Oregon.

12
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:07,300
 Not as a speaker, but as the person who paid $125 to get a vendor table.

13
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,500
 But I'm gonna be there, I'm gonna bring in all these haunted items.

14
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,300
 Veronica Mahonadal is going to be there to get her autograph.

15
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,380
 We'll put a little pin in her hand.

16
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,880
 It's gonna be lots of fun.

17
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,780
 And there's a bunch of UFO people there as well.

18
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,780
 Whitley Stryber.

19
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:27,180
 If I'm not a big enough draw, Whitley Stryber, the author of Communion, is going to be speaking

20
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,180
 at the convention.

21
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,860
 He'll be there May 13th.

22
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:31,860
 So you gotta pick a day.

23
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,300
 You can't stay there for both.

24
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,380
 It's a festival they immediately kick you out if you stick around for too long.

25
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:41,140
 But someone who never sticks around for too long is actually one of our long term Patreon

26
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,140
 supporters.

27
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,740
 Really, really appreciate this.

28
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,200
 And give it up for Cindy Perrariya.

29
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,200
 Wooo!

30
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,600
 Everyone give a big round of applause as Cindy is walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

31
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,760
 Cindy, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

32
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,760
 You guys can't support the Patreon.

33
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,760
 I totally understand.

34
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,480
 Just helps read the word about the show.

35
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,000
 That helps out so much.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,520
 Cindy, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

37
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,360
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

38
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,840
 We're gonna float all the way out to some dude's kitchen.

39
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,140
 Giant Durgible's knocking over all of his dishes.

40
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,140
 Oh no!

41
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,020
 That's Fiesta Ware.

42
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,100
 But we don't care about any of that.

43
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,780
 And even if we do, even if we demolish this guy's collection of dishes, it's okay because

44
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,460
 he can talk to them from beyond the dead.

45
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,620
 Still doesn't fix his dishes.

46
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,540
 Still doesn't clean up his kitchen.

47
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,140
 But we're gonna take a look at this dude.

48
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,220
 His name is Grant.

49
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,360
 And he has a YouTube channel called Optimal Frequency.

50
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,120
 I don't remember how I even came across these guys.

51
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,520
 Optimal Frequency is the YouTube channel's name.

52
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,360
 And what they do, they have a gimmick.

53
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,200
 Every YouTube channel should have a gimmick.

54
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,200
 Mine is.

55
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,440
 Mine is to have the least amount of recommendations.

56
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,640
 YouTube is completely shadow banned.

57
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,640
 My channel, I don't even think most of my subscribers even know when to put out videos

58
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,640
 anymore.

59
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,560
 But my gimmick is being run off YouTube.

60
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,360
 But let's take a look at Grant here.

61
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,280
 He runs this channel Optimal Frequency.

62
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:14,020
 What he does is he, you know, on one hand this is kind of ingenious.

63
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:20,580
 And on the other hand, this is the highest level of cherry picking when it comes to any

64
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,740
 sort of ghost audio.

65
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,420
 So let me tell you what it is for.

66
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,380
 What he does is he has this new technology.

67
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,380
 He turns on a faucet.

68
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,380
 You're like, "Water!

69
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,380
 Whoa!

70
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,980
 Where's this magical thing at?"

71
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:37,600
 He turns on like a kitchen faucet and he records the water going, "Shhh!"

72
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,040
 You don't know what water sounded like.

73
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,200
 You didn't even know running water existed until this podcast.

74
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,040
 And then he has this thing.

75
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,040
 He didn't invent this.

76
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,840
 This is a software you can buy.

77
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,840
 It's called Crisp.

78
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,880
 And what it does, it's intelligent software.

79
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,280
 It filters out white noise for zoom calls or anything really.

80
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,920
 For ghosts, for ghosts and water.

81
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,200
 You didn't know that was possible.

82
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,420
 It's to filter out weird noises or white noises if a ghost is floating around when

83
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,420
 you're trying to do a job interview.

84
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,420
 You're like, "Uhhh!

85
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,420
 I want to work at Microsoft.

86
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,420
 My place is currently haunted.

87
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,420
 I need a move.

88
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,060
 I don't have any money."

89
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,860
 But anyway, so yeah, that's what Crisp, this software is.

90
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,420
 You can like, it's a monthly fee.

91
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,660
 I think it is your buy it out, right?

92
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,540
 So the way Grant has it set up is that he records the water running.

93
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,940
 He asks questions.

94
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:29,020
 And then he goes back and using the Crisp software, it makes the water say something,

95
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,020
 right?

96
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,760
 It's punching it in the stomach and it's like, "Come on, water molecules, tell us the truth."

97
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,960
 I'll play you a sample.

98
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,960
 So because you guys are like, "What in the world is this guy talking about?"

99
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,200
 That's what I was thinking the whole time I was watching these videos.

100
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,840
 And of course I had a pick on the most clickbaity video this guy recently did.

101
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:53,640
 Because if you're going to ask the ghost in your kitchen anything, ask them about the

102
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,400
 current war in Ukraine.

103
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,240
 Because why not, right?

104
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,240
 Why not?

105
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,620
 You're just going to hear a bunch of white noise and you're going to pick words out

106
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,260
 and go, "Oh, it says that."

107
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:09,580
 Then he posted a video on March 29th, 2022 called the Ghost of Kiev, Part 1.

108
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,620
 Yeah, there's two of these.

109
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,260
 He has a lot of videos overall.

110
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,020
 What he does is he'll ask this question.

111
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:26,460
 So let's say for example he asks, "As of today, how many Russian generals have been killed

112
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,460
 by the Ukrainians?"

113
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,480
 Oh, again, I'm talking about the ghosts.

114
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,400
 I'm sure they have better things to do than be like going to CNN.com and trying to figure

115
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
 that information out.

116
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,360
 "As of today, how many Russian generals have been killed by the Ukrainians?"

117
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,800
 And it says on the screen, "He knows, Grant knows, that the number is five at that time.

118
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,720
 Five Russian generals had reportedly been killed by the Ukrainians."

119
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,580
 This is the ghost answer, though.

120
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:03,100
 Okay, section two.

121
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:22,900
 How many Russian generals have been reportedly killed as of today by the Ukrainians?

122
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,580
 So if you didn't understand what that was saying, which I'm fully aware that probably

123
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,080
 most of you are like, "Huh?"

124
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,120
 That said, "I heard that they were wrong."

125
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,300
 Well, okay, let me back up here.

126
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,060
 This is what he says the ghost said, right?

127
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,340
 "I heard that they were wrong.

128
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,780
 It's only an empty theory."

129
00:06:42,780 --> 00:07:00,440
 If CNN.com can tell you how many Russian generals have died, I don't know why the ghosts give

130
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,440
 such a cryptic answer.

131
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,540
 And the ghost is constantly saying, I feel bad, I'm actually putting this on the ghost,

132
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:11,460
 this technology, optimal frequency, this website, this YouTube channel.

133
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,460
 And what's weird, right?

134
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,060
 So all of his questions are weird.

135
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,520
 That was one of the most sensical questions that he asked, and it was something that could

136
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,520
 be verified.

137
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,420
 "How many Russian generals have died?"

138
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:27,440
 And then this ghost is like, "Ahhh," gives that answer.

139
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,700
 But he asks questions, so he has a partner.

140
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,940
 I guess normally it doesn't work with him.

141
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,100
 This guy named Gary Reid.

142
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,220
 So Grant is also working with this guy named Gary Reid.

143
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:44,180
 And he asks the ghost, he's asking the ghost about, "What do you think about me working

144
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,180
 with Gary?"

145
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,180
 What?

146
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,180
 He's in your house.

147
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,500
 It's a little too late to be asking the ghost.

148
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,540
 The ghosts are like, "Look out, he has a knife."

149
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,500
 It's a little too late to be asking stuff like that.

150
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,760
 He's asking questions about that.

151
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,920
 He's like, "Is my audio setup okay?

152
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,920
 Is everything okay?"

153
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,280
 You should know this stuff.

154
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,880
 You've been doing a YouTube channel for a long time.

155
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:12,320
 And the way it's set up is you record the ghosts talking through the water, and then

156
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:18,360
 you put the crisp technology over that to clean up all of the non-ghost stuff, aka running

157
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,360
 water, right?

158
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,360
 It's just going to eliminate everything.

159
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,720
 And then you try really hard to hear something.

160
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,700
 And then, so you record the voice, you record the sound, I don't want to humor if it's saying

161
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,500
 these actually recording voices.

162
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,100
 You record the sound, and then you run it through the AI program, and then you're sitting

163
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,940
 there in your editing bay at home, and you're playing it back.

164
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,340
 You've already recorded everything.

165
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,660
 If it gives you any advice on your recording setup, you've already taken it apart.

166
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:47,500
 You've already removed everything, right?

167
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
 So it wouldn't even make sense.

168
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,780
 You don't hear it in real time.

169
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:56,200
 It wouldn't even make sense if you were asking how everything's okay.

170
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,040
 Now maybe, watch, I don't know if this will be a video that he finds.

171
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,040
 Maybe he'll say, "No, I do listen to it in real time."

172
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,680
 I just have to say, it doesn't seem that way, sir, because you keep asking the question,

173
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,680
 "How's my audio setup?

174
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,880
 How's my audio setup?"

175
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,800
 If you could hear it in real time, and when they say...

176
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,760
 This is their answer, by the way, how's his audio setup?

177
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:26,100
 [Metal clattering]

178
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,900
 They compliment his monitor.

179
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,740
 They say that his monitor is cool, or something like that.

180
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,740
 I'll play the actual clip.

181
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,740
 [Laughs]

182
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,980
 They didn't actually say that.

183
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,220
 People are gonna be like, "What?

184
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,700
 You quoted the ghost out of context."

185
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,020
 They did not say the monitor was cool.

186
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,320
 But anyway, so whatever, dude.

187
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,560
 This kind of goes on and on and on.

188
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,320
 At one point, he starts going about the go...

189
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,760
 This is what made me click on this video in particular.

190
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:58,760
 We know now, for a matter of fact, that Ghost of Kiev does not exist.

191
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,760
 It didn't exist.

192
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,760
 He never existed.

193
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,240
 It was a video game demo footage someone put together from War Thunder, if I remember

194
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,240
 correctly.

195
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,040
 We did an episode on it.

196
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,720
 He didn't exist.

197
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,720
 So right...

198
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,740
 I do have to give this dude credit, because he didn't take the videos down.

199
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,580
 It would be the same thing as if I did a video where I used a Ouija board to contact the

200
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,340
 count from Sesame Street.

201
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,820
 And the thing kept going to the numbers.

202
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,540
 Then it went, "HA, HA, HA, HA."

203
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,780
 And I was like, "Oh my God, we've made contact with the count from Sesame Street."

204
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:36,660
 And then someone informed me, CNN informed me, "The count is not real."

205
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,660
 Right?

206
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,800
 I think most people would have taken it down.

207
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,640
 So as far as when I'm recording this, the Ghost of Kiev episode is still up.

208
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,640
 Because he doesn't exist.

209
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,640
 And we all know he didn't exist.

210
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,360
 But they're asking like, legitimate questions.

211
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,040
 You're like, "What's the thrust like on your jet?

212
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,040
 How many afterburners?

213
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,520
 How many Gs can your jet take?"

214
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,520
 No.

215
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:02,580
 They actually ask questions like, "How many confirmed kills has the Ghost of Kiev got?"

216
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,080
 And the answer, the ghost didn't say it's not real.

217
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,820
 It's not real, Grant.

218
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,540
 The Ghost of Kiev is a propaganda tool.

219
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,820
 They said, "50 at least.

220
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,420
 Check it."

221
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,580
 They asked the ghost if Zelensky, who what?

222
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,020
 Is the prime minister or president?

223
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,140
 I don't know the exact position of.

224
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,980
 But prime minister Zelensky from Ukraine.

225
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,820
 Is he the Ghost of Kiev?

226
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,820
 And no.

227
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:34,340
 If you were on your edge of your seat for two seconds there thinking that was true,

228
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,340
 the ghost said no.

229
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,340
 I don't think that was a joke.

230
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,760
 I don't think they actually believe that.

231
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,160
 Now you could go Jason, you're cherry picking.

232
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,480
 You're cherry picking kind of the funny moments and stuff like that.

233
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,480
 And I am.

234
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,520
 But you also gotta remember that that's what this is as well.

235
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,480
 They're cherry picking the ones that fit the answers.

236
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,240
 They could have been doing this for hours on end.

237
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:59,200
 And these are the ones that make any sort of sense, right?

238
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,560
 My thing is, is like, so we've talked about this before.

239
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:12,260
 There's things like, obviously, EVP is just putting out saying, "Is there anyone in here?"

240
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:17,300
 And then you go back and you listen to the audio and see if there's an, see if you cut

241
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,300
 an EVP.

242
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,940
 That's kind of the most, that's like the base level.

243
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:24,740
 I think the base level is walking in a haunted house and you hear in a disembodied voice

244
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,740
 go "BOOM!"

245
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,260
 Like that is, that is the caveman's version of the EVP.

246
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,680
 And then you have an electronic recording device, which does it.

247
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,280
 And then they have things like spirit boxes.

248
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,760
 Those have come about maybe in the past five years.

249
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,720
 I could be a little bit older.

250
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,120
 They've definitely blown up in popularity in the last five years.

251
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:49,120
 And that's where you have basically a radio, a broken radio is what it is, where it spins

252
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:55,720
 through the dial super quickly and every so often over going through the AM/FM band, you'll

253
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,440
 pick out individual words.

254
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,060
 I am here behind you.

255
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,820
 Boo!

256
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:07,020
 And then you turn around and look because large, large maybe standing there.

257
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:12,980
 That again, like all EVP, the spirit box, I've never used the spirit box myself.

258
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:21,020
 EVPs to me are the most reliable because when you ask a question like, "Are you here?"

259
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:27,840
 You either get silence or background noise or something.

260
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,720
 And then once you have something now, you can start debate over what does it say.

261
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,680
 But whether or not, if I say, "Is anyone in here?"

262
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,280
 And there's a disembodied voice that says, "My name is Margaret.

263
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,000
 I died here."

264
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,560
 Or a disembodied voice said, "Waffles, tomorrow!"

265
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,820
 It's still a disembodied voice.

266
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,340
 I mean, the ghost may be an idiot, right?

267
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:57,340
 The ghost may be a moron, but it's still a disembodied voice.

268
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,460
 That's what I like about EVPs.

269
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,060
 You could go, "I don't think it said that.

270
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,060
 I think it said this one more quivley.

271
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:07,180
 The point is, is that it's saying something."

272
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,900
 There's a voice from the ether saying something.

273
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:14,140
 It may not be answering my question, but it should not exist.

274
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,460
 It's saying something, right?

275
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:20,680
 The haunted boxes are a little more prone to, I'm not completely dismissing them.

276
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,880
 I think I did in earlier episodes, I think.

277
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,680
 But I looked into them a little bit more.

278
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,640
 I do think though they're more prone to, it's a random thing.

279
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:35,280
 And so if it clicks to 10 different stations, you might be able to hear, "Buy now!"

280
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,560
 And you happen to be standing outside of a hot dog cart in New York City.

281
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,880
 And you're like, "I must get a hot dog."

282
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,080
 The ghost told me to, but then it picked up all this other stuff.

283
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,360
 Again, I've never used one.

284
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,900
 I've looked into them, I've done some research on them.

285
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,220
 I'm less dismissive of them than I used to be, but...

286
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:55,340
 And maybe someday I'll be less dismissive of optimal frequency.

287
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,500
 Probably not.

288
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,340
 Because when you look at other videos, and you know what, here's the thing.

289
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,380
 Who cares what I think, right?

290
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,660
 Who cares what I think?

291
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,340
 I watched two videos by this dude.

292
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,780
 What is my opinion matter, right?

293
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,500
 Like, honestly, this is my thing.

294
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,140
 He looks like he's having the time of his life.

295
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,940
 He looks like he's having a ton of fun.

296
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,240
 There's a lot of people who enjoy watching his videos.

297
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,840
 I think it's goofy, but who cares, right?

298
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,600
 I'm not the end-all be-all of paranormal research.

299
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,600
 Who cares what I think?

300
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,680
 They honestly grant looks like he's having fun.

301
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,040
 Is there a better way to spend the afternoon, right?

302
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:34,320
 When you're into this stuff, I go to the bagel shop and just read spooky stories for hours

303
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,720
 on end and type up notes.

304
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,520
 That's how I spend my Saturdays.

305
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,200
 A lot of people would think that was a waste of time.

306
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,960
 Who cares what people think, right?

307
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,420
 I'm saying the same thing to you.

308
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,100
 Grant looks like he's having the time of his life.

309
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,180
 He does look a little perturbed every show often.

310
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,980
 He seems to lose his patience with Gary in the basement.

311
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,660
 But you know what I mean?

312
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:58,620
 How awesome is it to be able to not only spend a day recording the water coming out of your

313
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,500
 faucet and having...

314
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,420
 I don't think he's talking to paranormal.

315
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,260
 I do think it's all...

316
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,780
 He's just putting together patterns.

317
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:10,180
 But he's having time of his life and he's putting out content and people are enjoying

318
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,180
 it.

319
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,520
 It's so funny because sometimes I'll lay into people who I think are grifting and I think

320
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:19,400
 are spreading harmful messages to people's health.

321
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,160
 That's kind of the difference because sometimes I've gone really hard.

322
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,240
 I did a whole week about Vampire Kevin.

323
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,360
 I'm like into this anonymous dude on the internet.

324
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,000
 And yeah, I just thought like...

325
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 He was running...

326
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,520
 Well, legally I can't say he was running a grift.

327
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,600
 But let's put him in the category of people that I go.

328
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,600
 This is dangerous.

329
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,220
 These guys just having fun.

330
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,660
 I don't believe it's ghosts personally.

331
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,660
 But his...

332
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,740
 And this is one of the reasons why.

333
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,540
 His other videos, he's talking to the ghost of Kiev, I guess, or he's just talking to

334
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,820
 ghosts hanging out by his water fountain.

335
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,700
 But he's done videos where he's talked to specific people.

336
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:02,660
 He's talked to Freddie Mercury, dude from Queen, right?

337
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,660
 Anthony Bourdain.

338
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,460
 And you know, at one point I was like, "Oh dude, I should listen to that one.

339
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,460
 We actually did an episode about Anthony Bourdain."

340
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,280
 But then I thought, "He's actually there, Jason.

341
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,160
 It's the dude's water flossing."

342
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,640
 It's not like you're going to go there and learn anything great about Anthony Bourdain.

343
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,800
 So I was like, "Oh yeah."

344
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,800
 So he did...

345
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,800
 He's done a bunch of them.

346
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,800
 He's done a ton of these videos.

347
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,800
 But he's done ones on...

348
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,920
 These are the most notable for me.

349
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:30,280
 Freddie Mercury, Anthony Bourdain, Stephen Hawking, right?

350
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
 That's pretty recent.

351
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,240
 And I wonder if it had the electronic voice, right?

352
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,680
 Was the ghost like...

353
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,860
 Like when Stephen Hawking died, would his ghost sound like a robot?

354
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,300
 Probably not, but then you wouldn't recognize his voice.

355
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,940
 And we're thinking about whether or not Stephen Hawking...

356
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,940
 I guess ghosts don't care whether or not you recognize their voice, right?

357
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,940
 It's a ghost.

358
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,240
 Because then he would be like in the little motorized wheelchair.

359
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,420
 And I don't think that's possible.

360
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,660
 He's probably walking around as a ghost.

361
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,500
 But Freddie Mercury, Anthony Bourdain, Stephen Hawking...

362
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,500
 These are all very fascinating people.

363
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,500
 The bog...

364
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,260
 I was like, "Dude, this would be..."

365
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:08,560
 Anyway, the Boggy Creek Monster.

366
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,560
 Not the soggy bottom boys.

367
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,400
 That would be pretty interesting too.

368
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,560
 Except they're not real.

369
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,320
 The Boggy Creek Monster, which who knows if that guy's real.

370
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,640
 I'm like, "What is this dude's real?"

371
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,120
 Boggy Creek Monster is basically a swamp bigfoot.

372
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,560
 And I saw that one and I was like, "What?"

373
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,560
 That would be the only...

374
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,960
 I would interview that guy every single week.

375
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,120
 Wouldn't you love to know the weekly adventures of a cryptid?

376
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,160
 He's like, "Almost got caught today."

377
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,840
 You wouldn't believe it.

378
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,500
 My buddy Stephen Hawking showed him in his ghost wheelchair and saved me once again.

379
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,900
 Thank you, robot ghost.

380
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,900
 I remember once I saw...

381
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,780
 I don't remember where I saw this online.

382
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,340
 I think it was just a passing comment.

383
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,820
 But someone said, "I never understand.

384
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,060
 You watch shows like Ghost Hunters.

385
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,260
 They come out to a house.

386
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,380
 They set up their cameras for the night.

387
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,620
 The next morning they're like, "This is a confirmed haunting.

388
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,940
 Listen to all these EVPs we caught and these moving shadows."

389
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,740
 And then the next week they're at a different house.

390
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,380
 You go, "Stay in the same house.

391
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,960
 Stay in the same house.

392
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,600
 Collect as much data as you can at that one house.

393
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,880
 If this is a confirmed haunting, you should put your gear there for like a month."

394
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,440
 I was like, "I never thought about that."

395
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,440
 That's super interesting.

396
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,000
 You made contact with a cryptid, with the Boggy Creek Monster.

397
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,920
 That would just be your YouTube channel.

398
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,040
 Every week you'd have a new video of you talking to this monster.

399
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,520
 He's just talking like Cookie Monster.

400
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,040
 He's like, "Yum, yum, yum.

401
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,280
 Meet another camper."

402
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,180
 If you could make contact with a cryptid, that is all.

403
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,860
 I would talk to the Boggy Creek Monster all the time.

404
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,780
 Freddie Mercury, he's not going nowhere, right?

405
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,780
 He's a ghost, right?

406
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,300
 They're stuck there forever.

407
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,260
 You can save him for another YouTube channel.

408
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:47,140
 But yeah, if you could talk to a cryptid, talk to a cryptid.

409
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,660
 But anyways, you can check out Optimal Frequency.

410
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,660
 I had a real...

411
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,580
 It actually started making me sick to my stomach.

412
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,220
 I don't know what it was about the ghost.

413
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,220
 The ghosts were flying in my stomach every time I played them.

414
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,900
 I don't know if it was the white noise or whatever.

415
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:03,760
 I watched two videos of them, but yeah, it just kind of made me sick to my stomach.

416
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,320
 But with that recommendation, it'll make you notches as you listen to it.

417
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,640
 They look like they're having fun.

418
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,200
 It doesn't look like they're trying to rip anyone off financially or mentally.

419
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,440
 They're not running any sort of weirdo cult.

420
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,840
 Like so many other people we see in the space.

421
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,800
 So good on you, Grant.

422
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,600
 Good on you for being a step above most people in this sphere.

423
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,120
 Again, I don't think you're talking to ghosts, but it's fun.

424
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,700
 I'm not gonna knock that.

425
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:35,380
 Cindy, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the world famous carbonicopter.

426
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,580
 We're leaving behind this dude's kitchen.

427
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:40,020
 It's still in shambles from the dirgeable crash.

428
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,900
 Let's fire up the rotors on this copter.

429
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,300
 Knocking everything from side to side.

430
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,940
 It created a few more ghosts, unfortunately.

431
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,980
 Cindy, take us out of this dude's house.

432
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:54,700
 We're headed all the way out to a suburban neighborhood.

433
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,700
 Somewhere in America.

434
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:03,640
 This is one of those stories that I kind of stumbled across.

435
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,920
 I found this post.

436
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,160
 It was titled Being Contacted by an Entity.

437
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,840
 I was like, oh, okay, cool.

438
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,200
 I do love me some entity contact.

439
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,040
 It's one of my top five contacts.

440
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,120
 I'm looking into it and generally what I do when I come across this stuff, I read the

441
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,240
 post and I'm like, okay, that's weird.

442
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,200
 That's good enough to be covered on Dead Rabbit Radio, I say.

443
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,420
 Because I stuff another jalapeno cheddar bagel into my mouth.

444
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:33,380
 And then I'll go back and I'll look at people's posting history if that's available.

445
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,860
 Sometimes stuff's posted anonymously on the X board.

446
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:39,060
 And there are other forms and stuff that have more availability.

447
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,860
 You can check this stuff out.

448
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,660
 And that's when I really started digging through this person's past.

449
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,060
 Now we're going to call this person.

450
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,780
 This is, I got to be real careful about this one, honestly.

451
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:54,180
 Like part of me wanted to contact this person and clear some stuff up, but this is a weird

452
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,180
 one.

453
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,680
 We're going to call this, it is a whole shot in the dark.

454
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,640
 If it's your real name, I'm not connected to the entity.

455
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,840
 We're going to call this person Wendy.

456
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,840
 Wendy.

457
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,120
 And let's go through a couple of the posts.

458
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,860
 I want to take you on this journey because I read the entity post first being contacted

459
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,080
 by an entity and then I went and found all this stuff.

460
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:27,860
 On March 28th, 2022, Wendy posted on a forum asking the question, healthy at every size.

461
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:34,820
 And this person, Wendy, I don't think we ever get it in exact age, but we do get a whole

462
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,180
 host of health problems that Wendy is suffering.

463
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:43,260
 And we, this first really comes to the forefront on this March 28 post.

464
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,680
 Wendy is going, you know, I'm talking about giving up, trying to lose weight.

465
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:53,240
 Like I've been trying to lose weight for so long and I've actually gained 30 pounds while

466
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,240
 I've been trying to lose.

467
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,080
 I mean, coming back to my calories and all that stuff and I'm actually gaining weight.

468
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:05,300
 Now either she's not actually cutting her calories or she has such a serious medical condition

469
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,920
 like water bloat, right?

470
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,680
 Like she can't actually lose weight.

471
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,680
 You have to go to the doctor.

472
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:18,460
 She goes, maybe I read this online that I can be healthy at any size and that all of

473
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:24,700
 the health conditions that kill fat people are due to medical discrimination.

474
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,280
 Like you don't actually die of a heart attack from being overweight.

475
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,300
 You die of a heart attack because you go to the doctor and they say, oh, for us to treat

476
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,860
 your heart, you're going to have to lose weight.

477
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,140
 And so you die of a heart attack.

478
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,500
 Now if they had just treated your heart in the first place and hadn't discriminated against

479
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:44,200
 you because you were overweight, then fat fatalities would go down.

480
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,680
 And what's interesting is when I go to the doctor, that's something that always comes

481
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,440
 up no matter what medical condition I'm in.

482
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,560
 People say, you know, you've gained a lot of weight.

483
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,880
 I'm actually a lot lower now than I used to be.

484
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,160
 But I have never felt discriminated against personally, right?

485
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:05,480
 I knew that my weight, I got up to 350 pounds.

486
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,420
 I'm nowhere near that now.

487
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,520
 But that would be issue, right?

488
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,560
 Bad knees, your heart issues, breathing issues, stuff like that sleep apnea, that's due to

489
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,560
 your weight.

490
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:19,320
 And there's been this push recently, sure beauty at every size, right?

491
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,040
 But health is a more complicated issue, right?

492
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,880
 Health at every size is far, far more complicated.

493
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,920
 And speaking from experience, I don't necessarily think that that's accurate.

494
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:34,840
 But she posts that she says I'm having a hard time losing weight and maybe being larger is

495
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:39,380
 healthier than being skinny or of a normal weight is her exact quote.

496
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,100
 Being larger is healthier than being skinny or normal weight.

497
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,180
 And that's what she had been told.

498
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,100
 That was on March 28, 2022.

499
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:52,540
 On April 7, she posts again and she says in this post completely unable to lose weight.

500
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:55,380
 At this point, she gives us some more details.

501
00:24:55,380 --> 00:25:01,020
 She is five foot two and 530 pounds.

502
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,980
 So that's quite heavy.

503
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,520
 It's very, very, very heavy.

504
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,640
 She goes on eating 1500 calories a day.

505
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:14,560
 I cannot lose weight and I don't know what's going on.

506
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,240
 And I'm going so in this might see you're like Jason, what does any of this have to

507
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,240
 do with an entity?

508
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,280
 Is the entity like a weight trainers, the entity like a personal instructor, personal

509
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,320
 fitness guy who's going to help around.

510
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,400
 The reason why I'm laying all of this out because we get when we talk about someone

511
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,200
 who's contacting entities.

512
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,380
 It's very, very interesting.

513
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:38,300
 We cover a lot of this stuff where people are hearing voices in their head and we get

514
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:43,980
 a very clear picture of this person's not just mental health, but physical health.

515
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:48,280
 And that is something that is constantly missing from a lot of these stories.

516
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,100
 We covered a story last week where the woman started hearing voices.

517
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,460
 She also said she was overweight.

518
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,940
 Now that I think about it, she had lost 50 pounds in her story.

519
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,620
 I'm going to have to look into that.

520
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,620
 That's really interesting.

521
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:02,780
 I also saw a meme recently and it said that American paranormal hosts are all overweight.

522
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:08,520
 I want something to go like anyone who's like puts out paranormal content is overweight.

523
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,520
 So that's weird.

524
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,840
 But again, it's America.

525
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,840
 We have this.

526
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,560
 So that's kind of why I'm dialing into this.

527
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,560
 And this does play a part.

528
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,960
 I'm not just here to be like, "Ah, look at how heavy she is."

529
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,400
 Because that's not the point, but we have a picture of this woman's health.

530
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,560
 She's five foot two.

531
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,560
 She's 530 pounds.

532
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:30,360
 Going through her post, it turns out she doesn't eat 1,500 calories a day.

533
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,620
 If you ate 1,500 calories a day to 530 pounds, you are guaranteed to lose weight unless you

534
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,900
 have a serious medical condition.

535
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,980
 You're retaining water so much that you're basically a water balloon and you would have

536
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,180
 to go to hospital and get that taken care of.

537
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,780
 530 pounds eating 1,500 calories a day.

538
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,980
 It turns out that's not true.

539
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:51,660
 And I think we would have all known that.

540
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:59,220
 She eats 6,000 calories a day by her own estimate and she goes and that is her guessing the calories

541
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,280
 of restaurant food.

542
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:08,080
 So she's eating probably 5,000 calories a day of stuff she can read.

543
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,720
 Like actually look at the nutritional value of.

544
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,160
 April 13th.

545
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,480
 So what is that?

546
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:24,000
 Six days later after that, completely unable to lose weight, she posts, "I will die soon."

547
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,540
 From April 7th to April 13th, she's gained 10 pounds.

548
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:34,140
 She says doctors are telling her that at any moment her heart can stop.

549
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:41,980
 Her health is so poor, she can die at any time.

550
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:46,880
 She makes an interesting, she's kind of going through her health issues.

551
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,740
 She also adds to the comment, "No money can't stop eating."

552
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:57,400
 And it made me think someone must be enabling her because one of the things you need to

553
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,360
 eat is money and especially if you're ordering restaurant foods, very expensive.

554
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,000
 So I'm wondering if someone's enabling her, right?

555
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,320
 Anyways, she's up to 540 pounds.

556
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:14,520
 She's posting on all of these other subs and forums to lose weight, looking for advice.

557
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:19,360
 She mentions that she's bedridden and she's mentioning that she might be evicted.

558
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,380
 She has someone who's taking care of her, you wouldn't need someone to take care of you

559
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:27,060
 in the state where your heart can literally stop at any moment.

560
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:30,540
 And that person is going back to college, so she doesn't know, Wendy doesn't know how

561
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,540
 things are going to work out.

562
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:40,500
 That was April 13th, April 22nd, being contacted by an entity.

563
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,260
 She says this all started three years ago.

564
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:48,300
 This entity situation started three years ago, but it's definitely come to a head.

565
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:54,160
 She said she started seeing a three-digit number appear randomly around her.

566
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:58,920
 Now not like a hallucination, but look at your clock, it's a three-digit number.

567
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,240
 You're checking your stock, three-digit number on the ticker tape.

568
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,700
 Apparently your Scrooge McDuck and a ticker tape is coming out all the time.

569
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,440
 She said, "I'm not going to tell you what the number is.

570
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,280
 I'm not going to tell you what the number is for reasons that will become obvious."

571
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,840
 But I keep seeing this number appear.

572
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,820
 Another thing that's going on over the past three years is I begin to feel disconnected

573
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,820
 from reality.

574
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:28,340
 The world begins to seem more and more like just a dream.

575
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:35,700
 They're so vivid it's almost like I can't tell when I'm asleep and when I'm awake.

576
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,540
 And then the voices appear.

577
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:43,060
 The entity comes into her life.

578
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:46,600
 And this is always so interesting.

579
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:53,200
 She's laid out a very personal health journey online and yet when people get cagey about

580
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,760
 certain details, which you perfectly whine, right?

581
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,280
 You don't have to tell everyone everything.

582
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:01,400
 But I find it interesting when you talk about very, very detailed things about your weight,

583
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,760
 how many calories you're taking today, and then you leave other stuff really vague.

584
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,560
 It makes you think the worst, right?

585
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,520
 Not of her, but of what could be going on.

586
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:18,620
 She says the entity kept telling her to do something over and over and over again, but

587
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:22,540
 yet she refused to do it.

588
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:25,580
 But she won't, she doesn't reveal what that thing is.

589
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,580
 That's troubling, right?

590
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:30,700
 Because you think, you know, the worst, hurting herself or hurting other people.

591
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:38,380
 She says during this time she begins to see visions of the dead when she looks into mirrors.

592
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,380
 She sees ghosts standing behind her.

593
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,080
 She's simply trying to check out her own reflection.

594
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,600
 She believes she's going crazy, which I think anyone would have.

595
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,040
 Anyone of those things, right?

596
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:56,040
 The voices, depersonalization, seeing the specters of the damned behind you.

597
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,640
 Any of those three would make you feel like you were going crazy.

598
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,920
 She's having all of them.

599
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,880
 She then says she got COVID twice.

600
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,920
 She suffered from, this is very recent.

601
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:11,080
 This is like in the last year, got COVID twice, suffered with strep throat, anaphylaxis,

602
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:17,060
 which I think is a reaction to medicine, anaphylactic shock at least, or some sort of allergic

603
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,060
 reaction.

604
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:22,980
 Cellulitis, the flu, that's a bit of a downgrade there, right?

605
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,060
 You're like, oh, you won't believe it.

606
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,860
 I almost died of an anaphylactic shock.

607
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,900
 And I had the flu.

608
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:33,980
 You're like, dude, dude, you need to learn how to actually organize stuff from least

609
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,780
 scary to most scary.

610
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,780
 But she does end it on a pretty scary one.

611
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:42,080
 I think called mastitis, which is inflamed breast tissues.

612
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,680
 I had to look that up.

613
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,180
 Didn't look at photos.

614
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,180
 Please don't send me any.

615
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,000
 I was like, what's mastitis?

616
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,960
 And I found out what it is.

617
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,400
 She said she went to the urgent care 10 times.

618
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,480
 Now here's the thing.

619
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,440
 When I'm reading this, this is where you start to think, hypochondriac.

620
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,840
 Remember, I'm reading this post first.

621
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,640
 I have no idea about her health history.

622
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,400
 I'm reading this post first.

623
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,080
 And I was like, wow, either this person's the unluckiest person.

624
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,080
 She got the flu.

625
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,080
 Oh, no.

626
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,080
 I'm so worried about her.

627
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,100
 Either she's very unlucky health wise, or she's a hypochondriac.

628
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:20,540
 I had no idea that she was 530 pounds or 540 pounds at this point, which I would go, okay,

629
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,820
 yeah, that totally makes sense.

630
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:25,500
 That totally makes sense that you would have a whole host of health concerns.

631
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,540
 But she's going to urgent care over and over and over and over again to get taken care of.

632
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:35,620
 And then at the very end of this whole thing, she gets a severe blood infection with no cause.

633
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:39,640
 The doctors at the urgent care facility, if you don't know what that is, if I don't know

634
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,920
 if these are all over the world or even all over the United States, it's basically in

635
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:47,800
 between your regular doctor that you can make an appointment to see and the emergency room.

636
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,080
 It's drop-in clinics.

637
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,840
 I've been to them hundreds of times throughout my life.

638
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,840
 Show up.

639
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,840
 Show up.

640
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,840
 I got some weird malady.

641
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,840
 I've stepped on something.

642
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,640
 I've got cut open.

643
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,320
 I go to the urgent cares all the time.

644
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,280
 But yeah, so you just show up and you get treated right there.

645
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,500
 She gets a severe blood infection.

646
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,500
 They can't tell what it is.

647
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:10,940
 They tell her to go to the emergency room and she says, "I don't have any money."

648
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,100
 So she went home.

649
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,060
 So don't do that, right?

650
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:18,620
 Most emergency, if you don't own a home, if you don't own any assets, just go to the emergency

651
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,620
 room.

652
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:23,220
 They'll send you a bill and they'll work with you.

653
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,220
 They'll work with you.

654
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,380
 Usually, I know the Catholic ones do.

655
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,780
 I can't speak for all of them.

656
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:31,100
 I can't speak for a greedy Memorial Hospital United or whatever.

657
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:36,640
 But yeah, if you're going to die and you don't own any assets, I would recommend going to

658
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,200
 the ER, at least to do that.

659
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,400
 You own a house, then that's a little more tricky.

660
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:48,880
 But she goes home and her fever rises to 106.

661
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,640
 And at this point, she's basically just laying on the floor.

662
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,560
 She's cooking to death.

663
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,760
 Her brain is boiling.

664
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:59,680
 And that is when she looks up at the television set and appearing on big block letters right

665
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,900
 on the television set.

666
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:06,620
 Are the words, "Listen and you will live."

667
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:11,820
 So Wendy in this horrible fever with this horrible blood infection, all these other horrible

668
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:15,340
 health problems, the flu, she gets to her feet.

669
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,100
 She uses all of her strength to get to her feet and she's begging.

670
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,940
 I'll do anything it takes.

671
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:24,820
 Just don't, I just don't want to suffer anymore.

672
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,820
 She collapses.

673
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,180
 She blacks out.

674
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:33,640
 A couple hours later, she wakes up.

675
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,600
 Totally fine.

676
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,600
 Blood infection as far as she can tell is gone.

677
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,200
 I don't know how she would diagnose that.

678
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,200
 She's cutting open her finger.

679
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,440
 She's like, "That looks like good blood."

680
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,120
 That's not infected at all.

681
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,560
 She said her blood infection is gone.

682
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,560
 She feels great.

683
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,680
 She says she hasn't even been sick since.

684
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:56,360
 And she started to think, "Maybe I'm not crazy."

685
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,040
 Maybe I was never crazy.

686
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,920
 And then she says, "This is one of her quotes.

687
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:09,020
 Since that moment, this entity tells me everything."

688
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:13,340
 She says, "By listening to the entity, it is told her about her mission in life."

689
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:17,080
 See there are people out there that she needs to help.

690
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,200
 And the entity will tell her what she needs to do.

691
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:25,780
 Word for word, the entity will tell her what she needs to buy and what she needs to learn

692
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:29,720
 to help these people.

693
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:34,600
 And then she starts getting, she says she starts getting messages from burner accounts

694
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:41,840
 on Reddit with nonsense phrases and the three digit number.

695
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:47,400
 One of these makes references and in-jokes about stuff she's had dreams about, things

696
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,780
 she's never mentioned to anyone.

697
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,180
 This account will kind of reference stuff.

698
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,280
 That firefighter's hat sure was big, wasn't it ma'am?

699
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,600
 I don't know if the post had an accent.

700
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,560
 It said, "Hey seed in mouth."

701
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,600
 She's like, "Ah, the accent."

702
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:07,880
 But she said that one only pops up on Reddit when she doesn't know what to do next.

703
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,360
 She says she has refined her ability to contact the entity.

704
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:16,320
 Instead of it just putting voices in her head, she has a decatero cards and she hasn't used

705
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:22,780
 them as normal tarot cards but she lays them out and it makes a pattern and it will tell

706
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:29,020
 her what the entity is trying to express.

707
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:33,660
 She says the voices of the entity no longer mentally torment her.

708
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:40,500
 In fact, it seems playful and friendly when it wants to be.

709
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:45,160
 April 22nd she posted this, it seems fairly uplifting, right?

710
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:52,400
 These uplifting voices in your head can be saving her life, giving her direction.

711
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,160
 And I started looking through the posts around this time period and I did see people respond

712
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:00,760
 like she had posted something about weight loss and someone would leave a very cryptic

713
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,840
 code.

714
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,160
 Like that's what the dollhouse said.

715
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,040
 And then she would respond, "Why are you here?

716
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,040
 Why are you here?"

717
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:14,260
 So, that's why I didn't want to write anything or email her because I was like, "Someone

718
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:19,140
 obviously is messing with her and I don't know how far back she's been posting."

719
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:24,420
 I mean, I guess I'm going to look at it but Steve is eating bagels.

720
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:31,020
 You, I can, someone or some people are messing with her or it's possible that she's doing

721
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:36,780
 it herself or not that she's trying to fake it which is obviously always possible but

722
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:42,160
 she could be so disassociated that she has multiple accounts herself.

723
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,520
 I think someone's messing with her, a couple of people are messing with her.

724
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,440
 I think she's probably posting somewhere that she sees these numbers and da da da da da

725
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,320
 and people are posting them and which is cruel really at that point.

726
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:57,680
 Like this person seems to have, seems to have some sort, definitely a whole host of health

727
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:03,720
 problems and seems to be on a very, very serious mental health journey.

728
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:08,500
 So I mean like cracking jokes that make her think that she's being contacted or being

729
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:13,420
 harassed by agents against this entity or whatever she thinks this thing is.

730
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:17,260
 That's why she doesn't want to reveal the three digit number so that way she can verify

731
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:20,740
 when people actually do use the three digit number that they're correct.

732
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:30,620
 And you could go, "Jay, seeing as a paranormal researcher, how do you say that this is insane

733
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,960
 versus other people who communicate with entities?

734
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:39,240
 You yourself, you've had interactions with demons and angels and shadow men and all this

735
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,240
 stuff."

736
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:45,880
 And you know what's interesting is each time that happens I think I'm going crazy.

737
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:50,480
 Like every single time that has happened, and it's not happened a bunch, but I go, "Oh

738
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,160
 my god, I've lost my mind.

739
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,680
 I've totally lost my mind."

740
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,200
 And I'm not, the only person who does that, there's tons of people who've had communications.

741
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,320
 Grant, Grant has them coming right out of their faucet.

742
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:06,140
 It makes her, why do you lean towards mental health on her story versus the other story?

743
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,700
 It's a feeling, I can't even really tell you.

744
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,020
 Like I can't say this is specifically why.

745
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,020
 Who knows, right?

746
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:16,500
 It's not that, it's not necessarily health problems, it's just sometimes you have a

747
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,580
 hunch.

748
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:20,420
 But here's the frightening thing about this one.

749
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:26,020
 I think she may be contacting an entity.

750
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,660
 It may be real.

751
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:32,720
 It's possible that her brain got cooked by a 106 degree fever.

752
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,720
 That will do it.

753
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:41,660
 That's enough for an adult to cause some at a very least short term brain damage.

754
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:45,040
 And someone who was already struggling with mental health stuff, remember the story started

755
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:52,560
 three years ago, the fever was fairly recent.

756
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,920
 She might have connected with something.

757
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,800
 And that's what scares me.

758
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,740
 I would much rather have people, I had to choose, right?

759
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,460
 I'm not like, woo!

760
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:06,580
 If I had to choose, I would much rather a lot of these stories be mental health because

761
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:12,220
 mental health can be treated with counseling, or with medication, or with observation and

762
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,220
 things like that.

763
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:23,180
 The paranormal stuff is much harder to take care of.

764
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,900
 Far, far more difficult to deal with.

765
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:31,720
 It's not only are you really trying to handle it from a mental health perspective, and this

766
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,320
 is a spiritual issue.

767
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,520
 You don't know what the power level is of this entity.

768
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,520
 Is it an imp?

769
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,520
 Right?

770
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:45,080
 Is it just a little demonic creature that's crawled out of the depths of somewhere?

771
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,080
 Dark?

772
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,080
 Old?

773
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,160
 That's attached itself?

774
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:52,920
 Is it a solar plexus clown glider?

775
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,960
 Is it a demon?

776
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:00,900
 Is it a cosmic horror?

777
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:04,740
 These are all totally different things that require totally different methods.

778
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:08,100
 Now you could say exorcism would probably get rid of all of them, right?

779
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:16,540
 A good old fashioned religious exorcism, but you don't know, right?

780
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:20,780
 We covered that story about that guy who they did like a 10 hour exorcism on and then they

781
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:24,500
 had to take a break and they said, "Well, we got all of the demons out of them except

782
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,500
 for two.

783
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,840
 Wrath and murder, but I'm sure he's fine going home."

784
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,760
 That's one of my favorite episodes of Dead Rapper Radio.

785
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,760
 I'll put that in the show notes.

786
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:37,160
 That really is one of my favorite stories I've ever covered on this show, which says

787
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,160
 something right, which says something that's totally terrifying.

788
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,160
 Gave me nightmares.

789
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,760
 I had nightmares after recording that episode.

790
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,240
 But yeah, what is this?

791
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,640
 I would much rather Wendy have this mental health.

792
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,480
 I would much rather, oh first off, I would much rather her not have any of these issues,

793
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,480
 right?

794
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,780
 And not have a story to tell on Friday.

795
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:02,340
 If I had to be 100%, I'd much rather do a four episode a week podcast and not have

796
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:06,380
 a story like this of this poor woman suffering through this.

797
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:10,080
 But if I had to choose, again, I would choose that it would be a mental health struggle

798
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:17,220
 versus a spiritual battle.

799
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:21,580
 But it's telling her what to do and it's laying out these plans and I found this one

800
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,100
 odd post someone had left.

801
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,100
 I'll try to find it again.

802
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,200
 I didn't, I don't remember the exact page.

803
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,200
 I'll see if I can find it again.

804
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,080
 But she was talking about something and one of these random people jumped in and left

805
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:35,440
 a code and she said, please, please, I can't wait another year.

806
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,360
 Tell me, tell me the plan.

807
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,640
 I'll do it.

808
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:44,560
 So she's like begging random people online that she thinks might be part of this grand

809
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,600
 conspiracy involving this entity.

810
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:52,880
 So weird and sad.

811
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:58,780
 And then the very last thing that I've seen her post was the day afterwards.

812
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,420
 It was April 23rd, 2022.

813
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:07,500
 The post itself was removed, but the title is still there.

814
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:21,660
 Quote, does anyone want to go to the void with me?

815
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:22,660
 What is this?

816
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,280
 It's just such a bizarre journey.

817
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:30,660
 As far as the recording of this, she's still posting on stuff, but it's weirdo stuff.

818
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:33,380
 She's not like, I don't want to get my scientific calculator to work.

819
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,580
 The batteries, I need to charge the batteries.

820
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,560
 It's more weird stuff.

821
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:41,460
 She's glomming on stuff and people are posting all these series of numbers and she's like,

822
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,740
 oh no, help me on my journal.

823
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,980
 It's like, dude.

824
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:50,740
 But mental health issues, most likely, right?

825
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:51,740
 I'm not going to say probably.

826
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:54,460
 I've pretty much gone through pretty good evidence.

827
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:56,180
 Some mental health struggles here.

828
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:59,980
 But what I want to end this note on, what I want to end this very depressing Friday episode

829
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:04,020
 on, I thought about this while I was reading the story, because last week we talked about

830
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:07,500
 a young woman who was also hearing voices from this entity.

831
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,860
 And this is something we cover a lot on this show.

832
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:13,740
 We've done, I'll try to put a couple other episodes in the show and it's, I find all

833
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,140
 of this stuff very fascinating.

834
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:21,060
 But I started to, let's put on our conspiracy caps and wrap the episode up like this.

835
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,980
 Very, very short wrap up.

836
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:25,500
 It's kind of just an open-ended question.

837
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:30,720
 We have all of these people hearing these voices all over the world.

838
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:36,880
 What if they're all coming from the same source?

839
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:48,940
 What if there is something dark and ancient and powerful talking to millions of people

840
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:54,060
 with mental health struggles all over the world?

841
00:44:54,060 --> 00:45:01,480
 Millions of different voices, but one voice.

842
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,360
 You may hear it as a woman.

843
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,620
 He may hear it as his aunt.

844
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:10,880
 She may hear it as just an anonymous dude's voice yelling in her ear while she's trying

845
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,560
 to sleep.

846
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:22,120
 Words of encouragement, words of hate, statements that drive you so mad you find yourself walking

847
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,120
 down the street.

848
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,120
 You've lost your job.

849
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,120
 You've lost your home.

850
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,280
 You've lost your family.

851
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:30,040
 You've turned to self-medicating yourself with the strongest street drugs available,

852
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:37,860
 the voices are still there, but they're all coming from the same source.

853
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:44,220
 And the source knows what it needs to do to push you.

854
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:49,140
 This person needs a word of encouragement to bring them into my fold.

855
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:57,420
 This person needs to think they're worthless to break them down to make them my servant.

856
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:03,160
 Millions of different voices screaming millions of different phrases in the minds of millions

857
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:08,920
 of different people spread across this planet.

858
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:15,080
 Millions of different voices, but one voice.

859
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:23,420
 Is there a terrifying puppet master living worlds and realities far beyond our own, slipping

860
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:32,860
 its tendrils into the minds of the most vulnerable people on the planet?

861
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:50,060
 Somewhere in the darkness, somewhere in the void, sits a monster with a million mouths.

862
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:52,560
