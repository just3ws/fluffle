 One of the one possibly one of the funniest true crime stories have come across recently we're gonna talk about that
 We're gonna take a look at a time that American frontiersmen
 politician
 Shooter of animals Davey Crockett had a run-in with the creature. He couldn't kill and
 Then we take a look at a bizarre
 Theory that goes back
 thousands of years
 Is it possible that diseases are?
 Actually supernatural today on Dead Rabbit Radio
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day
 I hope you guys are having a great day, too
 Let's go ahead and get started because we got a lot of stuff to cover here
 First off I want to give a shout out to our newest supporter of the show John from Scar
 John from the Scar group. Thank you so much. He's the one who's he's done a couple pieces of artwork for the show
 He's done the colored in Dead Rabbit logo, which you'll see appear a lot
 He also did the custom artwork for the
 final episode of the Korea week North Korea week
 So I wanted to give John from Scar a shout out longtime supporter of the show
 So you are going to be our carboner copter pilot for today
 You're gonna be our chauffeur. You're gonna take us wherever we want to go
 Doesn't matter if you want to go there. You are the one driving us around now
 Let's go ahead and first off. Let's hop in the Jason Jalopy John. Let's go ahead. Let we're leaving behind Hood River
 We're headed out to Natick, Massachusetts never heard of this town before never
 I've never even knew it existed right and today I wake up. I've literally just got done reading this story
 I'm recording this episode extremely early because the story is so hilarious
 I just got to tell this story for driving out. We're leaving behind Hood River
 We're going to Natick, Massachusetts. It's August
 2019 now
 They do a little bit of a meta here before actually getting the story. Let me tell you what was going on
 It just woke up probably about two hours ago. I'm doing my reading
 I do all reading all my articles in the morning stuff like that and I'm
 drinking my Diet Pepsi
 half awake
 And I see this headline this couple is suing this this married couple suing some eBay executives
 For harassment or something like that and I remember looking at being like, ah, you know some lunatic, right couple couple
 Loona I guess I'm some sort of bootlicking corporate shill because I saw the headline and I was like a couple lunatics
 Accusing this company of something they probably didn't commit
 I'm kind of reading through the article and I'm reading it
 I'm like, oh these guys probably just looking for a quick payday and then I get about halfway through the article
 I'm barely awake. Okay, I get half through the article and I start seeing words pop up like prosecutors
 federal charges
 Felony and I go whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second. This isn't some lunatic lawsuit
 This isn't some like civil civil lawsuit because this story is absolutely insane
 So when I was reading and I was like, this can't be true, right? This has to be some people looking for a quick payday
 Let's rewind back in time and go to August of 2019
 There's this married couple right they live in a Natick, Massachusetts and they've provoked the ire of eBay
 The online auction site really the only online auction site and the only one that matters
 Six former eBay executives have been charged federal crimes
 Now this is all alleged, right? But one of the guys is on the run right now. They can't find them authorities can't find them
 They're charged with high-level eBay executives. Okay
 they're charged with conspiracy to commit cyber stalking and
 Conspiracy to tamper with witnesses and you're like what?
 The two main people involved was James. This is all alleged again James Bogg
 He's the former senior director of safety and security for eBay and then you have David Harville
 eBay's former director of global security and resiliency again
 This wasn't a couple people working at the warehouse who were having a crummy day
 These are people who ran their security teams
 They also had the you also had the former senior manager of global intelligence and a former senior manager of special operations for eBay's
 global security team
 Okay, all alleged and that's the lesson I'm gonna say that
 So you have these high-level people who are threatening emails and texts are threatening to crush this lady
 I'm gonna put her down. They're gonna show her what's what
 So listen the reason why they're all former and executives is because eBay is already running internal investigation
 And fired all of these people and said we had nothing to do with this
 We have nothing to do with this other people say it may go a little bit higher against the CEO of eBay actually
 Recently over this over what we're about to get into if these former eBay executives, right?
 high-level
 These people are pulling in hundreds of thousands of dollars a year and they want to strike back at this couple
 They want to quote crush this lady
 So this is what they this is what you're paying all this money for for your senior manager of global intelligence
 These are the plans they come up with to harass this couple. They send threatening messages emails text messages
 That's pretty standard, right? They send pizzas. Okay. This should have been an obvious setup, right?
 The pizza parlor is is should have
 They should be responsible for this one at 4 30 in the morning
 Tom and those pizza like obviously that's fake
 No, I don't even know pizza parlors are open at 4 30 in the morning
 But apparently if you have eBay on your side, you can make them open they add this is pretty funny
 They put a ad online
 That said if we're having a yard sale, but if no one is outside force said yard sale just knock on her door
 That's pretty harmless, right? I mean it'd be annoying
 And again the people who I mean who walks up to an empty yard and be like yuck yuck
 I wonder this with this location the yard sale, right?
 Well, better go knock on the door
 Yard sales at 4 30 in the morning. They also this is where it starts to get a little more iffy. They put a craigslist ad
 Inviting singles couples and swingers to their house to party after 10 p.m. Every night now
 That's like trolling 101 and it's quite hilarious to think that you imagine like a boardroom and all these people are sitting there in their
 Suits and their ties and stuff like that. They actually have like a PowerPoint
 They're like, what are we going to do to this couple today?
 And they're like, I don't know how's the Swinger initiative going and they're like go to the next slide
 They're like according to this five percent of all swingers in Nantik have been to this house
 You see now why I thought this was just somebody I was like there's no way that eBay executives that actually be doing this
 I'm reading the article and I'm just kind of glancing over and I'm thinking there's no way that
 There's no way this would be happening, right?
 But then I get further down and the federal government is involved these guys are actually being charged one guy is on the run
 But that's not all that's not all because remember who you're messing with bro. You're messing with eBay and
 eBay known for
 Having access to every single thing on the planet
 So I mean I could call up and have a bunch of swingers show up at your house, right? I could not gonna but I could
 But eBay has the villain
 Basically has access to every prank in the world
 So this is they started sending this couple stuff
 They get a bloody Halloween pig mask like the mask the saw pig woman thing
 It's like a head, you know, you guys know what a pig woman looks like
 I don't know. Maybe you don't maybe you don't watch horror movies
 I mean sure it wouldn't be fun to get in the mail, but whatever
 Then now you have a holy costume. Thanks eBay. They sent this is cruel
 Married couple sitting there one day you get a book how to survive the death of a spouse
 That's dark but then the line thinks up
 They send them a box of maggots
 You're like already reading this book. They're like, oh, this is kind of creep. They're sending us some threats
 But next to the big mask
 Next day you get a box the box is moving across your table
 Box of maggots box of live spiders. I mean it come on these guys
 This is genius trolling at this point
 This is when some executive at eBay overheard and goes what you're having a bunch of swir show up at your house
 Why don't we send them all the gross stuff we sell on eBay box of maggots box of live spiders?
 Which you know both of those you have to open right to find the maggots in the spiders
 It's not like you just saw a box on it
 It's from spiders or us with a sticker on it caution live spiders inside they open the box up the spiders poured out
 I know that probably triggered some of you guys and I meant to do that
 I meant to do that open a box up bunch of maggots pop out
 One giant maggots rule them all
 This was funny. This is another funny one. I mean they're all kind of funny except for the book they sent a
 They sent them a bunch of porn
 But see that that's one thing you're like, all right. I just got my free porn magazines first time if you'd go
 They still make porn magazines. This is quite quaint. I'm gonna show this to my hipster friends
 They sent porn, but they sent it to their neighbors with their name on it
 Basically it looks like they were ordering the couple was ordering the porn, but it was getting delivered to the wrong address
 That's a nice spin eBay
 Give a plot for that's funny
 That's that porn to the neighbors with their name on it. That's pretty funny. I'm not doing to me, right?
 But still pretty funny and then they sent them a pig
 I just had to record this story like when I got the reading they sent him a pig fetus
 They sent this couple a pig fetus, but
 But the shipper of the pig fetus something sparked in their brain and was like, hmm
 They actually called up the family first. They probably realized it was going to a residential address
 It was probably like for is this the place my uncle lives in that town
 He's got a bunch of porn that he didn't order and it had his neighbors name on it
 They called up the family go did you order a pig fetus?
 No, we did not order a pig fetus so they didn't get that so you're asking yourself what in the world could have
 Prompted six there. I don't know if I said this earlier. It's six different eBay executives
 Who have been fired and are currently facing charges one is arrested the other ones on the run and for the people born arrested
 But they're facing these charges
 What could have made these eBay executives again last time allegedly?
 Start a campaign of terror
 sending swingers sending a sex perverts to their house
 pizzas maggots
 Live spiders. They're still running around look behind you. There's one ten yards away from you at any given time. They're everywhere
 All this stuff attempted attempted pig fetus delivering what could this couple have possibly done to get this
 They wrote a newsletter
 They wrote a newsletter about e-commerce and in the newsletter they talked about eBay
 said eBay sucked and
 Then in the anonymous comments people to be like you're right eBay sucks
 That was it that was it
 That's terrifying right I
 100% thought because I read the article obviously backwards the lead was these this couple writes this newsletter and eBay is harassing them
 And I'm thinking that's
 Impossible I remember reading go they're probably just suing them in court because they got a bloody pig mask and it could have you know
 Someone could have been messing with them or whatever. I thought that's
 Impossible and I kept reading the article and I'm thinking I'm half awake and I'm thinking they're firing civil charges against six eBay executives
 Saying that they were speaking truth to power and they were getting harassed because a bloody pig mask got sent to their house and
 Then I was that uh-uh
 nope
 They these people are being charged they're facing jail sentence prison sentences
 They've been fired from their job at eBay after an internal investigation
 That's
 Terrifying and and the couple went to the local police and they were like telling the cops that the cops at first were kind of like
 What I was doing like that sounds impossible
 And then finally the detectives really started looking into it
 They pushed it really really hard and then they got all the eBay and eBay started investigating and canned all these people that's terrifying, right?
 like I
 It sounds made up, but no and the the police are saying we're not gonna reveal the name of the couple or their blog
 We're not even gonna reveal it was a blog. It was a blog dude
 Like you know what I mean think about that would be the quick think about how much people crap on Michael Bay online all the time
 Right and the fact that Michael Bay would even take one one minute out of his time to post a craigslist ad to send
 Swingers to your house sounds ridiculous
 But these guys had a targeted campaign against this couple and that's it who had a blog talking about e-commerce and they're like eBay sucks
 Now and here's the thing we don't know because I don't have access to the blog
 I don't know exactly what they said, but I can't admit the most scathing review of eBay the most
 Expose a review of eBay on this blog
 Would not justify that activity right eBay couldn't I
 It's boggles my mind because obviously this wasn't a executive having a bad day and goes you stink leaves like a fake phone call
 This was like targeted harassment over time period, right? It takes a while to arrange a big thing to get sent to somebody's house
 Absolutely bizarre terrifying really
 You think I like I'm always coming across gang stalking stuff, and I'm like a gang stalking any gang stalking me
 This is usually a bunch of bunch of weirdos, right? And that was my knee-jerk reaction to this one. It's like there's no way
 This is true absolutely creepy, and then I think as I'm reading the article people that I piss off all the time
 Like yeah, so anyways that is a bizarre true crime story. It's funny
 It's good that the people are getting justice and it probably make me pause a little bit more
 When I wake up in the morning and I'm reading an article like this or even in the midday because I completely brushed it off
 I was thinking out this can't be true, but they're being dragged in front of federal court
 Really the couple now they may be making the blog still we don't know but the couple now definitely
 Can sue eBay later on get a ton of money?
 I'm sure lawyers are already salivating over that lawsuit and they got a free free box
 It's out of it, right and they made some new friends. It turns out that the real harassment was the swing or friends
 They made along the way
 I think that is the real lesson to learn from this whole thing. So shame on you
 former executives of eBay and possibly other members of the eBay community allegedly
 But who knows
 Scary though, isn't it dude like all the stuff that's put out there on a daily basis all those negative opinions out there on a daily basis
 I can understand if you're making fun of like a local restaurant and they like get uppity and they're like no you take that down
 And so I mean it's still still despicable like people are allowed to have their opinions and things like that
 But then the restaurant should just be like ah, whatever we have enough good customers
 Or maybe that review is valid or whatever
 But that's like a local thing to have eBay actually care what some blog whether or not the blog had 10 readers or 100,000 readers or whatever
 It wouldn't affect their overall business for whatever reason what this person was saying in this blog
 Was really digging into eBay's skin
 But still
 Live maggots was a bridge too far eBay. I mean again, I got a free bloody pig mask out of it. That's awesome
 But everything else is pretty gross. Let's go ahead that story took a long time
 I'm editing nothing that story took a little bit longer than I thought so we're gonna save the davi crocket story for tomorrow
 It's quite short, but it's not short enough to really do justice now
 John let's hop in the carpenter copter. We're leaving behind natik
 Massachusetts and I yes. Yes, you do notice I have a
 Safeway plastic bag in my hand and john's like you're not really that's not what I think it is
 It's all wiggling
 It's a little of both you'll never know when you need
 A handful of maggot spiders we might in the rest of this story who knows so i'm gonna carry this bag around for the rest
 They have us in we're flying the helicopter
 We're flying it out
 We're leaving behind the united states and we are headed out to
 Thailand
 We're flying over the villages. It's january 2013. We're going to tamban ta seawang in thailand
 so we're walking through this village
 and
 Everything's going normal. It's just normal village life. There's a bunch of dudes singing about stuff some chick wants to read books
 And then this young healthy man falls over dead
 People are like oh what happened that kind of ruined the big chorus we were building up to
 A couple days later another young healthy man in the village dies
 Over the course of a couple days four men in total die of some respiratory illness
 So they contact a medium doctors can't figure it out
 So they contact a medium
 And she says you have to hang a red shirt outside of your house if you have a young man in your house
 You have to hang a red shirt outside your house that'll keep the ghost from getting them
 I actually mentioned this on yesterday's episode
 Disease goes away young men stop dying five years later in 141 kilometers away. What is that like 200 miles in nakton
 Ratchezma's femi district
 Young man dies respiratory illness. No one can figure it out a couple days later another young man dies
 respiratory illness
 This is in 2018
 Word gets out of what the cure could be
 Put a red shirt hanging outside your house
 People stop dying now in in the area
 They attribute this to a a widow's curse a widow's ghost. It's basically a
 What it what it sounds like a a woman whose husband died when she passes away her spirit is floating around and it's striking down young men
 Is some sort of brutal revenge thing
 And the red shirt or red towel was to wave it away
 But you know, it's probably just is a skeptic. It's probably just
 Coincidence, right? You have a disease that strikes. You have an unknown respiratory illness that strikes and it's already run its course
 The red shirts don't actually change anything
 The disease would have stopped anyways. Let's leave behind tylen. Let's head out to india. This is in 2020
 We meet a man. We meet the swami
 chakrapani
 He's the national president of the all india hindu
 maha shabaha
 And he's making this statement. We're standing in this crowd and he's making this statement in india
 the corona virus
 Is an avatar
 sent to get revenge for eating animals and everyone in the
 Crowd is clapping everyone in the crowd is clapping and he's like yes
 Yes, it has come down
 to destroy
 the meat eaters
 And it's ravaging the planet. We've gotten out of control. We've lost our way
 We've lost balance with nature. He knows the cure for it
 The president of china must create an idol of the corona
 And seek forgiveness
 All non vegetarian chinese people must pledge to not hurt any innocent creatures
 And doing this will make the corona return to its own plane of existence
 We're standing in this crowd and you go well
 The last i checked the could not only chinese people were eating meat
 And last i checked not only chinese people had corona virus and i was i'm like yes
 Yes, but india and china don't really like each other. I want to use these two stories really as a jumping off point
 Do diseases have a super natural origin?
 We talk about demonic possession where a demon can
 Inhabit a human being and cause it to cause chaos destruction work for ebay starts sending out pig fetuses all this stuff
 A demon can possess a body. Why couldn't a demon?
 possess a germ
 Why couldn't a demon possess something smaller than a human body?
 And if the and i'm not disregarding corona virus or any disease whatsoever. I'm not saying i'm not saying anything like that
 This is a thought experiment
 But if a demon can possess a human and biblically a demon can possess a pig
 That happened when the dude was possessed and jesus was like you get out of that dude and the demons are like uh, uh, uh
 And that's where that famous quote comes from when jesus has how many demons are in you the demon goes
 We are legion for we are many
 And the demons like no that was a cool line
 But get out get out and the demons are like aw and they he
 God puts them in the bodies of pigs like possesses a bunch of pigs with them
 It's like get in there and then the pigs drown themselves
 the demons cause the pigs to drown themselves so
 Biblically demons can possess non-human creatures in fiction and impossible
 stories that you see
 Demons may be able to possess inanimate objects
 Onto dolls and stuff like that, but you could debate whether or not one those stories are correct at all
 But you though you could have human ghosts inhabit those as well
 I don't know if a human ghost could technically possess a human
 But I should look into that considering that is kind of my job. But can a demon
 possess
 a germ
 It's an interesting question because what that would mean
 What it would mean is that the germ is vulnerable to the same thing that the demon is vulnerable to
 So again in demon lore you can perform an exorcism on a human
 You can put holy water on a human who's possessed by demon and it would drive these things out
 If you are now again, this is gonna sound completely ridiculous, but if you add a a germ
 On a slide like a micro microscope slide and you have a dropper of holy water when squirt squirt
 Would the germ react to it now if you have a microscope
 Please do that. Please go get some water and then start getting people to cough on slides
 Maybe you can find ones that are demonically possessed, but wouldn't that be interesting?
 I think it's an interesting thought experiment. Could a demon infect a germ and if it did
 Would when humans are possessed again according to demon lore when humans are possessed they become incredibly strong
 They become super smart. They can speak languages. They basically have
 All the intelligence of a demon. So they've been around for tens of thousands of years of centuries tens of thousands of centuries
 They have all the intelligence of the demon. They're physically strong. They can pick people up. They're in the classroom
 Maybe some mild telekinetic powers now that I think about it is actually interesting because
 Demons don't have a lot of powers once they're in a human body
 They can mildly make stuff levitate, but like dematerialization things like that bending spoons
 It doesn't really work that way. They're pretty limited
 But they definitely do have increased strength and they have the vast intelligence of a demon
 If you put that into a germ you lose it. I mean, I don't not say the germs are going to be able to bench press 10 other germs
 But it may be able to become a more hearty creature
 a creature more immune to
 cures
 So if we accept that demons can possess people
 Why couldn't demons possess germs and if demons possess germs?
 or a virus
 What's to stop it from being a virus that is close to being incurable?
 You could have it so that the demon virus that I can't believe
 I'm actually even saying this out loud. You can have it when the demon demon virus when it splits and replicates
 Does it have the full strength of the demon in each little atom?
 Or does the demon get weaker and weaker?
 And the reason why I think it's interesting is because
 We talk so much about healing the body healing the body when it comes to medicine, but even
 Western medicine is coming around with the idea that you also have to heal the mind
 That visualization plays a huge part in healing
 They do say that having visualization when you're sick imagining the cancer cells slowly dying off turning into nothingness
 helps so much
 So when even western medicine and eastern medicine has always been about the spirit the mind as well
 It's not just like here take this you also have to
 Work on your mind your meditation your onefulness to help defeat the disease
 So what if diseases aren't just a biological enemy?
 What if on just a basic level it's not just attacking the body but attacking the mind attacking the soul?
 So to cure them you have to fight them on both levels
 And if we accept that then we can push it one step further and say that not only is a life-threatening disease
 Something that attacks the mind and the body but also something that attacks the spirit the soul
 That's the demonic angle to it
 By no means saying stop taking your medicine. I'm by no means at all saying don't go to the doctor when you're sick
 But you can always supplement
 Your healing with healing you can do yourself do what the doctors tell you to do
 But at the same time being mindful
 Meditating visualizing can help a lot as well
 If the world of the supernatural is inhabiting the world of microbes
 The battle to find cures for these diseases that have plagued mankind for centuries and new ones that are popping up today
 Can go on even longer
 Because we're not fighting just one enemy. We're not just fighting a biological enemy. We're not simply fighting an enemy of flesh and blood
 But of spirit
 It's not one that just creeps in our bedroom at night or follows us down a dark road when we're alone, but it inhabits
 amoebas
 turns sniffles
 into respiratory illnesses
 And we could labor for years and years and years in laboratories
 trying to find a cure
 And when we find a cure we find out it only works or barely works or doesn't work
 But maybe the component that is missing isn't
 Another amino acid
 Maybe the cure that's missing is the right medicine
 and a red flag
