00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,180
 China shoots to the top of the arms race and is autism the next step in human evolution today on Dead Rabbit Radio

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:21,920
 Hey everyone, this is Jason Carpenter back for another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. Hope you're having a great day

3
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,560
 It's the July 3rd. It's the day before the 4th of July. I think I'm gonna do a couple episodes

4
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,820
 Record a couple episodes today. I'm probably gonna be out doing stuff tomorrow

5
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,120
 I hope you guys are having fun to whatever you decide to do wherever you're at

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,720
 Hope you guys have a good day tomorrow and today not just tomorrow

7
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,000
 Don't let that despair code get you down the despair code in the last episode

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,800
 It's funny because I know that I'm gonna get some pushback on that episode

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,260
 Because I kind of said this is what the despair code is

10
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,960
 there's a lot of theories of what the despair code is and

11
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:01,320
 That one seemed to be the most succinct so if you've ever been curious about what the despair code probably actually is again

12
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,320
 It's a conspiracy theory and it's most likely made up

13
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,280
 but the idea that you make your own reality and

14
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:11,600
 It can be a reality of despair or it can be a reality of hope and it really depends on on

15
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,440
 Your worldview and remember you can always change your worldview. You can have

16
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,080
 some negative feelings and

17
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,600
 Bring them around to something positive and the same thing you can be on the top of the world

18
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,520
 And you just like let life beat you down, but but don't let that happen. I'll always try to be on the positive side

19
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,840
 You know when I was talking about the despair code yesterday

20
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,720
 I was like, oh, you know the despair. Hey, everyone's like don't research it. Don't research it. It's totally awful

21
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:41,000
 And I'm like, yeah, yeah, whatever. I have had the worst diarrhea since I've done that episode

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,120
 The worst okay, not the worst, but it's been pretty bad. I had left work early because my stomach was killing me. I

23
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,320
 was

24
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,880
 dodging I

25
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,320
 Was basically pulling the matrix with my butthole

26
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,960
 I was barely making it

27
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,800
 In time to the bathroom my pants were like kneel like just sliding off in slow motion

28
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,280
 bending backwards to avoid

29
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,920
 To avoid what was coming forth agent Smith is now my colon

30
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:17,080
 It was bad. So maybe that's what the despair code actually is referenced to it has nothing to do with

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,360
 Being trapped in your own universe. It actually makes your gut

32
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,560
 Feel despair. That's where you feel it all

33
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:32,040
 All I ate today. I had a little coconut oil, which you of course you're like, well Jason, that's really bad

34
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,480
 But I have coconut oil all the time I got used to it. I had some beef jerky and cheese sticks and it was

35
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,960
 I was reacting as if I had like stage four

36
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,240
 Spanish flu

37
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,640
 You know given to me by a

38
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,320
 Swine in the middle of a Chinese chicken factory. It was bad

39
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:56,200
 I held up a good front. I didn't let anyone at work see how distressed I was

40
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,760
 But I think they picked up on it when every five minutes. I just clutched my stomach said I gotta go to the bathroom

41
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,120
 So maybe I didn't come off as cool as I thought I didn't

42
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,720
 It was pretty gnarly though. Now. I know you're thinking what does this have to do with anything and

43
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,040
 um

44
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,640
 Doesn't really oh it will does because I think

45
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,880
 I should probably put a disclaimer at the beginning of that last episode

46
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,600
 May cause intense bowel

47
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,600
 discomfort

48
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,320
 because I I uh it may now this episode will probably be

49
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,240
 edited quite a lot as I stop it

50
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,000
 Run away

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,680
 And then come back

52
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,680
 You know what I think's weird

53
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,000
 Is people don't like to use public restrooms

54
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,240
 Now i'm not saying i'm like a public restroom aficionado, but

55
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:54,600
 Actually, I am I've actually thought about starting a website where I review public restrooms because I spend so much time in public restrooms

56
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,680
 I go

57
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,000
 To the restroom like not all the time, but generally if when I'm out at a restaurant

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,560
 I use the restroom I'll use the restrooms at

59
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,120
 Grocery stores and gas stations too gas stations are the worst, but we know they're the worst

60
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,920
 But I've been in some good. I've been into some amazing restrooms

61
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,280
 Like you're like this restroom is nicer

62
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:22,280
 Than the house I grew up in I've never been to a restroom where someone's giving me a towel like a steam towel

63
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,360
 I always thought that would be interesting

64
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,600
 And of course we've all been to those disgusting restrooms that like have no toilet seat

65
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,520
 And you kind of have to like put your hand against the door otherwise it'll open up

66
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:38,120
 The worst are the bathrooms where the door opens out instead of in because then I'm always afraid someone

67
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,960
 Can just get in I all like I'm always afraid someone's going to either

68
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:48,200
 That actually happened once so I was in the restroom in a mcdonald's in sacramento on how avenue

69
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,720
 And it was like seven in the morning

70
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:58,600
 I used to go in I had to work like at eight or nine, but I used to go into mcdonald's buy a newspaper get a couple cookies

71
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,040
 Drink some coffee

72
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,880
 use the restroom

73
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:09,080
 And so one day I go into the restroom and I'm I'm actually reading the newspaper in the restroom at this point and

74
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,640
 I hear someone into the restroom

75
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,680
 And then the lights go out

76
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,680
 And it's pitch black because obviously there's no window

77
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:25,640
 And I'm sitting there in the pitch black and I know someone else is in the bathroom with me

78
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:33,800
 And I just yell out who did that like I had to not say it as loud possible because I'm have this condenser mic

79
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,880
 But I'm like who did that

80
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,040
 And I hear this voice sound like a homeless person. They have a distinctive type

81
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,600
 I think their vocal cords have evolved to be homeless and he's like I don't know man

82
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,320
 I don't know and the whole time I'm expecting someone to grab my ankles because

83
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,960
 The thing the you know how they have that huge gap between the floor and the bottom of the door

84
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,360
 I imagined someone cut the light off and was going to crawl into the stall with me and grab my ankles

85
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,120
 And I was ready to step on a dude's neck

86
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:08,440
 Like I had one leg up and I was like if I feel anything grab me they're crippled for life

87
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,560
 I will I will begin just smashing their skull in

88
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:16,520
 And he goes I don't know man. I don't know and I'm all turn the lights on

89
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:22,680
 I'm cussing a lot now too and the guy's like I don't I can't I can't and then the door opens

90
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,280
 And now I'm getting the light from the mcdonald's and he steps out

91
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,680
 And then I sat in there and I

92
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,880
 Wiped obviously. I don't think I washed my hands if I got to be completely honest and I walked out

93
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,080
 And it was just a fuse something went out in the bathroom when pitch dark, but oh dude that was terrifying

94
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,720
 But even then I mean

95
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,320
 I I don't have a problem. I know people who hate

96
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,360
 Hate using public restrooms

97
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:56,520
 And they'll like oh they'll refuse to use them. It's always like dude. Just just go to that. No, no, no, I'm good

98
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:03,400
 And I did learn just for you know, here's a conspiracy. Why do women always go to the bathroom in pairs?

99
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,760
 This is really why I mean people go so we can talk about but but but no

100
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,400
 It's because women don't sit on the toilet seat

101
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,880
 They squat and they can't hold their purse while they're squatting so their friends are there to hold their purse

102
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:21,720
 Bam mystery solved dude. Just be honest if girls are just like oh, yeah, I hate sitting on toilet seats

103
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,720
 So I squat and I need someone to hold my purse

104
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:30,920
 Just why don't you just be honest just be honest with us ladies will cause far less gossip about you

105
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,880
 Now I will still gossip about you. Let's get started with the episode after I go to the bathroom

106
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:41,160
 We got some good stories for you today

107
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:46,600
 One of them actually came from a friend slash listener of mine that I've talked about before Veronica

108
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:52,200
 I was talking to her yesterday about the despair code and during the conversation

109
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,920
 She brought up an interesting topic

110
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,560
 Is she she believes

111
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,320
 That autism could be the next step in human evolution

112
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,040
 So we're going to go ahead and take a look at that but first

113
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:09,560
 First I got to address this story because it's the front page of drudge. It's been big news for about two days

114
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,120
 I wanted to talk about it last night. Didn't have a ton of time

115
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,400
 China

116
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,880
 Is ready to mass produce

117
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,880
 quote unquote laser guns

118
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,720
 China's getting ready to mass produce these guns

119
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,920
 I want to put the link on the show notes. You have to look at the pictures of these things

120
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,320
 Now what's amazing, you know the problem they've always had with laser weapons in the past

121
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:38,680
 Is the amount of cooling that is needed. We've had laser based weapons on our on a like our huge cargo planes

122
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:45,080
 And they every after each shot they would have to empty up the empty out the bay and just all this water would have to

123
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,160
 Flood out of it. They were constantly having to cool these big space guns down

124
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,880
 They were basically made basically used to shoot down missiles

125
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,280
 China's china's claiming to have invented these laser rifles

126
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:06,840
 That weigh as much as an ak-47. He uses a lithium ion battery just like your cell phone does it will allows it to have 300 at two second long shots

127
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:12,600
 And basically cooks you it puts a it puts an invisible

128
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,920
 Beam on you for two seconds that burns your skin

129
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:22,120
 It's this the article describes the pain as being excruciating and what's worse

130
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,760
 If you're wearing anything flammable

131
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,320
 It catches on fire now. You probably it's probably not like one beam and you're just like oh

132
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,760
 You're like totally like torched and you're like running through the street

133
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:40,440
 But it'll probably burn the area around that enough to panic you god knows what happens if they shoot you in the face with it

134
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,560
 I mean two seconds of a beam that's enough to set something on fire in your eyeball

135
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,320
 You're not going to have a very good day china said they're going to use these for

136
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,880
 Anti-terrorist actions and they do actually have a pretty big terrorist population over there with the Uyghurs

137
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,560
 It's not as bad as in other parts of the world, but it you know

138
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:04,200
 They are running into that it can also be one of the one of the examples

139
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,720
 They give is that it can be used in military action to set a fuel depot on fire. So these are these are pretty beefy

140
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,240
 I guess right now

141
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,680
 The production cost is about $15,000 per rifle, which is far far exceeds

142
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,720
 What an ak-47 is or another standard

143
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,960
 military rifle, but that's still incredibly cheap for technology like that that you're not

144
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,840
 carrying the added weight of

145
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,080
 You know 300 rounds

146
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,960
 300 rounds now you have a battery that can fire

147
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,080
 They're in the shots. They said the whole thing weighs like six kilos

148
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:43,000
 They said it's close to the weight of an actual ak-47. So good on you china. Don't use them against us

149
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,200
 Because that wouldn't be good

150
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,400
 But i'm sure here's one of those things if they're announcing these now

151
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,840
 I'm sure that other countries have had these for a while or been working on these for a while

152
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,920
 I think if you had something that was this much of a game changer

153
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,080
 You wouldn't announce it in your newspaper. You'd use it a couple times and

154
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:08,840
 Different actions and maybe now they're announcing it because they're going to start mass producing them and obviously people are like

155
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,160
 Hey, how come that dude is carrying around that?

156
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:17,240
 Awesome looking starship trooper rifle and they're like, oh, no, no, no, no, you know like don't pay attention to that now that they're mass produced

157
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,640
 It's uh, it's going to be a good thing. I think we're going to need them when we go to war

158
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,040
 with the aliens

159
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,160
 again

160
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,840
 Aliens could be interdimensional or from our own planet most likely not from space, but either way we're going to blow them out of this

161
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,080
 Blow them up

162
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,080
 You know nothing can defeat humanity

163
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:41,160
 We are the reigning champions on this planet and in this solar system and most likely the galaxy

164
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,320
 So nothing can stop us. Nothing can stop us. They could have all the laserships and

165
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:54,920
 Garbage and teleporters and whatever other sci-fi nerd stuff. They want they can't stop us. You know that I know that

166
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,480
 They'll know that soon enough now

167
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,360
 you know, it's funny because

168
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,440
 sci-fi science fiction

169
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,080
 Play such a big part in what we invent

170
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:10,520
 Science fiction really dictates where science goes. I believe

171
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,400
 The reason why people

172
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,480
 Beam down on star trek

173
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,280
 The reason normally everything before star trek other than like obscure sci-fi, but generally in

174
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,240
 Mainstream like flash gordon and stuff like that

175
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:28,440
 You would they were all shuttles like a ship would go here and flash gordon would out of it

176
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,400
 And what happened was gene roddenberry wanted to do this television show

177
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,360
 But it would cost too much to make all these models of these runabouts. That's the name of the shuttles on star trek

178
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,920
 I'm a huge star trek nerd by the way. That's like

179
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:46,680
 I forget harry potter forget, you know, all of that other nonsense star trek is my nerd jam

180
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,200
 But anyway, so they

181
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:53,800
 Instead of having those little runabouts and having shots of the ship landing each time and having to build like a life-size model

182
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,720
 Of the runabout for them to keep coming out move them set to set gene roddenberry goes

183
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,800
 Ah, I just haven't teleport down there

184
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:05,720
 That way we save tons of money each episode. We're just gonna have people slowly dissolve and slowly appear

185
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:12,600
 And that became such an iconic thing. You know the the term beam, you know, beam me up scotty

186
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,880
 Which actually was never in the show, but you know to to beam up and they go back and forth

187
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,160
 Young people watching that

188
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,560
 They are like, oh my god, that's so amazing and they start to try to invent teleportation

189
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,520
 They start trying to invent teleportation devices

190
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:32,200
 Um, I think that would we've been working on teleportation without star trek possibly

191
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,600
 But I don't think it would be so in the consciousness to want to do it the taser

192
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,800
 Well, not a lot of people know this the taser is actually the guy who invented the taser

193
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,520
 It's an acronym

194
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,320
 for tom a swifts electric rifle

195
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,080
 because

196
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,720
 Back in the day like in the turn of the century there was a

197
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,720
 Character named tom swift and he was like a little like huck fin type dude

198
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,800
 And he had an electric rifle and he would shoot the bad guys and it would stun him

199
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,560
 And the guy who invented the taser that was his favorite series of books

200
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:11,480
 So he wanted to invent a weapon that using electricity electricity would stun people that weapon has saved lives

201
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,320
 The taser gives people the opportunity between

202
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:21,720
 You know going toe to toe with someone and blowing their head off a taser gives you that middle ground

203
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,400
 If that

204
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,760
 Inventor had never read those books and was never inspired by those books

205
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,280
 We wouldn't have that or we most likely wouldn't have that

206
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,760
 You get that vision in your head

207
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,640
 So I always thought that was fascinating. How many people have tried inventing lightsabers?

208
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:43,720
 How many people have tried working on anti gravity devices and things like that? So the the old

209
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,000
 The old inventors they would look at nature and say

210
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,240
 How does a bird fly? I want to build something that flies like a bird and the new inventors will look at pop culture and say

211
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,280
 We can do this

212
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:02,200
 I I think we can actually do this what this fantastical idea is I think we can do this which I find fascinating

213
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:07,560
 I think science fiction is important as much as I poo poo people for being nerds and stuff like that and I will do that constantly

214
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,440
 I think it's great now

215
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:16,600
 This is a little there's not much of a segue here. So I'm just going to roll right into it

216
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:22,760
 So I was talking to Veronica the other day. Uh, she was saying that she feels like autism

217
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,880
 Is an evolutionary step. It's the next

218
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,160
 stage in human evolution because

219
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,000
 They have more empathy and they're kinder

220
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,360
 And they have this connection with nature that

221
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,320
 uh, neurotypical people don't have that wasn't her term, but that is the term for

222
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,360
 Normal people is you know neurotypical people who don't have autism

223
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:55,000
 And how they're they can she's telling me about how she knows people who can like communicate better with animals and how they're just this

224
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,840
 Next they could be this next step in human evolution and

225
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:04,840
 She said, you know what the world would be like without people with autism like 70 of mit graduates have autism and

226
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:09,720
 So on and so forth now. There's a couple of issues I have with that

227
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,000
 assessment one, I think that you can have this the

228
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:19,400
 Signs of autism and not be autistic just like you can have the signs of having the flu and not have the flu

229
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,960
 I could have diarrhea and vomiting

230
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,760
 And still not have the flu

231
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,720
 That doesn't mean I have the flu that just means I have some of the symptoms

232
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,080
 So if you're get really obsessive over certain details and you're

233
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:37,960
 You're just like hyper focused on one particular field that is a sim that is like a sign of autism

234
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:45,400
 I don't believe 70 of the people at mit if the word tested would actually be diagnosed with autism or aspergers or anything like that

235
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,920
 That being said

236
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,680
 I took what she said she was like, okay. This is interesting. It's her theory actually

237
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,240
 She's not alone. There are other people who believe that autism

238
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,640
 That that's a possibility that autism is the next stage in human evolution now

239
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,360
 What was interesting is the fur I found two articles

240
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,880
 One was from 2007 from discover magazine

241
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,560
 and they basically say that

242
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:19,720
 The they basically say that same position that the someone who is autistic

243
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:26,040
 They're basically evolving past our society because our society is basically become poisonous

244
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,000
 And only by turning inward

245
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,400
 Can you actually

246
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:36,120
 Like grow because our society has become so toxic over the centuries

247
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:42,360
 To to pull yourself out of it to be inside of yourself more than a part of society

248
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:48,280
 Is an evolutionary benefit and those people who are hyper focused and things like that will go on to succeed

249
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:55,320
 I'm gonna I'm gonna come back to that article in a second because this article is how we're gonna end it off

250
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,240
 but I wanted to give you that

251
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,080
 that lead in because

252
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:05,560
 The article discover magazine is is fairly well written. The next one is basically a letter to an editor

253
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,040
 where a

254
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,000
 author

255
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,680
 A woman I believe

256
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,680
 not like that matters, but

257
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:17,000
 Truly believes that autism is the next step in human evolution and and this is it

258
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:25,720
 What if those who fall anywhere anywhere within the autism spectrum disorder a sd are actually the next step in human evolution

259
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,880
 In my opinion anyone within the autism spectrum are gifted

260
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,400
 Pure empaths most certainly and probably

261
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:42,280
 Depending upon how high one is on the spectrum gifted with other psychic or new age gifts

262
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:47,640
 I think they were born feeling everything to such a high degree

263
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:53,560
 Their emotions are akin to someone whose raw nerves are exposed because they do not have their protection

264
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,960
 Layers skin provides

265
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:02,440
 They find it difficult to exist in a busy noisy dysfunctional world where there is so little peace to be found

266
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:09,880
 If you stand back and look our society is hurtling towards something ugly

267
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,000
 We interact less with each other on a personal level

268
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,360
 We care less for our neighbor. We find it easier to hate to destroy

269
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:25,240
 We have no respect for others and dishonor the earth. It's like the world is speeding out of control and no one cares

270
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,640
 so

271
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,640
 So what if

272
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,040
 The chosen few within a sd are actually nature's solution

273
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,840
 An attempt to save us all from the destruction society is speeding tour

274
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,800
 speeding toward

275
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,800
 And so on and so forth. She continues to

276
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,280
 give everyone with autism a

277
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,680
 hand job but now

278
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,840
 Here's the thing that is the most hippie-dippy highfalutin

279
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,000
 ridiculous

280
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 Read on the situation

281
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,320
 Anyone within anywhere in the autism spectrum disorder is gifted

282
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,800
 They are the beauty of the world. They are true empaths now

283
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:11,240
 That's just that is just flat out false

284
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,960
 It's a spectrum for a reason because on the one reason you have

285
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,360
 You have a person who is again

286
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,520
 Hyper focused and working tends to be a withdrawn has a hard time communicating with others

287
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:31,080
 But successful in their given field and then you have

288
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:37,480
 The person who can cannot take care of themselves at all and unless you prepare their food in the exact right way

289
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,880
 They will not eat

290
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,080
 That's the spectrum

291
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:50,200
 You can't lump them both in and say they're both the greatest balance of the universe that

292
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:57,320
 There's some sort of connected to the plant life and the and the atoms that grow within the kidneys of the

293
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,080
 Comquat

294
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,640
 It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous. If you want to pull. I mean again, this is

295
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,560
 She's basically making up her own version of the world

296
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,120
 Which I guess is fine

297
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:17,720
 But the promises can be destructive because when you have the kid who has to wear a helmet because he's constantly punching himself in the face

298
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,120
 And biting anyone who comes near him. This woman walks up and goes oh

299
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:28,360
 Parents you need to learn how this child is the next stage in human evolution. You're just neurotypical

300
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,040
 You don't understand you're treating this child wrong now the child has some

301
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,280
 Problems that need to be addressed to keep him and other people safe

302
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:41,800
 I can understand someone saying that you know, maybe somewhere in the spectrum. They have this

303
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:47,400
 this sense to then client to then make the leap of logic to say that

304
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:52,440
 They are then they're basically where we are

305
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,560
 The we're basically the homo sapiens and they're the homo superiors to

306
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:03,400
 Take the terminology from the x-men comic books because you think oh jason years are blowing up

307
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:08,520
 She's just you know, she's going on about this. We have any this is how she ends it now. Okay

308
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,640
 Go a couple hundred years into the future

309
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:18,760
 Man is having to rebuild from scratch because everything was destroyed by the so-called normal people

310
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:26,760
 Wouldn't it be interesting if those future people are able to look back on history and see that present day a sders

311
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:32,200
 special gifts to society who were labeled by away it filed away and dismissed

312
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,600
 Or actually the leaders who could have saved planet

313
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:44,600
 Saved people and the planet if only the ego-ridden normals of the 21st century pause to consider the possibility

314
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,200
 So again now

315
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:55,560
 Anyone who doesn't have autism is just a horrible person and the people with autism are like god's gift their nature's gift

316
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,840
 I mean this this is bordering on

317
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,880
 reverse eugenics

318
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,640
 I I she's all I mean if the normal people

319
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,120
 The the everything was destroyed by the so-called normal people

320
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,000
 Oh when you hear me like doing weird inflections with this article

321
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,160
 You'd be surprised how often she put stuff in all caps and italicized a lot of stuff. I'm not just being a dick

322
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,080
 I am generally a dick when it comes to stuff like this

323
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,800
 Now again

324
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,960
 You know I got you guys know I have trouble when these conspiracy theorists acts for money

325
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,160
 That's what bugged me about that lord of the rings guy too. I never got to that

326
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:39,000
 That guy is a whole series that you have to pay for to watch him go on and on about how lord of the rings is based on

327
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,320
 True life and people pay for it. He's making good money. I saw a bit of a video and he's dressed. Well, he obviously can buy a nice suit

328
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,480
 This is just as dangerous though because again what you're telling

329
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:55,960
 People and really you're telling parents of children who have autism and people with you can I can someone has autism

330
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,960
 I'm not going to say hey, dude. You're broken

331
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:03,640
 Because there are with there is there is a spectrum and some people are far more successful than me

332
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:10,200
 And some people have a hard time, you know functioning within a family unit let alone society

333
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:16,680
 But for her to just say no, they're all better than everyone else that is such

334
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,400
 a

335
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,560
 Like right there I can say listen there's a spectrum and there's these group people these group people

336
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:30,920
 There's everyone in the middle with her it's all normal people are destroying the planet and everyone with autism are our only hope

337
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:37,720
 That is well, you know now the thing about the author probably has autism that hadn't dawned on me, but

338
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,720
 That being set aside that's that's a very hateful ideology

339
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:47,000
 That's a very hateful ideology and when you're preaching hate like this really, how are you any different?

340
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,040
 Than someone carrying a tiki torch from through charlotte's fill. That's what this is

341
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:58,120
 That's what this is you're claiming that everyone who doesn't have autism is going to destroy the planet

342
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,520
 And people with autism are the saviors now. We're going to go back to that original article

343
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,400
 Because I think this sums it up perfectly

344
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,000
 In the original article that I was talking about and discover magazine

345
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,720
 It said I'm going to quote this here because this is again

346
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:18,680
 We'll go through the the different ways these are these articles are constructed. Here's the quote from discover magazine

347
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:24,040
 And the going on the assumption that autism is an evolutionary trait here we go

348
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:29,320
 Even if the assumptions are correct her evolutionary hypothesis doesn't work

349
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:36,200
 Mutations don't have a purpose natural selection works on individuals and not the whole species

350
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:42,360
 The rise in autism if it's even real has happened in just the last 20 years

351
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,040
 Unlike the evolutionary leaps the anthropologist's sights

352
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:51,800
 Autism involves many genes and would take even more generations to spread if it was advantageous

353
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,200
 And most of all there's the sex

354
00:25:54,360 --> 00:26:01,720
 It's only an adaptation if it makes you have more kids. So a literal human connection is essential

355
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:08,200
 And that it's it's one of the key components of autism you withdraw from other people

356
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:13,880
 So short answer no, it's not a step in human evolution

357
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,160
 If anything they will have they're less likely to have kids

358
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:23,720
 What is causing the rise in autism? We don't know that I've heard theories that it's not and that's without our

359
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:30,200
 Kind of says if it's even real autism hasn't increased. It's just what we define as autism has increased

360
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:36,760
 There's the idea that it is a cultural social thing with the way children are brought up that's environmental toxins

361
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:43,080
 Then you have ideas like the vaccines and then you know you could have it that it's like a genetic quirk

362
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,520
 In the system it could be a combination of two or more of those

363
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,960
 so

364
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,880
 I think I think we can kind of close the I'll close the case on that conspiracy

365
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,400
 I do not think that autism is the next step in human evolution

366
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:03,080
 I don't think it's weird to think that there is going to be a new a new step in human evolution

367
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:08,120
 But I again, I think it'll be so small the changes are going to be so small. We won't even see it

368
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:12,840
 So I think we're going to end this episode today. I got I'm going to put all those article links below

369
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:18,760
