00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,060
 Today, we take a look at three American cities.

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,580
 One is known as the most haunted town in America.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,780
 The other one is known to have the 8th gateway to hell.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:19,800
 And the third one has been plagued with legends of monstrous beasts running through the forest.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,380
 Are any of these stories true?

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,980
 We'll find out today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:31,660
 [Music]

8
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,060
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,180
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:35,980
 I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,420
 I hope you're having a great day too.

12
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,820
 We have a lot to cover today because we're doing three stories on three different towns.

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,100
 So I want to jump right into it.

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,620
 Now this is related to an episode I did recently.

15
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,900
 Ariana Grande and the 7 gateways to hell.

16
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,380
 Now when I released the episode, I had a lot of fun recording that episode.

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:57,340
 I have a lot of fun recording all of them, but that one was particularly entertaining to me.

18
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:03,340
 When I posted it up on YouTube, I had a YouTube commenter named Rising Vapor hit me up and says,

19
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:10,540
 "Hey, there's actually, I know of a couple other towns that are similar to the town of Stoll, Kansas."

20
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,980
 And so he sent me some resources.

21
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:16,780
 He basically said, "Here's a couple of information for town enough for me to track them down."

22
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,420
 And so we are going to take a tour of these towns in America

23
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,980
 that may or may not be haunted.

24
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,180
 We will discuss that as we get into it now.

25
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,380
 Normally we take the carpenter copter, but I figure we're in America.

26
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,380
 There's no point to have to get in.

27
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,180
 Oh, and the helicopter is a Boeing 347.

28
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:35,820
 I looked it up.

29
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,340
 That's a helicopter with the wings.

30
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,660
 So if you're ever curious of what the carpenter copter looks like,

31
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,500
 it is a Boeing 347.

32
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,220
 All two of you out there who are like, "What's it look like?"

33
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,180
 And I'm one of them.

34
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,140
 It's a Boeing 347.

35
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,260
 But anyways, carpenter copter, we're going to just leave grounded for today.

36
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,860
 And I know a lot of people are disappointed.

37
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,620
 Now we have the carpenter copter for our air travel international.

38
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,540
 Can helicopters fly over oceans?

39
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,580
 I guess we should have checked that out.

40
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,460
 So we have the carpenter copter for international travel.

41
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:09,580
 We have the rabbit rowboat that if we're going from to islands or again over oceans.

42
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,700
 And I was like, "I need a car.

43
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,220
 I need a car."

44
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,940
 And I was, I came up with a couple of different ones.

45
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,140
 So I needed a land vehicle to, you know, we're just driving around town.

46
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,740
 So that is why I want all of you to hop on board the Jason Jalopy.

47
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:26,460
 I want you to picture it looking like a steam powered old timey car,

48
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,060
 all a chitty-chitty bing-bing, but probably less cool.

49
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,340
 So let's all hop into the Jason Jalopy and makes all sorts of weird noises.

50
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,180
 It sounds like it's going to die at any moment.

51
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,700
 And it might, but it's still a reliable vehicle.

52
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:45,500
 Now Rising Vapor has sent us on this quest to check out these three towns.

53
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:52,780
 So, so the first place we're taking the Jason Jalopy to is a little town called Dudley Town.

54
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:58,300
 Now Dudley Town is in the state of Connecticut, the beautiful state of Connecticut, I'm assuming.

55
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,100
 I've never been there.

56
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:05,100
 I just imagine there's like leaves and people named William and Buffy and Stella and

57
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,380
 Stewart.

58
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:11,580
 They're drinking tea and they see a car of like hooligans show up and they're like,

59
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,380
 "Show us your ghosts.

60
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,100
 Show us your ghosts."

61
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,100
 And they're like, "Oh my, oh my, I don't know what to do."

62
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,500
 Call the authorities, Martha.

63
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,020
 And then the authorities come out and they like, "What are you looking for?"

64
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,140
 And they're like, "I'm looking for ghosts."

65
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,940
 Now Dudley Town was called, okay, so let me back up.

66
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,380
 Dudley Town brief overview.

67
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,980
 It was founded in the 1700s.

68
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,300
 By the 1800s, it was abandoned.

69
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,900
 The forest grew up around it.

70
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,020
 It used to be farmland and it just wasn't great farmland.

71
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,180
 So people move away that that tends to happen.

72
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,940
 In the 1920s, this dude writes a book called The History of Cornwall.

73
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:46,620
 And he says, "You know, Dudley Town has had a string of bad luck.

74
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,620
 This guy went insane and this guy killed his family and a bunch of Indians came in

75
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,700
 and killed these kids and a bunch of people disappeared."

76
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,420
 The end, like it was just like an anecdote in a book.

77
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,020
 And he didn't say anything supernatural was going on.

78
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,940
 He just said, "This is a string of bad luck."

79
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,460
 Rumors started to swirl.

80
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:08,620
 One of the rumors was that Dudley Town was founded by a guy who betrayed King Henry VII or whatever.

81
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,660
 And the curse was brought over because English kings are known for putting curses on people.

82
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,340
 But that was a rumor that started.

83
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:20,460
 The rumor started that just the land was cursed and then it became that the land was haunted.

84
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,140
 The area itself was haunted.

85
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,020
 Dan Akroyd, a literal ghostbuster.

86
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,100
 And he's actually really big into paranormal research.

87
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,180
 But Dan Akroyd's an actual ghostbuster.

88
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,660
 He said, "Dudley Town is the most haunted place on earth."

89
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,060
 Quite the boast.

90
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,180
 I think even in the intro I said the most haunted place in America.

91
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,860
 Dan Akroyd, I was selling it short.

92
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,820
 Dan Akroyd said it was the most haunted place on earth.

93
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,180
 Now, before the history of Cornwall was written,

94
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,660
 long before Dan Akroyd was talking about being the most haunted place on earth,

95
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,980
 after the town of Dudley Town was abandoned,

96
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,700
 the town was bought by basically the people who still lived there.

97
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:04,700
 And they was bought in the name of this group that is one of the most ominously named groups

98
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:09,500
 that I can think of outside of Cobra or Umbrella Corporation.

99
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,780
 Actually, those names aren't as scary as this one.

100
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,900
 The Dark Entry Forest Association.

101
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,780
 What?

102
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:21,900
 Now, their name comes from a forest near Dudley Town.

103
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,780
 It's part of it called the Dark Entry Forest.

104
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,500
 Because apparently the way that the mountains are situated,

105
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,460
 the forest is always dark because of the shade or something.

106
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,900
 Maybe they're lit up during the noon,

107
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,660
 but I mean for the most part they're in the dark.

108
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,780
 Why don't you just call yourself the DEFA, the DEFA?

109
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,060
 Why the Dark Entry Forest Association?

110
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,820
 They bought this land up in the 1920s, so the whole area is private land.

111
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,620
 You can't visit it, you can't take your ghost crew there,

112
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,220
 you can't traipse through with your EMF or your spirit box or none of that stuff.

113
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,940
 They shut it down to the point that if you're driving down the road,

114
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,060
 people have reported this,

115
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,340
 that if they're driving down the road and they stop or they slow down, cops show up.

116
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:02,060
 People in the area are constantly watching for ghost hunters or teenagers or whatever

117
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,140
 and calling up the Connecticut State Police.

118
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:10,860
 Like they have nothing better to do than patrol this area, catching the ghost crew or whatever.

119
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,580
 Dark Entry Forest Association guards this area so zealously

120
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,260
 that to me that actually raises more questions.

121
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,500
 If I had just seen this place and it was like,

122
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,740
 "Oh, this place Connecticut had a string of bad luck."

123
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,500
 Dan Alcord said it was the most haunted place on earth.

124
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,940
 I'd be like, "Oh, that's kind of interesting."

125
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:31,660
 But the fact that there's a group that's actively like suppressing people

126
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,540
 from investigating it, it just seems odd.

127
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,580
 Now, there was a report that there was a Christian based movie production company

128
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,020
 that wanted to do a movie on Dudley Town.

129
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,020
 And for whatever reason, it sounds so bizarre,

130
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,700
 but the director, the producers, got six screenwriters,

131
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,180
 put them in a house in Dudley Town and they're like,

132
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,460
 "Write a script."

133
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,100
 What?

134
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,580
 But it sounds like a mix-up of a bad reality show and a horror movie,

135
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,100
 but anyways, the six writers were sitting in there trying to write on the script.

136
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,260
 A bunch of behind the scenes stuff happened with the movie producers arguing and things like that.

137
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:09,420
 One of the things, according to this article, was that the Dark Entry Force Association

138
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,860
 threatened to sue the filmmakers for defamation

139
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,540
 if they made this horror movie based on their town.

140
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,700
 That is aggressive debunking.

141
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:23,180
 They've come out, I mean, if you go and you look up Dark Entry Forest or Dudley Town,

142
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,780
 most of the first links are, "Our town is in haunted, our town is in haunted,

143
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,780
 our town is in haunted, please stay away."

144
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,540
 And one of the things said, "How would you feel if you were sitting in your house

145
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:36,220
 and you saw a bunch of teenagers walk outside throwing beer cans and setting fires?"

146
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,820
 Well, I wouldn't feel too good, but if I knew they were there,

147
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,540
 because they thought it was the most haunted place on earth,

148
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,340
 I wouldn't mind because I would charge them five bucks.

149
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,500
 I would charge, I would open it up and say,

150
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,060
 "Five bucks, ten bucks, I mean, it's the most haunted place on earth."

151
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,100
 And again, we talked about this with the Ariana Grande thing.

152
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,620
 Stole Kansas is like, "Do not come here, there's no ghosts."

153
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,100
 Roswell says, "Please come here, there's aliens."

154
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,940
 And Roswell is a booming economy, tourist economy,

155
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,820
 and Stole Kansas is just this little town in the middle of nowhere.

156
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,380
 Now, I'm going to stereotype Connecticutans,

157
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:13,660
 people who live in Connecticut, Connecticutis, I'm going to stereotype Connecticutis,

158
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,820
 and I'm going to assume they're all just wealthy, so they don't care.

159
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,220
 They don't need the extra money, and they don't need the money.

160
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,740
 Again, they're just sipping drink and tea.

161
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,140
 Teenagers are kind of like Archie and Jughead

162
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,020
 are like running around in the backyard, and they're like, "Ugh."

163
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:31,100
 But the pushback is what makes the story suspicious.

164
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,380
 The pushback actually is what makes the story interesting,

165
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,180
 because there's hundreds of supposed cursed towns

166
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,860
 and ghost towns and stuff like that across America and over the globe.

167
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,060
 But the fact that you have a group that's so aggressively trying to debunk it

168
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:49,420
 actually makes me more suspicious that something actually happened there

169
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,340
 or is happening here today.

170
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:51,820
 Who knows?

171
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,220
 I mean, it could just be that they got tired of teenagers

172
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,220
 like knocking over their crumpets and like driving motorcycles over their doilies and stuff like that.

173
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,740
 That's the most logical answer.

174
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:07,900
 But again, sometimes it's not the story itself can be fairly bland.

175
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:12,380
 It's the little meta details behind the story that make it more suspicious.

176
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,980
 So, we'll rate these.

177
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,940
 On a scale of 1 to 10, how much would I want to visit Dudley Town?

178
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,500
 I don't know.

179
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,180
 It sounds kind of pompous.

180
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,980
 It doesn't sound like there's a lot of meat to the story.

181
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,540
 On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd say probably 4.

182
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,940
 I wouldn't even waste my gas drive into Dudley Town.

183
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,340
 So Dudley Town, a bit of a wash.

184
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,300
 I look over at Rising Vapor who's in the Jason Jalopy next to me

185
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,980
 and I'm like, "Dude, didn't she tell me to go to this town?"

186
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,140
 And he's like, "Well, I mean, I heard of it.

187
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,980
 I didn't technically tell you to drive to here in this really slow car."

188
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:46,460
 And I'm like, "Okay, now we are going very slowly to Masa..."

189
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,500
 I can't say the...

190
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,260
 I can't pronounce the state's name.

191
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,540
 I don't think I can at least.

192
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,300
 We're going to Massachusetts.

193
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,300
 So, Massachusetts is a couple states over, I think.

194
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,580
 It's still the East Coast.

195
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:02,460
 And we're going to a place called Leichester.

196
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,500
 Or Leichester.

197
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,020
 I think it's Leichester.

198
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:05,900
 There's no H.

199
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,540
 So, we're going to Leichester and we're going to visit a place called

200
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,860
 the Friends Cemetery.

201
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,140
 Or, also known as the Quaker Cemetery,

202
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,500
 which I wrote in my notes is Quarker Cemetery.

203
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,180
 Just to let you know the level of detail and precision I have with my notes.

204
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,580
 So, the Quaker Cemetery.

205
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:31,580
 Or, it's most commonly known as the Spider Gates Cemetery,

206
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,620
 a.k.a. the Eighth Gateway to Hell.

207
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,700
 Not one of the official Seven Gateways to Hell.

208
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,500
 No.

209
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,180
 This is the Eighth Gateway to Hell.

210
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,300
 This is the King Kong of Gateways to Hell.

211
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,460
 It was founded in 1740.

212
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,300
 That's my first note I have written down.

213
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,020
 The second note that I've written down.

214
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,860
 This website is fucking nuts.

215
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,660
 So, that should let you know where we're going.

216
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:58,940
 I found General Information Website on the history of Spider Gates Place.

217
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:03,580
 The next website I found seemed to be where most people got their information

218
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,980
 about the Spider Gates Cemetery.

219
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,420
 I'm going to read you some detail.

220
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:13,980
 So, this website is proposing that these things are true about the Spider Gates Cemetery.

221
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,940
 Number one.

222
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,260
 Spider Gates Cemetery is one of the most visited spots in the state.

223
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:22,300
 Let me tell you a little bit about the state of Massachusetts.

224
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,100
 Benjamin Franklin's birthplace.

225
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,500
 Martha's Vineyard.

226
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,660
 The Battle of Lexington.

227
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,540
 The place where the Revolutionary War started.

228
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,100
 The shot heard around the world, also in Massachusetts.

229
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,780
 Cape Cod.

230
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,140
 Any of these places ring a bell?

231
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,780
 But this website proports that Spider Gates Cemetery

232
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,860
 is one of the most visited places in the state.

233
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:52,220
 The Quakers apparently believed that this cemetery, their cemetery, was sacred.

234
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,580
 And it is where they did their incantations.

235
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:55,820
 What?

236
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,180
 I don't...

237
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,460
 Okay, I'm not too far up on my Quaker information,

238
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,740
 but this website makes them out to be borderline

239
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,540
 Satan worshipers.

240
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:10,140
 And at one point, actually straight out accuses them of building an altar to worship Satan.

241
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:14,620
 Now, like I said, my information on Quakers is fairly limited,

242
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,900
 but they're...

243
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:20,860
 From what I understand, they are a breakaway denomination from Christianity.

244
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,740
 They're not like crazy hard workers like the Amish,

245
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,700
 but they're not like super lazy like every other Christian on the planet.

246
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,500
 They're like in between.

247
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:35,260
 But I don't think I would ever classify the Quaker Oats Guy in the box

248
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,740
 where I get my oatmeal as a Satan worshiper.

249
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,340
 But anyways, this website does.

250
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,700
 Story goes, in 1984, a young boy hung himself in the cemetery.

251
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,180
 The family of the boy goes, "Oh, that sucks."

252
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,620
 So we're going to give you gates for your cemetery.

253
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:50,940
 What?

254
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,260
 I mean...

255
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:56,060
 They say we're going to give you gates for your cemetery,

256
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,060
 and they're going to look like spider webs.

257
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,500
 Because the boy was Greek, and we are Greek as well,

258
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,820
 and the spider webs represent the story of a Rakhne who weaved webs.

259
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:11,100
 Okay, so anyways, they have these gates that if you squint really hard,

260
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,500
 they may look like spider webs.

261
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,380
 Other accounts say they actually are supposed to look like sunbeams.

262
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,580
 They kind of look like boobs with wrinkles, to me.

263
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,580
 But anyways, Spider Gate Cemetery.

264
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,380
 Apparently, if you go through the gates at midnight,

265
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,300
 the devil appears and takes your soul,

266
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,500
 that would be a very easy thing to test.

267
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,300
 Just do it.

268
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,300
 Just walk through the gates at midnight and see what happens.

269
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,500
 There's also a...

270
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,460
 There's a bunch of dead grass where a house used to be,

271
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,340
 which is where the Saint and Worshiping Quakers went.

272
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,340
 But the house is gone, but the grass...

273
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,620
 The grass is still dead.

274
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,380
 Can you...

275
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,180
 Can you Laffyne podcast host explain that?

276
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,300
 Well, I mean, I don't...

277
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,420
 Not a soil expert,

278
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,220
 but I think if you build any stone structure on something

279
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,900
 and leave it there for a while,

280
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,460
 grass might have a hard time growing back there.

281
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,900
 There is a grave for a dude, real name...

282
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,980
 Earl Marmaduke.

283
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,420
 Even back in the day, that fool got picked on at school.

284
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,340
 Earl Marmaduke is grave.

285
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,740
 If you walk around it 10 times at midnight

286
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,620
 and say "Marmaduke, talk to me,"

287
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,700
 then put your head on his grave.

288
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,900
 He talks to you or moans or something.

289
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,540
 He does...

290
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,820
 He makes some sort of noise.

291
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,060
 There's two things...

292
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,700
 There's two things that I have a problem with that.

293
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,460
 One, if it's a ghost,

294
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,100
 like I can walk into my bathroom and see like the ghost

295
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,460
 of like an old man hiding underneath my

296
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,260
 kitchen cabinet.

297
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,940
 I don't know why I have a kitchen cabinet in my bathroom,

298
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,980
 but you understand, like...

299
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,700
 Ghosts are things that you walk through the force,

300
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:39,340
 you see a ghost,

301
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,060
 you get in your car,

302
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:40,940
 you look in the rear of your mirror,

303
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,380
 there's a ghost in your back seat,

304
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,620
 you're sleeping and you see your bedsheets start to rise

305
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,700
 and there's a ghost crawling through your bed, all that stuff.

306
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,260
 Why is it that some ghosts can just appear anywhere,

307
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,260
 but other ghosts need these ridiculous

308
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,340
 incantations and rituals to appear?

309
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,340
 It's never explained,

310
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:55,900
 and this comes...

311
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,180
 I see this stuff a lot.

312
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:57,740
 But they're like,

313
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,940
 if you do this ritual,

314
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,780
 if you hold up three thumbs,

315
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,300
 you have to borrow one from somebody else,

316
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,580
 light two matches,

317
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:07,260
 and then blow them out all at the same time at 444 a.m.,

318
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,060
 a ghost appears,

319
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,780
 but then I could literally just like walk outside

320
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,220
 and see like a ghost jogger,

321
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,660
 like it doesn't make sense.

322
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,460
 I never get the incantation stuff.

323
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,260
 My second thing,

324
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,540
 my second problem with it,

325
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,140
 as you walk around 10 times in midnight,

326
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,500
 say Marma, do talk to me,

327
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,180
 and you put your head on the grave,

328
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,700
 and he says something to you.

329
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,540
 Who, who, who did that?

330
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,060
 Who was the first person to do that?

331
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,860
 Did someone walk around eight times and go,

332
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,220
 I give up, nothing's happening?

333
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,740
 And then another guy walked around nine times,

334
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,180
 and he's like, oh man, I,

335
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:35,820
 this doesn't work.

336
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,100
 And then a guy walked around 10 times,

337
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,300
 but it was three in the afternoon,

338
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:38,780
 and he's like,

339
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,180
 I mean, like,

340
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,500
 how did you get to that evolution of this stupid,

341
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,900
 this stupid ritual,

342
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,340
 and you can actually go and see pictures of Earl Marmaduke's tomb?

343
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,820
 There's a bunch of grass worn out

344
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,260
 because people are walking around it.

345
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:57,500
 Does that mean that Quakers were also satanically murdering people on that grave?

346
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,660
 Like, you can't have it both ways.

347
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,180
 You can't show me a picture of dead grass

348
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,140
 and go saying worshiping,

349
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,580
 and then show me another picture of dead grass

350
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,660
 and go, I just, people are walking around a lot.

351
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,180
 You can't have it both ways.

352
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:11,100
 And then this website ends with this quote.

353
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,260
 No joke, this is the last phrase on this page for

354
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,820
 Spider, Spider Gate Cemetery.

355
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,300
 I love this,

356
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,340
 I'm gonna read this whole quote without trying to laugh.

357
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,740
 The last legend surrounding the cemetery

358
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,220
 speaks of a hidden cave

359
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,540
 where the body of a young girl was found.

360
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,020
 You're like Jason, that's not funny, but it gets funny, okay.

361
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:35,340
 Most attempts to find this cave end in disappointment

362
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,740
 as there really are no caves,

363
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,060
 at least not once big enough to hide a body, how does he?

364
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:44,940
 Someone's like, oh no, I know my body hiding caves and that.

365
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,540
 Back to the quote.

366
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,900
 Furthermore, there is no proof that a girl was ever found.

367
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,900
 However, about a mile from the cemetery is a small cave,

368
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,260
 once used as a root cellar,

369
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,220
 where a six-year-old boy was beaten and dumped into the river.

370
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:02,060
 This occurred in the early 1980s.

371
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,660
 Spider Gate Cemetery is a good day trip to explore a few legends

372
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,700
 and get close with some nature and local spirits.

373
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,940
 What? I don't want to go there.

374
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,900
 You just told me that a little kid got beaten and dumped in the river

375
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,620
 in the 1980s, that's in my lifetime.

376
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,420
 I was watching Transformers,

377
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,660
 this kid's getting his brains beaten,

378
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,100
 and then the next sentence you told me to go there for a fun trip.

379
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,420
 They don't even say if this guy ever got caught.

380
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,220
 They should say the kid was beaten and dumped in the river,

381
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,980
 and it happened if this guy's still alive.

382
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,980
 Not the boy, but I mean the killer.

383
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,220
 I don't want to go there.

384
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,460
 But the funny thing is, is that other people have.

385
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,100
 So there's another website where a guy's like,

386
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,860
 hey, I'm doing a day trip to Spider Gate Cemetery.

387
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,500
 And it's so funny because this guy, he's really,

388
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,980
 he's like me, he seems, he's really into the stuff,

389
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,900
 but he got his information from a book called like,

390
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,900
 Weird Massachusetts.

391
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,820
 And I am pretty sure the website that I was reading

392
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,420
 got their info from that book,

393
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,420
 because what he was talking about on his journey

394
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,500
 is totally matches the book.

395
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,980
 He's like, yeah, I went to where the gates were

396
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,500
 and I looked for the hanging tree,

397
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,700
 but I didn't really see it.

398
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,820
 They said the tree that the boy was hung from was like an elm,

399
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,060
 but I only saw like a sycamore.

400
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,940
 He goes, I saw the place with the dead, dead grass.

401
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,380
 I saw the Marmaduke, there's a picture of him by the Earl of Mar-

402
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,740
 not Earl, there's a picture of him standing by Earl Marmaduke's grave.

403
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,700
 And so I think it matched up, he was reading the same story.

404
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,020
 The funniest thing is, is his story starts off being like,

405
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,060
 I couldn't find the place.

406
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,140
 It's super hard to find.

407
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,460
 He goes, I think I passed it a couple of times,

408
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,980
 I had a really hard time finding it.

409
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,940
 But apparently this is one of the most visited places

410
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,300
 in the state of Massachusetts.

411
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,260
 This graveyard gets a zero stars.

412
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,780
 I would not go to this graveyard if you paid me to.

413
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,980
 What a crock.

414
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,140
 What a, what a waste.

415
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,020
 I was like reading this, what was in a waste because it was highly entertaining,

416
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:01,660
 but to think that people think that this story has any validity whatsoever,

417
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,260
 it is almost 100% made up.

418
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:07,900
 I'm hoping the boy who got his head caved in is also made up.

419
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,060
 But none of it's, none of it's true.

420
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:14,060
 Other than the fact that there's a place called Spider Gate Cemetery.

421
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:19,660
 So this place gets a big fat goose egg on a one to 10 scale.

422
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:23,740
 It is one of the most ridiculous fake hauntings I've ever covered on this show.

423
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,540
 And the people who wrote that description,

424
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:31,180
 they either have to start writing fiction or they should be ashamed of themselves

425
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:37,900
 because there is no reason why people should be wasting gas or time or brain cells

426
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,860
 investigating Spider Gate Cemetery.

427
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,980
 Where we're going to now, we're staying in Massachusetts.

428
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,980
 So if you're tired of me mispronouncing that,

429
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,180
 which again, I think I might actually be pronouncing that right.

430
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,060
 There's a lot of T's in it, but I don't, I think they're all silent.

431
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:57,020
 So anyways, now we're going to a place called Dogtown.

432
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:01,580
 Dogtown, Massachusetts was founded in 1693.

433
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,020
 Lot of weird coincidences, lot of weird events.

434
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:09,100
 The early settlers in the area reported that there was a,

435
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,660
 there was a tribe of Indians called the Agawam Indians.

436
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,700
 And when the early settlers got there,

437
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,220
 they noticed there was a lot of wolf activity in the area.

438
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:24,860
 And the story that they heard from the natives was that the Agawam Indians ancestors,

439
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:30,060
 they have the ability to gain their heads would turn into the heads of dogs.

440
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,460
 You're like, okay, you know, shamanistic and stuff like that.

441
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,980
 But the Indians also said there is a herb in this area that anyone can take,

442
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,860
 turn you into a dog, shape shift into a dog.

443
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,380
 You didn't have to have any sort of high level ritual training or anything like that.

444
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,620
 You could turn into a dog if you could find this herb.

445
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,700
 Early settlers probably like whatever did.

446
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,140
 See you next Thanksgiving.

447
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:54,540
 The reason why the town's called Dogtown has a couple of different origins.

448
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:58,540
 One is that there was a bunch of dogs in the area, like wolves in the area.

449
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,740
 Another possibility, which this was another fact.

450
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,260
 So they just, these are all facts.

451
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,060
 They just don't know which one contributed to the name of Dogtown.

452
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,220
 Was during the American Revolution.

453
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,940
 So the town was founded in 1693.

454
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:15,580
 It was actually very well situated because it was close to

455
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,020
 water.

456
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,060
 It was close to the water.

457
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,300
 So you could do fishing and stuff like that.

458
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,540
 But it was protected, it had natural barriers to protect it from both pirates,

459
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:28,060
 which was a big issue back then, and native raiding groups.

460
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:33,340
 So they kind of had protection from both, you know, sea adversaries and land adversaries.

461
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:37,820
 It wasn't the best for farming, but they were able to do other things there.

462
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,380
 So it was a bustling town to a certain point.

463
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,500
 It was not like a Boston level town, but they were, it had a population.

464
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,860
 During the American Revolution, when all the men left to fight the British,

465
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:52,940
 women started taking dogs on in disproportionate amounts.

466
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:56,300
 So it got to the point where pretty much every woman had a pet dog.

467
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:02,220
 Now that sounds creepy too, and it kind of makes you think like this area has some sort of like canine

468
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,500
 presence.

469
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:09,340
 But it was almost like all the women in town to have company, don't be dirty,

470
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:13,020
 you're going to be anyways, but to have company, they got dogs.

471
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,300
 But what happened was American Revolution, spoiler alert, America won,

472
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,620
 and the town was still there.

473
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:22,300
 But during the war of 1812, when those dastardly British showed back up,

474
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,340
 I think it was against the British.

475
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,460
 I might have been the French, I'm not for sure, but the war of 1812,

476
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:31,580
 that particular town, Dogtown, was now susceptible to naval bombardment.

477
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,620
 And people were like, you know, we can go to a place that has, you know,

478
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,820
 better economic factors, better farmland and stuff like that.

479
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:42,780
 And as the townspeople left, you basically had three groups of people that stayed in

480
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,500
 the town.

481
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:49,020
 You had widows, you had independent women, which back then was basically codeword for

482
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:54,620
 witch, and vagrants moved into towns because they had all these houses and no one living in them.

483
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,900
 Got a lot of accusations of witchcraft in the area at this time.

484
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:03,100
 Now, and this is past, we're in the war of 1812, so this is past the Salem witch trials.

485
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:10,700
 This isn't during witch mania, but this town had such a unique creepy vibe that it got the

486
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,820
 reputation of housing multiple witches.

487
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:19,340
 One of them was known as Tammy Younger, and her nickname was Queen of the Witches,

488
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,260
 and she would sit on on her patio.

489
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:25,020
 And when people had to travel by her house to get, you know, they're going from point

490
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:30,300
 A to point B in Dogtown's in the middle, as they drove by her, she would curse their oxen,

491
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,340
 and the oxen would stop and she'd be like, give me some potatoes.

492
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,020
 And then she would let them on through.

493
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:40,140
 Now, that obviously could just be legend, but the person apparently did exist.

494
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,300
 And people would give her food.

495
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:46,860
 Now, whether or not she had the magical power to stop Beast of Burden, I'm not for sure.

496
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,660
 I mean, obviously, logically, probably not.

497
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,300
 But for whatever reason, people were stopping and giving her food.

498
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,500
 And maybe she's a prostitute.

499
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:59,660
 I don't know how to think about it, but there were stories of in the woods, like booming sounds,

500
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,820
 you'd see like flickers of light in the forest.

501
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:05,260
 Sometimes figures would just be standing there by the tree line.

502
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,500
 It was not a fun place to be.

503
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,340
 Imagine like Blair Witch USA.

504
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,740
 It was not a cool place to be.

505
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,860
 A practical problem.

506
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:16,540
 So whether or not Tammy Younger was actually a practicing witch,

507
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,820
 or she may have been practicing witch, but whether or not she actually had any sort of powers,

508
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:23,580
 that's up to debate, whether you're a skeptic or a believer or things like that.

509
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,940
 And I always kind of fall in the middle.

510
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:31,820
 What's not mystical, what's not, you know, like, ooh, might be spooky is what is spooky,

511
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:36,460
 but not paranormal is the third theory of how Dogtown got its name.

512
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:40,380
 Now, some people believe that the town didn't get the official name of Dogtown,

513
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:45,340
 or it didn't really get known as Dogtown until far later in its life cycle.

514
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:50,060
 Because after the American Revolution, after where everyone got their dogs,

515
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:55,420
 after 18, War of 1812, where people were leaving, people just left their dogs there.

516
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,740
 And the dogs went feral.

517
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:01,980
 You just had wild packs of dogs roaming the town attacking people.

518
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,100
 And they think that that's the reason how it really got the name of Dogtown,

519
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,060
 is that people from out of town would be like, I'm not going there.

520
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,580
 There's a bunch of dogs running around.

521
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:15,820
 And, and if we're lucky, they won't eat our oxen while Tammy Younger has them frozen in fear.

522
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:19,260
 In 1845, the last building was raised.

523
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,340
 Like, they're like, get rid of the town, it's gone.

524
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:26,940
 And to make things even creepier, this town, apparently dog-headed Indians are running around it.

525
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,740
 People have an incredible fascination with dogs.

526
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,780
 There's a witch, there's a bunch of dogs, crazy dogs running around.

527
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:37,900
 You knock down all the buildings and a spooky forest appears instead.

528
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,180
 Not just flatland.

529
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,900
 So you have all these trees, the forestry, not the next day,

530
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:46,780
 but I mean, you know, the forestry appears and Dogtown, when they tore all the buildings down,

531
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,820
 they left the basements.

532
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,900
 Because what are you going to do, the cellars and stuff like that?

533
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:55,580
 So you can literally be walking through this forest and fall into a spooky basement from the 1600s.

534
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,940
 And no one will ever know you're there.

535
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,940
 And it's probably full of feral dogs.

536
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,340
 A lot of the cellars now have been marked with rocks.

537
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,900
 But not all of them.

538
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:08,860
 There's still quite a chance as you're walking through this spooky forest that you're going to fall into a cellar.

539
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,420
 A spooky, spooky cellar.

540
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,860
 So now we're in the present day.

541
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,100
 Well, not the present day, we're in 1984.

542
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,780
 Present for me when I was a kid.

543
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:22,780
 Now, I, another boy just got his brains bashed out in Spiderwebs, Spider Gates, sorry.

544
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,860
 I've already forgotten what that place is called.

545
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,220
 This is 1984.

546
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,700
 Return of the Jedi just came out a year earlier.

547
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,700
 Transformers, I think, came out this year.

548
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,740
 I was quite chubby.

549
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:40,780
 While I was in California watching Transformers, what was going on in this abandoned city/spooky forest of Dogtown?

550
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,780
 1984, March 17th.

551
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,940
 There was a report of a giant animal.

552
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,820
 I don't know why I made that noise.

553
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,540
 I guess I should have went.

554
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,540
 Anyway, whatever.

555
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,980
 It sounded like a circus song.

556
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,180
 There's a giant monster.

557
00:26:55,180 --> 00:27:00,380
 There's a giant animal that's roaming the cliffs near Dogtown on March 17th.

558
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:07,580
 March 24th, a deer, it's carcass, is found ripped in half, not eaten, but torn in half.

559
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:16,220
 That night, two people in the area say that they saw a giant dog monster roaming through the forest.

560
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:21,340
 So those are all reports that they had seen this monster moving through the forest.

561
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:25,900
 Actual news event, actual provable news event on June 24th of that same year.

562
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,780
 So just what is that?

563
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,740
 March, April, May, June, at five months later, four months later.

564
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:35,900
 Ann Natty was an avid jogger and she loved the Dogtown area.

565
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,660
 She just thought it was a beautiful forest.

566
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,540
 And there's a man out there named Peter Hodgkins.

567
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:45,820
 Ann, he ended up telling the police so you can tell where this story is going.

568
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,660
 I didn't plan it.

569
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,860
 I didn't really think about it.

570
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:54,780
 I just saw her and I had an overwhelming desire to murder her.

571
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:58,620
 So in these dark forests full of so many legends,

572
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:04,460
 Peter Hodgkins comes up behind her with a rock, smashes her head and just completely

573
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,460
 out of the blue.

574
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:10,940
 He just saw her and knew that he needed to kill her.

575
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:15,100
 Is there a connection between that murder and the monster that was roaming the woods?

576
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:20,060
 Was this town infested by some sort of spirit animal?

577
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:26,060
 Is there really a plant in that area that if you ate it you could become a shapeshifter?

578
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:32,940
 Was it possible that Peter Hodgkins was the beast that was sighted just five months earlier?

579
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:38,620
 No memory of it, just a wild, murderous beast?

580
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:42,860
 This area definitely seems sinister.

581
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,540
 Could be completely made up.

582
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:48,780
 All the information that I've presented to you, it could just be myths and legends that are

583
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:51,100
 sewn together to tell a compelling story.

584
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:56,060
 I, on a scale of one to ten, out of all the places, I would put Dogtown at a ten.

585
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:59,340
 This place sounds absolutely fascinating to me.

586
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:03,660
 Dogtown, I think, has a dark secret.

587
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:07,660
 And the only way you'll ever be able to really prove it, right or wrong,

588
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,900
 is to walk around at ten times.

589
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,940
 No, no, the only way you're ever able to really like prove it would be to go out there.

590
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:20,060
 But if Peter Hodgkins wasn't the beast, where's the beast now?

591
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:24,140
