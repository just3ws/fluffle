 In the back hills of Arkansas in the year 1855
 Whoa horse whoa, what's gearing you so much?
 We have to stop these people but how we don't even know if they're people they're not people
 Pushing over a wagon
 wagon catches on fire
 Person standing in front of the silhouette of the fire. Yes, we don't know no human could push over
 No human could push over a wagon like that
 How echoing over the moonlit landscape of Arkansas we don't know how to stop these raiders
 You already said that where I'm saying it again. Dang it. We don't stop these people. They're not people
 Then what are they?
 They're the Bigfoot and this is the story of the human Bigfoot war of
 1855 today on Dead Rabbit Radio
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day
 I hope you guys are having a great day, too. You guys listen to yesterday's episode
 I think you can tell how how healthy I am which is not very
 The ending of that episode sounded like I was really trying not to cry at the story of Martin Guerrero
 I was holding in the cough for about 15 seconds
 And I was trying to say that final line so I could just finish the episode
 Cough and then go to sleep. Yeah, I don't know what it is. It could be the combination of me
 I've completely given up the nicotine. I'm not even on the patch anymore
 So I'm feeling kind of good, but I'm quite miserable could just be coming down with something because of the weather
 I don't know so this episode actually is only going to be one story, but it's a good story
 But so this episode is probably gonna be a little short
 I just need to get some more rest
 But I want it I'm glad I saved this one because I think this one is definitely one that can hold up its own episode
 Don't need anything else. So let's go ahead and jump into the Bigfoot human war or the human Bigfoot war
 I really don't think it matters which one comes first, but this is from the conspiracy iceberg
 This is also a recommendation from our Bigfoot or resident Bigfoot expert
 Bennett Bennett, thank you. This is one that I've actually had on the docket for quite a while
 I researched it probably like six seven months ago and just haven't reported it and then Bennett reminded me
 That it existed and I was like, oh, yeah, I already have the notes on this one
 So thank you Bennett for reminding me that of work that I had previously done
 Let's go ahead and jump into this
 So we're gonna get on our mighty steeds
 That sounds like a witch, but it's not we're not jumping on top of old-timey witches
 We're jumping on top of our horses getting on our mountian or horses. It's a better term
 You're not just jumping up and down on them. So get on your steed young traveler
 I'll eat your children. We're like, that's not a horse. You gotta get a real one. So we're taking our horses
 We're gonna ride back into time
 We're going back to the year 1855 we're going to the state
 of Arkansas now
 I think in 1855
 It was still pretty like yeah, there was a government there
 But it wasn't like super
 It wasn't like it is today
 I have no idea what I'm talking about
 What I'm trying to say is
 the state had like
 U.S. citizens in it and then a bunch of natives in it as well, which might again might be the case today
 But I think it was I'm trying to say it was probably more wildernessy wildernessy
 Okay, so
 Nowadays you can go to a little rock, but back then it was just rock
 It was just a giant rock. It hadn't been carved down yet by the settlers
 So we're riding through the wilderness of Arkansas on our horses on our mighty mighty steeds
 And we're gonna meet the Choctaw tribe and they're we're gonna meet a dude named Hamas Tubby
 So we're like poking his stomach. We're like, hey Tubby. Hey, he has a full on six pack
 This guy is a massive warrior. He's like you can call me Tubby. Oh, you want Tubby? You're the one who's Tubby
 Jason and I'm like, you're right
 But at least my name is not Tubby Hamas Tubby
 And he has a bunch of sons, right and they're recorded to be the Choctaw
 tribe is already a very tall native american tribe, but apparently
 Tubby and sons are pushing seven feet tall
 Seven feet tall. So a couple inches taller than me. So massive people, right?
 And they're in a group of even bigger dudes
 And while Hamas and company are chilling
 They're actually probably doing a lot to further the growth of their tribe
 But while they're in the area you start hearing reports of raiding parties
 People oh Tubby Tubby. I'm so glad you're here
 They're like, what's the matter dude? And he's like
 So I was walking with my girlfriend down by the river, right?
 and
 somebody like pushed us and then we ran away
 The native dudes like oh, well, that's that's that's quite rude. He got pushed and they're like, yeah, he got pushed
 Okay, you leave and then if someone else comes and they're like, oh Tubby Tubby. Oh my god
 I was I was just walking by the river
 But I had a bale of apples with me. I was carrying apples
 And something came out of the woods and pushed me over and took my apples
 And Tubby's like the plot of the plot thickens
 Now we have a motive for this pushing action that's going on and then
 No, no, okay
 So let me be clear here
 People weren't getting pushed at the river. The point is is that I was trying to build the narrative. There were multiple attacks
 By raiders in the area against people
 So whether or not apples or girlfriends were being pushed over the point is is that
 Someone kept attacking
 Choctaw natives in the area big people
 I mean if a Choctaw was like, oh my god, that guy was so huge Tubby knows. Hmm. That's interesting because we're the biggest people around
 And we haven't eaten apples in a while. So
 They're getting word of these raiding parties in the area
 Both at the river and beyond
 So they try to find out what's going on. Who's attacking their people and then
 Children start to disappear. So at this point Tubby's like, okay apples getting pushed or no apples getting pushed
 This has gotten serious like we have to take care of this kids are missing
 So they form up a
 Posse they form up a search party to find who is taking these people
 What they do is they have a 30 man crew
 So they're like load up boys
 Cloting up the rifles
 Putting bullets in
 Guys pulling up picture of his girlfriend
 He's kisses it puts it on the top of his horse so you can see these he's riding in the battle
 They're like, who's that? He's like, this is the girl I'm coming back to
 Puts it on there. Come on boys. Quit messing around get your guns ready. We got to go find some kid killers
 Like wait a second. How do you know they're killing the kids? He's like, I skipped ahead in the story
 So this group at the person who skipped ahead in the story. His name is joshua la flor
 He's half french half chock towel and he goes come on boys. Let's do this
 We're gonna find these people. We're gonna push him into the mud. We're gonna do more than that. We're gonna kill him
 They're like, yay. Yay. Some guy was like, really? You're just gonna push him into the mud
 It's like, hey, it's improv. I'm just coming up the top of my head. He hops on his horse. Now, we're gonna ride with him
 Come on. Come on, dude. Get your horse. We're gonna make some more of these tiny people
 Among these seven tall soldiers. We're wearing like modern day clothes
 They're pretending not to notice but they're like those guys are idiots
 They think they can be in this battle with us
 But anyways, we earn their trust halfway through the journey because they keep dropping stuff on the ground and we pick it up
 For them because we're tiny. It's all people can't pick stuff up. So anyways, we're right. I don't know
 We're riding our horses in this big cavalry band now
 We're able to track these bandits down in relatively short order. It's not like the next day. They're like, oh look
 But these guys are expert trackers. So we're able to get to where we're going and it doesn't take a lot of time
 And at one point we're up in a hill and joshua was like get down get down all the horses
 Are getting down. They're high. Can a horse kneel a horse can like get down
 Can a horse sit like a sphinx can a horse sit actually? I think it's a good enough question
 But like horses seem to be you know, it's funny and that's already going this segue on my episode
 I'm trying to make short because I don't feel good
 Horses
 Are one of the most alien looking creatures that I think we see on a daily basis like yeah, you know
 Water bears look weird and like insects are pretty disgusting
 But when you see a horse it actually looks like
 Some kid drew something and it came to life. It doesn't it's a big fat
 It basically has the body of a maggot just like a big round
 torso and then tiny little stick legs and then
 Uh, I just a head shaped like an aquatic creature or dinosaur and then a tail
 And it's so gross horses are pretty like gross looking
 They're magnificent and they're kind of awesome to look at but they look like big brown maggots with stick legs like really
 They're super super
 Alien looking they don't look like they belong like a dog. Everything looks in proportion cat. Everything looks in proportion
 Cows even cows look kind of weird too, but not as weird as a horse
 Anyways, you're like, and what horses are you looking at?
 Who was magnificent muscular beast on?
 I don't know. I they just look alien to me. I'm not saying that they're not pretty
 I mean brown maggots aren't pretty by definition, but
 They just look so alien to me
 anyways
 We're riding these
 Horses looking at me as I'm delivering that monologue the horse that I'm riding is like, dude
 You're kind of a jerk and he's trying to fight. I'm like, come on horse. No, no, no, you're good. You're one of the good ones
 You're one of the good ones. Oh, okay. Thanks Jason. So we're walking anyways
 We come to this hill the horses are ducking down and joshua the floor breaks out this homemade telescope
 It's basically just two pieces of cardboard and some nerds high glasses that he's told back in town
 He's turning. He's like there's a raiding part. I see the party over there. That's the raiders. They're in that little forested area
 Mount up boys
 Get back on our horses check our rifles. Yep, according to the story. We're rocking sharp rifles
 They're 50 caliber combat rifles. So getting putting those big old bullets in we're about to blow up some raiders
 Joshua the floor. Let's go. We're riding down the hill now
 Full charge not just dropping. I don't know why I'm making that noise
 Just all it sounds like a dude's at some British cheese about to start rapping
 The forest not the forest the forest stays there the horses
 Crash into the forest. So the horses
 Russian to the forest we're on the horses. So we all rush into the forest
 And the first thing
 We're hit with is the smell of death
 Start choking and gagging some of the smell so bad some of the horses
 Throw their
 Throw their right. It sounds like a witch throw their riders off of them. Uh
 Horses take off the smell is that bad
 Imagine if somebody
 Who never wore deodorant?
 Died in an outhouse on a summer day and then that outhouse farted in your mouth
 That is what the smell of this area is like
 That is about enough. We're starting to gag
 Oddly enough one of the guys is like
 Oh, yes, my favorite smell in the world. He has a fetish for this by the rest of us
 Now as we're combating this basically chemical weapon at this point, we can't stand the smell of death
 We start to see these three figures
 kind of hunched over a pile of something and while we're like our eyes are all watery
 Trying to figure out what's going on one of them stands up and it's truly a monstrous man if not a monster itself
 seven to eight feet tall
 Seemingly covered in hair and holding like a chicken wing the arm of a dead child
 Taking another bite or just looking at us
 And we see there's two other figures like him
 And they're standing by a pile of all the dead children that have been missing
 There's been nine of them. I don't know if I said how many there were anyways
 There's been nine of them and they're partially decayed and being eaten or have been eaten
 And it doesn't matter because at this point we're
 Throwing up and the creature
 Kind of wipes its mouth off now joshua la flor. He's not freaking out. He's not throwing up. He's still on his horse
 He's completely enraged by what he sees he he takes his horse
 He grabs his sword and he
 Charge and he goes running towards on horseback the guy who's standing up who's just eating the kid's arm
 Running full bore. He's going to chop this dude's head off
 And the creature turns and just punches the horse in the head and kills the horse instantly
 Now joshua falls off the horse and the creature looks over at him and joshua pulls out his pistol and just unloads pop pop pop pop pop pop pop
 Every bullet pop pop pop pop hits this creature
 Empties the gun into this creature creature still coming joshua gets to his feet
 joshua grabs the sword and just starts hacking at this guy now
 He's drawn blood just slicing it up. He's cutting his blood everywhere. He's doing damage
 This isn't some sort of mystical creature, but it is some sort of creature
 And it's still coming towards him as joshua stabbing and slicing and cutting and then we're all in shock
 By what's going on because this whole thing happened in a matter of seconds
 From the time we all fell off of our horses or just smelled
 the horrible stench
 To where we're at right now
 Everyone's frozen all these combat trained soldiers are frozen and us and then and then one of the other creatures walks up behind
 joshua and while he's stabbing the first one
 Desperately trying to kill it. The other one just walks up grabs the back of joshua's head and goes
 Rips his head off of his shoulders and joshua just falls to the ground
 Now I imagine the creature did some sort of Harlem Globetrotter move the head started rolling around spinning it on his finger
 But whatever happened in real life at all the shock of people ended right there
 Like seeing their leader killed made them not being shocked which okay
 Let's take a second to go over this part real quick
 That is a really really bad team
 If you are a military man and you're trying to pick your best team
 Can you can't can you do well under pressure? Well, it depends if it's really smelly
 I can't but don't worry captain the second you die. I'll be ready to fight again
 But anyways, everyone's kind of like whoa. What was that? I just saw a bunch of kids getting eaten
 I just saw a horse get punched to death and I saw my captain's head get ripped off
 It's time to fight everyone opens fire with their rifles now. They're sharp 50 caliber rifles
 Creatures are like
 Getting shot
 Now it says in the story that every shot was a head shot because these guys were so good with these rifles
 And I'm telling you that not because we're humble bragging. I'm like, all right
 Dude, we're so good shooting people with these rifles. It's because it plays an interesting part in what's coming up
 But anyways, so you just see this big foot
 It's like close up of a rifle shooting then a big foot piece goes off his head and then another shot
 piece go off his head and then slow motion
 Bigfoot brains going everywhere and then I guess I want to be making that noise
 He would already be dead all three of these creatures just getting massive 50 caliber rounds to the head
 Then birds come back to the forest
 They're french birds apparently
 and
 Nature has been restored now. They're like
 Oh wait, no, sorry, then there's I forgot this part
 So then they think they're all dead, right? But one of the creatures doesn't get shot at multiple times
 Why 50 caliber rounds? So here's the epilogue
 So they're like that good thing that was done and some guy has his back
 To one of the raiders. He's like, yeah, can you believe these guys are such knuckleheads?
 We killed them so easily
 What a bunch of what a bunch of rum dingers and then the creature gets up and starts running
 And they're like uh and so this young brave jumps off of his horse and grabs his knife and he's running through the jungle and the creature's like
 And that dude's running behind him
 Monsters running and then the guy jumps up
 Sticks him with a knife and just kills this dude with this monster with a knife
 Now he'd been shot up a bunch of times
 So they did think he was dead or not. It doesn't matter. The point is is that the last one was killed by a knife
 So the remaining people all of us basically there was 30 people in joshla flure la flare whatever
 He died he got his head ripped off
 So we start digging they make us dig the graves because we were completely useless in that fight
 We dig the graves we dig the grave for joshua
 We dig the grave to bury the children and then we just burn the body of the raiders
 We burn the bodies of these bandits
 slash monsters
 Because they don't deserve a proper burial
 And then we ride back home
 And we get home and there's a little little kid walks up to you and be like hey
 Hey, what what do you guys see out there? Is it true? Is it true the smell and the head in the head getting punched off and
 And all of that stuff and we look down at the little boy and we go
 I don't know if it's true. We're about to figure that out
 We're about to figure that out little boy
 He's like whether it doesn't make any sense and then bam
 We're back in the present day and then we go and grab a history book and we look up and it says
 1855 a little boy
 asked the question of two strangers and
 And they didn't have an answer
 That little boy decided to dedicate his life to finding answers
 That little boy's name was hawking
 Stephen hawking so we didn't know it, but we actually inspired
 Stephen hawking native american boy, but you didn't know that
 Native american boy born in 1855
 Anyways, the point is is that we're back in the future
 Let's take a look and see how much of this story is true
 Now like I said, I came across this story months and months ago and I did all the research
 I just let it sit there and I thought I just I don't really I think it's totally fake
 I think it's 100 fake. So I was like, I've done a lot of stories where I just talk about it and then go
 It's fake and then move on. That's what was preventing me from talking about it
 But when Bennett was like, yeah, you should cover it. I was like, I'll give it another look
 So let's really dig into this thing here. There's a website called sasquatchhistory.wordpress.com
 Which is really good website because I always like websites that take like love exploring stuff
 But then also know that stuff needs to be dunked and debunked and debunked and that is what this podcast does
 So let's take a look at what we can verify with this story
 This is what the sasquatch history website says one those sharp rifles. They didn't come out in 1855
 They weren't invented until 1870. So right there
 We have a problem and they were 50 caliber rifles
 But the thing is is like this website was saying that Native Americans really wouldn't have access
 If they had access to a 50 caliber rifle, the ammo would be quite rare for them
 They wouldn't be able to be super well trained on them to land headshot after headshot after headshot
 Because it was a military grade rifle with military grade weaponry
 It would be harder to get than say like a 22 round or something like that
 So right there you go. Well, then it's not true because these
 Weapons that are named in it aren't didn't exist at the time even if they did they wouldn't be
 Plausible for them to use. Well, what's interesting is the story itself might be true
 But the detail could have been added in later
 So it could have originally just been they were using rifles and someone says oh no
 They'd have to have 50 caliber rifles to fight these monsters
 But apparently this story has some seed of truth into it
 If we look at the original story that there these weren't creatures at all. They weren't bigfoot
 originally it was just there was a bunch of raiders in the area and
 They were killing kids at a certain point and these guys came out and they fought humans
 And they shot a bunch of times in the head and that was kind of the end of it
 And then the humans became more than human they became man beasts
 And then over time they became beasts or bigfoot's
 So now they're fighting giant hairy people in the middle of the woods
 So you have that you have an origin of the story you have like an evolution of the story
 The area where this happened in the Choctaw language. It's known as looking for killers
 This little grove
 Where all this supposedly went down
 Is no one has looking for killers in Choctaw?
 So it's possible something went down. However, here's the real kicker
 I'm getting all of those details from that website sasquatchhistory.wordpress.com
 And they could be making it up or they could be completely wrong because I tried looking for
 The glenn I tried looking for what looking for killers means in Choctaw
 I tried looking for earlier versions of the story. I couldn't find anything the real kicker to the story of whether or not it's true
 Is there was no such person as joshua la flor the person did not exist at that time period
 I'm not saying that there's not one now some guy's a bookkeeper in Idaho. He's like starts to fade away
 He's like no, I don't exist at the time. There was no guy named joshua la flor. There was a la flor family
 They were very very influential members of the Choctaw community. They were half french half Choctaw all of that stuff checks out
 But there was no captain joshua la flor that person did not exist
 There was a jackson la flor, but it was born after the events
 So we have all these different little details that don't add up that make you go
 The story's fake when you talk about people riding and shooting monsters in the middle of the woods
 Which is really what the the monsters are eating children
 Heroes show up shoot monsters into story
 When you're talking about a story that's fanciful your details need to be on point
 And it's funny because had they left out the name of joshua la flor or the types of rifles
 The story would be much harder to just flat out debunk and say it didn't happen because these details didn't happen
 But I think there's a more interesting
 Let's assume that a version of the story happened that it wasn't humans fighting bigfoot
 Which is possible because you figure that humans fought neanderthals for thousands of years
 We had constant struggles with other species other humanoid species on this planet
 The idea of a bunch of people in the wild wild west shooting at bigfoot isn't
 Super out of the or like if you believe in that type of stuff. I mean, obviously it's not like a scientist
 It's like you're right Jason that isn't out of the ordinary. In fact, it's quite plausible like I'm not saying that but
 If you believe in this stuff anyways, then but I think there's actually a more interesting question to this
 I think there's actually a more interesting theory to this. So let's assume that the events themselves are true
 They didn't use the rifles joshua la flor is isn't in it. It's some other dude
 People are getting attacked pushed by the river children go missing search party shows up
 And they see in this wilderness a bunch of people run off and they see three
 mighty men left behind
 Tall men seemingly covered in hair
 Almost supernaturally strong and these three men turn and fight to the death
 With this band of 30 native warriors
 One theory that's been put forth is that these guys were vikings
 These were a band of vikings that had long lived in america as a separate
 little civilization
 And this is how they lived they raided other people. They took what they wanted like they did in europe
 but this time they got tracked down and
 Three of them decided to make a stand
 While the rest of them took off
 I think that idea is way more honestly bad ass than the bigfoot like yes bigfoot
 I'm getting shot in the head, but I think I think the idea and I've always found this idea intriguing
 I know they came out of that movie pathfinder, which was okay, but the idea of vikings versus
 Like native americans. I find absolutely like visually stunning. I think that is such a not for them
 They're like, oh i'm getting stabbed i'm getting stabbed and the other guys the vikings getting shot with arrows
 It's not visually stunning for them, but you have two basically the two most alpha
 Relations on the planet like I'd like to see ninjas fight as tech warriors
 I'd actually like to see ninjas
 Fight knights from medieval times
 I'd like to see like as tech warriors fight
 You could have as tech warriors fighting vikings. Anyways, that's another point. The point is is like
 Wait, it's it's kind of the point the point is is that I think it's awesome when you have two societies
 fight
 But not like I don't I mean I don't really care about like russia and syria fighting turkey
 That's not as interesting. I want to see
 Like those ancient civilizations clash in ways they never did so to me. It's more exciting and exhilarating
 To thank that in 1855
 Some dudes were running up on some vikings that were eating children
 And a viking a human turned around and punched a horse so hard the horse died and then the viking kept getting stabbed
 I'm not saying the vikings a good guy in this scenario either. Don't get a twist and I'm not like yay go vikings
 He's deserved to die because he's eating children, but
 I just find that idea more interesting than the bigfoot but either way either way if this story happened
 Something very very dark happened children went missing and were eaten
 A brave man died trying to seek out vengeance
 and three men
 Or beasts or both
 Were killed in that glen
 but
 Remember a bunch of them got away and just because we got no further reports in that area
 doesn't mean
 That they didn't continue their reign of terror
 somewhere
 in the american west
