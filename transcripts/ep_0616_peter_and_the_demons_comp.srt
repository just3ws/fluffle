1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,740
 We all know that the world of the paranormal is hiding from us.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,880
 Is it possible now we know how they're doing it?

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,280
 When a young boy starts misbehaving in Brazil, you just assume he's going to get a spanking.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,280
 Instead he's cursed with immortal life?

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:24,120
 And then we take a look at a bizarre story from an apocryphal book of the Bible.

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,160
 When the apostle Peter was traveling from town to town spreading the teachings of Jesus

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,280
 Christ, he was hoping to convert people to Christianity.

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,560
 That was kind of his job.

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,280
 But instead he ran into seven angels in the middle of the city.

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,800
 But he quickly surmised these weren't any angels.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,520
 They were fallen angels.

12
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,640
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:56,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,800
 I'm having a great day.

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,200
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

17
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,720
 Those introductions for some reason are getting way rougher than they used to be.

18
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,560
 I don't know but I'm still having fun doing the show.

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,840
 Hope you guys are still having fun listening and I know someone who's having fun is our

20
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,760
 newest Patreon supporter.

21
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,040
 He's a wild and crazy guy having tons of fun.

22
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,720
 It's ultrasound 700.

23
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,600
 Nothing but sound waves penetrating the building of Dead Rabbit Command.

24
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,600
 We can't see him.

25
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,600
 We can't.

26
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,760
 Actually that leads into our first story but for right now we can't see him.

27
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,960
 He's vibrating us to the bones.

28
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,720
 Ultrasound 700, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

29
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,200
 You can't support the Patreon or if you have a corporeal form, that's okay too.

30
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,800
 Just help spread the word about the show really really helps out a lot.

31
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,640
 Ultrasound wubba wubba wubba wubba is vibrating in just the right frequency that now we can

32
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,640
 see them appear.

33
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,640
 Ultrasound, I'm gonna toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Dune Buggy.

34
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,160
 We have to go off-roading for this so we're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

35
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,240
 We're headed out to the jungle.

36
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,880
 *Dunkey noises*

37
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,960
 Dead Rabbit Dune Buggy is headed off to...

38
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,960
 I don't think a Dune Buggy works really well in a jungle but somehow we're able to make

39
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,960
 it.

40
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,760
 As Ultrasound's driving we all have machetes.

41
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,680
 We're chopping vines at 60 miles an hour but we're there.

42
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,920
 We're in the jungle and in the jungle we're gonna meet another Patreon supporter, Elkie.

43
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,080
 Elkie actually supported the show.

44
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,520
 Did we give Ultrasound 700 a round of applause?

45
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,040
 I don't know if I forgot that.

46
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,840
 There it is, the lonely clav of the jungle.

47
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,840
 I'll edit that out if I did if it's in there then it's in there.

48
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,480
 But anyways, Elkie, he's in the jungle, he's getting attacked by a bow constrictor.

49
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,440
 But Elkie's the one who recommended this story to me so thank you very much Elkie.

50
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,920
 I thought it was pretty interesting.

51
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,920
 He shared with me this reddit post and this is basically what it was.

52
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,720
 It's a photo of a green tiger.

53
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,280
 Now it's not some cool new cryptid.

54
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,000
 That'd actually be kind of lame if it was just a tiger but green.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,640
 But anyways, it's a green tiger and it's how...

56
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,840
 This is really interesting.

57
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,680
 Otherwise I wouldn't be reporting it.

58
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,120
 It's how oon-gallates see tigers.

59
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:09,880
 So an oon-gallate, if you don't know because I didn't, is a hoofed animal and a lot of them are red, green, colorblind.

60
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,720
 So they can't see orange as orange.

61
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,960
 They see orange as green and tigers are famously orange.

62
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,520
 Basically they look like the jungle.

63
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,840
 Basically if you have red, green color, you can't see a tiger.

64
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,960
 It's really, really interesting.

65
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,960
 I recommend checking the show notes out to take a look at this photograph.

66
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,160
 It's what a tiger would look like to a hoofed animal.

67
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,800
 It's invisible.

68
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:40,240
 Like if it was perfectly still, actually now that I think about it, do animals know what tigers look like?

69
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:48,920
 Like a baby goat, even an adult goat, like a goat from Bolivia, would he know what a tiger looked like?

70
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:53,080
 Like if he was walking through the jungle, he's like, "Oh no, I took a wrong turn."

71
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,240
 He's in the middle of the jungle of Africa.

72
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,680
 What do you know what a tiger looked like?

73
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,160
 I wonder if predators have a smell to them.

74
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,080
 Like they smell like death.

75
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,280
 They smell like dead goats.

76
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,040
 Because a goat from Bolivia I would assume would be like, "Uh-oh, it's about to get real."

77
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,600
 Like I've never been to this part of Africa before.

78
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,920
 I lost my map.

79
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,560
 I should have listened to that tour guide when he said stay on the trail.

80
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,240
 But I know something's about to eat me.

81
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:24,760
 I wonder if a goat from one country would recognize a predator from another country.

82
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:34,680
 If you took a wild boar from America and put him in Komodo, that Komodo island full of the Komodo dragons,

83
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,160
 would the wild boar just like wander around and then eventually get bit and die?

84
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,440
 Or would he know something was up?

85
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,000
 If you've never faced that predator before, would you be prepared?

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,280
 Because humans are dumb.

87
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,720
 Humans will just wander into a forest and be like, "Oh, I like hiking.

88
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,160
 I'm a hippie and I enjoy the earth."

89
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,320
 And then something jumps out of the bushes and eats them.

90
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,200
 Army hammer.

91
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,840
 Army hammer.

92
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,880
 They're hiking through the Hollywood Hills.

93
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,880
 But humans will do stupid stuff and they'll go up and they'll pet things that will eat them.

94
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,040
 So would a goat do that?

95
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,280
 But anyways, look at how biologists look at it.

96
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,160
 Even if they could do that, the point is that they couldn't see it.

97
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,240
 But let's say they could see it.

98
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,240
 I'm saying would they recognize the silhouette of a tiger?

99
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,440
 We can look at a photo and go, "Oh, there's a tiger in that picture.

100
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,720
 It's not completely invisible."

101
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,320
 But an animal, they would just see vines.

102
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,160
 They would just see like this big lump of grass and things.

103
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,920
 They're like, "Oh, I'm a vegetarian.

104
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,880
 I love grass.

105
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,440
 Art, art."

106
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,040
 And they'd go to eat it and the tiger eats them.

107
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:37,040
 The point of the story is not my complete ignorance of biology and sociology of animals.

108
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:42,800
 The point of the story is this, the implications of paranormal activity.

109
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,160
 I found this very fascinating.

110
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,680
 And again, Elkie, thanks for sending this over.

111
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,040
 I did a little more research on this.

112
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,160
 Because actually I didn't.

113
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,040
 When I was looking through the Reddit posts, is what I meant to say.

114
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:00,640
 There was someone who by the name of, I wish my boyfriend was a dog man,

115
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,920
 which I don't think they mean a literal dog man, but that would be cool.

116
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,120
 I wish my boyfriend was a dog man.

117
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,880
 Post a link to an article, there are a very, very, very small subset of human women.

118
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,800
 Only women can have this.

119
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,760
 That are reverse, reverse colorblind.

120
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,680
 So most humans have three types of cone cells in their eyes.

121
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,280
 Colorblinds only have two functioning ones and a mutant one.

122
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,920
 There's been a theory for a long time that the daughters of colorblind people

123
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,240
 may have three working ones and one mutant one.

124
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,120
 In theory, they could see more colors than the average person.

125
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,120
 In fact, 99 million more colors than the average person, but they would never know it.

126
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,360
 They assumed everyone sees like that.

127
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,240
 I have double vision.

128
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,440
 I assumed everyone saw like me.

129
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,400
 Thought I felt like everyone had to concentrate to bring everything together.

130
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,040
 That was just normal.

131
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,680
 It wasn't until I was 16 when I figured that out.

132
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,880
 And this was again, just a theory until 2007,

133
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,760
 they were able to find one woman in the United Kingdom.

134
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,600
 They could verify had this condition.

135
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,480
 She has three regular cones, like a normal person.

136
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:11,120
 But as the child of someone who was colorblind, she also inherited the mutant cone.

137
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:17,280
 And there is a specialized test that can create a color that even the people who created the test

138
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,400
 can't see the color.

139
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,080
 But if you have this mutant gene, you can see this color appear.

140
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,240
 Fascinating science stuff.

141
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,080
 But what does any of this have to do with ghosts and goblins?

142
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,240
 We don't only talk about ghosts and goblins on this show.

143
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,600
 We do talk about interesting science stuff, but this leads back to that.

144
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,200
 What if the world of the paranormal isn't trying to hide from us?

145
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,240
 What if they're literally a green tiger?

146
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,360
 Like the tiger didn't choose to be green.

147
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,000
 It didn't wake up one day and go, "Ooh, I think I'm going to evolve to become an apex predator."

148
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,120
 I mean, technically it did.

149
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,600
 But I don't want to get started on evolution again,

150
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,680
 because I always go sideways when I talk about that.

151
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,240
 It happens through evolution.

152
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,120
 What if the world of the paranormal isn't actively hiding from us?

153
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,720
 They literally can't be seen by us, not by their own choice.

154
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,360
 It's always this idea of the shadows standing behind us, the gap woman,

155
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,800
 and our cupboard, the creepy hand, the boogeyman.

156
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,520
 The boogeyman might want to be your buddy.

157
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,920
 Still don't trust the voice in your closet, but the boogeyman may want to be visible.

158
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,440
 But it can't be.

159
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,320
 So is it possible that the world of the paranormal is there?

160
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,360
 We just can't see it.

161
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,200
 And we have all these people who claim to be mediums and they see spirits and stuff like that.

162
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,480
 And I give some of them credit.

163
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,200
 I have no one real people who can see spirits.

164
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,480
 Obviously I've seen ghosts, but I've known people who have claimed to be mediums,

165
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,360
 who have backed it up.

166
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,880
 I think a lot of them are fraudulent, but I don't think all of them are fraudulent.

167
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,240
 Same thing with remote viewers.

168
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,680
 I think there are some people who know how to do it.

169
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,120
 I think there are some people who can actually do telepathy and things like that.

170
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,400
 But most of the people who claim to do that, I'd say 99% of them are fraudulent or mistaken.

171
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,280
 But what if it comes down to the fact that they don't have this connection to the veil,

172
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,120
 that they don't have any sort of spiritual training?

173
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,600
 What if they were just born with a different set of eyeballs or a different genetic ear

174
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,880
 or different nose?

175
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,560
 There's the thing where you can smell the future.

176
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,560
 We'll do that in another topic at some point.

177
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,640
 I have a story about being able to smell the future.

178
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,800
 My point is that it could be something that you can't really train yourself to do.

179
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,560
 You're either born with that extra mutant cone where you could see it or not.

180
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,360
 And those are the people who can see the ghosts and they don't really understand

181
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,800
 why other people can't see ghosts all the time because they see them all the time.

182
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,560
 Maybe they actually have something different in their eyeballs.

183
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,320
 And the way evolution works is that enough of these ungulates,

184
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,440
 a great, now I'm talking about evolution, damn it, as time goes on some of these hoofed animals,

185
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,720
 these gazelles are going to have a little baby that's not colorblind.

186
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,560
 And that baby is going to be like, dude, look out, look, there's a giant orange thing over there.

187
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,240
 Guys, stop, stop, stop.

188
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,240
 And then that dude will live longer and have more babies because he's not dumb and trying to eat

189
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,120
 green tigers.

190
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,800
 And then his kids will pass on that mutation and it'll get better.

191
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,800
 And then a million years from now, they won't be being eaten by tigers.

192
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,160
 They'll have taken over the planet gazelles with little space helmets on Venus.

193
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,760
 But they'll keep evolving.

194
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,720
 Their eyesight will keep evolving until eventually they can see the tigers.

195
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,760
 And then, I guess, in theory, then the tigers just change a different color.

196
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,600
 They'll evolve so they can keep eating gazelles.

197
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,120
 The whole thing's weird, but my point is that what if humanity evolves to the point

198
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,880
 just through freak evolution, humans haven't evolved to see ghosts everywhere.

199
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,800
 And see all the phantoms and the boogieman and the creatures.

200
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,280
 Actually, now that I think about it, evolution isn't always good.

201
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:46,240
 What if we used to be able to see these things?

202
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,960
 And they horrified us.

203
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,120
 We wouldn't go out to hunt.

204
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,760
 We feared the darkness.

205
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,680
 We feared the creatures of the night.

206
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,760
 And those people who were truly afraid stayed at home and slowly starved to death.

207
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,680
 When the people who couldn't see them went out and hunted and gained food and lived longer.

208
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,760
 What if we used to be able to see these things and our eyes have devolved to the point where

209
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,880
 we can't see the paranormal?

210
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,080
 As a survival mechanism, if you knew the boogieman was real, would you ever go outside in the dark?

211
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,000
 Interesting theory.

212
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,960
 Interesting theory I just came up with.

213
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,240
 I thought we were going to have a future of seeing nothing but ghosts.

214
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,000
 But maybe ghosts is all we saw in the past.

215
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,520
 And we've evolved to ignore the real.

216
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:40,080
 Ultrasound, I'm going to toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

217
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,600
 Let's fly away from Africa.

218
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,320
 We see the gazelles trying to evolve super fast as invisible tigers are sneaking up behind them.

219
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,240
 They're like, come on, evolve, evolve, evolve.

220
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,120
 Maybe they'll get there.

221
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,640
 Maybe enough pluckiness will help them evolve eyeballs.

222
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,560
 But until then, we wave goodbye to the gazelles who are headed out to Brazil.

223
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,640
 Ultrasound's piloting the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

224
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,280
 Over the ocean.

225
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,560
 Now I know some of you guys are going to think, hey Jason, didn't you cover this guy before?

226
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,200
 First off, I'm going to say there is a very good chance that I will cover the same stories

227
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,520
 more than once because I'm 44 years old so I forget stuff.

228
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,640
 I've had 600 and what 14 episodes at this point.

229
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,680
 Each one has two or three stories in them.

230
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,320
 I have a pretty good system for keeping track.

231
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,760
 The website DeadRabbit.com actually has a search bar that you type in words and it'll

232
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,960
 pull up every episode.

233
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,960
 Those words are in the show notes.

234
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:37,360
 So I'll type in stuff like bag man or bag of bones and it will give me an idea of whether or

235
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,680
 not I've covered both of those before.

236
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,600
 But this is not that story.

237
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,560
 I remember once a long time ago, I don't remember what episode it was,

238
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,040
 there was this guy in Brazil, it was some old legend.

239
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,480
 He tricked his dad into eating his brother or tricked his dad into eating his mom or

240
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:01,360
 something like that and then he was cursed to carry a bag of bloody bones over his back

241
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,920
 for the rest of his life and he lived forever.

242
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,200
 Now that's not this story.

243
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,800
 Yes, this story does take place in Brazil.

244
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:15,440
 It does involve a bag of bones and it does involve immortality, but it's not that story.

245
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,600
 It's a different, it's a different guy with a bag of bones who's immortal.

246
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,560
 But not the same story.

247
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,240
 Anyways, we're in Brazil, Ultra sounds like a little, he's like I don't know.

248
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,440
 This might be the same story.

249
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,160
 It's not.

250
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,320
 Ultra's trying to go ahead and bring this carbonicopter low.

251
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,680
 We're in this little village and we're gonna meet a guy, his name is Romo Zeno.

252
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,600
 And Romo Zeno is a little boy.

253
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,120
 He's basically 10 years old.

254
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,520
 He's running around the village and he's a total jerk to everybody.

255
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,800
 Imagine if Dennis the Menace and Bart Simpson had a kid and then that was raised by Cartman.

256
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,720
 That is Romo Zeno.

257
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,800
 He is kicking over plants.

258
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,480
 He likes to destroy things.

259
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,560
 He loves to torture animals.

260
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,400
 So not a good guy, not a good fellow.

261
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,000
 And one day, the worst combination is when you have someone who's really mean

262
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,320
 and someone who's hungry at the same time.

263
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,680
 His mom says, "Hey, Romo Zeno, I know you're like a total,

264
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,320
 undependable jerk and everyone in town hates you, but I have a journey for you.

265
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,840
 I'm gonna give you this chicken.

266
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,680
 I'm gonna put it in a box, not a bag, not a bag, that's from that other story.

267
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,120
 I'm gonna put it in a box and you take this chicken out to your dad who's working.

268
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,280
 And Romo Zeno, who's always like, you know, pulling the wings off flies, like that's cruel,

269
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,800
 but he's about to take it to the next level.

270
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,000
 He's walking with this chicken.

271
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,040
 He's going to his dad's place of work and he gets hungry.

272
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,920
 He's like, you know, after a long day of torturing animals.

273
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,240
 I have to eat a chicken.

274
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,920
 So he eats this chicken and he realizes, oh wait, this is my dad's lunch.

275
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,280
 He goes, I don't know, I'll figure something out.

276
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,560
 I'll make up a story.

277
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,600
 So he brings this box of bones to his dad and he goes, hey dad, how you doing?

278
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,760
 Dad's like, dang it, you came here, you big weirdo.

279
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,400
 Son puts down the box and goes, here's your lunch.

280
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,080
 Mom sent me this with your lunch.

281
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,680
 Dad opens it up, it's just a bunch of bones.

282
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,760
 And he goes, whoa, whoa, Romo Zeno.

283
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,280
 What's going on, bro?

284
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,560
 Like, where's my chicken?

285
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,120
 And Romo Zeno goes, oh, you know what?

286
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,640
 Every time you leave for work, this other dude shows up and hangs out with mom all day long.

287
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,600
 And I'm pretty sure they ate the chicken.

288
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,560
 So that, that happened.

289
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,400
 That's happening right now.

290
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,720
 That's my excuse for why I'm carrying.

291
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,080
 So the dad flips out and he goes back to the mom's house.

292
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,040
 Now at this point, Romo Zeno is probably thinking, you know, I'm only 10.

293
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,520
 I don't really know the ramifications of saying another man's coming to the house.

294
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,120
 Maybe dad will be mad.

295
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,560
 Well, dad comes home and he stabs the mom to death.

296
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,800
 And Romo Zeno, I hope he was shocked by this whole thing.

297
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,120
 I can't, I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt.

298
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,440
 He may been well aware of what was going to happen, but the mom knew what happened.

299
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,840
 As she's being stabbed to death, she places a curse, not on her husband.

300
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,720
 She doesn't blame her husband for whatever weird reason.

301
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,360
 She blames her son and he, she turns to the son as she's being stabbed and she goes,

302
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,400
 "You lied, son. You lied. So I curse you with eternal life.

303
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,520
 You will walk until time is done.

304
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,840
 You will walk until you, you are the last human on the planet."

305
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,600
 And at that point, the dad probably should have maybe stopped stabbing her and been like,

306
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,880
 "Oh, I was mistaken.

307
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,400
 Okay, to be fair, he shouldn't have stabbed her at all.

308
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,800
 Whether or not the kid was telling the truth, he shouldn't have stabbed her at all.

309
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,000
 But this is the story.

310
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,720
 So she doesn't curse the husband for murdering her.

311
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,320
 We don't even know what happens to the husband.

312
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,520
 But she curses the son to walk to the ends of the earth."

313
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:34,480
 There's the old story of like the wandering Jew, this Jewish man who's cursed to walk the world

314
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,760
 for all of eternity.

315
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,720
 And he's apparently popped up in different time periods.

316
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,200
 He was like a Count, Count Germain or something like that.

317
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,920
 This is Brazil's version, but the wandering Jew at least like gets around and force gumps it

318
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,280
 into like historical events.

319
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,360
 This dude never left Brazil.

320
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,040
 He's been hanging out there for who knows how many centuries at this point.

321
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,120
 And he has the ability to be immortal.

322
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,400
 He's going to live forever.

323
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,560
 He knows there's nothing he can do to stop it.

324
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,520
 So what does he do?

325
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,280
 Now he's even more of a vandal.

326
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,880
 He will actively attack people's houses.

327
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,720
 He scares people.

328
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,960
 So you'd be walking on the street and then a little kid goes, "Boo!"

329
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,360
 Which isn't that scary in and of itself.

330
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,480
 I mean, it would be startling.

331
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,760
 You'll spill your coffee.

332
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:21,360
 But if the person pulling the prank is immortal, he's had a lot of time to work on his delivery.

333
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,320
 Also, they don't actually say that he's paranormal.

334
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,720
 But I'm kind of getting the idea that he's invisible or has some sort of teleportation powers.

335
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,280
 But maybe that's just my retconning because they don't actually say that.

336
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,320
 He does love now.

337
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,880
 Now that he's this immortal deity at this point, he can never die.

338
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,000
 He could be learning all sorts of languages or investing money.

339
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,200
 No, he's just going to run around.

340
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,120
 He tortures chickens.

341
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,320
 I don't understand how you would torture chickens or why you would torture chickens.

342
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,800
 But he has this obsession with torturing chickens.

343
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,600
 He has an obsession with chickens in general.

344
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,880
 Because he ate that chicken.

345
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,240
 Apparently that was part of the curse.

346
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,560
 The mom didn't say that part.

347
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,400
 But you'll also be obsessed with chickens.

348
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,760
 This is why I'm telling this story.

349
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,760
 One, I think it's absolutely a bizarre legend.

350
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,280
 Two, there is a series of children books based on this guy.

351
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,520
 He's like a Dennis the Menace character over there.

352
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,360
 He did get his mother slaughtered by his father.

353
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,320
 He does torture animals.

354
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,920
 But there's a series of children's books.

355
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:20,720
 And they show him like standing there with four broken windows and he's like hiding his slingshot.

356
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,840
 There's one where he's jumping out from behind a Christmas tree blowing a trumpet right in Santa's ear.

357
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,760
 Like really, really jerk stuff.

358
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,200
 The funniest one was he's sitting underneath a tree relaxing.

359
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,720
 And there's a songbird in the tree and he's playing a boombox.

360
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,040
 He brought a boombox and sat it next to the bird and hit play.

361
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,480
 And then there's a bizarre hidden cover I can't find.

362
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,720
 They only show half of it online.

363
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,760
 I looked all over for it.

364
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,400
 There's one of like a scarecrow looking worriedly over his shoulder.

365
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,040
 And then you can't see the rest of that.

366
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,520
 I have no idea what Roma Zeno is planning on doing to the scarecrow.

367
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,360
 It's kind of, that makes it even more terrifying, the scarecrow.

368
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,800
 Knowing what he did to Santa, what is he going to do to the scarecrow?

369
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,640
 But the scarecrow is just kind of looking weird.

370
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,800
 But the reason why I want to talk about it, if anyone can tell me what happened to the scarecrow,

371
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,600
 I'd love to know.

372
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,920
 The reason why I'm talking about this is that he has a redemption story.

373
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:22,000
 But not like a huge redemption arc, but just that they say sometimes he helps out.

374
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 One day Roma Zeno was walking through the woods looking for someone to scare

375
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:33,600
 or chicken to torture and he sees a woman in her house giving birth and there's no midwife around.

376
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:40,160
 And Roma Zeno's like, "Uhhh, hmmm, well I have nothing better to do, there's no chickens to torture."

377
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,520
 He actually feels bad for the woman.

378
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,720
 He goes and he finds a midwife in town.

379
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,760
 And then scares her chickens.

380
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,280
 And the midwife wakes up and is like, "What? What's going on out there?"

381
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:57,280
 And she comes out and then Roma Zeno starts like kicking this chicken down the road and chasing this chicken.

382
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,760
 And the midwife is chasing the chicken and then the chicken runs into the house and the midwife

383
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,480
 goes into the house and the woman's in birth and the midwife successfully delivers the baby.

384
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,200
 That's what makes me think that he's invisible.

385
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,320
 Because otherwise the story wouldn't be that he chased the chicken.

386
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,960
 It would just be that some 10 year old boy was running on the street

387
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,360
 and people were like, "Hey, that's Roma Zeno. He owes me like $500 every time he scared me

388
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,120
 when she coins fell out of my pocket."

389
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,960
 So he does have that redemption arc.

390
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,400
 The reason why I wanted to tell that is that it's going to lead right into our next story.

391
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,160
 Ultrasound 700, let's hop in that carbonicopter.

392
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,080
 We're leaving behind Brazil.

393
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,160
 We're headed out to Bible Times.

394
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:41,200
 Specifically Bible Times is in a location unless it's some theme park.

395
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,320
 We're headed out to Azotus, which is a city in what's now known as Israel.

396
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,440
 We land, it's all dusty and there's like dust covered buildings.

397
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,280
 Everyone's wearing dust colored clothes.

398
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,640
 We land the carbonicopter.

399
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,280
 It's old time, Bible time.

400
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,800
 This is New Testament era.

401
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,000
 So this would have been like the 34, 35 AD.

402
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,600
 We're walking around.

403
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,120
 Recently, you know, books, there's apocryphal books of the Bible.

404
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,440
 There are books that just didn't make the cut.

405
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,160
 And I read this really interesting article recently about a bunch of books of the Bible

406
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,120
 that didn't make the cut.

407
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,120
 It was actually this article.

408
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,960
 This article was in Live Science.

409
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,160
 It was on LiveScience.com.

410
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,080
 You can see it in the show notes.

411
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,920
 But really what they're doing is they talked to a man named Professor Tony Burke.

412
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,680
 He was an expert on early Christianity.

413
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:30,000
 And he recently published a book called New Testament Apocrypha,

414
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,240
 More Non-Cononical Scriptures Volume 2.

415
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,240
 So these are books that didn't make the cut in the Bible for various reasons.

416
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,080
 And it's interesting because apparently there was a lot of fan fiction in the Bible,

417
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:46,000
 not in the Bible itself, but there's a lot of fan fiction written post the Bible being put together.

418
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,720
 Where it was really popular to write backstories.

419
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,480
 So Jesus was crucified on the cross and there were two thieves on either side of them.

420
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,160
 There was a thief on either side of them.

421
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:58,080
 And a lot of people have written backstories for these characters, for these thieves.

422
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,360
 So I thought that was interesting.

423
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,000
 And he goes, they didn't make the cut because they were made up.

424
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,760
 They're just stories that people were writing to try to give more context to what was going on.

425
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,640
 But one of these non-canonical scriptures, this isn't in the Bible, could have made the cut.

426
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,400
 It actually, a lot of times these apocrypha books were written way after, like I said,

427
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,520
 the Bible was constructed.

428
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,520
 So we're saying they're popping up in like 8th century, 12th century, things like that.

429
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,440
 There was actually a book that is in his collection that's not in the Bible

430
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,760
 that seems to have been written around when they were putting the finishing touches on the Bible.

431
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,920
 Or close enough to that, that it could have warmed its way in.

432
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,680
 So we're in Asatos.

433
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,520
 And the apostle Peter is walking around spreading the teachings of Jesus.

434
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,400
 And while he's in town, he hears rumors of seven angels who are also visiting.

435
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,920
 He's like, that's great, we can team up, we can get eight times the work done.

436
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,840
 Well actually, probably four more than that.

437
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,320
 They're angels, they can preach at the speed of light.

438
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,760
 But I'm going to go hang out with these dudes.

439
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,400
 So he walks and he sees these guys hanging out in the town square and everyone's like,

440
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,480
 you know, kind of like giving them high fives and stuff like that.

441
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,440
 What's up, angel bros?

442
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,120
 And they're like fist bumping.

443
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,480
 And Peter's like, uh oh, like he's not like, that's my thing.

444
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,680
 I'm the fist bump guy.

445
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,200
 You guys are ripping me off.

446
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,400
 He realized right away that there's something off of these angels.

447
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,120
 So he starts talking to them for a bit and he's like, hey guys, what's up?

448
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,480
 You know, we work for the same dude.

449
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,800
 And they're like, oh yeah, yeah, we've heard about you, Saint Peter.

450
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,960
 And he's like, Saint Peter, what's a saint?

451
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,240
 And he's like, oh no, no, no, that happens later.

452
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,040
 That happens later.

453
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,080
 Sorry, spoiler alert.

454
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,520
 But you will be very famous someday, apostle Peter.

455
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,840
 And as he's talking to him, he's kind of just like walking around.

456
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,480
 He starts kind of dragging his foot in the dirt.

457
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,120
 And the angels don't really pick up on what he's doing.

458
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,960
 But apparently they can't look down.

459
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,520
 I didn't know that angels can't lower their gaze.

460
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,000
 He draws a circle around him in the dirt with his foot.

461
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,600
 And then as they're just still having this casual conversation,

462
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,880
 he interrupts them and goes, by the power of God, reveal these creatures to me.

463
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,040
 And then it turns out,

464
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,360
 I don't know if there was any special effects or anything like that,

465
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,200
 but that did deserve a sound effect.

466
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,000
 It turns out that these were not angels.

467
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,400
 They were actually demons.

468
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,560
 These seven angels were demons, which is what a demon is.

469
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,360
 A demon is a fallen angel, and that's what these guys are.

470
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,280
 But he goes, okay guys, what's the first off that fist bump belongs to me?

471
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,800
 And they're like, okay, sorry.

472
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,520
 He goes, secondly, reveal yourselves.

473
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,560
 Because a demon actually giving you its name is,

474
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,960
 I could almost do a whole episode on names.

475
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,280
 I've actually thought about doing an episode on that,

476
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,760
 or maybe at least a segment on the power of names.

477
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,800
 But getting a name from a demon, because it goes deep,

478
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,760
 it goes deeper than this,

479
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,160
 but getting the name of a demon is really important to being able to defeat them.

480
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,240
 In this case, he's getting their sins, what they represent.

481
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,440
 So you have all these demons, and he goes, what do you, who are you?

482
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,240
 And the first demon goes, I'm the demon of deception.

483
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,920
 The next one was the demon of lust.

484
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,280
 Then we had the demon of falsehood standing there.

485
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,040
 You don't know if he's telling the truth.

486
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,000
 He's like, I'm the demon of falsehood as I shift from side to side.

487
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,040
 The demon of adultery, the demon of greed, the demon of slander.

488
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,560
 There's a lot of liars in that group,

489
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:13,360
 which would actually make sense because they are coming to deceive people.

490
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,240
 So you would want to bring down your deception A team.

491
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,600
 You'd want to bring down deception, falsehood, and slander.

492
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,520
 And then you got greed, adultery, and lust, you know,

493
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,520
 just so the weakens aren't boring.

494
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,880
 That's your dream team, but there's seven angels standing there.

495
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,720
 And six of them have admitted what they are demons of.

496
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,720
 The last demon standing there and Peter goes, hey, so who are you?

497
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,960
 And that demon goes, hey man, what's going on?

498
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,840
 Why are you picking on us?

499
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,360
 Peter's like, what are you, what are you, because you guys are demons.

500
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,960
 The war in heaven, don't you guys remember that?

501
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,080
 It was like yesterday for you.

502
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,520
 It's been millions of years for us.

503
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,520
 Demon goes, no, no, no, no, no, no.

504
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,840
 Why do demons get treated so badly?

505
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,800
 See, you don't understand.

506
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,720
 You don't understand what it's like to be a demon.

507
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:04,000
 He says, I'm going to paraphrase here, but this demon says, listen,

508
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,240
 God loves humans.

509
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,760
 And no matter what you do, he accepts you into the kingdom.

510
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,960
 You guys can be prostitutes.

511
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,080
 You guys can be tax collectors, because back then that was the bad thing.

512
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,920
 IRS is not me.

513
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,360
 He specifically names prostitutes, tax collectors,

514
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,400
 deniers, blasphemers, slanderers.

515
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,560
 He will invite them into the kingdom.

516
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,560
 Why not us?

517
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,800
 Why not us?

518
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,480
 He goes, listen, there's so many Christians now.

519
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,560
 There's not even enough souls to corrupt.

520
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,840
 Why are we being picked on?

521
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,600
 People make their own choices.

522
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,200
 They were given free will.

523
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,640
 By God.

524
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,040
 He goes, if they are allowed into heaven, why aren't demons?

525
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,240
 Why don't we get to repent?

526
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:03,440
 A tax collector after doing his job and working for 20 years for the US government and retiring

527
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:09,120
 on the last day he's alive, he can repent for all those times that he's sent Jason,

528
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,160
 those letters about leans and levies.

529
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:17,360
 And he'll go to heaven, but me, a simple demon, will never go to heaven.

530
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,800
 Why?

531
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,920
 It's not fair that God favors humans.

532
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,600
 It's just not fair.

533
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,480
 And he goes, God gave humans free will.

534
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,160
 They make their own decisions.

535
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:32,640
 Sure, we may tempt them, but they decide to do it.

536
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,560
 They make the choice.

537
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,440
 And yet, they still find paradise.

538
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,320
 That's ridiculous.

539
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,560
 It's not fair, Peter.

540
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,560
 I'm not giving you my name.

541
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,720
 I'm not telling you what type of demon I am.

542
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,680
 It's not fair that we are locked out of heaven.

543
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:54,640
 And Peter stands there and he's looking at this demon.

544
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,640
 And in a Sixth Demonic Friend stand behind him,

545
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:04,080
 Peter races the circle he's drawn in the sand, turns and walks away.

546
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,880
 He lets the demons go.

547
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,600
 Fascinating story.

548
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,000
 And it's something that I've actually talked about on this show before, way early on,

549
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,720
 can demons be redeemed?

550
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,800
 And in early Christian theology, the theory was yes, they can.

551
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:28,720
 And this ties into the story with Roma Zeno, because could someone like that,

552
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,120
 could a cryptid, could a spirit be redeemed?

553
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,120
 This is the same thing.

554
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:40,160
 There is in the Islamic tradition a story of Jinn hearing the Prophet Muhammad speak the Quran

555
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,880
 and they convert to Islam.

556
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,400
 So you do have that in the Islamic religion.

557
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:51,760
 In the early Christian religion, you had philosophers say yes, yes, it is possible

558
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,400
 that demons can convert to Christianity.

559
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,800
 Then we get to Saint Thomas Aquinas.

560
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,080
 This was a terrifying way to look at it.

561
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,440
 He says demons have ultimate knowledge.

562
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,880
 They know everything.

563
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,880
 And humans don't.

564
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:12,240
 So when you make a decision, when you make a decision to eat a barrel of ice cream,

565
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,400
 whole barrel like eight gallons of it, I guess a better example other than that would be something

566
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,600
 like drinking and driving.

567
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:24,080
 Like you know the risks involved, but if you knew for a certainty, 100% if you drink and drive

568
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,800
 two night, you will run over a young boy.

569
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,200
 You know that for a fact, then you wouldn't do it.

570
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,760
 You may take that risk, but humans don't know the future.

571
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,200
 He goes, demons do.

572
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,760
 Demons know the second when they decided to rebel against God, they knew exactly how the

573
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,400
 story would end.

574
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:48,080
 Therefore they cannot be redeemed because they have ultimate knowledge because they know everything.

575
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,800
 Their free will he defined as instantaneous and final.

576
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,480
 They knew the outcome the second they made the decision.

577
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,640
 We can have possible outcomes.

578
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,560
 If I ask this girl out, these possible things may happen, but you don't know the future.

579
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,120
 They do.

580
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,720
 Therefore they can never be forgiven.

581
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,960
 That's actually terrifying, honestly.

582
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:17,360
 Like to have that level of knowledge, you'd almost not want to make any decision, but

583
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,720
 then even that would be a decision in and of itself to not make any decision.

584
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,480
 I find the idea though of can demons be redeemed.

585
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,160
 I read a horrible story the other day.

586
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,880
 It was about this guy, he was a congressional staffer.

587
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,120
 Congressional staffer, he was also a pro-life advocate.

588
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,520
 So he was doing these speeches against abortion.

589
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,720
 Every baby is precious and needs to be saved.

590
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,840
 He was recently arrested with baby child pornography.

591
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:53,520
 It's bizarre to think that that man can be redeemed and go to heaven and a demon can't.

592
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,840
 Because that's a demonic act.

593
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,160
 That's a demonic act that a human is choosing to do.

594
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:04,640
 And I find that so odd.

595
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,000
 I find that such an odd

596
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,440
 decision for reality to be made like that.

597
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,960
 I mean if you don't believe in religion or the afterlife or stuff like that then

598
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,880
 this is just a fun little ghost story.

599
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,360
 You're like that last part wasn't fun, but you know what I mean?

600
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,640
 But if you are religious, those are the quandaries that religious people look at.

601
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:31,600
 Like if this guy does believe and is redeemed, he gets to go to heaven.

602
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,160
 But this demon, this demon who's the tax collector demon,

603
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:44,320
 the fraud demon from the year 1300 who was like "oh yeah, you should collect extra taxes from that

604
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,560
 surf." That guy doesn't get to go to heaven.

605
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,360
 That demon can never be redeemed and go to heaven.

606
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,800
 But this sicko can.

607
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,560
 That's an interesting question.

608
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,640
 And I don't have an answer for it.

609
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,600
 I would like to see that demons could go to heaven.

610
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:06,240
 And I would like to see Lucifer apologize and go to heaven.

611
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,800
 To me I think the greatest future is a future of an empty hell.

612
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,120
 Nobody's there.

613
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,320
 Everyone is lifted up.

614
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,360
 And you know the thing with religion, a lot of times you end up kind of interpreting it

615
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,400
 yourself and you don't know how accurate it is and things like that.

616
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,960
 But that's always been my hope.

617
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,480
 Like I like researching all this spooky stuff, but it would be dope that at the end of the story

618
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,680
 everyone is together.

619
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:38,080
 It's me and you and Mormon Bigfoot and Roma Zeno's running around and then we're like walking

620
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,040
 through paradise.

621
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:44,640
 We're walking through this beautiful afterlife and we see like seven demons standing out in

622
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,760
 the corner and I'm like "hey those those those less demons from that episode I did,

623
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,400
 now we're on episode 10,000 before I died."

624
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,120
 But we hold up a little toast to that dude.

625
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,120
 That would be great.

626
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,640
 That would be great.

627
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,600
 Is it possible?

628
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,160
 Who knows.

629
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,640
 The apostle Peter showed these demons mercy.

630
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,160
 And even though this isn't an official book of the Bible, maybe it should be.
