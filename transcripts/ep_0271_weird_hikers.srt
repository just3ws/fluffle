1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Was there a pope who became a vampire?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 And then we take a look at an odd phenomenon.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Is there really an issue of hikers miles up into the wilderness,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 stumbling across perfectly dressed and clean people hiking next to them?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Just a few quick notes before we get started.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Yesterday it was the episode the Jimmy World Death Cult Conspiracy.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 And I said a few times in the episode, "I don't know. I can't find the actual website."

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 And two listeners did. Two listeners were able to find the website where people were talking about this conspiracy.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 One of them was no on Twitter and the other one was Dave via email.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 So I'll update the show notes, but for right now if you go to my Twitter, I've retweeted that tweet.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 And you know, I recommend getting a follow on us on Twitter anyways @DeadRabbitRadio

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 because that's where I'm going to start posting the fan art.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 I have a bunch of fan art that's been sent.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Never really had a place to put it @DeadRabbitRadio and also on Instagram @DeadRabbitRadio there as well.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 But let's go ahead and get started with the episode and thanks guys for finding that link.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 The first story we're going to look at is a re- both stories today are actually requests.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 The first story we're looking at though was requested via Gmail by Gary.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 And Gary sent me an intriguing little story about Pope Innocent the 8th.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 He was made Pope back in 1484. It was a super contentious like Pope thing

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 where they have all the people that go and like light the smoke and they pick a new Pope.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 I know how much the Catholics just pulled their hair out because they skipped like a hundred different steps.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Everyone wanted their own Pope and Pope Innocent the 8th was the compromise Pope.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 He was the milk toast Pope and he came in, he's doing his Pope stuff,

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 got on his Pope robes, starting all this stuff.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Notable for a few funny things and then one quite grim one.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 One, so the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire hated his brother because his brother kept trying to overthrow him.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 And his brother got kidnapped or got captured would be a better term.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 They didn't like breaking his house and steal him. It was during a battle they caught him.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 And then the Pope came in a possession of the Sultan's brother.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 And the Sultan said, "Listen dude, I really don't like my brother. I will pay you to keep him prisoner. Please don't release him."

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 The Pope's like, "Yeah, sure, you know whatever. I got it because you know he's Italian. He's a Guido."

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Straight up, I want you to imagine Pope Innocent the 8th as the situation from Jersey Short.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 That's how you got to picture him now.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Now the Catholics have actually turned off the episode.

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 But he's wearing his big Pope hat and then no shirt.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 He's just this muscular Pope walking around. He's like, "Yo, I got you. I got you, Sultan."

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 And to make it more, that's just funny. I think it would be funny if your brother got kidnapped or captured and you're like, "Keep him.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 I will pay a ransom that you don't let him go."

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 This was the ransom though. Totally shocking. 120,000 crowns. You only have one head.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 What are you going to do with all those crowns?

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 An annual fee, I know it's currency. An annual fee of 45,000 ducats.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 And on top of that, the Sultan's like, "Oh, here's a bunch of crowns. There's a bunch of these gold coins.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Showering them on the situation. He's dancing. Here's a bunch of ducats.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 And oh, by the way, here you can have this back too."

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 And he gives them the lance that spears Jesus' side.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 The Sultan's like, "Oh yeah, remember that thing that killed your god? Yeah, I have it. Do you want that?

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 I'll give it to you. Just keep my brother prisoner."

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 And the Pope's like, "Yeah, totally. I'll take that. Plus all this money."

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 He also has an interesting connection to topics of the show, this Pope.

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Because he was the dude who this, there's this German witch hunter who was like,

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 "I gotta be able to kill all these witches."

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 And the priests in Germany were like, "That's stupid."

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Like, "No, we're not going to give you authority to walk around burning witches and stuff like that."

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 So he wrote to the Pope and the Pope wrote a bowl, which is like a papal decree, saying,

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 "Yeah, dude, we should totally kill all these witches. That's a great idea. And do what this guy says."

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 And it's interesting because even though the Pope was saying it, the German administration,

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 or the German popes, not popes, the German bishops were still like,

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 "We're still not comfortable with that."

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 And that German hunter was the guy who ended up writing the Malleus Malifekarum,

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 which means "witch's hammer" or "hammer of the witches."

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 And it's a book on how to identify a witch and then how to kill a witch.

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 It's really dope. I've actually never read it. I've always wanted to.

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 I have a copy of it, an electronic copy of it somewhere, but it's basically a witch hunter's guidebook.

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 It goes over stuff like how witches recruit.

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 They make stuff go wrong in a woman's life and then the woman will come to them for help.

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 But let's get to the meat of the matter, the bloody, bloody meat of the matter.

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 The situation, you may say, is that Pope Innocent VIII is most famously known for being

72
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 the person who got the first blood transfusion.

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Now, it's 1492 at this point and he gets a fever.

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 A fever in 1492 would be the equivalent of cancer today.

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 I mean, you did not want to get sick in any way, shape, or form back then.

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 He gets a fever and he's like, "I'm just not feeling good, Doc. I'm not feeling good."

77
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Now, his doctor was this Jewish dude and the Jewish guy goes, "I have the perfect solution to this.

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 I have the perfect solution to this, your majesty or whatever you call a pope.

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Your holiness, that's what they call him.

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Anyways, I now have no Catholic listeners at all.

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 But the Jewish dude runs away and the pope is sitting there just sweating buckets.

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 He's like, "I hope he has a good plan. I'm so hot."

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 A Jewish dude comes back with three 10-year-old boys and the pope's like,

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 "This doesn't look good. This is not a good scene I want to be in the pope's looking for a way to leave."

85
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 He's too sick to leave, though.

86
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 And the Jewish dude, the Jewish doctor says,

87
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 "Okay, so this is what I'm going to do."

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Now, this is where the story-- there's-- the reason why I keep saying that he's Jewish isn't that?

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Because it's relevant to the story. I'm not just like, "That's a Jew."

90
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 It's relevant to the story where we're going with this.

91
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 He brings in the three young boys.

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Pope sweating even more now. He's like, "Ugh, hope there's not a journalist nearby."

93
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 And the Jewish doctor says, "I see what we're going to do."

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 And the story diverges a bit here.

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 They're either going to take a little bit of the blood out of the boys and the pope's going to drink it,

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 or they're going to take a little bit of blood out of the boys and the pope's going to bathe in it,

97
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 or they're going to kill the boys and the pope's going to drink the blood or bathe in the blood.

98
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 So there's basically four variations of it. All of them involve 10-year-old boys and blood.

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Gary mentioned that a lamb was used in this procedure as well.

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 I couldn't find that. I couldn't find that.

101
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 So I'm thinking there's even more variations out there that a lamb was also bled for this.

102
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 And there's questions of whether or not the kids were paid money or were kidnapped.

103
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 But the point of the matter is, however they got there,

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 we have in a room a pope, three 10-year-old boys and a Jewish doctor,

105
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 and the pope begins taking in the blood of the kids.

106
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 The idea is that their young, healthy blood will nourish the pope and he'll get back on top.

107
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 His fever will go away and he'll be fine.

108
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 And the boys will go off and be fine as well.

109
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Let's assume the most traditional version is he drank the blood of the boys.

110
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 And the boys volunteered and they were supposed to survive this procedure.

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 But what we know for a fact is the pope didn't survive at all.

112
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 The pope ended up dying and that's really the only factual thing we know about it.

113
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 There is disputes. People say that the story itself is an anti-Semitic rumor

114
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 that the Jewish - he really did have a Jewish doctor apparently -

115
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 but after he died, people started this rumor that the Jewish doctor came up with this crazy ritual

116
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 to keep him alive by drinking or bathing in the blood of these little boys.

117
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 And it was something that went around Europe to again show how evil Jewish people were.

118
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 I'm not saying that.

119
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 I'm saying that that was the general consensus of Europe at the time.

120
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 Because there was a lot of rumors about Jewish people kidnapping Christian babies

121
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 and using their blood for the Passover bread.

122
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 But oddly enough, I heard a version of this where the three kids were Jewish.

123
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 So he's bringing Jewish kids and then the pope's drinking Jewish blood.

124
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 I don't know, but anyways, the point of the matter is that for hundreds of years,

125
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 the story went around that this pope was the recipient of the first blood transfusion

126
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 or more likely in their terminology - the pope was a vampire.

127
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 The pope was drinking human blood to try to live longer

128
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 and he died and the kids died and the Jewish guy was behind all of it and it was this horrible thing.

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 Today, researchers don't know whether or not the pope actually did any of this.

130
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 It's possible that it really happened and they just - people were like,

131
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 "Oh, this is a perfect opportunity to bash them Jews," and then they just started rolling with it.

132
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Nobody knows for sure.

133
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 But this story has a really, really interesting footnote.

134
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 So Pope Innocent VIII died in July of 1492.

135
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 You understand?

136
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 I mean, that's when Christopher Columbus discovered America, right?

137
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 I think everybody - probably every American - maybe not everybody.

138
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 I don't think people in Paraguay are like, "Oh, yeah, 1492."

139
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 1492 is the year that Columbus discovered America, right?

140
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Right?

141
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 I'm trying to think of that Amy Grant song.

142
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 I didn't mention that.

143
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 But I'm trying to think, in the year of 1492 when Columbus sailed the oceans blue,

144
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 had he landed on India shore, you never would have come to walk on my door.

145
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 I think for - well, anyways, the point is in 1492 - that's from the song Galileo -

146
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 in 1492 is when - now I gotta look it up.

147
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Okay, so yeah, he discovered it in 1492.

148
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 So the Pope dies in July of 1492.

149
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Let me get to the point here.

150
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 The Pope dies in July of 1492, and on his tombstone there's this inscription.

151
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 It says, "During his pontificate, the glory of the discovery of a new world."

152
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 So he was remembered for that.

153
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 He was the Pope who was around when Columbus discovered America.

154
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 But this is what's weird.

155
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 He died seven days before Columbus even set sail from Spain.

156
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 This isn't a history podcast.

157
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 The point is that he died seven days before Columbus ever even set sail.

158
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 He would have died before there was even a hint that Columbus had discovered a new land mass.

159
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 And so what researchers are looking at this at, because the inscription wasn't made way later after Columbus had come back and all that stuff,

160
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 the inscription was made when he died.

161
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 Researchers have looked at it and thought, "We may have gotten the date of Christopher Columbus's journey wrong.

162
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 We believe that this inscription was done when he passed away,

163
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 but history may be wrong as far as when Christopher Columbus actually discovered America."

164
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 This little 11-word epitaph could actually rewrite history.

165
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Or Pope Innocent VIII?

166
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Vampire.

167
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 He's like a time-traveling vampire.

168
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 I guess you'd have to be a time-traveling vampire too, but what if it worked?

169
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 No, never mind. He died. The kids died, whatever.

170
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 But yeah, that's one more mystery. The Pope leaves us with one more mystery.

171
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 All we have truly is a dead pope, a gravesite, a rumor of drinking young boy's blood, and a mystery that still endures today.

172
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 Pope Innocent VIII? Vampire? Time-traveler?

173
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Or just a guy who liked to drink blood?

174
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 Okay, I guess he didn't like to drink blood. He kind of had to.

175
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 And this whole made-up problem is probably all made up anyways.

176
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story here.

177
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Our next story is actually also a request, and I want to preface it by saying this.

178
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 I don't want to seem like I'm beating a dead horse, and you'll know what I mean in a bit.

179
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 But I feel like I might be beating a dead horse, but let's go ahead and get started with this, though.

180
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 This is a request via Gmail from Jimmy. Thanks for the request.

181
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Jimmy sent me this request asking to talk about hikers.

182
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 Well, let me go ahead and get into it. You're walking through the woods.

183
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Uh, uh, uh, you're apparently eight years old, and you make noises when you walk.

184
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 You're walking through the woods. You've been hiking for hours, and you're all dirty flies flying around you.

185
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 You're not pigpen, okay? You're not filthy, but you're walking through the forest.

186
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 You got your walking stick, and you got your little socks that you can't see, like the no-show socks are totally lame.

187
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 I hate those, but you're wearing- you're wearing those. I'm not. I'm wearing normal socks.

188
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 I'm next to you. You're super cool. And you're just walking there, like, "Oh, Jason, why can I not have your clothes?"

189
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Oh, by the way, dead rabbit radio merchandise. Check it out. Show notes below.

190
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Buy some merchandise. You can take that on the next hike.

191
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 We're walking through- we're hiking through the woods, and I'm joshing you about your clothes.

192
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 I'm like pushing you down in the mud. You're like, "I'm gonna stop listening to your podcast."

193
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 I help you back up, clean you off. But now I'm getting dirty, too, because we've been walking for a while, and I feel bad.

194
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 I was pushing you down. We're walking through the woods, and while you're quietly plotting your revenge against me,

195
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 while you're quietly waiting us for- for us to reach the cliffside so you can push me off and make it look like an accident,

196
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 we see a man at the end of the trail. And you're like, "Huh?"

197
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 And I'm like, "Oh, my grinder-wraps." No, no, no. So we see a man at the edge of the trail, and we're both like, "What?"

198
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 That's bizarre. We both look at each other. Now, we're filthy. We're, like, dirty, and, like, we're all muddy.

199
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 I don't go hiking. I don't know how much filth people get on them when they actually hike.

200
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 I imagine you come out looking like swamp thing. I mean, I've walked trails, but I've never actually gone, like,

201
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 multiple-day hiking. I imagine you're just, like, super, like, gross when you come out, right?

202
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 But anyways, we see this through to the end of the trail, and we're all dirty. But he's not.

203
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 He's actually very well-dressed, like, nice, clean shorts and shoes. Shoe's don't look dirty at all.

204
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Totally. You know what a clean person looks like. You don't have to explain a clean person.

205
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 We're in the middle of nowhere, okay? It's me and you. We're in the middle of nowhere. This super clean dude pops out of the bushes and just

206
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 stands at the end of the trail. Now, we want to be polite, so we walk by and we go, "Hey, how you doing?"

207
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 And you're like, "Help me. He just pushed me into the bushes. He's gonna hurt me if you don't."

208
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 But we just keep walking by, 'cause he doesn't respond to us at all. And we turn around and he's still just kind of walking there,

209
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 walking on the trail, totally clean. Weird look on his face. We just continue on our journey until you do find that cliff

210
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 and you push me off and I plummet to my death in this version of the story. But now we're back in reality where we're sitting around

211
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 talking about this story. This is weird, okay? This is totally gone off the rails. The point of the story is this.

212
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 This is what Jimmy sent to me. Thanks, Jimmy. There's this crop of sightings of people, very well-dressed people in the middle of nowhere,

213
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 and not just like they're fashionably dressed in their hiking clothes. They look like they haven't been hiking at all.

214
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 This all started, as far as I can tell. This all started on a Reddit thread. This dude posted this thing saying,

215
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 "Hey, guys, I was on this Missing 411 video." Missing 411 is the conspiracy theory that people go out in the woods

216
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 and they just mysteriously vanish. It was popularized by David Palades. And he seems to think it's Bigfoot.

217
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 A lot of other people have taken with it and run and said it's interdimensional portals or aliens and stuff like that.

218
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 But anyways, Missing 411 is a collection of stories of people missing in national parks and the National Park Forest Service

219
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Industrial Complex is trying to have this conspiracy of silence so if you go missing in the park, nobody ever finds out.

220
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 That's Missing 411 in a nutshell. This Reddit poster says, "I was on a Missing 411 video and I saw these comments."

221
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 And he has these comments copied and pasted. There's a person named Pete Johnson who was a 50-year-old hiker

222
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 and had noticed that he'd been hiking for a long, long time, not in one particular hike, like throughout the years.

223
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 He was an avid hiker, is what I'm looking for. He had run into clean-looking people in the middle of nowhere.

224
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 He goes, "Trails that I would have a hard time getting to and I'd be all dirty. I'd turn a corner and there'd be someone very well dressed in front of me."

225
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 They didn't seem lost. They didn't seem tired, which I thought was weird too, because I was super, like, you know, like, super exhausted.

226
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 And he said they all looked to be over 40 years old.

227
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 He found another comment on the video agreeing with Pete saying he had seen the same thing, and then he found one more comment from a guy named Anders D.

228
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Who said that he was a "wild crafter" or whatever. There's a stupid name for every hobby out there.

229
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Sorry if you enjoy wild crafting. What a-- That's Jets, sounds like. A card from Magic the Gathering.

230
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Anyways, anyways, this guy says he's a "wild crafter." It just means he, like, collects herbs and roots.

231
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 But he likes to get herbs and roots, like, on the side of cliffs and stuff like that.

232
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 It sounds like more he's trying to find a reason to not go home to his wife.

233
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 So he made up a hobby and says, "Oh yeah, but it's super hard. It's dangerous too if I ever fake my death.

234
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 I mean, if I ever actually die." It's because I was wild crafting. But anyways, he grabs roots and berries and stuff.

235
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 He's basically his hobby is being a bear. So this guy climbs up mountains and eats-- doesn't eat him.

236
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 He gets roots and berries and stuff. I don't know what he does with him, actually.

237
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 He gets roots and berries. He says that he looks for ginseng and rare medicinal plants.

238
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 Whatever. Go to G and C. And he will climb up a mountain. He'll be all sweaty.

239
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 He'll climb up the mountain. He'll turn and there'll be a middle-aged, well-dressed dude just sitting there.

240
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 No equipment, no hiking equipment or anything. Calm, blank face, not sweaty at all.

241
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 And Anders is just like, "Raaah!" He's like a bear. He basically-- his hobby is a bear, so when in danger he reacts as a bear.

242
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 Now, he didn't actually crowd the guy, but the point being is that this guy on Reddit says, "I found these comments on a video."

243
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 He posts that comment-- oh, he posts these three comments on "The Truth Is Here." It's a Reddit board.

244
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 And people immediately are intrigued by it. I was intrigued by it. I go, "Whoa, that's really fascinating."

245
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 Of course, my skeptic mind is starting to rev up while I'm reading this stuff, but I'm still kind of reading through the comments

246
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 and people are like, "Whoa, dude, that's awesome. Like, this is so creepy. Like, you're in the middle."

247
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Because anything out of the ordinary is creepy.

248
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 If you're walking through a toy store and you go through an aisle of dolls, you're like, "That's not creepy," because dolls are supposed to be there.

249
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 But if you are walking home and in the middle of the sidewalk is a doll, that's a little more creepy, because you think, "Well, maybe a kid dropped a doll or something like that."

250
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 But if you go home and you don't have kids, you turn on your light and you walk in your bedroom and there's a doll on your bed, that's creepy.

251
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 And it's the exact same item each time. A well-dressed person walking down the street is not spooky.

252
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 A well-dressed person walking through farmland is a little more weird.

253
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Like, if you're doing your farm stuff, you got your sickle and you're cutting down wheat, I've never been on a farm, and you're doing that.

254
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 And then a well-dressed man pops up and is like, "Whoa, you almost hit me." That would be weird. It would be extremely weird.

255
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 But if you're up in the middle of nowhere climbing mountains pretending to be a bear, like, onters here, and you ran into a well-dressed guy,

256
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 "Oh, and by the way, the doll's right behind you. Don't look, but it's right behind you."

257
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 But enjoy the rest of this podcast as the doll's walking up behind you. Where has it gone with this?

258
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So anyways, the Reddit post starts, people are like, "Whoa, dude, that's totally trippy, man."

259
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 And then some--well, it was really weird, because the original poster was like, "Yeah, that is quite--it's quite illuminating the human condition."

260
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 He was kind of commenting on what people were saying. And other people start commenting, and they're like,

261
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 "I was hiking. I looked up in the tree, and there was a man wearing wool slacks sitting in the tree."

262
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 And I ran away. People were like, "Oh, it's creepy. That could have just been a backpack or something like that. Someone who got lost."

263
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 And then other--because, you know, the wool slacks, I imagine they look like a hobo.

264
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 And then other people, though, were like, "Yeah, that's weird. I once was also hiking, and I ran into, like, a well-dressed person in middle of nowhere."

265
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 And then they said, "But they were probably just hiking. It was a nice outfit."

266
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 Everyone else was kind of--they were intrigued by the idea, but even the ones who'd seen stuff like it, they thought it's weird,

267
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 but they weren't assigning any sort of sinisterness to it. Just--it was a weird experience.

268
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 So it seemed that the thread was going pretty normally at this point.

269
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 You have a guy making outrageous statement, a lot of people were buying Inuit,

270
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 and then a few people were sharing their own experiences with it as well.

271
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 And then this young woman jumps in, and she says, "Oh, yeah, it was really weird. Once, me and my boyfriend were hiking."

272
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 And I saw this Persian man walking the opposite side of the trail. He was wearing a suit, and he was smoking a cigar.

273
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 And this is where the thread really goes off the rails.

274
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 And this is where I said, "I feel like I'm kind of beaten a dead horse with the recent stories I've done."

275
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 I feel like maybe I've become a little too skeptical, but it really is just me simply strolling down the page and reading every entry.

276
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 She said, "I was hiking with my boyfriend. I saw a Persian guy in a suit with a cigar he walked past us. He didn't say anything."

277
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 And the original poster goes, "That sounds made up." And everyone else goes, "That's what this thread's about."

278
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 Like, you're talking about people in the middle of nowhere, and this woman saying she found something similar to it,

279
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 and you're saying that you said it's made up. Like, where's this coming from?

280
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 At that point, the dude totally flips out on the Reddit page. The stuff will be available.

281
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 And then he starts accusing people of not finding... I'm trying to figure out the best way to put this.

282
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 He start... People start to say, "If I was walking, if I was hiking in the middle of nowhere and I saw a well-dressed person in the middle of nowhere,

283
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 I would say hi to them." And he just flips out. He flips out at the idea that you should be able to talk to a well-dressed person in the middle of nowhere.

284
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 And so he says this. This is one of his quotes, one of his great quotes.

285
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 "You see people as their appearances. Simply because the people are well-dressed and clean, you think this means they're safe to talk to?

286
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 You're superficial. This is precisely why they are not safe to speak to.

287
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 The person who was safe to speak to in this is someone as tired and dirty as you are."

288
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 People are like, "What in the world?" The post literally was like, "Why didn't anyone ever try saying hi to these people?"

289
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Like, having a conversation with them. And he flips out. Because if you're dirty, you can only talk to other dirty people.

290
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 And then this started a whole thing. And it ended with him, this is probably one of my favorite quotes over the course of this show.

291
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 This lunatic on Reddit trying to defend himself that if you are dirty, you shouldn't talk to clean people.

292
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 If you are clean, you can talk to clean people. If you're dirty, you can talk to dirty people.

293
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 But if you're dirty and you see a clean person, that means they're sinister. This is my favorite quote.

294
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 This one guy, this is in reply to a comment basically saying, "If I ran into a guy well dressed in the middle of the woods, I would say, 'Hello, I would talk to him.'"

295
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 This guy's response, "You do you, man. If you want to behave that way in situations, go ahead.

296
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 But I will be the first to inform you that you're not privy to how existence works.

297
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 You have a very sheltered life where you believe you're on top of the food chain? You're not. You're just in the middle of the cattle herd, blocked by other cattle from the wolves."

298
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 [cow mooing]

299
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 You go out in nature and act like everything else is a cow. You're gonna get ripped apart.

300
00:23:45,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 And your mind the whole time will be going, "OMG, this is so unfair! OMG, why are my intestines being ripped out? I thought I was important. Why is this person abducting me? Doesn't he know how important and smart I am?"

301
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 This dude obviously has some issues. First off, nobody cries out, "OMG, my intestines are getting ripped out."

302
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 But I love it. That's this guy's escalation. Someone goes, "Why don't you talk to the guy in the business soon?"

303
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 He goes, "You know what? You listen to me. I know the rules of the road, kid. You talk to those clean people. You'll be like my intestines are getting ripped out."

304
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 Anyways, anyways, anyways. He ends up deleting his account. So this guy is a ghost. Not literally. That would be cool. But he doesn't exist on Reddit anymore.

305
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 He's probably changed his name to World Craftery. Oh, and that was another thing. So me, being me, I looked for those YouTube accounts of the "Onders" guy in the Pete Johnson.

306
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 And there's a couple other names in his original posts. They don't exist on YouTube. So they couldn't comment on a YouTube video.

307
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 I checked for them as Reddit users. They don't exist on Reddit. He never said the name of the missing 4-0-1 video, so we can never verify where he actually got these comments.

308
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 I couldn't verify that people existed at all. So it's a hoax, right?

309
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Well, a lot of the stories I've been doing recently, I've been able to pretty aggressively debunk. And I was hoping to find one that I couldn't.

310
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Which is a tall order, I get that.

311
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 And this one kind of straddles in between the two, because obviously this maniac's rant teens are easily debunked. There's no proof these people existed.

312
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 And when this one girl told a story similar to his, he totally lost it and then went off on this whole thing about how clean people are evil.

313
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 But what makes it a little bit harder? His nonsense is debunked. But what I find interesting is, there were other people in the thread saying they had similar experiences.

314
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 I'm skeptical about a lot of things. One of the things I do, it's probably one of the more nonsensical things I believe in, is I do believe in stuff like

315
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 dimensional portals and time portals and people out of place and time, people disappearing in one location, reappearing in another.

316
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 I believe a lot of those accounts actually can be chalked up to rational answers, but I just have a belief that those things exist.

317
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 I think it is possible that these people are here from somewhere else. Again, it sounds completely ridiculous.

318
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 Most likely, the other people who are commenting, not this crazy guy, but the other people who are commenting on the thread, saw something that was unusual.

319
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 They remarked on it because it was so unusual, but it had a rational answer. A guy in a business suit was just walking through the woods.

320
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 It's possible that these people came from alternate dimensions or time travel and they were lost and that's why they looked so weird.

321
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 That's why they weren't talking to anybody. But there was one more comment on this Reddit thread I wanted to talk about in the episode like this.

322
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 There was one comment that went pretty much unnoticed throughout the whole crazy discussion.

323
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 I even didn't notice it the first time I read the thread. It wasn't until I went back and was taking notes that I realized the significance of it.

324
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 There's one answer to what this is that provides both a rational explanation and a sinister one.

325
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 This person on the Reddit thread said, "What if these people are the reason why they're out in the middle of nowhere and they don't look like they've hiked there?

326
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 They just seem to appear there and they don't want to talk to you. They seem to have an air about them that they don't want to talk to you."

327
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 What if they just emerged from some sort of secret underground facility?

328
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 That actually is a perfect answer. It's not the most likely because then we have to believe in these underground facilities.

329
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 But I do. I don't know about the sprawling alien infested... Actually, I know that's not true, but there's that whole alien infested subway system underneath Dulce Air Force Base.

330
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 And there's a bunch of aliens are shooting humans down there, something like that. I don't believe that's the right word at all.

331
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 But I do believe that there are massive underground facilities all over, and I believe also there would be privately owned underground facilities as well.

332
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 If you wanted to do any sort of experimentation or work with any sort of technology that you didn't want Prion Eyes to see, there's no better place to do it than underground.

333
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 That actually would explain why someone, why you're hiking for hours and you turn a corner and there's a guy standing there in a suit, or very, very well-addressed and not dirty, and just seems to be looking off into the distance, not wanting to interact with you in any sort of way.

334
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 They just came out for a breath of fresh air because the mutants that they're creating, you know, ten feet away in the hidden door underneath the underbrush, are clawing up their comrades.

335
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 They're like, "I need to smoke rake!" while the mutilations go on and then the marines will go in and take care of them.

336
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 It's an interesting answer for a question that I never knew existed until Jimmy sent me the email.

337
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 Nature terrifies me. I don't like nature. I don't like the wilderness at all. I think it's super spooky.

338
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 And when you start to have little pieces of civilization pop up in the middle of them, it actually makes it creepier.

339
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 A shack in the middle of the woods is far creepier than just the woods.

340
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 So I understand why a well-dressed, civilized, clean person in the middle of nowhere is unsettling.

341
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 And I think it's unsettling to everybody. It just seems so out of place.

342
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 So the next time you are hiking up that long, dusty trail, birds chirp and nearby, deer, eating some leaves or something, whatever deers eat,

343
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 or walking through the woods all by yourself enjoying God's splendor, or just nature if you're an atheist,

344
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 be careful of the next corner you turn. There may be a man standing there who's well-dressed, looking off into the distance.

345
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 You may be daring enough to say hi and start a conversation with him.

346
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 But after you get a few words out, you realize that civilized is the last thing this man is.

347
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 And as you're being dragged into that deep underground base hidden from all eyes, all you can think of is, "Oh my God, why are my intestines being ripped out?"

348
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 I thought I was important.

349
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:49,000
