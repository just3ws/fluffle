1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 An ancient African cryptid that still stalks the land today.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,320
 And the dumbest cult you've ever heard of today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:17,080
 Hey, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,040
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,880
 I hope you're having a great day.

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,040
 By the time you hear this, I will be on vacation.

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,200
 I'm actually already on vacation, but I'll be actually like physically on vacation.

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,280
 I'll be visiting my family.

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,640
 So that'll be fun.

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,560
 It shouldn't affect the really schedule, but I'll get into that as we record some more episodes.

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,200
 If I do have to take a week off, I'll let you guys know ahead of time.

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,800
 So I watch YouTube a lot. We've talked about that before.

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,960
 I don't really watch television.

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,320
 I usually watch movies that I have that I've never seen.

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,960
 I'm not a big rewatcher of movies, unless it's an amazing film.

16
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,440
 I watch a lot of YouTube, though.

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,400
 I recently started watching this channel called Mr. Gigi.

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,680
 And I found him the way that I think most people found him

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:04,720
 was because he did this overview kind of compilation of to catch a predator videos,

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,960
 where he basically like gives commentary and he's talking trash about the predators and all that stuff.

21
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,480
 And talks about Chris Hansen.

22
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,720
 And I've watched those videos actually probably all the way through twice.

23
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,440
 It's just a nice kind of like a when I watch YouTube,

24
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,760
 I kind of have it on in the background while I'm doing something else.

25
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,640
 Unless I'm watching something that needs 100% of my attention.

26
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,480
 If it's just someone talking like this podcast,

27
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,880
 I just kind of have it on in the background while I'm doing something else.

28
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,640
 Now, it's funny because Mr. Gigi, he's really good at what he does.

29
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,080
 He's this young man who just takes these to catch a predator videos and talks trash about them.

30
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,520
 And it's funny because I watch him.

31
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,320
 And then of course, you know, recommend a video as pop up.

32
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,000
 And there's this YouTube channel called Pop Squad, P-O-P Squad.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,800
 I recommend both of these, Mr. Gigi and Pop Squad, if you're into this, but that's probably the wrong term.

34
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,160
 But Pop Squad is an on the street vigilante group.

35
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,640
 I believe they're based in either the Northeast or maybe Canada,

36
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,680
 where they do what to catch a predator used to do.

37
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,840
 They confront people trying to talk to young men and women online.

38
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,600
 And then they run into, they say, hey, let's meet at Target.

39
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,960
 And then they bring down a camera crew and they corner the guy at Target.

40
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,960
 And they basically berate him and say, you know, we're going to release this information.

41
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,200
 We're going to put this video online and all these people are going to see it.

42
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,720
 We're going to turn it over to the police and all that.

43
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,520
 And the guy's like, I was just here to have a Coke.

44
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,600
 I was just here to have a Coke.

45
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,960
 Now, there's a bit of a, what's the word, schnoidengfroffen?

46
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,280
 Schnoidengfraiden?

47
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,400
 You know what I mean.

48
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,160
 It's the German for taking the light and other people's misery.

49
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,120
 I think that's part of it.

50
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,840
 These people are not nice people to put up bluntly.

51
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,680
 They're trying to manipulate young men and women for sex.

52
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,280
 But as I'm watching it, so, you know, to catch a predator was a show that was on in like the early 2000s.

53
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,560
 But Pop Squad, they're doing videos today.

54
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,400
 And the other day I was watching one and I thought,

55
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,080
 I thought that this was so 2006.

56
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,440
 Like, I remember watching Pop Squad back in the day and definitely to catch a predator.

57
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,200
 But the idea that people still meet young men and women online,

58
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,440
 I just have a hard time wrapping my head around it.

59
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,600
 I know pedophilia exists and it's absolutely awful and it's horrible and it's a tragedy.

60
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,440
 Every time that it happens, these people need to be dealt with to the fullest extent of the law.

61
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,560
 But how are people still doing it?

62
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,280
 Like, and especially like chatting with someone online.

63
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,440
 First off, who uses chat rooms anymore?

64
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,760
 Are these people actually chatting or are they meeting on Facebook?

65
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,400
 I don't know.

66
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,520
 And I just don't like, how have they not gotten wise to this?

67
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:40,280
 And there's hundreds and hundreds of hours of video footage of people getting caught doing this.

68
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,920
 But you're going to be the one who sneaks through the system.

69
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,680
 It's absolutely mind boggling.

70
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,720
 I think it goes to show how short, I mean the people are sick obviously,

71
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,880
 but they're also very short-sighted to think that they're going to get away with it.

72
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,920
 I don't get it.

73
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,280
 I don't get it.

74
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,160
 And they don't, they get caught one or two ways.

75
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,480
 They get exposed by a Chris Hanson or Pop Squad, that's the minority.

76
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,520
 Where they just get arrested and thrown in prison for 20 years.

77
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,680
 It's absolutely mind boggling.

78
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,240
 But if you have an afternoon to spare, Mr. Gigi and Pop Squad.

79
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,000
 The sad thing is, I was reading, what was I reading about today?

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,440
 I'll read the sun for the daily inquire, what was it?

81
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,400
 The sun is a British, oh the independent British newspapers.

82
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,800
 They have a lot of weird stories in them.

83
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,680
 It was Brits.

84
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,560
 And I saw recently, maybe not recently, but you know,

85
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,640
 with these headlines popped up, I read these articles of people being exposed in this way,

86
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,600
 killing themselves.

87
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,560
 And that's always sad.

88
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,480
 That's always sad.

89
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,120
 I think that that's not the answer.

90
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,480
 I mean, you know, do your time.

91
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,840
 You know, you did break the law and you're doing something horrible and all that.

92
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,720
 But that's just sad that people have lost their lives over this.

93
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,040
 And I feel bad for the vigilantes too, because they're doing what is,

94
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,280
 they're doing a good thing, a good service.

95
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,320
 And then something like this happens.

96
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,160
 And then that, that'll weigh on them.

97
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,880
 But at the end of the day, their main goal is, I believe their main goal is to protect children.

98
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,280
 They'll sell a t-shirt from here and there.

99
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,560
 But again, the difference between them and some of the cults we cover is the

100
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,520
 cults are asking for obscene amounts of money or they're dangerous.

101
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:24,920
 Now, speaking of dangerous cults, this cult that we're going to talk about on the first story

102
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,240
 is probably one of the dumbest cults I've ever heard of.

103
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,600
 Now, the term cult may not be a fair signifier,

104
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,560
 because it's not necessarily like a church you go to.

105
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,600
 And you all have to wear the same sneakers and shave the left side of your head

106
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,960
 and pierce your right pinky.

107
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,920
 It's not like that.

108
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,240
 It's more of a lifestyle, but it's so incredibly dangerous that...

109
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:53,080
 So I've, I've, I'm at a loss for words.

110
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,200
 So what it is, is it goes under a couple different names.

111
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,280
 One is Brevarianism, or the second one is Sungazing.

112
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,680
 Now they're both fairly related.

113
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,600
 So, but what we're going to focus here on is the Sungazing aspect.

114
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:12,360
 So what this cult believes is that your pineal gland in your brain,

115
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,640
 it has to be opened up for your chakra power to give you magnetic light or whatever like that.

116
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,120
 And through evolution and bad living practices,

117
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,520
 our pineal gland has become calcified.

118
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,960
 People say fluoride does that too.

119
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,800
 But anyways, so your pineal which basically cuts you off from the universe.

120
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,920
 So how do you fix your pineal gland?

121
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:38,200
 Either 45 minutes before the sun rises, or 45 minutes as the sun is rising,

122
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,360
 or 45 minutes as the sun is setting.

123
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,920
 You got to stare at the sun.

124
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,560
 You got to stare directly at the sun.

125
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,560
 But I know what you're thinking, Jason, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

126
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,160
 But that's because you didn't let me finish.

127
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,560
 Because you don't stare at the sun for 45 minutes.

128
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,360
 You stare at the sun for 10 seconds.

129
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:02,040
 And then the next day, you stare at the sun for 20 seconds.

130
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,840
 And then the day after that, you stare at the sun for 30 seconds.

131
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,440
 Until eventually you stare at evil.

132
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,880
 You build up your eye muscles.

133
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,880
 This is the rocky of eye muscles.

134
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,760
 They're running up the solar stairs and they're like doing a little dance.

135
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:21,160
 After doing this over and over, maybe it's 10 seconds every week.

136
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,160
 But anyways, you add 10 seconds to it each time.

137
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,560
 And so you will be able to eventually, you will be able to stare directly at the sun

138
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,040
 for 45 minutes straight.

139
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:39,000
 Now it's very clear on all their websites, do not stare at the sun for more than 45 minutes.

140
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,760
 Because that might cause eye damage.

141
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:46,200
 But you can stare up to the sun up to 45 minutes.

142
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,160
 And you can only look at the sun as it's rising and it's setting.

143
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,040
 Because that's when the UV rays are the least damaging.

144
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,760
 I'm not, I'm not making that claim.

145
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,120
 That's their claim.

146
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,600
 But anyways, so you will, you go out, you look at the sun for 10 seconds and then you stop.

147
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,960
 And you can do it for another 10 seconds.

148
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,720
 Or you know, you get, it's a cumulative thing.

149
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,160
 So you keep adding 10 seconds to it.

150
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,000
 Eventually you get to 45 minutes.

151
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,440
 And then at that point, you can't look at the sun anymore.

152
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:17,320
 Now you have to walk barefoot everywhere on dirt.

153
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,840
 Not grass, dirt.

154
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,960
 And because after staring at the sun for 45 minutes,

155
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,760
 like once you build up your eye muscles that much, your pineal gland has been completely opened up.

156
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,760
 And now you're not going to have any trouble at all except for macular degeneration.

157
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,880
 But, and then to keep your, your pineal gland recharged,

158
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,880
 you just have to walk barefoot on dirt.

159
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:45,240
 Now this is one of those weird cults that is completely incompatible with modern life.

160
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,560
 And I think that might be the allure of some cults.

161
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,000
 But I mean, if you're a businessman and you're like, you know what, I have everything.

162
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,240
 I have a beautiful wife, I have kids, I have this great job.

163
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,680
 The one thing I don't have is an uncalcified pineal gland.

164
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,400
 Okay. And you do that whole thing.

165
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,000
 But now are you going to put sand everywhere in your building?

166
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,240
 Like, are you going to go golfing and just mow up all the grass?

167
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,960
 Like it's just completely incompatible with human life.

168
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,440
 At least, you know, some of the religious cults out there,

169
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,280
 you can go about your normal day and just pray to some wacky God.

170
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,680
 This one, you kind of have to change your whole life.

171
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,080
 But anyways, so a couple of the things that are going on is that

172
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,800
 by the time you can get up to the 45 minutes, the claims of the cults are,

173
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,600
 is that you don't even have to eat anymore.

174
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,280
 That's how crazy good the sun's power are.

175
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,800
 You don't have to eat anymore.

176
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,360
 You can literally absorb all the nutrients you need from the sun

177
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,160
 and from the dirt on the bottom of your feet.

178
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,960
 So that's where the breatharianism comes in.

179
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,960
 So the breatharianism, they use sun gazing.

180
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,520
 This is all based on like India, like basically like Americans or Europeans going to India,

181
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,200
 getting high and then coming back and making stuff up.

182
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,680
 And usually change your name to some sort of Indian name.

183
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,240
 India, India, not Native American India.

184
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,720
 So anyways, you go to this point, your pineal gland is like completely open.

185
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,160
 You've absorbed sunlight instead of eating food.

186
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,920
 And you don't have to, I think you don't have to drink water,

187
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,080
 but they sometimes do just for in social situations.

188
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,080
 They'll drink like milk, which was actually a good out.

189
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,400
 Because then if you're ever really hungry, you're like,

190
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,320
 "Hey dude, dude, you're calling up all your friends.

191
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,840
 Hey, it's sun gazing, Johnny.

192
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,800
 Yeah, yeah, to me, it's me.

193
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,080
 Hey, do you want to go to, uh, do you want to go to Hooters?"

194
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,680
 You know, just for a social event.

195
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,920
 It's not, I'm not breaking my religious practice.

196
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,200
 I just, it's socially then.

197
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,440
 But anyways, so of course, when you make such dangerous claims,

198
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,120
 people are going to start debunking them.

199
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,360
 And so a lot of scientists and researchers have said,

200
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,520
 "Oh, you know what? That's your claim. That's great.

201
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,720
 Let's put it to a test."

202
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:59,880
 Now in India, they said, "Oh, this guy went 441 days without eating."

203
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,120
 And it was done under rigorous experiments,

204
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,320
 but whenever they've tried replicating the tests anywhere else,

205
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,400
 under circumstances determined by the researcher,

206
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,640
 it always fails, like within a weekend.

207
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,080
 Or week.

208
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,720
 At tops.

209
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,800
 This news report was trying to test one of the biggest leaders,

210
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,880
 biggest proponents of this belief.

211
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,920
 She barely, I think she barely made it a week before a doctor was like,

212
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,360
 "You got to cut this. She's about to die."

213
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,520
 And the woman's like, "I'm fine. I'm fine."

214
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,200
 And she's like, "Super dehydrated."

215
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,600
 And then first she was saying,

216
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,400
 "Oh, the hotel room you put me in has black mold.

217
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,120
 It's unpurified air. This isn't going to work."

218
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,800
 So the researchers took her to the middle of nowhere in a cabin

219
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
 with beautiful spring mountain air.

220
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,480
 And it still didn't work.

221
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,000
 She was still horribly dehydrated.

222
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,880
 What's funny is so, so it's, first off, it's incredibly dangerous.

223
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,600
 Please don't do it.

224
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:57,320
 Secondly, it's never been tested outside of them, of their, that group.

225
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,640
 And again, if a Christian goes,

226
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,160
 "Oh, when you die, your soul goes to heaven

227
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,600
 and you go see your grandma and your grandpa."

228
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,920
 And stuff like that, that can't be tested.

229
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,640
 And that's not physically damaging anyone.

230
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,920
 So I mean, people could go, "Ha, ha, you're lying."

231
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,000
 And other people go, "Well, no, I believe that that's true."

232
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,960
 And then that's kind of the end of it.

233
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,560
 But if someone's making a claim,

234
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,640
 you can stare at the sun for 45 minutes,

235
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,520
 it's not going to hurt you, and you'll never have to eat again.

236
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,000
 That's a claim that will impact your life here.

237
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,320
 It will physically hurt you here.

238
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,320
 So that's why people, I think, have been more adamant

239
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,520
 about disproving this stuff.

240
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,640
 People have starved to death doing this plan, obviously.

241
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,360
 I thought it was funny.

242
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,960
 I was looking over the pro-sun gazing websites,

243
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,160
 and they were talking about their own research they had done

244
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,040
 about sun gazing.

245
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,160
 I found this little nugget.

246
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,880
 "The number of people who reported a decreased need

247
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,680
 for solid food was approximately equal

248
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,960
 to the number of people who reported no significant change

249
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,000
 in the need for food."

250
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,760
 And they're using that as like, "Oh, look it.

251
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,520
 See, it kind of works,

252
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,600
 because we brought 50 people into this room."

253
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:04,200
 And half of them said, "I'm good with not having any more food."

254
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,280
 And the other half goes, "Nah, it didn't help me at all."

255
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,520
 That's called a placebo effect.

256
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,280
 And what's the time limit?

257
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,280
 Because if you did it just after brunch,

258
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,000
 some people are going to be, "Oh, I'm so hungry."

259
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,360
 And then other people are going to be like,

260
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,480
 "Nah, I can wait till dinner."

261
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,080
 What's funny, though, is that it said only one person

262
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,280
 in the study reported an increased need for food.

263
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,000
 And I'm like that, Homer Simpson.

264
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,400
 I can just imagine a bunch of like normal humans in there,

265
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,840
 and then yellow-skinned Homer Simpson standing in the corner.

266
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,840
 "Who looks at the sun and gets hungrier?

267
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,040
 Who stares at the sun and wants more food

268
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,040
 than they had before they stared at the sun?"

269
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,040
 Not many people.

270
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,800
 So this cult is still very active.

271
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,120
 There's, I've found multiple,

272
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,960
 I have found more articles talking about the benefits of this

273
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,640
 than I found debunking this.

274
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,200
 Because it's still fairly underground.

275
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,120
 I think it's more prevalent in India, obviously,

276
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,200
 and then in Europe.

277
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,880
 It's not so prevalent here.

278
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,760
 People have made attempts to debunk it,

279
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,120
 but there's more saying,

280
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,000
 "No, no, this will help open up your sixth eye,

281
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,080
 or your third eye, and your sixth chakra,

282
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,920
 and make you connected to the universe."

283
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,840
 And yeah, because you're going to be blind

284
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,320
 and the rest of your senses are being heightened.

285
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:19,880
 I don't know.

286
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,200
 I wonder how these people work during the eclipse, too.

287
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,320
 I wonder if they're like,

288
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,840
 "Dude, I got my 45 minutes in.

289
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,360
 I can totally stare at this eclipse."

290
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,960
 Nuts.

291
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,360
 And I mean, I just don't get how

292
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,680
 theories like this evolve,

293
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,840
 and how they came up with the 45-minute window.

294
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,000
 Because did they have a bunch of monks go blind,

295
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,560
 and then they're like,

296
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,480
 "Hey, how long did you look at the sun for?

297
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,080
 Ah, I looked at it for 46 minutes."

298
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,240
 Whatever.

299
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:43,960
 Don't do this.

300
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,080
 And if you know, happen to know anyone who's sun-gazing,

301
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,080
 please buy them a pair of blue blockers.

302
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,360
 Did they still make those?

303
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,520
 Our next story is actually going to be the beginning

304
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,960
 of our cryptids week.

305
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,000
 We're going to do a cryptid story each day this week.

306
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,120
 We've got some good ones,

307
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,920
 and this one is actually what inspired

308
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,120
 the cryptid week.

309
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,400
 Because when I found out about this one,

310
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,640
 I thought, "Okay, I bet you there's some other

311
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,240
 really cool monsters out there

312
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,520
 that no one's ever heard of."

313
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,520
 So in the deepest jungles of Africa,

314
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,360
 maybe not the jungles.

315
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,280
 That's a stereotype.

316
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,040
 But in South Africa, in a jungle,

317
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,880
 there's a huge cave system.

318
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,120
 And in this cave system is apparently

319
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,960
 more riches than you could ever imagine.

320
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,840
 It's very equivalent of the Lost Dutchman mind,

321
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,880
 except they know where it's at.

322
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,080
 They know exactly where it's at.

323
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,960
 So people have tried going into this cave,

324
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,480
 and it smells of sulfur,

325
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,320
 which probably means there's some sort of gas down there.

326
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,080
 And it's apparently bottomless,

327
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,680
 and it goes all the way out to the ocean,

328
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,440
 like 60 miles away or something like that.

329
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,560
 What keeps people away from really getting

330
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,440
 into those riches

331
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,120
 is the creature known as the Groot Slang.

332
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,560
 Now, I found this out while I was researching this.

333
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,680
 Apparently Groot Slang is also a Final Fantasy boss.

334
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,040
 That being said,

335
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,000
 the Groot Slang is also an ancient South African legend

336
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,800
 of a creature with the head of an elephant

337
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,880
 and the body of a snake.

338
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,760
 If you could pick two more ruthless animals

339
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,880
 to put together,

340
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,360
 it would be like a hippo and a Tyrannosaurus Rex.

341
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,080
 So the Groot Slang, its origin story,

342
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,640
 the creation myth is when the gods were first

343
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,440
 created in the world,

344
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,920
 they created the Groot Slang,

345
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,360
 and it was the most cunning,

346
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,360
 evil, intelligent creature on the planet.

347
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,520
 And the gods realized,

348
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,080
 "Whoa, we probably messed up on this one."

349
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,720
 Because it's completely just overrunning the planet.

350
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,640
 So it gathered up,

351
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,640
 the gods gathered up all the Groot Slangs

352
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,920
 and chopped them in half

353
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,400
 and made one half the elephant and one half the snake.

354
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,240
 But in that purge,

355
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,720
 one Groot Slang hid,

356
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,120
 hid from the gods,

357
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,840
 and didn't get cut in half,

358
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,920
 and that's where all the other Groot Slangs have come from.

359
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,120
 So this isn't a singular immortal creature.

360
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,280
 It can breed, I'm assuming, asexually.

361
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,800
 I don't really know how,

362
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,320
 but it has sex with itself.

363
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,680
 It's a hermaphrodite maybe.

364
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,760
 So the Groot Slang that you may see today

365
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,120
 isn't necessarily the one

366
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,040
 that was created a million years ago.

367
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,200
 And people still say they see it today.

368
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,560
 It's a creature that people in this area have said,

369
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,920
 "Oh no, no, no, don't go in that cave.

370
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,200
 There's the Groot Slang in there."

371
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,280
 Which, you know, for one thing could be a cover story,

372
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,920
 but the stories lasted for hundreds and hundreds of years.

373
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,600
 It's their version of Bigfoot.

374
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,240
 But Bigfoot to us is a big hairy monkey

375
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,640
 that will either beat your brains in

376
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,680
 or walk blurrily out of frame.

377
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,360
 The Groot Slang is an evil god creature.

378
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,840
 Like, the power scale between the two,

379
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,560
 they're considered the same as far as

380
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,840
 people have sightings of them

381
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,560
 and they find broken stuff and all of that.

382
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,200
 And detractors go, "Oh, Bigfoot's just a bear."

383
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,200
 And detractors in South Africa go,

384
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,800
 "Oh no, that was just a regular elephant

385
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,680
 with a 60-foot-long slender slimy body."

386
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,720
 So they, but they're both on the same level

387
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,400
 of people believe in them.

388
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,280
 This isn't a myth.

389
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,760
 They actually believe the Groot Slang exists today.

390
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,880
 But the power level between the two is off the charts.

391
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:09,160
 I would, I would rather fight five Bigfoot than one Groot Slang.

392
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,720
 I'd rather fight 10 Bigfoot than one Groot Slang.

393
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,360
 And here's why.

394
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,880
 The way that the Groot Slang is described is it's super intelligent.

395
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,040
 And you know, the thing is too is that

396
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,600
 a lot of the comparisons with the reptile body,

397
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,440
 the intelligence, it also not necessarily lives in that cave

398
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,040
 because there was riches in there.

399
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,600
 It got gold and brought it there.

400
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,720
 So it's more on the line of a European dragon.

401
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,560
 A Bigfoot is just a smart monkey.

402
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,400
 Like a stone age level intelligence monkey.

403
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,080
 The Groot Slang is acquiring wealth and hiding it

404
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,480
 and then strambling anyone who comes near it.

405
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,400
 So I'd much rather fight a bunch of Bigfoot people.

406
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,640
 Even though I'd be outnumbered like physically,

407
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,960
 I feel like I could out, I could home alone them.

408
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,320
 I could out tactic them.

409
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,720
 I could have like pots of boiling water above their head

410
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,600
 and I could have a roller skate that has like a tack in it.

411
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,040
 So when they step on it, they're like,

412
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,080
 I guess you don't need both.

413
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,440
 I guess the tack or the roller skate trip goes either way.

414
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,560
 But the Groot Slang,

415
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,160
 how are you going to defend yourself against it?

416
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,640
 It's an elephant sized snake that's hyper intelligent.

417
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,200
 I do have to say, I always find it's weird

418
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,880
 when we find cultural contamination and myths

419
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,280
 when there was no cultural contamination.

420
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,120
 So you have the story of the reptilian dragons in Europe

421
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,920
 who hoard gold and they're just like these massive beasts

422
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,480
 that live in mountains and cave systems and things like that.

423
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,400
 And then we travel, what is it?

424
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:43,000
 A thousand miles south before the British ever got into South Africa

425
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,600
 and you have the story of the Groot Slang,

426
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,560
 this giant reptilian like creature that hoards wealth

427
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,240
 and lives in a massive cave system.

428
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,840
 I always think that's fascinating

429
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:57,080
 because technically there shouldn't be any cross-contamination.

430
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,840
 You could argue that when the British came down,

431
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,320
 the Groot Slang myth evolved a bit,

432
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,480
 but I couldn't find any sourcing on that.

433
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,520
 But yes, was there at some point a giant reptiles that were,

434
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,920
 I hoarding gold?

435
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,440
 I mean, probably not, but I just find it interesting.

436
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,280
 I find it interesting that dragon mythology

437
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,640
 is pretty much all over the planet.

438
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,400
 And I said before in a previous episode,

439
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,480
 reptilians being part of creation myths are all over the planet.

440
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,320
 You have it in the Middle East creation stories.

441
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,120
 You have it in the Native American creation stories.

442
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,520
 You have it now in the South African creation stories

443
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,760
 where the reptile is this horrible evil being

444
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,200
 that the gods have to intervene.

445
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,520
 What's the difference between the Groot Slang

446
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,200
 and the serpent in the Garden of Eden?

447
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,200
 I don't know.

448
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,400
 Where, why does it all come from one sort of cultural pot?

449
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,760
 I don't know.

450
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,160
 I do know that I would never want to meet a Groot Slang.

451
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,800
 I would want to see one through binoculars.

452
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,920
 I think that would be awesome.

453
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,080
 I think that would be great,

454
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,400
 but I wouldn't want to be walked through the,

455
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,760
 oh, and I wanted to say this too.

456
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,280
 You know, looking into the story, I started to think,

457
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,720
 okay, so imagine you're walking through the forest,

458
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,920
 just a regular forest,

459
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,040
 and you see a little girl in a white dress

460
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,240
 with like black hair, like Samara,

461
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,680
 standing with her head against leaning against the tree.

462
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,760
 You're in the middle of nowhere,

463
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,960
 and she's like, "La, la, la, la, la."

464
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,160
 You're going to be upset, to say the least.

465
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,760
 You're going to not have a good time.

466
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:34,840
 But I know that I'm in a forest in Michigan or wherever,

467
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,720
 and I can turn around and walk out,

468
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,320
 and a couple of squirrels are going to scatter

469
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,040
 in each direction,

470
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,800
 and then finally get in my car and drive away,

471
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,840
 and then she's in the backseat.

472
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,600
 Now, let's flip that.

473
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,000
 Let's say that you're in a jungle in Africa,

474
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,840
 and it's, there's like jaguars walking around,

475
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,440
 you've got big old boas,

476
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,440
 you've got all sorts of parasites and fire ants,

477
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,800
 and all sorts of horrible things

478
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,680
 that are naturally there that exist.

479
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,840
 You turn a corner and next to a giant vine

480
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,000
 is a little girl wearing a white dress with black hair going,

481
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,080
 "La, la, la, la."

482
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,200
 I think the idea of,

483
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,760
 I think a ghost in like the outdoors

484
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,040
 is totally terrifying to me.

485
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,640
 I think more so than a ghost in a house,

486
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,040
 because I don't like the outdoors anyways,

487
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,680
 but a ghost in the outdoors of an environment

488
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,480
 I'm familiar with is less terrifying

489
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:27,720
 than a ghost girl deep in some sort of hot, humid jungle.

490
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,560
 But technically, they should exist in both biomes.

491
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,480
 That's scary.

492
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,960
 I'd much rather meet Samara in Yellowstone than Samara.

493
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,600
 Well, I could,

494
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,760
 Samara on the Serengeti would probably be pretty easy

495
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,160
 because you'd see her like 50 miles away.

496
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,120
 Still be creepy though.

497
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,040
 And as you went to run,

498
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,160
 you'd go, you'd get in your car,

499
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:47,720
 you'd turn it on,

500
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,840
 and there'd be a lion and the ghost girl in your back seat.

501
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,960
 I'm not doing it.

502
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,920
 Sorry, South Africa.

503
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,600
 I'm not visiting you.

504
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,280
 I actually have no listeners in Africa.

505
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,440
 Maybe this episode will turn that around.

 So this is the beginning of our cryptid week.

510
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,400
 We're going to just keep zooming along.

511
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,160
 I wanted to focus on cryptids that we don't know about,

512
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,080
 not like science or anything lame like that.

513
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,640
 But I hadn't known about it until I did this research,

514
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,080
 and I hope you hadn't heard about them.

515
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,160
 This is going to be a nice little discovery week.

516
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,280
 We're going to learn about a lot of new crazy creatures.

517
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,480
 DeadRabbitRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy

518
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,520
 and true crime podcast.

519
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,880
 You don't have to listen to it every day,

520
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,560
 but I'm glad you listened to it today.

521
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,440
 Have a great one, guys.
