1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,180
 Who, or what, is attacking the poor, pigeon population of Las Vegas?

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:17,000
 And then we travel to Canada, to a small mining town known as Garcon.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,680
 Aliens land and give a young man very explicit orders.

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,400
 And then they leave.

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,960
 And then the story gets really weird.

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,360
 Day on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:41,280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,920
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,760
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:52,800
 It's freezing cold up here, I'm actually recording this in thermals and my Care Bear

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,800
 onesie.

12
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,080
 Let's go ahead and move on to our first story.

13
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,600
 I actually tweeted out not too long ago on my break, so I'm not going to hold back this

14
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,640
 surprise too long because of people who follow my Twitter @DeadRabRatio or like, "Hey, we

15
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,720
 already know where this story is going, so let's just do it.

16
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:15,320
 December 2019, so this month, this year, we're in Las Vegas, Nevada, driving on the road

17
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,800
 in Jason Jalopy.

18
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:23,760
 We look to our left, pigeon flies by.

19
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:30,360
 See these pigeons are also distant relatives of the blob dissolving a kid.

20
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,640
 And then we look to our right.

21
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,040
 Another pigeon flies by.

22
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,920
 But this one is wearing a stylish hat.

23
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,120
 We look at each other and then you force my head to look at the road, you're like, "Please

24
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,760
 just stay focused on the road.

25
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,200
 We parked the car, so you don't have to worry about me.

26
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,200
 Watch where I'm driving."

27
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,800
 We start walking through Las Vegas.

28
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:56,760
 Now we see a bunch of beautiful women and showgirls and David Blaine or Chris Angel

29
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,080
 or whatever is floating above the ground, but we ignore all that stuff.

30
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,840
 I'm still checking out the showgirls, but we try to ignore all of that stuff because

31
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,000
 we're on the hunt for some pigeons.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,560
 Now this is a 100% true story.

33
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,080
 There's a lot of photos of this.

34
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,720
 It's all over the news.

35
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,200
 There are pigeons.

36
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,040
 Somebody is putting little tiny hats on pigeons.

37
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,560
 Nobody knows who or why or how.

38
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,320
 And that actually should be the easiest question to answer.

39
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,080
 Because this is my first question.

40
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,880
 Like, yes, who's doing it?

41
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,160
 I figure it's either like an art collective or a lunatic.

42
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,040
 It's kind of the same thing, but it's somebody or a group.

43
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,040
 Why they're doing it?

44
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,360
 Maybe they're doing it for fun.

45
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,480
 Maybe they're doing it to like make the pigeons more popular.

46
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,520
 I don't know.

47
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,800
 But my biggest question is how?

48
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,920
 Are they little strings attached to it?

49
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,560
 Or are they, because that's a big difference.

50
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,000
 If you're putting a little stringed hat on a pigeon and let it fly around, I don't care.

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Go nuts.

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,160
 Doesn't bug me at all.

53
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,120
 If you're gluing hats to pigeon heads, that's not cool.

54
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,120
 Like that's totally not cool.

55
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,440
 You heard it here first, guys.

56
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,440
 That rubber radio taking a stand.

57
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,080
 Do not glue hats to pigeon heads.

58
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,160
 I'm against that.

59
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,160
 That's my question.

60
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,160
 How are they doing this?

61
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,160
 People are trying to figure this out, though.

62
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,160
 It's a mystery.

63
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:18,160
 There's a group in Las Vegas called Lofty Hopes, because there's a group for everything.

64
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,360
 I'm not knocking the group.

65
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,760
 I just find it bizarre that this group exists.

66
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,560
 There is a group for everything.

67
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,440
 Lofty Hopes is, bills itself as a pigeon-positive movement.

68
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,040
 So they're very pro-pigeon.

69
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,040
 I don't know.

70
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,280
 Are there anti-pigeon groups out there?

71
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,040
 I guess that might just be society and/or city dwellers.

72
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,200
 The Lofty Hopes is run by a woman named Mariah Hillman, and they're trying to get to the

73
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,000
 bottom of who's putting these hats on these pigeons.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,880
 And they're telling people, "If you see a pigeon with a hat on, immediately call us.

75
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,880
 We'll come down there."

76
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,480
 Now, what are you gonna do?

77
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,480
 Like, yes.

78
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,160
 I'm like, "If I call up your phone number, I'm not gonna capture the pigeon.

79
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,520
 I'm not gonna back it into a corner.

80
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,240
 I don't know why it has that hat.

81
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,760
 It may have been put on by a human.

82
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,440
 It may be a hyper-evolved pigeon, and it went out and bought a nice little hat.

83
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,440
 I don't know.

84
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,440
 I'm not gonna corner it.

85
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,800
 If I see a pigeon and I call you, by the time you get there, the pigeon's gonna be

86
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,800
 gone."

87
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:17,520
 Now, their concern is that they don't know how these hats affect birds vis-a-vis their

88
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,760
 predators.

89
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,560
 So is it gonna make them stand out more when the predator's hunting them?

90
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,120
 Is it going to give away their position?

91
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,320
 Now, my first guess is yes.

92
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,360
 If a pigeon is, say, a foot high, which is an awfully big pigeon, but just for the sake

93
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,360
 of measurement.

94
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,360
 Okay, fine.

95
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,960
 The pigeon is six inches tall, and he's hiding behind a brush, and there's a giant cat chasing

96
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,960
 him.

97
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,960
 A regular sized cat, to us.

98
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,440
 But, damn, a giant cat.

99
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:50,320
 He's half a foot tall, and he's hiding behind a brush that is half a foot, a bush, not like

100
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,320
 a broom.

101
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,320
 Half a foot tall.

102
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,840
 The cat won't see him.

103
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,760
 But then, if he's wearing a two-inch hat, the cat will see the hat.

104
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,080
 Now, we all know the relationship between cats and hats.

105
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,120
 Generally, they work well together.

106
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,760
 But, so technically, then the cat could attack the pigeon wearing hats.

107
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,320
 The hat wearing pigeon.

108
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,840
 But then that's kind of stupid because the cat just smelled the pigeon.

109
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,160
 So it doesn't really matter what the pigeon looks like.

110
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,520
 Because how many of the predators actually just go off the smell?

111
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,720
 And, think about it this way.

112
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,000
 Think about it this way.

113
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,800
 If you happen to be hunting, let's switch it.

114
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,000
 So a cat hunts a pigeon, and we hunt, let's say, a bear.

115
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,240
 So you're walking through the woods, you have your rifle, your shotgun, or whatever you

116
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,480
 use to kill giant monster animals.

117
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,160
 You're walking through the woods, and you see a bear just minding its own business.

118
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,840
 It's on the other side of a bush.

119
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,840
 And you're like, "Oh, great.

120
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,160
 I'm gonna blow his brains out, take him home, and do whatever I do.

121
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,160
 Make a bear skin rug."

122
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,720
 And then he turns and faces you, and he's wearing full clown makeup.

123
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:03,000
 What is actually going to buy that creature some time?

124
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,200
 You're gonna, somebody put the bear to sleep, slather it on full clown makeup, put the big

125
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,560
 red nose on him, let him wander off into the woods.

126
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,560
 And when you go to pull that trigger and the bear's like, "Whaa?"

127
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,400
 And he has a full on clown face.

128
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,520
 You're not gonna open fire.

129
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,800
 You're gonna be shocked.

130
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:28,680
 So I actually think that by putting this little hat on a pigeon, the cats, for the past 10

131
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,360
 million years, cats have been eating pigeons.

132
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,560
 And then one day, a cat is walking through Las Vegas.

133
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:41,000
 He turns, he sees that familiar outline, he smells that sweet, sweet pigeon meat, and

134
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,920
 he looks and it's wearing a hat.

135
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,040
 The cat would be like, "What is going?"

136
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,200
 And then the bird flies away.

137
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,160
 So this might actually be beneficial to the pigeons.

138
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,040
 So lofty hopes, I would say.

139
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
 Let's see what happens.

140
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,640
 Let's see what happens to the pigeon population.

141
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,280
 Unless someone's gluing hats to the...

142
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,280
 You know what's so funny is like all of that, you guys probably, your guys probably biggest

143
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,160
 question is, who's doing this?

144
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,680
 Again, that doesn't seem to be such a big question for me, but that is actually a really good

145
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,960
 question.

146
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,240
 Who and how is my biggest question?

147
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,880
 But anyways, somebody is putting hats on pigeons.

148
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,400
 And maybe they're helping pigeons.

149
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,760
 Maybe a hyper-evolved pigeon from the future has invented time travel and is going back

150
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:31,800
 and putting hats on the pigeons of today to ensure that his people aren't killed in the

151
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,920
 catpocalypse of 2020.

152
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,240
 We'll never know unless that actually happens and then we'll figure out that.

153
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,840
 The pigeon invented time travel.

154
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,960
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

155
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,760
 Now our next story is an interesting one.

156
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,040
 We are going to Garcon Canada.

157
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,960
 The year is 1954.

158
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,640
 It's June 2nd.

159
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,720
 We're going to pull up to this mine shaft in the Jason Jalopy.

160
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,000
 We drove from Las Vegas.

161
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 We're up here now.

162
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,600
 This is a really bizarre story.

163
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,360
 It's a bizarre story on two fronts.

164
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,480
 Let's go ahead and tell the story first.

165
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,880
 Garcon Ontario is in Canada.

166
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,480
 It's basically a mining town.

167
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:15,080
 It's five miles south of a place called Sudbury, which is known as the nickel capital of the

168
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
 world.

169
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,080
 And all these things are going to become extremely important.

170
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,640
 This is such a weird story.

171
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,760
 There's a dude named Ennio La Sarza.

172
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,200
 He's a 23 year old man.

173
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,400
 Ennio La Sarza.

174
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,920
 Italian immigrant in Canada.

175
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:36,520
 He works as a miner and he works as a painter as well at this mine in Garcon.

176
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,520
 And one night he's there.

177
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,520
 It's actually not even night.

178
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,520
 It's like 5pm.

179
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,240
 It's barely evening.

180
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:51,280
 He's at the mine and he sees an object in the distance.

181
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,920
 And he sees it start to dive bomb towards the ground.

182
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,560
 Towards him and he's watching it go faster and faster and faster and he says it was going

183
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,680
 faster than the fastest jet he had ever seen.

184
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:11,280
 But before it hits the ground it just begins to decelerate and then lands.

185
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:17,320
 With a dramatic entrance you really have to think that UFO didn't have to do that.

186
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,640
 That when it was standard you wouldn't build a vehicle that would be a standard landing

187
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,880
 procedure.

188
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,560
 You almost think these aliens had to be show offs or to scare him in some way.

189
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:35,320
 Why would you build a vehicle that has to approach the earth as fast as possible and

190
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,320
 then slow down.

191
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,600
 It just seems like a waste of energy.

192
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,040
 And physics and the fact that it's super dangerous.

193
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:47,480
 But anyways he sees it speed up and then slow down right before it lands on the earth.

194
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,840
 This saucer is a flying saucer.

195
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,600
 It's 25 feet in diameter.

196
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
 Has landing pads.

197
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,880
 Little landing gears come out.

198
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:02,400
 1950 smoke effect shoots out.

199
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,000
 And the ship opens up and out step these aliens.

200
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,880
 He describes the aliens of being insectoid.

201
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,440
 They had six, he said it was a combination of arms and legs.

202
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,480
 They almost look like, you know how like if you took a beetle or an ant.

203
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,280
 But these ones could stand up on two legs and have four arms available or stand up on

204
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,120
 four legs and have two arms available.

205
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,080
 They could use them for anything.

206
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,160
 It's six appendages and they all look the same.

207
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,880
 With like claws.

208
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,760
 Claws where we would expect hands.

209
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:42,080
 And he said they almost closed spasmodically like step, step, step, step, step, step.

210
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,640
 Truly alien.

211
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:51,120
 These things are 13 feet tall with one eye in the middle of what you would assume would

212
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,440
 be a face on what you would assume would be a head.

213
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:01,920
 It had like these weird kind of knobby head over the, it basically had like a big flat

214
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,960
 roundish insectoid type body like a potato bug type of thing.

215
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:12,640
 Six weird arms, legs, this bizarre head.

216
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,080
 One eye in the middle of this face.

217
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:23,000
 Here's a quote that was in, this story was really, this story, okay, it's really hard

218
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 not to get ahead of myself, but the main source we have for this story is Project Blue Book.

219
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,640
 The official US investigation into unidentified flying objects.

220
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,520
 And it's really, I don't want to spoil it.

221
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:45,720
 So what we see in Project Blue Book is this sentence, three strange beans emerged from

222
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,220
 the craft.

223
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:55,040
 They were about 13 feet tall, greenish blue in color, and the face was a color combination

224
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,760
 he had never seen before.

225
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,280
 And it's funny, I've mentioned that on past episodes.

226
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,360
 How can you imagine something or describe something you've never seen before?

227
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,120
 A color combination, I remember I was talking about, I was when I was writing a science

228
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,240
 fiction book there was a color called amber blue, it was equal amounts of blue and gold

229
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,240
 at the same time.

230
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:21,440
 It wasn't both, it was the same, it was like, it was something that the characters in the

231
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,560
 story were completely, they saw it all the time, but if when a human saw it they would

232
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:32,400
 see it as either gold or blue or a mixture of both, but it was really, it's hard to

233
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:38,280
 describe because the color doesn't exist.

234
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:44,440
 And I guess HP Lovecraft has a similar story called like Color Out of Time or Color Out

235
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,280
 of Space or something like that, they're making a movie about it, but describing a color that

236
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,520
 you can't describe that you've never seen, that you don't understand, this guy's looking

237
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,000
 at that.

238
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,600
 I can make up a story about that and HP Lovecraft can make a story about that, but this guy's

239
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,400
 actually sees these aliens get off the ship and their face was a color combination he

240
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,800
 had never seen before, their bodies were the greenish blue, but their faces were something

241
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,320
 out of this world.

242
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,680
 So these aliens come down and one of the creatures which he assumed was the leader, scuttles

243
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:22,400
 towards him, doesn't do a nice little gray alien walk, we come in peace, it's like an

244
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,720
 insect.

245
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:30,600
 It's 5pm again, which makes it to me creepier, the sun is just setting, life is still fairly

246
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,400
 normal at 5pm, midnight, 3am, things are creepy.

247
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,960
 But at 5pm you're hungry, you're ready to go home and watch some I Love Lucy and eat

248
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,960
 dinner.

249
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,300
 As the creature starts scuttling towards him, he turns to run and is immediately frozen

250
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,040
 in place.

251
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,400
 And that's when the conversation starts.

252
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:58,280
 There's a voice in his head and it tells him to do something.

253
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:06,640
 Ennio wakes up, aliens are gone, he runs to his office and tells his boss immediately,

254
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,360
 I was just out by the mine, these aliens came down, the ship came, tells him the whole story

255
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,920
 and the boss of the mine is like what in the world are you talking about?

256
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,720
 About 10 minutes has passed, it's about 5, 10, 5, 20 now.

257
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:25,160
 He goes this happened and I felt the alien voice in my head and then I passed out and

258
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,080
 I took off running and I'm talking to you right now.

259
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,120
 He begins to alert the authorities.

260
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,280
 Ennio, and I believe the boss was part of this as well, we're going to get into the story

261
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:38,680
 behind the story here, but Ennio, he does contact like the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,

262
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,040
 the Canadian Air Force, all of this stuff.

263
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,280
 I saw UFO, this is what happened, these aliens came down.

264
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,240
 While this is being investigated.

265
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,160
 The number one question that I'm sure you have as well, the investigators come down

266
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:56,880
 and he tells a story, he goes they asked me to do something and then I fell asleep and

267
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,160
 people go what did they ask you to do?

268
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:06,160
 And Ennio would start to tremble and he would look at these men, military men, police officers

269
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,640
 and say I'm not going to tell you.

270
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:14,000
 I'm not going to tell you what they asked me to do, but I would never do it.

271
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,720
 I would never ever, never, never ever do it.

272
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:23,080
 He said I told the aliens I would rather die than do that and I was not then conscious.

273
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,520
 And I woke up, they were gone.

274
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,280
 The officials are like what did you say?

275
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,040
 I'm not going to tell you what they asked me to do.

276
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,840
 I refused to, but I would never do it.

277
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,680
 I would never ever, I just couldn't even imagine doing it.

278
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:44,760
 He actually begs the police to throw him in prison because he believes that he is a danger

279
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,200
 to humanity.

280
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:53,440
 Because if the aliens get him and force him to do what they wanted him to do, just lock

281
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,600
 me up in jail man.

282
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
 Just lock me up in jail.

283
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,480
 It's the only place I'll be safe.

284
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,320
 And the fact that he won't say what they asked him to do makes the story more mysterious.

285
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,240
 So the first thing you look at is is the story true?

286
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:15,040
 Now there is only one site that really talks about this story.

287
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,920
 And I've talked about these guys, I've done a lot of stuff.

288
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:24,160
 There is a website called Cryptopia and Cryptopia has a podcast called the Crypto Knot Podcast.

289
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,080
 And from what it seems like, it seems like it's pretty much a one man operation by a

290
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,360
 guy named Rob Morphy.

291
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,360
 This is the only website that talks about the Garcon Invaders.

292
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,120
 So you go, it's creepypasta.

293
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,640
 Now I've done a lot of stuff from Cryptopia, I do and a lot of it checks out.

294
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,000
 I don't think I've ever come across a completely fake story on there.

295
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,240
 But I'm looking into this stuff and I'm like, why can't I find anything about this case

296
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,960
 except from this website?

297
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,680
 Now what's interesting is, I kept digging, I kept digging, I kept digging.

298
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,720
 There is a newspaper in the area, remember I said this was south of Sudbury, the nickel

299
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,160
 capital of the world.

300
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,880
 There is a newspaper in the area called the Sudbury Daily Star.

301
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:13,400
 And they did have a series of articles about UFO sightings.

302
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,920
 There was a website that happened to list every UFO sighting that was printed in the

303
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,880
 Sudbury Daily Star.

304
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,160
 Which seems like a very obscure website, it really was.

305
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,480
 But there was a ton of them dating back to like 1914.

306
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:33,040
 And I came across a book that was published in 1956 that quoted the Sudbury Daily Star

307
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:38,600
 saying that there were fireballs in the sky around Sudbury which is only 5 miles away

308
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,280
 from Garcon.

309
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,440
 And the idea was that these fireballs, these UFOs was actually the Russian spying on the

310
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,280
 nickel capital of the world.

311
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,400
 And I'm not saying nickels as in they had a much of 5 cent pieces.

312
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,440
 This is where most of the world gets their nickel.

313
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,600
 So this story gets to Project Blue Book in a bizarre way.

314
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,240
 Because we have to meet two people.

315
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,040
 We meet Elder Charles Beck.

316
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,560
 He's a minister, he's an African American minister.

317
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,040
 He has a radio show on.

318
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,320
 This is back in the 1950s.

319
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,120
 He has a radio show on.

320
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,600
 He's releasing these gospel albums.

321
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,160
 He's a famous musician of the time.

322
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:20,520
 And there was a reporter working for the Sudbury Daily Star named Michael Bolton.

323
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,000
 Completely lost to history obviously because his name is Michael Bolton.

324
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,840
 When you type that in, all you get is the singer.

325
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,680
 So you have Elder Charles Beck and you have a guy named Michael Bolton writing for the

326
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:36,440
 Sudbury Daily Star on July 9th, 1954.

327
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,680
 So a month after all of this happened.

328
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:44,680
 Elder Charles Beck and Michael Bolton meet up with Ennio and they get him to tell the

329
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,800
 story on tape.

330
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,240
 And then, and after the story is recorded, Ennio has a nervous breakdown and he goes

331
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,240
 "You gotta erase the tape.

332
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,400
 You gotta erase the tape."

333
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,520
 I made promises.

334
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,680
 I made promises not to tell the story.

335
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,520
 You gotta erase the tape.

336
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,640
 And Elder Charles Beck and Michael Bolton are kinda like "What?

337
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,640
 This is...

338
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,920
 Okay, okay, calm down, calm down.

339
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,440
 We'll erase the tape.

340
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,440
 We'll erase the tape."

341
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,640
 They figured they had took good enough notes and in front of them they erased the tape.

342
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,160
 It's very, very suspicious obviously.

343
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,820
 As a skeptical person you go "Oh, that's very convenient that the only first hand account

344
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,820
 was destroyed."

345
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:27,760
 But, what happened was Elder Charles Beck and Michael Bolton then went such a funny

346
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,760
 name.

347
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:36,440
 But then they go on to Beck's radio show and retell the story from their memory.

348
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,520
 They go "Listen, he told us to erase the tape."

349
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,120
 Because people knew the name.

350
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,200
 It wasn't like they were outing this guy, but they're like "He told us to destroy the

351
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,520
 tape, but this is what we remembered."

352
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,600
 And that's pretty much the story that I just told you.

353
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,080
 So how do these two guys get involved?

354
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,660
 Are these people important?

355
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,700
 Who is Elder Charles Beck?

356
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,460
 Michael Bolton we know is a reporter, but again it's just disappeared.

357
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,020
 But why is this radio minister involved in this?

358
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,220
 And how is he contacting Project Blue Book?

359
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,860
 Did someone working for the US government hear this radio show?

360
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,340
 Here's a quote from Project Blue Book on this case.

361
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:16,700
 The case is listed in Project Blue Book as "Spacecraft Landing in Canada."

362
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,600
 And it's listed as being the first time this has ever happened in Canada.

363
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,360
 Aliens Landing in Canada.

364
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,480
 This was the first time.

365
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,480
 Here's a quote.

366
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:32,060
 "I am indebted for details to BSR associate Elder Charles Beck.

367
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:41,280
 A Buffalo New York minister who travels considerably uses 'saucer' material in his radio broadcasts

368
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,600
 and has had various interviews with Washington authorities on this subject.

369
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,500
 He's basically...

370
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,500
 Is he...

371
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:56,380
 I don't want to use the term like a man in black, but he's almost like back when UFOs

372
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,380
 were still...

373
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,300
 The myth was still being created.

374
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,500
 This is only like nine years after Roswell.

375
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,200
 You have a guy who has a radio show.

376
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,500
 You have a minister who has this radio show who every show often tells a story about flying

377
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,260
 saucers and at the same time is traveling.

378
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,580
 It's almost like he's using his show as a cover.

379
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,760
 He's going on these revivals.

380
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,120
 He's going on these tours.

381
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:25,920
 He's taking his ministry across the country and at the same time investigating UFO landings.

382
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:30,480
 To the point that authorities in Washington are talking with him.

383
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,400
 Who is this guy?

384
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,640
 Elder Charles Beck.

385
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,760
 When you look him up on Wikipedia, talks about he has a couple songs.

386
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,280
 He wrote a song called "Winehead Willie Put That Bottle Down."

387
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,280
 The Memphis Flu.

388
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,200
 That's a song about the 1918 flu pandemic.

389
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,980
 But what in the world is a BSR associate for one?

390
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,300
 And then he goes, "Yeah, thanks.

391
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,420
 This guy travels the country, investigates his stuff."

392
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,420
 What?

393
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,660
 Who is this dude?

394
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,420
 Lost to history.

395
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:07,980
 It's not mentioned anywhere else, but there is a facsimile of one page of Project Blue

396
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,260
 Book on the Cryptopia website.

397
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,620
 That's where I'm getting a bulk of this information.

398
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:16,800
 So the question is, what would the aliens have to say to this guy?

399
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,160
 What could they have him do?

400
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,960
 This is how the Project Blue Book article starts off.

401
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,960
 Spacecraft landing in Canada.

402
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,800
 Quote, "Interplanetary sabbath- This is a government document, by the way.

403
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:34,040
 Unless this has been forged, which it would be an odd forgery because none of the- it's

404
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,000
 really hard to make these connections.

405
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,960
 But let's assume this is actually from Project Blue Book.

406
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,780
 A government paper."

407
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:49,220
 Quote, "Interplanetary sabotage with whole planets as the stake is a new concept, and

408
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,220
 one I feel will grow.

409
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:56,700
 So too, with the chain reacting of mineral and metal stock while still in the ground.

410
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,180
 The nuclear physics has been carefully checked by an authority.

411
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:05,860
 The facts, and my own speculative thinking about them, are quite in line with material

412
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,700
 given to us by GL."

413
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:19,080
 I hope the BSR will again scoop the power and pelf-simions on this.

414
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,800
 What?

415
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,800
 What is BSR?

416
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,720
 Again, I'm sure someone who really knows about Project Blue Book could figure out what BSR

417
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,720
 is.

418
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,720
 What's power and pelf?

419
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,720
 I actually had a look that up.

420
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,320
 That was an old timey.

421
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:37,120
 Again, generally it could be a forgery, it could be a fake, but a way you could tell that

422
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,340
 it's not fake is there'll be old terms in there.

423
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,460
 Power and pelf means dirty money.

424
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:47,220
 It's a very, very old timey word.

425
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:52,540
 So I hope the BSR will again scoop the power and pelf-simions on this.

426
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:56,100
 Simions as in apes, simions as in us.

427
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:01,020
 Who are the BSR and why are they trying to scoop the corrupt people?

428
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:04,420
 The corrupt humans on this idea.

429
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:08,360
 The person when he says speculative thoughts on this stuff, again, he says that the guy

430
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:14,760
 never says what the aliens wanted him to do, but he's standing around a nickel mine.

431
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,200
 He's outside the nickel capital.

432
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,320
 You have all of this nickel in this area.

433
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:25,280
 This is what the author of the Project Blue Book article thinks is going on.

434
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,960
 Around this time there was a theory of something called a cobalt bomb.

435
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,440
 Basically it was a salted earth bomb.

436
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,640
 Assaulted bomb is what they called it.

437
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,620
 It was a bomb that was used to maximize nuclear fallout.

438
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:44,100
 Most bombs, nuclear bombs go off, destroy a bunch of buildings, kill a bunch of people.

439
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:49,020
 You want minimal fallout, so you can go and move your troops in and take over an area.

440
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,940
 A cobalt bomb would be maximum radioactive fallout.

441
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:56,300
 It would be to destroy an area for thousands of years.

442
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,300
 Here's his quote.

443
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:03,340
 "It is conceivable, in terms of space being science at least, that the nickel and the nickel

444
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:08,640
 mine could be chain reacted into cobalt 60, right in the ground.

445
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:15,720
 All it might need is some simple form of triggering fuse, i.e. a neutron emitter, to start a reaction.

446
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:21,480
 A spoonful of cobalt 60 is equal to all the radium ever produced or in existence in the

447
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,800
 world today.

448
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:27,520
 This is why the cobalt bomb is giving the world a case of king size jitters."

449
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,280
 So the alien.

450
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,160
 This is the theory that they are putting forward in Project Blue Book.

451
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,860
 And this is kind of the theory that people believe in.

452
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,380
 Rob Morphe was leading towards this as well.

453
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,700
 And again I got most of my research from him.

454
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,460
 I had to do a bunch of side other stuff.

455
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,540
 We'll get to that in a second.

456
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,300
 But, they could have, the alien, the theory is this.

457
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:49,880
 The aliens wanted to put something down the mine shaft that would start a chain reaction

458
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,260
 that would basically irradiate the entire planet in one go.

459
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,700
 And the, NEO said, "I'm never gonna do that."

460
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:02,100
 And the aliens just kind of shut him down and then he woke up and the aliens were gone.

461
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,120
 Even in the Project Blue Book thing he's going, "I don't know if that's pot."

462
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,760
 I mean technically, and he uses that term space being science at least, which is basically

463
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,960
 he's saying, "In the world of science fiction, if aliens can visit from another planet, they

464
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,800
 could possibly have some sort of advice that could turn nickel to cobalt 60.

465
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,320
 They're close on the periodic table.

466
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,760
 It might be possible.

467
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,480
 If they did that, it would completely destroy the planet.

468
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,800
 It would irradiate the entire planet.

469
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,800
 We'd be dead.

470
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,960
 We have no way to stop it."

471
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,660
 And NEO just kind of disappears into history as well.

472
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,580
 We don't really find out what happened to him.

473
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,460
 We do know that he never changed his story.

474
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,180
 He continued to talk about this.

475
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,140
 In 1956 he was 23.

476
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:45,260
 You know, he would be like 90 years old at this point.

477
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:48,500
 But he just kind of disappeared into history.

478
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:53,640
 And again, this story is so, it's not known at all.

479
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,100
 You can go through the show notes and you can try looking it up on your own, but you're

480
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,760
 going to have a very hard time finding anything about the Garcon invaders.

481
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:04,000
 Because I looked to verify the story over and over again.

482
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,520
 I did come across, like I said, that website that was a list of news articles involving

483
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,240
 UFOs in the Sudbury area.

484
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,640
 This is an interesting one.

485
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:21,680
 I did find the actual article referring to NEO's story, as well as 40 other articles

486
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,320
 from 1914 to 1977 of UFOs of this area.

487
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,180
 Sudbury has a population of about 50,000 people.

488
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,780
 40 articles is a lot.

489
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:34,820
 And going back to 1914, before the UFO flap even started.

490
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:38,860
 So it does seem to be that there were a lot of UFO sightings.

491
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:42,620
 Project Blue Book says this is the first time aliens were seen there.

492
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:47,100
 But you can go back and see all these sightings of fireballs in the sky.

493
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,100
 Here's a quote.

494
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,460
 I know we're doing a lot of quotes on this, but I think it's important to get the first

495
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,740
 hand accounts on these articles and these stories.

496
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:56,920
 Because this is really, if you haven't listened to the Crypto Knot podcast, which I haven't.

497
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:02,520
 But if you haven't looked at this, you've never heard this information before.

498
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,320
 I've never heard this information before.

499
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,600
 I've been following the stuff, UFO stuff, since I was 12.

500
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,480
 This is a brand new story for me.

501
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,600
 It's absolutely bizarre that this story's not more out there.

502
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,360
 This might be one of the reasons why though.

503
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,360
 Because here's this quote.

504
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,920
 "Squadron leader king" and there was a guy who works for the Royal Canadian Air Force.

505
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,080
 He said that he can...

506
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,080
 Here's the quote.

507
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,340
 "Squad he conducted an investigation into the report" and this is regarding the Garcon

508
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,340
 story with NEO.

509
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:34,340
 "He conducted an investigation into the report and quote, 'actually found it to be fictitious.'

510
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:39,300
 It just didn't cooperate with anything of what it should be."

511
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,460
 He commented.

512
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:47,780
 "When asked what it should be, King commented that it is classified information."

513
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,500
 So he goes, "Listen, I don't believe this story.

514
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,220
 Sure, I don't think NEO saw these aliens.

515
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,560
 It just doesn't make sense.

516
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,880
 It doesn't cooperate with anything that we know these things should be."

517
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,760
 The reporter goes, "What?

518
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,760
 Okay, so what should they be?"

519
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,120
 And he just goes, "That's classified."

520
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,360
 So they're obviously running into things up here.

521
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,040
 And so you have this young man go, "Listen, these aliens, these insects showed up and

522
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,040
 they told me something.

523
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,160
 I'm not going to tell you what it was, but they told me to do something awful.

524
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,160
 Please throw me in jail."

525
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,320
 And the Canadian Air Force's response is, "We think you're lying because what we've

526
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,420
 heard from other people is different than what you're telling us."

527
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,980
 And then you go, "Well, what have you heard from other people?"

528
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,540
 And they go, "We're not going to tell you that.

529
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,780
 That's classified."

530
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:31,180
 So they're definitely having some sort of encounters up there.

531
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:36,780
 You have aliens who visit Earth, talk to a young man, and give him an order that he

532
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,220
 refuses to do.

533
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,660
 Says he'd rather die than do it.

534
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:49,700
 You have a minister who has a popular Bible radio broadcast who may have been using it

535
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:58,440
 as a cover to travel around the Northern Hemisphere gathering information on UFOs for the government.

536
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:04,440
 You have the Royal Canadian Air Force saying that the story's fictitious because it doesn't

537
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:10,480
 match what they already know to be true about aliens.

538
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:19,980
 And you have a story that is completely disappeared from modern UFO lore.

539
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:29,060
 There are so many stories that are provably false about aliens that are shilled every

540
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:33,020
 single day.

541
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:37,340
 And that's what makes these ones stand out.

542
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:41,840
 The stories that you don't hear about yet have tons of evidence.

543
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:47,200
 The aliens themselves may not have landed, but there was so much investigation put into

544
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,600
 the story at the time to look into it.

545
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:58,400
 And all of that, it's not even been debunked, it's simply being ignored.

546
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,320
 We can talk about the Nazca Lions over and over and over again.

547
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,560
 That has been debunked.

548
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,040
 We know who made those, why they made them.

549
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,020
 It had nothing to do with aliens.

550
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:13,060
 I can guarantee you can type Nazca Lions into Google and you'll get more websites about

551
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:17,380
 aliens than you will about their actual function and why they were made.

552
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:21,900
 We know why they were made, how they were made, everything like that.

553
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,820
 But this story, you can find nothing.

554
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:29,460
 If it wasn't for Rob Morphe, if it wasn't for me just stumbling across his website,

555
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:32,900
 never would have known about this story.

556
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:40,960
 It was so documented and detailed at the time and now it's pretty much lost.

557
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,480
 And is it lost because there's no meat to it?

558
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,960
 Is it lost because it's not true?

559
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:54,200
 Or is it lost because it contains an element that is so frightening?

560
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:59,120
 It's beyond ancient aliens and reptilians running the British government.

561
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:05,300
 It's an element of us having a weakness built into our planet like we're basically an organic

562
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,020
 death star.

563
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:15,060
 That we have been drilling holes into the earth to dig out nickel.

564
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:21,380
 And what we've really been doing is building a weak point into our planet.

565
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:27,220
 That at any point, anyone or anything with technology that we don't have, that we don't

566
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:35,760
 understand, can put something in there and destroy everything in the blink of an eye.

567
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:44,200
 Is the story so dangerous that it's been covered up simply by being ignored?

568
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:49,560
 What would have happened if a different man had been outside that mine at 5pm on June

569
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,480
 2nd, 1954?

570
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,620
 A weaker man.

571
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:03,700
 A man who didn't care about the fate of the world.

572
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,700
 NEO may have faded into obscurity.

573
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:10,740
 He may have been ridiculed by the people he told his story to.

574
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:18,220
 But it's possible NEO actually saved the world.

575
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:32,760
 That's all folks.

576
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:39,760
 Bye.

577
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,340
 (upbeat music)
