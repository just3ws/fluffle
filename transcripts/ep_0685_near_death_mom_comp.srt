00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 When a spirit of vengeance enters the battlefields of the Civil War, all bets are off.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 And then we traveled to Chile to meet a young mother who was having a good time kayaking with her friends.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Everything was going according to plan until she died and then came back from the dead today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 [Music]

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Perpner. I'm having a great day.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. Hope you guys are finding some way to beat the heat coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 On the back of a crazy crustacean, it's William Wilson. Everyone give a round of applause to William Wilson.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 He's on this little crap ch ch ch ch ch ch ch. I read the other day that the voice of Sebastian the Crab died.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Actually, that's a good lead-in. It's a good segue. Later. I'm not going to segue right now, but we're going to talk about Death this episode.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Did you hear that? The voice of Sebastian the Crab died recently. And I know I'm really bringing you to the beginning of the show.

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 I'm in a childhood song. All those childhood songs you love so much. William's sitting there. He's looking at this crab. He's saying, "It's dead. It's this dead crab."

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 William, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode. If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Just help spread the word about the show. That's how you do your part to expand the Fluffle family.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Talk about it on Instagram, Facebook, wherever you guys hang out online. That is how you support the show as well.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 William, we're going to toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Dune Buggy. This is another vehicle we haven't used in a while.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Dune Buggy. We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We are headed out to Fletcher, North Carolina.

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 A group of Union soldiers is getting their butt kicked in the town of Fletcher, North Carolina. And so the order has been given to retreat. 1865 is towards the end of the war, if you don't know your US Civil War history.

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 But not every single battle was going smoothly at that point. The war was still on. The Union would eventually triumph.

21
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 But in this particular town, the South had the upper hand. And so the Union troops are retreating from town. And they know, you know, when they invaded the South, it was a lot of guerrilla actions on this part of the Confederacy.

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 And you had a lot of locals spying for the Confederacy, giving out troop positions and things like that.

23
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 So they knew that this wasn't necessarily just a military route. There was other factors that caused the Union to have to flee the city. So when they see a young woman on a horse wearing a Confederate cape, it's like the big, wool, gray capes that the Confederate soldiers would wear.

24
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 They see her galloping away on this horse.

25
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 The commander of this particular platoon of soldiers goes "Okay, let's get her and figure out if she knows anything." His eyes go from side to side, they're gonna execute her.

26
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 But technically he just says "We'll interrogate her," as he's trying to shoot her in the brain. She's riding away on her horse. The Union troops are riding after her. And it's really a win-win for the Union troops. They gotta leave town anyways.

27
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 And she's headed on the way out of town.

28
00:03:47,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 And she gallops past Calvary Episcopal Church. "Clop, clop, clop, clop, clop." And then the Union troops "Clop, clop, clop, clop, clop, clop." Follow after her. They can't catch her.

29
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 No matter how close they get to her, she always seems a little bit farther away. And again, at this point, they've stopped trying to catch her. They actively have their guns raised. They're trying to shoot her as she's galloping away.

30
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 But they can't even get in firing distance of this woman.

31
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 And then the woman vanishes.

32
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 And then all the Union troops kinda look at each other, right? They pause their horses.

33
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 One of the horses was the cryptkeeper. And they go "Sir, did you see that?" And the other one's like "I sure did, Jimmy."

34
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 And that was super bizarre. People shouldn't just disappear. And then he looks down in mid-sentence. He was so rudely interrupted by a projectile going into his stomach.

35
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 "Ugh, how rude!" And then the other Union soldiers are like "I've taken a very long way to explain. For some reason, I don't know why I'm dragging this on so long."

36
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 All 20 soldiers are massacred on this spot. Slow motion bullets. "Bwaah, naah, uuugh." They died. They died. Right there.

37
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 It was a Confederate ambush. Or was it?

38
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 The Confederate troops were just kinda hanging out. But when they see the troops galloping, they get in position.

39
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 And when the troops ride by them, they open fire and it's completely uncontested. All these Union soldiers are killed. 20 are killed on the spot.

40
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Now of course some get away and they tell the commander "Yeah, this woman is definitely helping the South. She's wearing a Confederate cape. She let her men into an ambush."

41
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 And the general goes "Dagnabbit, do whatever it takes to find this woman."

42
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 And then the guy technically should have said "Oh, should have added the part where she disappeared into the ether." And the general was like "What?"

43
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 "You should have said, you should have led with that part. There, a woman disappeared that we were trying to follow."

44
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Let's go back in time even earlier. It's the year 1861. It's April. The Civil War is a few weeks away.

45
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 Rumblings in Washington and Rumblings in whatever the capital was in the South. There was a Confederacy, so there is a bunch of different capitals.

46
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 But you had Rumblings all over the place. People were talking about shooting each other in the brains. People always talk about that.

47
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 People were talking about shooting their own family members, their own countrymen in the brains. They were doing it for years and years and years.

48
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 And now we're just a couple of weeks away from the start of the Civil War. A young couple, we're going to call them "Man."

49
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Jeremiah, we're going to call the woman "Melissa." They just get married in North Carolina.

50
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 And they only get a few weeks of marital bliss before the knock.

51
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 It's a bunch of young men from town and they're like "Hey, Jeremiah." It took them a second to remember his name. It took them a second to remember his name.

52
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 They almost called him Johnny. "Hey, Jeremiah." Before you draft someone into the war, it's polite to know their name.

53
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 "Hey, Jeremiah." You ready to fight for the South? You ready to fight for the Confederacy?

54
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Jeremiah goes, "You know what? Yes. You just take a lot of convincing. It's a total pushover. Yes, I will fight for the Confederacy."

55
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 And so Molly, what was her name? Melissa. Melissa doesn't want him to go.

56
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 But Jeremiah, we've only been married for a couple weeks. You can't go. That's her argument.

57
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 Not the fact that they're fighting to have slaves. Not that they're fighting to keep this horrible mechanism in place.

58
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 Oh well, we can talk about that later, but we've only been married for a few weeks. She can't do this.

59
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 And Jeremiah's like, "Listen, Melissa, I know that war is scary, but it's also kind of rad.

60
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 So I might come back with just like a little bandage on my head, or I might come back at all.

61
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 I might be blown apart by a cannonball. You just don't know. That's what makes war so exciting."

62
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 So he waves goodbye to Melissa, joins the Civil War. He goes off with this group of young men, and they're singing a jaunty tune.

63
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Not long afterwards, Melissa's at home alone, and she's like, "Hmm, I wonder what Jeremiah's up to. I wonder if he's gotten that cool scar yet."

64
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 She's knocking at her door. It sounds a little more like a feeble knock. Sounds a little distraught.

65
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 She sees one of the young men who came to the house not too long ago to recruit Jeremiah, and he's covered in bandages.

66
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 They probably could have sent a better messenger to deliver this story, not the most gruesome survivor of whatever happened.

67
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 They could have at least sent like a gentleman. They sent the mummy, they sent mumra out, and he goes, "Listen, I know you were kind of promised a sexy scar."

68
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Yeah, the Civil War is not that great. It's not going to turn out really good for us in the end either.

69
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 And your husband, Jeremiah, was killed on the battlefield. I was about to say, "Blow into bits." I don't think anyone would say that to a grieving widow.

70
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 But I want you to have this. And the bandaged man, the bandaged man who appears in several urban legends after this, the bandaged man holds up a heavy gray wool Confederate cape.

71
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 And he goes, "Your loved one, Jeremiah, was wearing this when those Yankee bastards shot him."

72
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 So here you go, here you go, hope you know how to clean it. It's covered in blood and gory. He gives her this Confederate cape and she wears it all over town.

73
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 She's like, "I have a grocery store." We're like, "Dude, we know that you miss your loved one, but could you please clean his brain out of that wool?"

74
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 No, this is still a part of him. There's rats following her around. It's like a really twisted Disney movie. She never remarries.

75
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 And she doesn't remarry because she died a few months later. She's like, "Oh, that bandaged man, I bet he was cute underneath all those bandages."

76
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 She definitely doesn't remarried. She dies a few months later of a broken heart.

77
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 And then we have the first sighting of her was four years later, when these Union soldiers were trying to get out of town and they saw the Phantom of a Woman wearing a gray Confederate cape in front of them.

78
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 To this day, people of Fletcher, North Carolina say you can still see this woman riding through town. Her ghostly steed clipped cloppyding down the city streets after sunset.

79
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Her heavy Confederate coat still riddled with bullet holes.

80
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 [laughs]

81
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 Again, that was a horse, not a Crypt Keeper noise.

82
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 This is part of, like I said this week's theme, is "Hope You Like Ghost Stories." And I do hope you like ghost stories. I love ghost stories. We don't cover enough of them on this show.

83
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 We talked about these all week long, and I've talked about how ghost stories are like urban legends and how ghost stories are created and things like that.

84
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 We're really not going to go into that deep of it with this thing, because there's some other interesting things going on.

85
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 One, once again, for the third time in a week, and I've said this so many times on the show, it's super rare to find a ghost connected to the death of a human.

86
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Three times this week, we've covered ghosts that have had, in one way or another, a hand in the murder of a human, or in her case, 20.

87
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 20. This woman's erected quite the body count. So the story stands out just because of that.

88
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Very rare that we come across the, now we're coming across them a lot.

89
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 I think before this week, we might have covered three total.

90
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 So that's fascinating. Whether or not it's historically true, I really wasn't able to find out.

91
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 There are some issues I have with it.

92
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 What? I mean, some people just say ghosts don't exist, Jason. That should be your biggest thing, but I do believe ghosts exist.

93
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 But it has to have, there's a bunch of things that have to happen.

94
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 We don't have the name of this couple. If this woman was actually responsible for the slaughter of 20 Union soldiers,

95
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 people should at least remember her name, right?

96
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 But I do just find this story interesting. We have a spirit of vengeance, and it doesn't have a happy ending.

97
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 I was hoping, as I was reading the story, I was hoping, even though she fought for the South and got all these young men murdered,

98
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 I was hoping that in the end, she would find her ghost dude.

99
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Like he would show up. He might be floating around my Casper, and they're riding on that horse together.

100
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Like, but no, it's such a dismal ending.

101
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 William, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Carbentercopter. We are leaving behind Fletcher, North Carolina.

102
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 And we are headed out to Southern Chile.

103
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 So when I was talking earlier about the guy, I mean, it's so funny. I said Sebastian, the guy who voiced Sebastian Crabb tight.

104
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 I don't even know his name. But, I mean, obviously, like, that was a dope movie.

105
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 It's bummer, right? Because we all know that voice. We all have listened to those songs.

106
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 I think anyone could sing "Kiss the Girl" or "Under the Sea" by heart.

107
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Maybe. Maybe it's a generational thing, but at the same time, it's funny because I've talked about this on the show before.

108
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 I have this weird thing with death where I overthink it. Where I absolutely overthink it.

109
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Because I think life is so awesome. Life is so amazing that I can touch all the molecules of the wood, and, like, some tree died to become part of this closet, and, like, I can touch it.

110
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 You know what I mean? Like, it's just all this stuff, like, tasting food and sunbeams on your skin and things like that.

111
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Because all I know is being alive. And I value life.

112
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 So when someone's not alive anymore, I can't comprehend that.

113
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 And I'm Christian, so I have a belief system. Like, I believe that when you die, you go to paradise.

114
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 But I don't understand what paradise is. Like, are there streets? Is there gravity? Is there sunlight?

115
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 And if it's sunlight, can you feel it on your skin? Is it ever too hot? Is it ever too cold?

116
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Because these are all things that happen in real life. And when it's too cold, or when it's raining outside, I'll grab a blanket and I'll cuddle up.

117
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 I'm a grandma. But you know what I mean? You never think of drinking hot cocoa on a summer day.

118
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 But when it's stormy outside and it's kind of cold, that's when you think, "Oh, I wonder if I have any of that Swiss misleft."

119
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 And you look at it expired, expired two years ago, and you're like, "I'll take my chances."

120
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 You don't do that on a summer day, so...

121
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Yeah, yeah. The only time you ever eat del taco is when it's three in the morning and everything else is closed and you're stoned.

122
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 No one eats del taco under any other circumstances.

123
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 So I overthink, like, the physics of death.

124
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Now, some of you are atheists. I have a lot of good friends who are atheists or agnostic and they just say, "When you die, that's it."

125
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 So I just enjoy life, and I know at some point it's going to end. That... I just don't... I can't comprehend that.

126
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 I can't, like... I mean, obviously I'm still their friends, I'm not like, "Ahhhhh!" running away from them.

127
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 We have good conversations. We don't talk about it all the time.

128
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 But I've had good conversations with my friends who don't share my belief system, but I just... I have a hard time comprehending it.

129
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 And I can only think when somebody passes away, I hope they're in a better place.

130
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 I believe they're in a better place, honestly.

131
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 I believe they're in a better place. My idea of, like, redemption and paradise and things like that, I think are a bit different than other people.

132
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Even other people who share my religious beliefs, but that's... I've talked about that on the podcast before. I've done too much of an intro.

133
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 But I... when Sebastian the Crab, when the voice of Sebastian the Crab dies, I go, "I hope that man's in a better place."

134
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 "Hope he's in a better place."

135
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 So when I come across stories like this, on the one hand it is very abstract to me.

136
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 And on the other hand it is nice.

137
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 It's 1999, we're in Southern Chile.

138
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Dr. Mary Neal, she's a mother and an orthopedic spine surgeon, is kayaking with her friends.

139
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Weeeeeee! Splash, splash, weeeeeee! Splash, splash! They're like, "What are you, 7?" Weeeeeee!

140
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 She stops weeing at a certain point because her kayak actually goes over a waterfall.

141
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Now that was planned, apparently. It was part of the Daredevil tour she was on.

142
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 But when it goes over the waterfall, she actually goes underwater.

143
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 And the water is like pushing her down. It's keeping down the kayak.

144
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 She goes 10 feet underwater and the power of the water... maybe this wasn't planned, maybe this wasn't accident.

145
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 They're like, "Loser, see what the is! See what the end of the river!"

146
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 She goes off the waterfall, I'm assuming accidental now, and the power of the waterfall is actually keeping her underwater.

147
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 She gets submerged and she's stuck underwater for 12 minutes.

148
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 She's under there for 12 minutes, they can't get to her because the power of the water is pushing her down.

149
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 They end up calling rescue crews. I'm sure she was a doctor herself, she's probably hanging out with other doctors.

150
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 But an EMT rescue crew does get to the area, they pull her out of the water, and this is how they described her, quote,

151
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 "Blue, waxy, no heartbeat, no breathing, cold to the touch, dead."

152
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 That's when they pulled her out of the water, it was another 12 minutes.

153
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 She went without oxygen. She is resuscitated, zero brain damage.

154
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 It's like she took a deep nap.

155
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Now I read that, and I was like, "This is BS."

156
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 On the one hand it has a lot of stuff I really like, specific names, job titles, I love when there's job titles.

157
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 What did Jeremiah do before the Civil War?

158
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 It was very, very specific information, Dr. Mary Neal.

159
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 The date isn't specific, the location, Southern Chile, is not super specific.

160
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 But I read this and I go, "This sounds fake, you can't be dead, you can't not breathe for 24 minutes."

161
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 She was under water for 12 minutes, maybe she held her breath for the first two or three.

162
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 But still there's another 19 minutes that she's not breathing, it's not true.

163
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 This story is so well documented.

164
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Like I originally found it on this website, Iloveanomalien.com, but when I looked into it, she was...

165
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Okay, I'm not saying that this is the most reputable website, but she was on Oprah.

166
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 She was on Oprah.com, she was on HuffingtonPost.com.

167
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 And then though this story is in the clinicaloncology.com website as a medical journal.

168
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 This is a real story, she did come out of this with absolutely no brain damage.

169
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 So you go, "What happened to you?"

170
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 She's like, "Well, I was in a kayak and I went, "No, no, we know about the kayak thing."

171
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 "You didn't breathe for 24 minutes, you were dead."

172
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 "Cold to the touch, dead."

173
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Very, very famous story, she's told this many, many times.

174
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 And you could say she's faking it, but it's pretty hard to fake not breathing for 24 minutes.

175
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 She's standing in a place that she describes as so beautiful, it had, quote, "no earthly equivalent."

176
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 This place was pure bliss.

177
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 She sees a short distance away from her, a huge domed structure.

178
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 And she can't wait to get there.

179
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 She doesn't know what's in there, but she knows this is her new home and she can't wait to find out what's in the dome.

180
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 She gets there and she sees what she describes as beans.

181
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 They looked like people, but she could tell there was something that elevated them above mere humans.

182
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 They were wearing robes, very, very traditional garb that we find in religious ceremonies all over the world.

183
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 And when she entered the dome, she felt their love.

184
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 They were so joyful.

185
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 They were so happy to see her here.

186
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 They told her they were there to guide her and to protect her.

187
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 They would always be there to guide her and protect her, but she's not ready to go with them.

188
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 It's not her time.

189
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Now, Dr. Mary Neal, she has her patience that she cares about.

190
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 She has her family that she loves.

191
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 She has her children that she birthed into the world.

192
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 She loves more than anything.

193
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 But as she's in this domed structure, she's looking at these people and they tell her, "It's not your time. You have to go back."

194
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 She refuses.

195
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 "I want to stay here. I don't want to be alive anymore.

196
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 This is where I belong, but it's not her time."

197
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 And they actually force her, actually, these gentle spirits have to force her to go back.

198
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 They don't say it was physical force. They're like, "We'll guide you, all right. We'll guide you back to the land of the living."

199
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 They do force her to go back. They say, "You still have work to do. You still have to take care of things."

200
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 And Mary, you need to know something.

201
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 Your oldest son, Willie, we're going to see him before we see you again.

202
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 He will pass away, but we want you to know that he's going to be here with us.

203
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 We will guide and protect him like we are meant to guide and protect you.

204
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 [GASPING]

205
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Mary starts breathing again. She is, once again, alive.

206
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 She begins to share this story to her loved ones.

207
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 Because that was obviously the first-- even the doctors that were there were like, "What was going on when you weren't breathing for 24 minutes?"

208
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 She would share this story, but she always left out one detail.

209
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 The death of Willie.

210
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 Maybe this was all just a dream, and there's no reason to alarm anybody.

211
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 Maybe it was the fading synapses, firing their last bolts of energy that created this image.

212
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 Maybe if she never mentioned it, it wouldn't come true.

213
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 Ten years after the event, she's told this story hundreds of times.

214
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 She actually writes a book about her journey.

215
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 After she finishes writing the book, ring, ring, ring, ring, she gets a phone call.

216
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 She picks up the phone. She finds out that Willie had just died in a car accident.

217
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 He was killed by a distracted driver.

218
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 Someone was fiddling around on their cell phone. Killed her son.

219
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 The story of Dr. Mary Neal is a fascinating story on many different levels.

220
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 One just on a medical story, somebody coming back to life after 24 minutes.

221
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 We've come across stories like that before.

222
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 I don't think I've ever covered them on the show, but just in general, people being frozen.

223
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 People who should have died.

224
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 They apparently avoided a giant wheat thrusher coming out of them, but people who were frozen and their heart rate dropped so low,

225
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 and they couldn't breathe for a long period of time, and then once they're thought out, they're totally fine.

226
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 I'm wondering now how cold the water was, if it was able to slow down her heart rate or brain activity.

227
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 That was one of the reasons why she lived, but just as a medical story, it's an interesting feat.

228
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 It's a miracle, really. It's a miracle.

229
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 Then we have the idea of the near-death, or in her case, death experience, right? She did die.

230
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 She was cold to the touch, waxy and blue.

231
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 And she sees these beautiful images, which is what you want to hear, right?

232
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 I think even someone who didn't believe in an afterlife would go, "Well, if there is an afterlife, that is pretty cool."

233
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 It's just beautiful and love and peace, and people are there for you, and I would love for that.

234
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 I think everyone would love that type of afterlife.

235
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 The imagery may be different depending on your belief system, but just that sensation of belonging.

236
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Something... you know what I mean?

237
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 So we have that, and then the prophecy.

238
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 The death of a child, I don't have children myself.

239
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 The idea of having children absolutely terrifies me.

240
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 To me, that's one of the scariest things.

241
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 I talk about being turned into a human pig.

242
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 I talk about... that's really my main concern, is being turned into something against my will.

243
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 Like, turned into a tree or a rock or something like that. That's the scariest thing.

244
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 That's the second scariest thing, zombies.

245
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 But the chances of either of those happening are...

246
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 For me, they're higher than the average person, but still, they're not the most common thing.

247
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 Having a child terrifies me.

248
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 All my friends have had children. All the friends that I grew up with have all had children by now.

249
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 And the thought terrifies me to have a little person that's so fragile and stupid and weak.

250
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 I've basically become Omni-Man yelling at my son.

251
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 They're so weak, and anything could kill them. They could step on a rusty tag.

252
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 Stuff that I could bear. Stuff that has never killed me.

253
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 Stepping on nails and getting attacked by wild animals and coming down with diseases and stuff that have never, ever, ever killed me.

254
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 Could kill my child, and that terrifies me more than anything.

255
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 I don't even have kids, and I'm scared of them dying.

256
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 I can't imagine what it would be like to lose a child.

257
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 I can't imagine that.

258
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 But, I can't imagine that because my idea of death in the afterlife is based on faith.

259
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 I don't know.

260
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 I want to believe that great-grandma McGee, who I love so dearly, and grandma Miller, and grandpa Miller, and aunt Rosemary, and uncle Danny, and aunt Jackie, and all these people that I love throughout my life who have passed on.

261
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 I hope they're doing good. I hope they're in a better place. I hope my uncle Jeff is healed.

262
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 And had a whole episode on him, and I hope that the tragedy he went through is healed now.

263
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 And he's in this blissful place. But it's faith that I believe they are there. I don't know.

264
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 And I won't know until I'm either there or I'm not.

265
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 I don't have total faith. But Dr. Mary didn't have to have faith.

266
00:27:51,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 It's horrible that she lost her son. But she has to know where he's at.

267
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 She has to know he's there, in that place, right now, enveloped in pure love.

268
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 Some of us can just visualize the afterlife, or hope, for that type of paradise.

269
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 But Dr. Mary Neal knows for sure. It's a sad story, on a physical sense, but it's a hopeful story, on a spiritual sense.
