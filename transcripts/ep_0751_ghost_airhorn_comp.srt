1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
 A young athlete is driving home after a fearsome competition.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,880
 He's hoping to have a relaxing drive.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,360
 Instead, he comes face to face with an eerie apparition.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,160
 And then we take a look at a personal conspiracy theory of mine that I've mentioned before on this show,

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,600
 but now other people seem to be agreeing with me.

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,280
 Well, delve into that topic.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:29,280
 And finally, what happens when the world of the paranormal turns absurd today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,200
 I'm a wild freak down.

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,200
 Actually, I'm a wild freak down.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,880
 I'm your host Jason Garbiner.

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,160
 I'm having a great day.

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,600
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,640
 Hope you guys are slightly less sweaty than I am.

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,040
 I don't know why it's so hot in this closet all of a sudden, but speaking of hot,

16
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,760
 speaking of being our sexiest Patreon supporter,

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,840
 coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now is our legacy Patreon supporter, Zech.

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,200
 Give a round of applause to Zech.

19
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,640
 Take a little picture with him.

20
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,160
 Sexy sexy Patreon supporter.

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,480
 You're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

22
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,760
 You guys can't avoid the Patreon.

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,120
 I totally understand.

24
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,120
 Just help spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

25
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,160
 Zech, I'm going to go and entice you the keys to the Jason Jet.

26
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,080
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,440
 We are headed all the way out to Sweden.

28
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:27,520
 Zech is perfectly piloting this Jason Jet all the way out to Sweden.

29
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,680
 This story was actually recommended to me by the guy it happened to.

30
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:39,440
 Long time supporter of the show, Ampus Allen, is now a world athletic champion.

31
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,920
 Now, I don't want to tell you what sport it is.

32
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,120
 I don't want to dox the dude, but he is a world champion at a particular sport.

33
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,680
 So I don't know, pool, skydiving?

34
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,400
 Is that a sport?

35
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,360
 Is that actually a sport?

36
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,120
 Do you get points for skydiving?

37
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,080
 Swimmer? Who knows?

38
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,640
 Could be all three of the things.

39
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,920
 He could be playing pool, what skydiving, into a lake.

40
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,280
 But I don't want to dox the dude.

41
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,560
 I'm sure his manager is like, "What? You listen to that insanity?"

42
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,800
 So Ampus Allen, he's world champion though.

43
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,480
 I wanted to give a tip of the hat for that.

44
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,680
 Really, really amazing dude.

45
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,720
 And this story happens on August 21st, 2021.

46
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,160
 So incredibly recent.

47
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,760
 He was just leaving behind a finals match for his particular sport.

48
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,400
 This competition in Sweden, he was headed back home.

49
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,320
 It's a nice long drive from Fagestra to his home.

50
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,400
 Which he gets, he's like, "Here's where I live.

51
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,160
 I'm not going to try to dox this guy."

52
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,840
 You can just start drawing random lines from Fagestra in Sweden,

53
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,880
 and maybe you'll find this guy.

54
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,920
 It's 6pm.

55
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,240
 He's so happy that he won the competition.

56
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,440
 Dude, I'm so dope.

57
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,640
 He's driving his car.

58
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,320
 I'm sure he has a giant ego.

59
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,240
 He's making love to the trophy in the car.

60
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,160
 He's driving down the road.

61
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,680
 And in about an hour outside of Fagestra, there's dense forest.

62
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,560
 So the rolling countryside of Sweden has given away to trees all gnarled and spooky.

63
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,560
 The Berenstein Bears are climbing in one of them.

64
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,400
 And he's driving through this forest.

65
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,760
 He didn't specify that it was a spooky cartoon forest.

66
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,080
 And like the trees had eyes and they're like, "Come here.

67
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,040
 Eat this apple."

68
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,080
 Just a normal forest.

69
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,960
 He's probably, he estimates,

70
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,680
 20 to 30 kilometers from the nearest village.

71
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,880
 So quite a ways off.

72
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,480
 And while he's driving down this road, he sees

73
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,080
 a young girl.

74
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,920
 He's coming down this straight path and he's seeing this girl walk on the edge of the forest.

75
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,320
 Like she's just exiting this super dense forest.

76
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,880
 And he goes, "I would assume she was about six to seven years old."

77
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,680
 And she had on her winter clothes.

78
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,680
 He said it was like 70 degrees out that day.

79
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,200
 He wouldn't be wearing such heavy clothes.

80
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,960
 But he goes, "She was wearing this wintery clothes outfit."

81
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,720
 And she was pink from head to toe.

82
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,400
 He said that she looked like she was innocent.

83
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,960
 She looked like the stereotypical young girl.

84
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:02,320
 Which if you saw her outside of a daycare center

85
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,920
 or an elementary school or something like that,

86
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,040
 you wouldn't think twice about it.

87
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,000
 But driving through this forest in the middle of nowhere,

88
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,240
 she definitely sticks out.

89
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,400
 He says that she's maybe, at this point now,

90
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,800
 she walks out of the forest and she's standing maybe a foot from the road.

91
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,560
 And he's just driving and he's looking at her.

92
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,240
 And she doesn't seem to be really reacting to his presence right now.

93
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,960
 He's looking at her and she looks back.

94
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,600
 She's kind of staring at Ampus.

95
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,480
 So he's driving his car and then she just turns away.

96
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,200
 And looks back into the forest.

97
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:47,120
 Ampus Allen slightly swerves his car to give her some room.

98
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,400
 Because he doesn't know what's going to happen, right?

99
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,600
 Is she going to bolt in front of the car?

100
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,040
 He's thinking logically at this point because he's in the moment,

101
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,520
 but he sees this girl so close to the road and she's so young.

102
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,960
 He gives her a little bit of room and he kind of sways around her.

103
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,400
 But she doesn't step onto the road.

104
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,120
 She's continuing to look off into the forest.

105
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,240
 After he passes her, he slows down.

106
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,560
 But he's continuing to drive down the road.

107
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,200
 And the whole time he's kind of looking at her in the rear view mirror.

108
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,440
 And she's just standing there motionlessly staring off into the distance.

109
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,360
 Until finally he travels so far he can no longer see her.

110
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,000
 She doesn't vanish.

111
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,760
 She doesn't just cut all up a tree.

112
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,840
 She doesn't appear in his back seat covered in blood.

113
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,880
 He just can't see her anymore because he's traveled so far.

114
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,800
 That happened to him and he was trying to process it.

115
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,320
 And he's thinking rationally.

116
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,440
 He's going, maybe there was an adult that I didn't see,

117
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,320
 but I should have.

118
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,320
 Like the area around us was so empty except for the trees.

119
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,360
 I didn't see any other cars coming to pick her up.

120
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,080
 I didn't see any adult walking out of the forest to get her.

121
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,320
 I don't know what she was doing there.

122
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,840
 But he's still thinking logically now.

123
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,720
 One of his friends is another Patreon supporter of the show, Stefan.

124
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,240
 I think he was just the pilot not too long ago, a couple of episodes ago.

125
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,760
 Stefan Wolnestrom.

126
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,280
 He goes, so Ampest Allen is telling Stefan this story.

127
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,400
 They're probably eating like Swedish meatballs watching Donald Duck.

128
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,160
 And Stefan goes, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, dude, you saw a ghost.

129
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,040
 That wasn't some just random little girl walking around.

130
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,680
 It was a ghost.

131
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,560
 So Ampest Allen kind of thought about it.

132
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,360
 And then he made sweet love to his trophy again,

133
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,320
 declare his mind.

134
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,520
 And then he goes, you know what, Stefan?

135
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,640
 You're probably right.

136
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,240
 I'm going to send that story to Jason.

137
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,680
 Let's see what he thinks of it.

138
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,560
 This is a really interesting story because it is so...

139
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,040
 I believe it.

140
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,320
 I believe that this actually happened.

141
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,400
 I've interacted with both of these guys several times

142
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,200
 over the course of the show.

143
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,400
 They're both really good guys.

144
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,240
 I believe that the factual event happened.

145
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,440
 The question is, was it a ghost or was it a real girl?

146
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,280
 Neither are super comforting.

147
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,960
 Right?

148
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,080
 Like if we can prove it's a ghost, then that's creepy.

149
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,920
 Little girl ghosts are the creepiest.

150
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,360
 If it was like a little boy with his Oshkosh bagosh overalls

151
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,800
 and he's like, I burned in a fire back in 1939.

152
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,520
 Like, yeah, that's super depressing, right?

153
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,680
 But a little boy ghost isn't scary.

154
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,800
 And it's funny now that I'm saying that one of the worst ghost

155
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,280
 encounters I ever had was a little boy ghost.

156
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,880
 And he followed me around for a while.

157
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,560
 So let me put an asterisk on there.

158
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,760
 A little boy ghost can be scary, but they have to work harder at it.

159
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,040
 Little girl...

160
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,760
 Girls are just creepy.

161
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,920
 Anyways, because you see them so much in horror movies.

162
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,040
 So the idea of a little girl ghost is even creepier.

163
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,240
 I think...

164
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,600
 And I think that's a social thing.

165
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,240
 I don't think there's probably anything intrinsically behind that.

166
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,760
 I think it's because they're so commonly used in horror movies,

167
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,000
 from Nightmare on Elm Street to The Ring.

168
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,720
 But so you have that.

169
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,680
 If it's a ghost, it's creepy to think that there's this lost spirit

170
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,720
 of this six or seven year old girl just standing off into the middle of the woods.

171
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,440
 And then you start to think, like, is it not a ghost?

172
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,720
 Is it some sort of skin walk or some sort of cryptid that

173
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,520
 every show often someone does stop to see if she's okay?

174
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,480
 And Amp is how it apparently is a huge jerk.

175
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,560
 And he sees this little girl in the middle of the woods,

176
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,240
 and he's like, "Ah, she's a monster."

177
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,480
 And he just drives away, right?

178
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,200
 That could be that.

179
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,000
 Now the third alternative, which is the most likely,

180
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,240
 is that it was a little girl...

181
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,400
 It was a little lost girl.

182
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,040
 It was a little lost girl who probably

183
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,200
 wandered off from her campsite at best, right?

184
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
 The worst thing would be like someone had kidnapped her.

185
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,000
 Amp is how it's gonna feel really bad about this after this story.

186
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,200
 What if someone kidnapped her and she had escaped?

187
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,600
 And she gets to the road, but you also are constant,

188
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,080
 like at that age, you know not to talk to strangers.

189
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,800
 And at what point would you trust this stranger

190
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,560
 if you'd just been kidnapped by this other stranger?

191
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,120
 So she may not have made any moves.

192
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,520
 And there's...

193
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,240
 You know that she could be a lost.

194
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,400
 She could have been looking for help and Amp is how it just drove by.

195
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,880
 But because she's so young, she's not asking for help

196
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,440
 because he's still a stranger and doesn't want to talk to strangers, stuff like that.

197
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,040
 I have a theory and I don't know how I came across this,

198
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,200
 but I have a theory that sometimes people who are kidnapped

199
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,360
 get let go to show that they can't...

200
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,280
 To show that there's no help for them.

201
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,560
 It's really, really weird and I can't point to anything in the literature

202
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,360
 I've ever seen.

203
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,800
 It's just a hunch I have.

204
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,720
 And this is a true story that happened to me.

205
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,120
 I used to work at this big retail store and they have a track.

206
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,720
 Most retail stores have this where you can just walk around the entire store.

207
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,760
 It's like a big square.

208
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,160
 And one day I'm sitting there working out the store with my buddies

209
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,480
 and I see this girl she had to have been maybe 12, 13 years old.

210
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,400
 Walk.

211
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,040
 She's walking the track of the store.

212
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,800
 I see her from far off in the distance.

213
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,480
 Like I see her at one of the corners and I'm at the opposite corner of this square.

214
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,520
 And she's wearing like five inch heels and skin tight.

215
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,840
 She's dressed like a prostitute.

216
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,320
 She's dressed like a prostitute.

217
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,280
 She's dressed like how you would take a kid and try to make them...

218
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,000
 Almost like a mimicry of what a woman looks like.

219
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,560
 Whenever you have girls under the age of like 25 try to dress sexy,

220
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,680
 it always looks off.

221
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,800
 It's almost like this weird uncanny valley effect.

222
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,080
 Like sure you can act like a sexy woman.

223
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,360
 You can walk like a sexy woman.

224
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,680
 You can put on the same makeup as a sexy woman.

225
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,080
 But women under 25 they...

226
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,160
 It's like a mimic.

227
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,520
 It's like a skin walker.

228
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,920
 There's something weird about it.

229
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,640
 Now when you're younger you don't notice it.

230
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,800
 When you're 20 and 18 or something like that those are like

231
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,920
 "I'll do these chicks they're super hot."

232
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,400
 But as you get older it does look weird.

233
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,040
 I'm standing there and I see this young girl.

234
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,040
 Early teens right?

235
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,480
 12, 13, 14 years old.

236
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,840
 She's just like a prostitute.

237
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:41,360
 And she's walking through the store and she is walking as if someone hypnotized her.

238
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,880
 She's walking like a robot.

239
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,120
 She...her walking is so mechanical that she's walking through the store

240
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,680
 and no one else is engaging with her.

241
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,960
 No one else is noticing her.

242
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,800
 And I'm sitting there talking to my buddies.

243
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,480
 We're "working".

244
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,680
 Salespeople never really work.

245
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,600
 We just chat about video games and movies.

246
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,320
 And she's walking and she walks past me.

247
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,480
 And I get the weirdest feeling from her.

248
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,440
 The weirdest feeling.

249
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,400
 And I sh...

250
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,760
 To this day, this happened years ago.

251
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,600
 To this day I wish I had said something.

252
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,600
 So like "Do you need help?"

253
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,640
 Is everything okay?

254
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,880
 Because even back then I had this conspiracy theory that sometimes when you kidnap someone

255
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,720
 you let them go to show...

256
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,240
 Not right away.

257
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,720
 Like the first day but after like a year or whatever.

258
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,040
 You say "Listen the world hates you."

259
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,400
 Like we can let you go right now.

260
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,240
 The world isn't even looking for you anymore.

261
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,760
 Go.

262
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,920
 And you take them out and you give them a sense of freedom.

263
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,120
 And then you go see.

264
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,400
 No one's even looking for you anymore.

265
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,440
 Did anyone even talk to you?

266
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,680
 Did anyone see you and think you were in distress?

267
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:37,840
 No.

268
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,520
 Because you were meant to be here.

269
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,000
 You were meant to be the sex trafficking victim or whatever.

270
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,600
 It's like a psychological game.

271
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,440
 Psychological trick.

272
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,760
 And I had thought that conspiracy theory for years.

273
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,200
 And I see this girl walking and my mind's thinking "This is it.

274
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,960
 This is the conspiracy theory that I thought."

275
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,040
 She looks like she...

276
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,840
 If anyone was an MK Ultra victim it was this girl.

277
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,920
 Like there was...

278
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,440
 She had these big sunglasses on.

279
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,320
 You couldn't see your eyes.

280
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,920
 She walked with the same pace.

281
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,040
 She wasn't looking.

282
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,160
 So I decided anything.

283
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,160
 She will face straight ahead.

284
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:08,720
 Walking.

285
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,800
 She walks to the corner of the square.

286
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,920
 Starts walking out of the square.

287
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,720
 And I tell my boys.

288
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,880
 I was like "Dude, that was super weird."

289
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,040
 I gotta see what's up.

290
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,680
 And I'm walking through the store.

291
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,120
 I'm like, you know, behind...

292
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,720
 I'm not right behind her.

293
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,480
 I'm not scrambling on the roof.

294
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,840
 Like some shadow person.

295
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,760
 I'm walking, you know, a good 20, 30 feet.

296
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,240
 And she's still the whole time face straight ahead.

297
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,760
 Not looking at anything.

298
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,880
 And she walks out the door.

299
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,080
 She didn't buy anything.

300
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,000
 She walks out the door of the store.

301
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,080
 And I just kind of walk out as well.

302
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,040
 I'm kind of standing there and I watch her walk all the way

303
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,480
 to the end of the parking lot.

304
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,880
 There's like a white nice car.

305
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,400
 Like a Lexus or something like that.

306
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,840
 And out of it is two older men get out of the car.

307
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,880
 You know, probably...

308
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,720
 Probably my age now because I have a story

309
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,120
 having a lifetime.

310
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,400
 We go probably in their 40s.

311
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,880
 She walked up to them and they talked for a bit.

312
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,920
 And I'm just kind of standing outside of the store watching them.

313
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,960
 And they kind of talk for a bit.

314
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,600
 They talk for a bit.

315
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,120
 And then she gets in the back seat and they drive away.

316
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,800
 So I always thought that there was some sort of test.

317
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,800
 Like sure, you want to leave, you think, go.

318
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,080
 You can walk away.

319
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,640
 But you'll see that no one cares.

320
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,280
 And I should have said something.

321
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,600
 I mean, just from a customer service perspective,

322
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,280
 I should have said, do you need help finding anything?

323
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,960
 You know, I could have at least done my job.

324
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,960
 But I always thought that could have been that situation.

325
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,560
 It was weird, no matter what.

326
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,640
 I don't know if they were testing out their new robot

327
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,600
 or if she was MKUltraD or what.

328
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,400
 Like who knows, it could have been some assassin training

329
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,960
 where the first person who walks up to you and says a word,

330
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,040
 you got to stab them in the neck with your blade.

331
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,880
 Who knows what it was.

332
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,200
 It was not normal by any means.

333
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,600
 The little girl dressed like that was super creepy.

334
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,800
 Her mannerisms were super creepy, what she was doing there

335
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,840
 was super bizarre.

336
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,040
 And then the ending where she's like basically getting debriefed.

337
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,720
 Watching this conversation, they get all in this car and drive away.

338
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,280
 Super bizarre.

339
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,840
 But anyways, if it's Alan, you may have come across something like that.

340
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,640
 It could have been a ghost.

341
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,720
 They're both unsettling stories.

342
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,880
 And so thank you so much for sharing it.

343
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,800
 I definitely think it was a memorable encounter.

344
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,000
 And also good luck on your future athletic endeavors.

345
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,400
 See, I'm going to go and touch the oars for the Dead Rabbit Robot.

346
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,480
 We are leaving behind Sweden.

347
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,520
 We are headed all the way out to Hollywood.

348
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,800
 Splish, splash, splash, splash, splash, manning those oars,

349
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,760
 getting a good upper body workout as we sail all the way from Sweden to Hollywood.

350
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,280
 This is a personal conspiracy theory of mine that I've had.

351
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,000
 It's not, it's one of those conspiracy theories, which is kind of my favorite.

352
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,400
 They don't, it doesn't affect your life.

353
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,240
 And I think, I've talked about this several times in the show,

354
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,680
 so I'm not going to spend a ton of time on it, but we always focus on the giant

355
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,880
 world changing conspiracy theories that may or may not be true even.

356
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,480
 They're very, very distracting, lizard people running the British government,

357
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,720
 or all governments, things like that.

358
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,240
 We're always focused on that stuff.

359
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,160
 It's the little conspiracy theories that, one, are far more likely to exist,

360
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,120
 and really far more likely to prove.

361
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,920
 And you can start kind of putting together a mosaic and say,

362
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,560
 "Oh, if all this stuff's true, then maybe this other stuff is."

363
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,600
 I've said this before on the podcast and I've said it personally.

364
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,640
 I believe that a lot of Hollywood actors use steroids.

365
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,520
 I believe that when you see these guys being like,

366
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,360
 "This guy put on 30 pounds of muscle to play this movie character."

367
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:29,840
 Anyone who's ever picked up a weight knows how hard it is to put on 30 pounds of muscle.

368
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,040
 Now there is, we covered it a long time ago on the show.

369
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,920
 I'll put it in the show notes.

370
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,480
 There's this really cool exercise technique.

371
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,440
 I forgot the name of it.

372
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,880
 It's actually in the physical fitness conspiracy theory iceberg.

373
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,680
 It's like reverse lifting weights.

374
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,240
 [laughs]

375
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,720
 That's your leg.

376
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,920
 You don't lift weights at all.

377
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,880
 You get super buffed there.

378
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,400
 They built these machines that if you use them, you put on muscles incredibly quickly.

379
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,520
 I'll put that episode in the show notes.

380
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,520
 It was really cool to talk about.

381
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,840
 But for all these superheroes, they got to be shredded.

382
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,000
 They have to be shredded to do these roles.

383
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,920
 The guy who played Vision, Jarvis, originally he was just a voiceover actor.

384
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,480
 And they go, "Hey, how good is your workout routine?"

385
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,600
 And he's, "This is your story."

386
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,320
 He goes, "What?"

387
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,040
 They go, "We want to start having vision in the movies.

388
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,080
 And we want you to be Vision, but Vision has to be super cut."

389
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,520
 Like our CGI technology, it might be able to de-age you.

390
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,720
 It might be able to turn you into a flying green dude, but it can get rid of your belly.

391
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,920
 So he had to go on a super strict diet to get abs to play the Vision.

392
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,880
 Now who is Paul Bettany?

393
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,920
 Paul Bettany was that guy.

394
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,160
 So you have this expert, you have this expectation to be physically fit.

395
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,640
 And the studio needs the movie done.

396
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,160
 This isn't something that they can be like, "Oh, no, just give me a couple more months

397
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:42,960
 to put on this."

398
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,600
 No, the studio is like, "The movie's getting shot now.

399
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,080
 We cast you. Who's your drug dealer?"

400
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,280
 We know that you have one.

401
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,080
 Can he get you human growth hormone?

402
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,720
 And this was always my conspiracy theory.

403
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,360
 And again, it's not something that's world-shattering.

404
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:03,760
 However, I find it very interesting that the actors who portray these beacons of humanity,

405
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,960
 most of them are doing human growth hormones.

406
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,640
 And this is something that I've always believed because the first time you hear about an actor

407
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,280
 putting on 20, 30 pounds of solid muscle to play a role, you're like, "Whoa, what a commitment."

408
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,160
 After the fifth dude comes out and does that over the course of a franchise,

409
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,440
 and all these movies have these super...

410
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,840
 That's when you start to go, "These guys have to be juicing."

411
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,840
 Well, I was watching Joe Rogan the other day.

412
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,600
 I was watching an old clip of Joe Rogan.

413
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,240
 He was talking to a guy named Kyle Dunnigan.

414
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,280
 I was watching Kyle Dunnigan's Bill Maher impression.

415
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,480
 That's how I got led to this.

416
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,680
 And I guess Kyle Dunnigan was on Reno 911.

417
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,040
 I never watched that show, but I was watching his Bill Maher impression.

418
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,720
 And they're laughing and stuff like that.

419
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,920
 And then they start talking.

420
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,240
 It's a really good Bill Maher impression.

421
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:54,000
 Then Joe Rogan goes, "Hey, you remember that thing with Sam Harris and Bill Maher and Ben Affleck?

422
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,680
 Got in a fight on this set of Real Time with Bill Maher."

423
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,640
 And it was on October 6, 2014.

424
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,920
 It's a pretty viral video.

425
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,040
 It's very interesting to watch.

426
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:09,280
 Sam Harris is talking about extremism in Islam and how many people in the Islamic religion

427
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,240
 are actually extremists.

428
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,640
 And Bill Maher is like, "Yeah, yeah, I agree with that stuff."

429
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,200
 And Ben Affleck starts flipping out.

430
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,400
 He starts calling him racist.

431
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,680
 "I can't believe what you're saying.

432
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,920
 I can't believe I'm even part of this conversation.

433
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,040
 What is going on?"

434
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,680
 And Sam Harris and Bill Maher are trying to debate him.

435
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,920
 And he's not having anything of it.

436
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,320
 Now, it looks like a man who's extremely passionate about the issue.

437
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,280
 But Joe Rogan has a different theory about this.

438
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,880
 He goes, "I think..."

439
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,520
 This is fascinating because you have to be really careful making allegations and stuff like that.

440
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,080
 Joe Rogan, the number one podcast in the world goes,

441
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,840
 "I think Ben Affleck was on steroids.

442
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,400
 I think that's why he flipped out.

443
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,880
 I go, "If you look at him, his neck is red.

444
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,320
 He looks like swollen.

445
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,520
 He looks like he has a bunch..."

446
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,440
 And he was doing the Batman movie at the time.

447
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,280
 Joe Rogan goes, "Listen, when you're in your 40s,

448
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,800
 if you're going to put on that type of muscle,

449
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,200
 you've got to get the human growth hormones."

450
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,480
 And I'm almost certain he was roided up during that interview,

451
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,680
 and that's why he snapped.

452
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,040
 Now, I don't know about that.

453
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,280
 Ben Affleck did seem very passionate about the issue.

454
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,360
 But it does confirm because Joe Rogan would know this, right?

455
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,920
 Joe Rogan would know about the secret celebrity subculture of doing steroids

456
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,000
 because he has a foot in both worlds.

457
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,560
 He's really into physical fitness and he's in Hollywood.

458
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,440
 He would hear these stories.

459
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,840
 I thought it'd be harder to find information on this.

460
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,560
 I immediately, when I really started looking into this,

461
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,320
 found an article in the Hollywood Reporter written by Tatiana Siegel,

462
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,400
 and they quoted a Hollywood trainer named Happy Hill.

463
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,560
 And he said, "I believe 20% of all actors do human growth hormones."

464
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,680
 And it's so -- or performance enhancing drugs,

465
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,680
 which would basically just be anabolic steroids.

466
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,320
 It's really interesting because we've reached a point

467
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,760
 where the men have to have the perfect bodies as well,

468
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,680
 especially if they're doing any sort of action movies.

469
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,080
 But the fact like Tom Cruise is taking a shirt off,

470
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,360
 Chris Pratt is taking a shirt off,

471
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,640
 Ryan Reynolds is taking a shirt off,

472
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,400
 like these are constantly happening.

473
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,320
 They have -- the audience has expectations.

474
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,840
 These people cannot age.

475
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,080
 They cannot get flabby unless it's in the service.

476
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,920
 The story like Thor in Endgame, they have to be fit.

477
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,560
 They have to be super, super fit to have these roles.

478
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,960
 And it's been Botox and facial fillers and butt implants

479
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,600
 and all this stuff for so long for women.

480
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,240
 Now we're seeing human growth hormones for men.

481
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,320
 The difference is human growth hormones and steroids

482
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,880
 are former damaging on the human body over time.

483
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,320
 Which here's the thing, my personal theory on steroids,

484
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,440
 if you want to do them, you should do them.

485
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,600
 I actually am not shame in any of these guys

486
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,640
 for doing the steroids.

487
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,000
 That's my attitude towards it.

488
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,600
 I think that's something that if you're --

489
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,680
 it's no different than getting your body completely done

490
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,280
 up in tattoos and tattooing your eyeballs

491
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,800
 or having a bunch of piercings.

492
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,920
 I mean, it looks weird.

493
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,760
 It looks super weird, right?

494
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,880
 But if you want to be a muscle bound freak, who --

495
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,600
 why do I care?

496
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,880
 You're not playing sports.

497
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,360
 That's the thing.

498
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,400
 You're not playing sports.

499
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,400
 You want to play the Hulk.

500
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,200
 Actual size.

501
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,920
 You want to be 13 feet tall with giant teeth?

502
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,800
 Go. I don't care.

503
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,960
 Save them money on CGI.

504
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,400
 It doesn't affect me at all.

505
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,200
 But could you imagine if it came out

506
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,520
 that half of the Marvel film roster was on steroids?

507
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,160
 That would be insane.

508
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,120
 That would be --

509
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,240
 it would be a huge controversy

510
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,480
 because these characters are supposed to be heroes.

511
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,760
 And actually, I said 50 percent.

512
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,480
 We could probably say 20 percent of them are.

513
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,800
 Because this guy did, right?

514
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,160
 20 percent of all the heroes that you know and love

515
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,040
 probably do some sort of steroid or human growth hormone.

516
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,320
 So a conspiracy theory that I really didn't have any backing for

517
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,360
 was just a hunch.

518
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,280
 Turns out that it's probably closer to the truth.

519
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,040
 Joe Rogan himself goes, "Yeah."

520
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,560
 The reason why Ben Affleck was super mad

521
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,840
 was because he was on steroids.

522
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,280
 And again, I think he was super mad

523
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,640
 because he was passionate about the issue.

524
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,960
 But like, if that's what you want to do with your body,

525
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,600
 it might blow your liver out, but I mean,

526
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,240
 there are people doing far worse drugs in Hollywood.

527
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,960
 People just doing far worse things in Hollywood.

528
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,120
 You want to do steroids or human growth hormones.

529
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,560
 So you can play Thanos.

530
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,960
 He's actually all purple because his liver failed.

531
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,080
 James Rowland's like, "Ugh."

532
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,560
 You know, that's on you.

533
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,440
 That's on you.

534
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,920
 But actually, I guess I'm thinking about this now.

535
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,120
 Or is it on the studio?

536
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,480
 Like, if you were Chris Pratt,

537
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,880
 who was on a sitcom for a couple years,

538
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,240
 and then he wins the part to be Star-Lord --

539
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,840
 I'm not saying this happened --

540
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,200
 but then Disney comes to him.

541
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
 Mickey Mouse comes in with a giant syringe.

542
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
 And you're -- this is the deal with the devil, right?

543
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,600
 That we always talk about with the Luminati type stuff.

544
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,200
 It doesn't have to be an actual devil.

545
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,120
 If you're on the cusp of having --

546
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,000
 this made him, right?

547
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Before this, he was just a sitcom actor.

548
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,160
 When he was given the role of Star-Lord,

549
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,320
 and Disney goes, "Listen, you can have this,

550
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,440
 and it will make your career,

551
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,640
 but you need to start using human growth hormones.

552
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,840
 Would you do that?"

553
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,520
 The deal with the devil isn't always a literal devil.

554
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,240
 It doesn't involve grimoires or shadows

555
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,120
 coming out of pentagrams.

556
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,280
 Sometimes it's just a company saying that thing

557
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,880
 that you never thought you would do,

558
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,560
 that you thought was kind of a cheat.

559
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,560
 You have to do that to be in our movies.

560
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,000
 That's the type of deal with the devil

561
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,160
 that people face every single day.

562
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,400
 Not the movie thing,

563
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,040
 not the movie thing,

564
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,480
 but just work in general.

565
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,480
 You may be forced with it to make a decision

566
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,680
 that you just don't want to do.

567
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:20,800
 And you do it because that's the road to success.

568
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,040
 Like, any good deal with the devil.

569
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,920
 Zech, let's go ahead and toss you the keys

570
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,880
 to the carbonicopter.

571
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,400
 We are leaving behind Hollywood.

572
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,560
 We're leaving behind these roided freaks.

573
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,520
 They're chasing after us.

574
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,920
 They're merging into a mound of muscles,

575
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,440
 reaching up for the carbonicopter.

576
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,800
 Get us out of here, Zech.

577
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,200
 We are headed all the way out to Illinois.

578
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:46,800
 In Illinois, there's a small antique shop.

579
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:53,280
 The doorbell rings as two people walk inside.

580
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,200
 A daughter and her mother.

581
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,680
 This was posted online by a user called Vikeen.

582
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,000
 We're going to go ahead and call her Kate.

583
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,520
 It's just a guess if that's her real name.

584
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,880
 It's just a guess.

585
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,320
 And this isn't an unnamed town in Illinois.

586
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,960
 Kate is with her mother and their antique shop.

587
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,400
 And they find two cool little treasures.

588
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,960
 One is an old clock.

589
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,960
 The other is a old--

590
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,400
 because it's antique store--

591
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,160
 you're not going to get the best stuff.

592
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,280
 It's an old 1930s art deco radio.

593
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:34,720
 That's Jazzy in the jazz, the big brass band.

594
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,800
 And then coming up next, it's more of that.

595
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,480
 It's more of that super annoying music.

596
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:47,440
 I'm assuming to play normal music.

597
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,680
 I'm sure if they played it, it would play Bruno Mars.

598
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,120
 It's not a haunted radio.

599
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,240
 Or is it, actually?

600
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,280
 Maybe I'm jumping the gun.

601
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,920
 But let's assume you can get all the hits

602
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,520
 from the '90s and today on this.

603
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,440
 They buy this 1930s art deco radio and this old clock.

604
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,440
 They toss them in the car, and they're

605
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,960
 driving out to visit a lake.

606
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,400
 This is a mom-daughter day, right?

607
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,880
 They're driving out to visit this lake that's on the way home.

608
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,560
 They leave their antiques in the car, and they get out,

609
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,400
 and they're just kind of sitting there enjoying

610
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,920
 the beauty of nature.

611
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,120
 And then a storm rolls in.

612
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,120
 [Dog snoring]

613
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,680
 A huge storm, by the way.

614
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,960
 This storm does not say when it took place.

615
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,960
 It may or may not be Hurricane Ida that recently ravaged the state.

616
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,440
 But...

617
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,440
 [Dog snoring]

618
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,320
 So they get up, if you know, you can't stay at a lake

619
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,440
 when it's storming outside.

620
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,400
 They get up, and they both turn around,

621
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,320
 and they see their parked car there.

622
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,320
 And sitting in the driver's seat,

623
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,640
 is a shadow man.

624
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,320
 Now it doesn't state exactly what time of day this is,

625
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,120
 but I gather at best late afternoon.

626
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,480
 Enough that...

627
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:58,980
 [Laughs]

628
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,520
 Enough that a shadow would be visible in your car.

629
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,920
 If it's too dark out, you can't really see anything.

630
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:08,240
 But they see this shadow man sitting in the car, the driver's side.

631
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,440
 And then, it reaches its arm out the driver's side window,

632
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,680
 and it's holding...

633
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,400
 This story is just so bizarre.

634
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,320
 This story, this is one of the stories, it's short,

635
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,280
 but I don't even know where I would classify it.

636
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,160
 Shadow man in a car, that's interesting already.

637
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,760
 Shadow man in the driver's side of the car,

638
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,760
 like, because that's your route of escape.

639
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,600
 That really is terrifying.

640
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,200
 Shadow man's on the driver's side of the car.

641
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,880
 The shadow man reaches his arm out the car window,

642
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,080
 and he's holding, he's holding a shadow yee...

643
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,920
 It's, there's no product placement.

644
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,520
 There's no product placement here.

645
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,400
 It's the shadowy outline of an air horn.

646
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,600
 You know those cans of canned horn air?

647
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:56,400
 It's holding out a perfect black silhouette of a can of air, air horn.

648
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,760
 And they're watching this shadow man stick out his arm with this can of air,

649
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,920
 and he goes, "Aaahhh!"

650
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:10,800
 He starts honking the air horn, and they're looking at this thing.

651
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,640
 Kate starts running towards the car,

652
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,360
 and then when she gets to the car, it's empty.

653
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:23,680
 And her mom saw it too, and her mom heard it too.

654
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,520
 She saw the shadow man hold the air can,

655
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,520
 and she heard it, the blast of the canned air.

656
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,680
 That's absurd.

657
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,120
 That's ab- that's absolutely absurd.

658
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,440
 She goes on to finish the post saying it could be the radio,

659
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,600
 or the antiques have something attached to it,

660
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,440
 and she was going to monitor the items for a couple of days to see what it could be.

661
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,960
 But this is one of those cases.

662
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,400
 We talk a lot about ghosts.

663
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,000
 What are ghosts, right?

664
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,320
 That's kind of paranormal activity 101.

665
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,160
 What is a ghost, and is it someone left with an unfinished deed?

666
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,680
 Is it someone who doesn't know that they're dead,

667
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,640
 they haven't passed over?

668
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,040
 Is it a demon disguising itself as a benign family member,

669
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,480
 or a loved one or something like that?

670
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,960
 I don't think...

671
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,240
 This is so bizarre.

672
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,640
 Who's like, "Oh man, they're dying, they're like, "Oh, I really wanted to,

673
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,360
 I really wanted to honk an air horn in Louisiana."

674
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,240
 They're like, "Grandpa, what do you, are you going in St. Yev dimension?"

675
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,480
 He's like, "Ugh, he dies."

676
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,120
 At the same time, they're listening to really bad

677
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,480
 brassy music on the radio,

678
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,280
 and that was Skip Skipper in the Great Brass Band,

679
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,200
 coming up more irritating nonsense.

680
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,800
 And then he got sucked into the radio,

681
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,240
 and he's the leader of the brass band.

682
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,560
 He's like, "Ugh, this is a fate worse than death."

683
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,880
 But then someone buys the radio,

684
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,560
 and then they take him to Louisiana,

685
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,160
 and I like, it doesn't make, why is a ghost honking an arrow?

686
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,200
 Actually, there's so many,

687
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,360
 okay, why is a ghost honking an air horn too?

688
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,160
 Where did he get it?

689
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,360
 Why is that something that Shadowmen have access to?

690
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,920
 We've seen Shadowmen, the ones I've seen,

691
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,280
 look like just the shadows of people.

692
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,800
 Then there's Shadowmen that have the big black hats,

693
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,640
 like the cowboy hats and the trench coats,

694
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,040
 as well, the fashionable Shadowpeople.

695
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,640
 Maybe they have items like canes, but an air horn?

696
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,640
 It seems so out of the...

697
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,480
 It's not a paranormal...

698
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,880
 It'd be one thing if it was holding like a crystal ball,

699
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,720
 or holding a decatero card.

700
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,760
 I mean, because that wouldn't make sense, right?

701
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,040
 It's paranormal event with a paranormal tool.

702
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,000
 If they had a dowsing rod, and you saw like a Shadowman.

703
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,520
 But see, even that's stupid,

704
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,720
 because the Shadowpeople, they've never had hobbies, right?

705
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,160
 They've never done anything.

706
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,960
 They just kind of stand around, or poke their heads from around couches,

707
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,120
 or stand at the end of long hallways.

708
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,240
 Just creepy stuff, right?

709
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,760
 They're never celebrating.

710
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,600
 We've never seen one with a kazoo.

711
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,000
 And this one has an air horn.

712
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,400
 And it's audible.

713
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,680
 Like they hear it.

714
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,920
 It would be one thing...

715
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,840
 If you didn't hear the air horn blast,

716
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,240
 you may not even make out what they were holding in their hand.

717
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,680
 But the unmistakable sound of an air horn,

718
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,640
 with that weird trumpet shape,

719
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,240
 they knew what it was.

720
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,320
 And this might be one of the most puzzling ghost stories

721
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,680
 we've covered in a long time.

722
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,800
 We cover stories about revolutionary war soldiers

723
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,880
 getting lost in their decayed carcasses,

724
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,720
 still continuing to wander the wilderness.

725
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,800
 That makes sense, right?

726
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,200
 These two, these two dunderheads lost the British the war.

727
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,600
 And so it makes sense that they had these tortured souls

728
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,640
 walking through wilderness.

729
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,200
 What did this guy do to get an air horn?

730
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,520
 It actually sounds like an improvement, right?

731
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,680
 You can either carry the chains of the damned with you

732
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,800
 wherever you go, or you just carry around an air horn.

733
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,840
 And it'll be interesting.

734
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,080
 There's this one tweet going around, or this one meme I saw,

735
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,640
 and it said, "I'm tired of seeing ghosts do spooky nursery rhymes

736
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,760
 "just like Victorians.

737
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,760
 "When are we gonna see a ghost of a kid throwing his Nintendo

738
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,800
 "controller across the room, 'cause he can't beat Mario?"

739
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,040
 And that's interesting, 'cause we don't see that.

740
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,000
 I mean, it's a joke, but it's 100% true.

741
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,880
 We see old ghosts.

742
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,560
 We don't see caveman ghosts.

743
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,120
 We don't see Egyptian ghosts.

744
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,840
 A Victorian era is where it seems to start.

745
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,560
 So we think there's some sort of die-off, no pun intended.

746
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,720
 We think like the older the ghost, the less power it has.

747
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,000
 You just can't see it anymore.

748
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,080
 But there also seems to be a ceiling to that.

749
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,360
 How come we don't see the boy playing with a fidget spinner

750
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,520
 when you walk into your bathroom in the middle of the night?

751
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,280
 You might see a little ghost boy standing in your bathroom,

752
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,680
 his eyeless socks, his eyes, his eyes,

753
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,400
 his eyeless sockets staring at you.

754
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,920
 But will he have a Beyblade?

755
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,400
 Right?

756
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,080
 Will he have any of the toys?

757
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,560
 You would assume that ghost was so much older,

758
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,680
 'cause it doesn't have a collection of Pokemon cards.

759
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,840
 So this is interesting.

760
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,800
 We're not seeing the technological march of death.

761
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,720
 And that's really interesting.

762
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,600
 We're not seeing an advancement of technology along with a ghost.

763
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,920
 Because where are all the ghosts of sports fans

764
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,000
 constantly interfering with games?

765
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,640
 That would be hilarious.

766
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,600
 Where is this stuff?

767
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,480
 It's always old timey ghosts, but not too old timey ghosts.

768
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,160
 So the fact that we have a Shadow Man

769
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,960
 using a fairly modern invention, an air horn,

770
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,680
 and it being audible is just bizarre.

771
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,280
 And that's all it wanted to do.

772
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,240
 Was it attached to the clock?

773
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,440
 Was it attached to the radio?

774
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,800
 How did it get an air horn?

775
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,000
 All of this stuff is...

776
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,680
 The question whether or not the clock of the radio is haunted is mundane.

777
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,000
 Really, this story would have been mundane

778
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,600
 if the guy was just at the shadow version

779
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,360
 was just sitting in the car and then disappeared.

780
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,320
 I wouldn't even cover it.

781
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,040
 It's so...

782
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,720
 If it happened to you, it would be the most terrifying event of your life.

783
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,200
 But it's not Dead Rabbit Radio interesting.

784
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,320
 The fact that it started using an air horn in this device.

785
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,760
 A prop?

786
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:45,360
 And it was out of space and time, just like the Shadow Man.

787
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,640
 It was nothing but a silhouette.

788
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,960
 Nuts.

789
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,440
 Insane.

790
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,880
 This is one of the weirdest ghost stories

791
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,400
 we've covered in a long time.

792
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,000
 And it just opens a whole host of questions.

793
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,560
 When will ghosts catch up to modern times?

794
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,640
 When will we start seeing ghosts do things that we did as kids?

795
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,960
 Sure, we took baths and stood in hallways

796
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,680
 and tried to walk out of the forest and wave down.

797
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,480
 Rescue.

798
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,160
 But he just kept on driving.

799
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,720
 Sure, that...

800
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,160
 We may have done that stuff as well,

801
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,080
 but we spent most of our lives playing video games,

802
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,600
 reading comic books.

803
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,880
 I guess I'm speaking for everyone,

804
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,080
 but we spent a lot of our life doing these things

805
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,320
 and we're not seeing ghosts do these things.

806
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,600
 So why is that?

807
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,440
 It's just one more wrinkle to the mystery of the paranormal.

808
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,720
 One more puzzle we have to solve.

809
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,120
 But that's what makes this stuff so exciting.
