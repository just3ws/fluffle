1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
 A young man out for a morning stroll has no idea his entire reality is about to change

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,680
 when he sees the man in the pink shirt.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:16,120
 And then we travel to England in the 1600s to meet a man who got more than he bargained

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,720
 for when he won a lawsuit.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,000
 He thought he was just going to get a set of drums.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,240
 Instead he became witness to the very first recorded poltergeist haunting today on Dead

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,240
 Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:40,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,840
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,160
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,120
 My back's feeling a little bit better.

12
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,120
 So there's that.

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,440
 I wanted to warn you, I still am on Muscle Relaxers.

14
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,240
 You listened to the madness of yesterday's episode, but I think we got it rained in here.

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,680
 I think we got it rained in here.

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:03,240
 But someone who always relaxes me day in and day out, everyone give a round of applause

17
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,320
 to today's pilot, Jan De La Rosa.

18
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,400
 Come on in Jan, doing partwheels into Dead Rabbit Command.

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,880
 Jan De La Rosa has earned this privilege in a unique way.

20
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,560
 No one else has done this yet.

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,880
 I always talk about, I don't know, I mentioned it like three times.

22
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,160
 I have an Amazon wish list on my show notes.

23
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,200
 And they bought me a really cool book off that wish list.

24
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,800
 It's called Make Noise, a creator's guide to podcasting.

25
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,800
 So that's really really cool.

26
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,440
 And it's about the storytelling aspect.

27
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,640
 I'm like Jason, what is this episode 817?

28
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
 You know how to podcast.

29
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,480
 This is about the storytelling side of it.

30
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,200
 It's really really interesting.

31
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,560
 It's really cool talking about the storytelling aspect.

32
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,180
 And since that's what I do, this is the book I wanted.

33
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,640
 So Jan, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

34
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,040
 If you guys can't support the show financially, I totally get it.

35
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,680
 I totally totally get it.

36
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,840
 Just help spread the word about the show.

37
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,360
 That helps out.

38
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,200
 Just talking to your friends, talking to your families, talking about it on your socials.

39
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,920
 All of that stuff really really helps out a lot.

40
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,320
 Jan, let's go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider.

41
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,600
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

42
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,880
 We're going to glide all the way out to Alberta, Canada.

43
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:24,500
 We land in Alberta, Canada.

44
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,340
 It's a hot July day.

45
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,140
 The year is 1980.

46
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,460
 We're walking around the streets and it's only eight in the morning.

47
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,540
 It's 8 a.m.

48
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,460
 And we're walking around Alberta and we see another guy walking in front of us.

49
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,700
 Now this guy, we're going to call him Jake.

50
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,140
 Jake is walking down this alleyway.

51
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,720
 He goes, "I don't know where I was in relation to everywhere else in the city.

52
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:56,160
 Like I'm walking through the city and then I'm in an alleyway."

53
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,520
 And I remember getting there, but I don't know where I am at right now.

54
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:08,280
 But as I'm walking down this alleyway, I see standing there a man, a normal looking man,

55
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,280
 wearing a pink shirt with black trousers.

56
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,280
 I don't know where I'm at.

57
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,720
 I'm in an alley and I'm just going to keep walking through the alley.

58
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,220
 Maybe then I'll figure where I'm at.

59
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,620
 Just walk past this guy in the pink shirt and the black trousers.

60
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:34,220
 And as I'm walking down this alleyway, I start to hear him mumble.

61
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,220
 He hears this guy mumbling.

62
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,100
 He hears the guy in the pink shirt mumbling.

63
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,460
 He can't make out what he's saying.

64
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,760
 He really wants to know.

65
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,240
 It's some guy just standing in an alleyway at 8 in the morning.

66
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,560
 But again, he's wearing a pink shirt with black trousers.

67
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,400
 He doesn't look like a hobo.

68
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,280
 He doesn't look like he's super out of place.

69
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,280
 But the mumbling.

70
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,280
 It's the mumbling.

71
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,440
 You could be standing next to a businessman in an elevator, but if he was facing the corner

72
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,080
 going, "Mommy doesn't want me.

73
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,960
 Mommy doesn't want me.

74
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,520
 You don't care how he's dressed.

75
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,760
 You want to get out of that elevator as quickly as possible."

76
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,160
 Well he's walking past the guy in the pink shirt and the guy is still continuing to mumble.

77
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,920
 He can't hear what he's saying.

78
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:14,340
 The right when Jake passes the man in the pink shirt, he hears, "Claire is day," the

79
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,980
 man go, "if only you could know the clock."

80
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:27,420
 And at that moment, the man in the pink shirt grabs Jake's arm.

81
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,540
 Jake goes to shake him free, but he can't.

82
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,740
 This is an impossibly strong grip.

83
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,620
 And Jake is trying so hard to get free and the man in the pink shirt is just holding

84
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,640
 his arm completely restraining this guy.

85
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:45,480
 And at that point, Jake starts to hear footsteps running down the alley towards him.

86
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:51,960
 Can't see him because his back is to these footsteps, but fight or flight instinct can

87
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,240
 happen when the guy grabs his arm and he couldn't get free.

88
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,000
 But now, I mean, there's a complete panic.

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,840
 Obviously, this has been some sort of setup, some sort of ambush.

90
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,680
 And he hears these feet running up behind him and he turns.

91
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:11,460
 He turns his head as far as he can and he looks and his eye level, when he turns completely

92
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:17,100
 over, all he can see is a pair of shoulders.

93
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,420
 Whatever is coming up behind him is much, much taller than he is.

94
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:31,060
 He feels two strong hands reach up underneath his armpits and begin to lift him up.

95
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:37,040
 His body begins to feel light and the hands are able to lift him up even further.

96
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,000
 He's now in the grasp of two of these individuals.

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,520
 He's being lifted off the ground.

98
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:53,640
 And at that point, the man in the pink shirt lets go and then starts to ascend into the

99
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,640
 sky.

100
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,720
 Now I've never been mugged.

101
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,720
 I've never been robbed.

102
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:05,340
 I'm pretty sure that's not normal.

103
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:12,300
 And as he's watching the man in the pink shirt slowly rise up into the sky, Jake, just hovering

104
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:18,180
 a few inches off the ground, is now flying up into the air.

105
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:26,300
 And then instantly, he is naked, laying on the cold pavement of this alleyway.

106
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,160
 He looks to his left.

107
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,000
 He looks to his right.

108
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 He's alone.

109
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 But naked, right?

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,400
 I mean, that is reassuring.

111
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,600
 Whatever happened to one of these assailants are gone, but he's completely naked.

112
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:45,720
 And he quickly realizes, uh-oh, not only am I naked, but everything I had on me.

113
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,200
 This is interesting because I wouldn't have thought about this because I've never been

114
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,320
 mugged and I've never been naked in an alleyway.

115
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,000
 He comes to, he's naked in the alleyway.

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,620
 He goes, "Everything I have was in my jacket.

117
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,700
 My car keys, all my keys, my house key, everything's gone, my wallet.

118
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,200
 I have nothing.

119
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,620
 I am as I was born just now.

120
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,260
 I own nothing in this alleyway."

121
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:13,900
 So even if you do get up and you are able to cover yourself up, like there happens to

122
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,100
 be a big barrel there with suspenders on it, you're walking through the city, you're still,

123
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,940
 you're going all the way home.

124
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,400
 And he starts to hear more footsteps.

125
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,320
 He's like, "Oh man, not this again."

126
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,400
 So he jumps into a dumpster that's nearby.

127
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,320
 The only thing that I can imagine worse than jumping into a dumpster is jumping into a

128
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,080
 dumpster naked.

129
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:41,280
 He's in this dumpster and here's people walk down the alleyway and he goes, "Okay, good.

130
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,160
 Whatever was out there, they didn't see me."

131
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,000
 And then he'll be like, "Okay, I gotta figure this out, right?

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 I just can't stay in this dumpster any longer."

133
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,500
 It's disgusting, stuff is getting in my butt crack.

134
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,540
 And as he's thinking about crawling out, he hears more footsteps coming.

135
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:59,860
 He's like, "Okay, better wait just a little bit longer."

136
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:04,780
 Now remember, this story took, the story started at 8 AM.

137
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,700
 He stays in that dumpster until the sun sets.

138
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:12,060
 He says, "I kept hearing footsteps walking back and forth coming down this alleyway and

139
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,060
 I didn't want to risk it.

140
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,220
 I didn't know what was going on."

141
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:19,400
 But after nightfall, he gets back out of the dumpster, he uses some trash bags to give

142
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,400
 himself some clothing.

143
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,360
 He's like making a nice little dress.

144
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,920
 The rats sewed this up for me.

145
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,000
 You're the bell of the ball Cinderella.

146
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,840
 He jumps down and he's walking down the street in garbage bags and he goes, "Okay, first

147
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,040
 I gotta go and I gotta call the police.

148
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:36,200
 I gotta let the police know that they're space aliens or whatever in the world that was.

149
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,200
 Could be an invasion coming.

150
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,920
 I'm gonna go find the police and file a report and hopefully get a ride home."

151
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:48,980
 And as he's headed towards the police station, whoop whoop whoop, that's not the chuggalos

152
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,980
 showing up.

153
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,180
 That's not the gathering.

154
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:56,300
 Now, what happens is a police officer sees this man walking down the street wearing nothing

155
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,020
 but garbage bags and he pulls over and gets the story.

156
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:05,300
 So the officer takes him right to the police station and Jake tells the story, "I just

157
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,260
 told you."

158
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,740
 And the officers are writing it down.

159
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,420
 They probably stopped writing stuff down 20 minutes ago.

160
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,640
 They're like, "Oh, this is one of those cooks."

161
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,360
 But as he's filing this report with the police, he's like, "Yeah, I'm the guy with the pink

162
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,840
 shirt flew away and then the next thing I knew, I was flying away and then I was naked."

163
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,720
 And the cops are like, "Okay, we're gonna tell you exactly what happened.

164
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
 You were raped."

165
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,440
 And Jake's like, "Uh, no, no, I wasn't."

166
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,520
 And the cops are like, "Yeah, that's what happened.

167
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,920
 You were raped in that alleyway."

168
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,600
 And that's what it is.

169
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,500
 I hate to break the news to you, but...

170
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,900
 And Jake goes, "Wait, what are you talking about?"

171
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:49,860
 And the officers refuse to investigate this any further.

172
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:57,340
 Which is horrible because even if they're right, a man was raped at eight in the morning.

173
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,740
 They're like, "Oh man, call us next time when you're brutally murdered."

174
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,620
 The police refuse to investigate this case.

175
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,780
 They said that this man was raped.

176
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:11,240
 They had nothing to do with aliens, had nothing to do with UFOs, no one was flying around.

177
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,240
 You were raped?

178
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,240
 Good day, sir.

179
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,920
 I mean, again, they should investigate at least that.

180
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,840
 When Jake ends up telling this story, he says that was the end of it.

181
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,920
 They never called me back even if I was raped, which I wasn't.

182
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,160
 That's not what this was.

183
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,080
 But they should have at least investigated that.

184
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:35,400
 All I know is I was walking down the street, something impossible, multiple things impossible

185
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,300
 happened.

186
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,700
 And no one believes me, not even the police.

187
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,980
 And also the Alberta Police Department should investigate sex crimes.

188
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,740
 I don't know why they are not.

189
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,580
 This story came from, think about it, docs.com, one of my favorite websites.

190
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,740
 They got it from ufoorganization.com.

191
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,500
 And they're the ones who took the report about this young man who got assaulted.

192
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,220
 I mean, at the very least, he was attacked.

193
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,720
 This is one of those stories that's really interesting because, one, it takes place early

194
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,720
 in the morning.

195
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,520
 We covered a story, what was it, earlier this week, late last week, where it takes place

196
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,040
 like it's seven in the morning.

197
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,720
 That's so unusual for UFO stuff.

198
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,960
 Really any sort of paranormal activity tends to take place at night.

199
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:28,080
 Eight in the morning, broad daylight walking down an alleyway, an alien abduction, or what,

200
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,640
 I mean, how would you classify this?

201
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:34,260
 The only reason I keep going back to alien is because they were floating away.

202
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,340
 But in the lore, I mean, could it be demons?

203
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,340
 Could it be fateful?

204
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,340
 Hopefully not.

205
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:43,140
 I'm not a fan of the fateful stuff, I think it's kind of boring.

206
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,060
 But I mean, if I was playing, if a bunch of fairies showed up and really float away, it

207
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,540
 would be the most exciting thing that happened to me that week.

208
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,180
 But in general, I think it's kind of lame.

209
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,060
 But I keep going back to the alien thing.

210
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,060
 And the idea of the police said not investigate.

211
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,760
 The idea of the police saying sorry son, you got raped, we're not gonna investigate that

212
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,920
 either is so bizarre.

213
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,040
 Right?

214
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,080
 That sounds so absurd.

215
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,480
 That's such an absurd cover up.

216
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,720
 And then if you are right, Mr. Officer, let's go take me to hospital.

217
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,320
 Let's start collecting DNA.

218
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,560
 Let's do these kits.

219
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,840
 Let's solve this crime against me.

220
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,880
 I think I was abducted by aliens.

221
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,000
 You think it was something much more terrestrial.

222
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Okay?

223
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,900
 And by your logic, let's figure this out.

224
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,900
 Call me back.

225
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,900
 I'm gonna call you back.

226
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,420
 It almost feels like a cover up.

227
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,180
 And you have to wonder, is this...

228
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,620
 This is always the thing with paranormal stuff.

229
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,900
 And we'll be talking about this later this week.

230
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,140
 But I'm starting to come to the conclusion that this stuff is way more common than we

231
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,140
 think.

232
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:48,700
 Not this particular event in and of itself, but paranormal activity, be it alien or ghost

233
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,620
 or demon, is so common.

234
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:57,160
 And most people don't tell anybody.

235
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,400
 Because if you tell people, people are gonna think you're a weirdo, a quack.

236
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,640
 And the thing is, is think about it like a mugging, right?

237
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,920
 Let's say that you get mugged in your city and you don't want to tell anyone because

238
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,120
 it makes you feel weak.

239
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,120
 Right?

240
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,120
 You're not...

241
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,120
 I'm just using that example.

242
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,120
 Right?

243
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,120
 So much just got mugged when they're sitting at home.

244
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,400
 They're like, "Oh, nothing but a relaxing episode of Dead Wrap Radio.

245
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,400
 That'll cheer me up."

246
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,400
 And they're saying that...

247
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:24,140
 But let's say you get mugged and you go, "Man, I wish I had been stronger.

248
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,140
 I wish I had taken those...

249
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,140
 Just to...

250
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,140
 Whatever.

251
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,140
 Whatever.

252
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,140
 I've never been mugged.

253
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,140
 I'm just using this for an example.

254
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,640
 You get mugged, you feel weak, so you get embarrassed and you don't tell anyone.

255
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,540
 I actually think that happens a lot.

256
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,060
 And then some people get mugged and they go report it to the police.

257
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,540
 Actually, I know that happens a lot, but I know a lot of criminals that got mugged and

258
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,640
 stuff like that.

259
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
 They got jacked.

260
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,140
 They're not gonna report it to the police.

261
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,940
 Okay, now it's getting super complicated.

262
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:51,720
 My point is, is that let's say that 10 people get mugged in a city.

263
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,400
 The first four or five people may not report it for whatever reason.

264
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,960
 I mean, it's not worth it.

265
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,960
 That guy mugged me.

266
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
 If I go to the...

267
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,960
 I'm not getting this stuff back.

268
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:04,200
 If I go to the police, then my name's on a whole bunch of paperwork.

269
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,840
 My address is on a whole bunch of paperwork.

270
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,560
 And it turns out that this guy's a member of like MS-13 or the Trinitarios or whatever.

271
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,560
 It's just not worth it.

272
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,840
 I'm just not gonna go down that path anymore.

273
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,460
 I bet you that happens.

274
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,860
 I bet you that happens.

275
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:22,240
 And so out of all these muggings, you maybe have six people reported or four people reported.

276
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,900
 And taking that to the paranormal aspect, at least when you report a mugging, people

277
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,900
 don't roll their eyes and go, "Uh-huh.

278
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,900
 Sure, buddy.

279
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,900
 You're all P.D.

280
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,900
 Up.

281
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,900
 You have no wallet."

282
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,900
 You're like, "Uh-huh.

283
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,900
 Tell me another crazy story."

284
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:38,360
 Like at least with a mugging, people would go, "You might tell your friends and family

285
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,360
 that it happened.

286
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,360
 You probably would, right?

287
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,860
 Because again, you're like, "I gotta borrow money.

288
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,860
 Why do you need to borrow money?

289
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,260
 I got mugged."

290
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,400
 My point is, this analogy's gone sideways.

291
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,560
 Maybe I should stop recording on muscle relaxers.

292
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,560
 My point is, is that I don't think people report every crime.

293
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,060
 And I don't think people report every UFO, alien, all that stuff because it makes you

294
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,020
 look insane.

295
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,500
 And it shouldn't.

296
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,920
 And what happens is because no one is saying this, there's a very, very small amount of

297
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,600
 these reports coming out.

298
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,800
 And so less and less people say it because they don't want to be grouped in with that

299
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,720
 constituency.

300
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,460
 That population because they're a bunch of weirdos.

301
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:19,620
 When it turns out that if everyone reported, the time they saw a ghost or the time they

302
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:25,900
 had an encounter that just was unbelievable, then you would realize like 70% of the country

303
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,900
 has had this stuff.

304
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,620
 I've always said, my big complaint about UFO photos is I go, it used to be back in the

305
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:36,100
 70s when no one had cameras on them, we'd get maybe four to five good UFO photos a year.

306
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,660
 And you understood that because not everyone had a camera in their car.

307
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:46,200
 And I said, now that everyone has cameras on them, all the times we get four or five

308
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,760
 good UFO photos a year.

309
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,800
 And I said, that to me makes it seem fake.

310
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,960
 But now I'm thinking about it, you may take a photo, like there may be some really, really

311
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,600
 good UFO photos out there and people take it and it's this terrifying event.

312
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,160
 And then they just go, I'm not going to share this with anyone.

313
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,520
 Like obviously there's evidence of this, but I'm not going to go to coast to coast

314
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,520
 AM.

315
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,120
 I don't want to have a bunch of people knocking on my door.

316
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,860
 That's actually a great segue for our next story.

317
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,660
 Because when you go into, when you start examining the world of paranormal, you will get all

318
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:20,300
 sorts of people coming and asking you these questions and trying to get proof and not

319
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,620
 believing you, calling you a kook and it becomes a huge thing.

320
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,620
 Great segue jam.

321
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,700
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carpenter copter.

322
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,580
 We are leaving behind Alberta, Canada.

323
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:38,380
 We're headed all the way out to Tedworth, England.

324
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,800
 First off I want to give a shout out to Cold Blackwater.

325
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,600
 Cold Blackwater started this new subreddit called The Church of Charles Fort and I'm

326
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,480
 telling you this stuff that he digs up is so obscure.

327
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,720
 Which is what I love, right?

328
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,720
 And what this show loves.

329
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,240
 So if you're a fan of the show, check that out.

330
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,080
 I'm a mod on that, but this dude does all the heavy lifting.

331
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,440
 I like cross posts and stuff.

332
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,040
 I'm pretty busy with the show, but man, he has a lot of great stuff coming out.

333
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,840
 And this is where I got this story.

334
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:09,620
 I also want to give a shout out to the website Barriosandbeyond.com because that's where

335
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,900
 I got the bulk of my information for the story.

336
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,380
 So shout out to both of those guys.

337
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:17,340
 The year is 1661.

338
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:21,020
 Now nowadays this little town is called Tedworth.

339
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:26,180
 But back in the fabulous year of 1661, Black Plague was all the rage.

340
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,140
 People were still trying to figure out what to do with that brush.

341
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,220
 Is it for their teeth?

342
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,820
 Is it for their hair?

343
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,820
 Nobody knew for sure.

344
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:40,240
 In the town of Tedworth, that's in Wiltshire, England, there was a man named John Montpesson.

345
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,280
 Now John Montpesson, he was a landowner.

346
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,480
 He was an excise officer, so that's the guy.

347
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,880
 He's not making you do Jeff and Jacks.

348
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,360
 They hadn't been invented yet.

349
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,560
 But he like formulated taxes and stuff like that and like, hey, give me money.

350
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,840
 He's basically just a goon.

351
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,920
 And he was an officer in the local militia.

352
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,340
 Very, very high member of the society of Tedworth.

353
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:04,380
 And he's visiting the nearby village of Ludgershaw.

354
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,240
 And he's like walking downtown and everyone's like, hey, what's up John?

355
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,880
 Everyone's giving him high fives and stuff like that.

356
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,680
 And he's like, yeah, give me some money, do it.

357
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,680
 I like the high five and everything.

358
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,680
 Well, give me some money.

359
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,320
 I'm that excise officer.

360
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,480
 And as he's walking through town, he hears a...

361
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:24,300
 Now to you and me, that's a pretty good song.

362
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,800
 Trademark, I just came up with that.

363
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,200
 To you and me, that's a jazzy little tune.

364
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,200
 But to John, he...

365
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,340
 I like to be fair with that guy.

366
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,860
 He wasn't even that rhythmic.

367
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:42,020
 It was this hobo walking through the streets of Ludgershaw, banging on this drum.

368
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,180
 And he would do it all day long.

369
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,340
 Now John is just visiting this town, right?

370
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,420
 He feels bad for the people who always live here.

371
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,220
 This guy is constantly banging on this drum.

372
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,460
 He's not like the village idiot or anything.

373
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,460
 This is his job.

374
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,460
 He's a busker.

375
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,960
 He's basically a performer on the street, so people throw coins into a hat.

376
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,560
 And John can't stand it.

377
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:08,520
 He thinks this guy is such a nuisance that he actually confronts him.

378
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,240
 And he finds out, because this guy, you know, John is high up in society.

379
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,600
 He's able to interrogate this dude.

380
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:20,260
 It turns out that this drummer does not have a license for busking.

381
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,960
 He actually has forged documents saying that the government allowed him to play his drum

382
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,620
 to make money, but that was not the case.

383
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:32,420
 So John ends up reporting him to the authorities himself, basically.

384
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:36,660
 And he has him taken to court and punished.

385
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:42,140
 You can't forge documents and pleasure a really, really bad drummer.

386
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,620
 And the court is hearing this.

387
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,900
 And they're like exhibiting the guys all banging the drum.

388
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,220
 The judge is like, "Stop, stop, stop."

389
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,580
 John wins the case.

390
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,460
 Basically this guy neglected a name him earlier.

391
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,720
 William Drury was his name.

392
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,680
 William Drury loses the case and they're like, "You can no longer busk in this city, and

393
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,440
 you gotta go to jail for forging these documents."

394
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:09,000
 So as William is arrested and he's being taken away to jail, the court tells John, "Hey,

395
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,280
 congratulations, you won this case."

396
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,280
 You know what?

397
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,720
 And here's the thing, we have this drum here, right?

398
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,640
 Why don't you keep the drum?

399
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,640
 Almost as like a trophy.

400
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,280
 It's a really weird case.

401
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,640
 That'd be crazy if that's how stuff happened this day.

402
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,180
 They're like, "Oh, that guy assaulted you with this machete.

403
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,660
 Why is he going to prison?"

404
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,660
 Here's the machete.

405
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,940
 You're like, "Ah, there's still pieces of your face on it."

406
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,980
 They give John the drum.

407
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,980
 And then I imagine the bailiff is walking away and then he stops and he turns back to

408
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:45,380
 John and he goes, "Oh, also," I should have mentioned this earlier, "but William is associated

409
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,180
 with a band of magic-wielding gypsies."

410
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:53,920
 There's a lot of witches that like to hang out with that troupe that William was a part

411
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,760
 of, but I'm sure that won't affect your life in any way possible.

412
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:05,840
 The fact that you broke apart a group of gypsies that are very, very powerful, very, very powerful

413
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:13,240
 sorcerers, I don't think there'll be any problem going forward in your life, dear sir.

414
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,320
 And so John, who is not a superstitious person, takes the drum.

415
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,260
 It is a trophy, right?

416
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:26,740
 And this unlocks the very first recorded poltergeist story in British history.

417
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,100
 So we always have old stories with ghosts, right?

418
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,220
 Ghosts have been around for a long time.

419
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:36,140
 A poltergeist is more than just the shadowy figure walking past the graveyard.

420
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:40,780
 It's more than your loved one appearing in your little hovel being like, "Clean this

421
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,780
 place up."

422
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,780
 It's more than that.

423
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:46,100
 A poltergeist is all about sound and activity.

424
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,080
 It's all about the wrappings.

425
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,120
 It's all about stuff getting thrown off shelves.

426
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:56,520
 This is the very first time that we know of when this happened in England.

427
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:03,960
 He takes his drum back home to Tedworth and almost right away this poltergeist activity

428
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,960
 begins.

429
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:11,920
 Late at night, they begin hearing this loud banging on the outside of the house.

430
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,840
 And they begin to hear loud banging on the doors.

431
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:21,660
 And now you're thinking, "We're understaffed from a bunch of zombies, right?"

432
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,620
 It's happening externally in this house.

433
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,940
 And again, they know that he's pissed off a bunch of gypsies.

434
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,700
 And I think that's really where they're first thinking.

435
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,860
 Like, "Oh, they're coming around.

436
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,860
 They're banging it.

437
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,860
 Grab the musket."

438
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,860
 I don't think muskets were.

439
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,820
 They had to basically get pitchforks to go take these guys out.

440
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,740
 There's no one outside the house.

441
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:44,060
 But then the next night, "Bum bum bum bum bum."

442
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,440
 You're not with your pitchfork.

443
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,440
 Nothing.

444
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,440
 This goes on for a while.

445
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,840
 And then the noises start to happen on the roof.

446
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,840
 Now I should say this guy, because he's so high up in society, I keep saying the house,

447
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,680
 I should have painted the picture better.

448
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,960
 It's an estate with maids and butlers.

449
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,440
 This guy's really, you were imagining like a little tiny straw house.

450
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:11,680
 No, there's this grand estate, which you actually make it harder to find a source of the noise,

451
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,680
 right?

452
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,700
 They're not going to be around to cover, but it's this grand estate, and you would hear

453
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,180
 the banging on the wall, and when you went out, no one was there.

454
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:23,680
 Now they're hearing it on the roof of the house, which is far more alarming.

455
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,100
 Because even if you thought the idea that there was just a bunch of gypsies outside banging

456
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,260
 on the walls, now you're thinking, "I think it on the roof."

457
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,260
 Right?

458
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,860
 They'd be super easy to catch up there, but when you look out, when you poke your head

459
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:37,060
 out the window, you don't see anyone up there.

460
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,700
 The drumming was relentless.

461
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,180
 It was happening every single night.

462
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:46,240
 And at one point, they did have muskets, because I was a little bit farther down on my notes.

463
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,680
 John grabbed his pistol and began running around the house trying to find the source of the

464
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,680
 noises.

465
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,200
 But again, whenever they get to the noise, it's gone, and now you're hearing it in the

466
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,120
 opposite end of the house.

467
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:02,600
 And you have this house full of John and his family and a bunch of butlers and maids, and

468
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:08,280
 you have a madman running around with a gun, truly driven mad at this point.

469
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:15,820
 A month after this all started, the drumming gets even louder, and now they're no longer

470
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,860
 hearing it against the exterior walls.

471
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:23,380
 It's coming from inside the house.

472
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,540
 You can't rationalize it anymore.

473
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:29,060
 You're no longer thinking, "Ah, it's just someone playing doorbell ditch.

474
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,060
 We haven't been to doorbells yet either."

475
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:35,700
 But now you're sitting in the kitchen and you're hearing it from the interior wall

476
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,280
 that leads in a living room.

477
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,560
 At this point your legs are tired.

478
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,400
 You've already run around so many times looking for the source of the noise you hear it.

479
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:48,440
 What starts to happen is the sounds begin to center themselves, almost like they moved

480
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:53,480
 in from the outside, now they're inside, and now they're focused on the kids' rooms.

481
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:58,160
 All the rooms that have the kids in them, their kids, John and his wife's kids, now

482
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,120
 that's where they're starting to hear these noises more.

483
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:07,220
 And so this is when you start to have modern day skeptics go, a lot of times when we have

484
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:11,740
 poltergeist activity it's pranks, and a lot of times it's kids playing pranks.

485
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:15,780
 When we look at Jeff the Talking Mongoose, it's an episode we did a long time ago, put

486
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:21,460
 it in the show notes, people said, "It's really weird that all this stuff was centered around

487
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,460
 the kid."

488
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,340
 And then we had this Zargoza, what's it called?

489
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,140
 I think, Goblin?

490
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,140
 Same thing.

491
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:31,100
 You started to hear these noises and they started to assume it was the kids involved.

492
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,440
 The modern day skeptics kind of at this point in the story go, "It's probably fake, it's

493
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,760
 probably the kids."

494
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,960
 People at the time though, they're kind of worried.

495
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,400
 Worrying that this demonic knocking is now in the house and it's centered around these

496
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,400
 kids.

497
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:48,320
 And not only is the knocking going on in the kids' bedrooms, which would kind of point

498
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,840
 towards the kids where the perpetrator is all along, let's assume that, right?

499
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,880
 Let's assume that the kids are pulling pranks.

500
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:59,160
 The kids are now floating in their bedrooms.

501
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,740
 It's kind of hard prank to pull off.

502
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,240
 There's wood carvings.

503
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,660
 It's beautiful, the wood carvings involved in the story, because it was super popular

504
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,500
 in its day.

505
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,300
 There's wood carvings of kids floating.

506
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,740
 There's wood carvings of the devil dancing on the roof.

507
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,500
 It's really cool, the photos will be in the show notes.

508
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,420
 But the kids, their beds start shaking late at night.

509
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:27,100
 They could hear horrible, scratching noises underneath their bed.

510
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,160
 And the kids were shaking.

511
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,760
 Listen, that's not good for a kid, right?

512
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,800
 I don't know how much you guys read horrible news websites.

513
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,600
 But shaking kids is never good.

514
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,800
 Their tiny little brains aren't built for that.

515
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,360
 So the kids are being shaken.

516
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,360
 They're floating around.

517
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:48,040
 I can just imagine John like going to kiss the kids because I'm the opposite toward.

518
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,040
 They're like floating around.

519
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,560
 He uses horrible scratching underneath your bed and he's like, "I'll just say good

520
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,720
 night from here.

521
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,640
 I love you."

522
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:04,980
 You would think at this point, right, whether or not you are a skeptic, get rid of the drum.

523
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,940
 Just get rid of the drum, right?

524
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:10,940
 This is obviously some sort of cursed item.

525
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,020
 Just get rid of the drum.

526
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,460
 He doesn't.

527
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,260
 He continues to keep the drum.

528
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:21,500
 William, William remember, he's in custody and he's sentenced for deportation.

529
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,300
 Destination, America, thanks a lot.

530
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,020
 They're going to send him to America.

531
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,480
 And they ask him about this.

532
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,640
 He is interrogating.

533
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,760
 He's asked, because again, John's a very high-ranking society, what is going on at his house and

534
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,600
 goes, "Oh yeah, I did that.

535
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,600
 I used magic spells and I cursed the drum.

536
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,600
 And what are you going to do about it, right?

537
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,160
 I obviously have the powers of the Dark Lord in me."

538
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:48,080
 And they ship him out to America.

539
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,800
 Even after confessing that he has the ability to possess a drum, or maybe not possess it

540
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,640
 himself, it has his face on it.

541
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,900
 He's like, "Beat me now.

542
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,980
 He's cursed his drum."

543
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:03,260
 They ship him out to America and we don't know what happened to him after that.

544
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:11,340
 But back to the house, back to the John house, this ordeal lasts two years, right?

545
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:16,700
 We're looking at 1663 and this thing is still going on.

546
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,140
 At this point, the drumming has not stopped.

547
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,780
 John still has possession of the drum.

548
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,980
 The kids are floating out of their beds.

549
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:28,880
 The servants are floating out of their beds.

550
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,720
 Some of them, or this is even scarier, some of them were pinned down.

551
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,160
 They could feel a force holding them down to their bed.

552
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:41,040
 People are constantly, constantly, this house is in a state of chaos.

553
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,280
 Servants and John and people are grabbing weaponry and running through the house trying

554
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,520
 to fight this thing.

555
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,480
 Trying to find the source of the noise.

556
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,840
 But now it's even more than that.

557
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,260
 They're starting to have panty noises.

558
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:59,780
 You can hear this hideous coming from certain sectors of the house.

559
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,060
 The smell of sulfur.

560
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,620
 People are automatically thinking that this is demonic.

561
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,460
 And the drumming, don't forget the drumming.

562
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,140
 The drumming is constant.

563
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,900
 They're constantly hearing this banging.

564
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,060
 It's so loud.

565
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,100
 Neighbors start complaining about it.

566
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:20,100
 Can you imagine having a house so haunted that the homeowners association has to get

567
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,100
 involved?

568
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,600
 People want to check this house out.

569
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:27,200
 It's become really popular in this course of two years since it's all started.

570
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,960
 You have the neighbors wanting to come over and see what's going on.

571
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,560
 You have people traveling from all over the country to see what's going on.

572
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,720
 At one point, you had a blacksmith show up.

573
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,480
 You know, big buff, burly blacksmith, I'm not afraid of no ghosts.

574
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,240
 He walks in there.

575
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,680
 He's staying there.

576
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,200
 And a pair of pinchers.

577
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,460
 Not like a pincher bug, but you know those big heavy metal tongs?

578
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:57,260
 Start flying around the house and pinching his nose.

579
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,100
 Now I don't care how big of a skeptic you are.

580
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:05,020
 I don't care how big of a science-minded dude you are.

581
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:09,020
 I think after this, you might be able to explain the first time it happened somehow.

582
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:14,020
 But after the third or fourth snip of the nose bite, what was he still doing there even

583
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,020
 after the first one?

584
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,020
 I'd be like, nope.

585
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,020
 I'm gone.

586
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:20,160
 There's a lot of stories like that, like priests showing up and getting scared out of their

587
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,160
 mind.

588
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,640
 This ends up attracting one of the very first paranormal investigators as well.

589
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:30,000
 January 1663, it attracted the attention of Joseph Glanville.

590
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,200
 Now you had demonologists and you had people working for the church investigating this

591
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,200
 stuff, but he's really considered one of the first people to be cataloging paranormal

592
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:43,400
 events, not necessarily just- he was a clergyman, but this was like raining frogs and stuff

593
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
 like that.

594
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,540
 He was like, "I'm going into the paranormal world as a whole."

595
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,860
 And he shows up and he does an investigation on it.

596
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:54,940
 And he wrote a book called A Blow at Modern Sadocism in some philosophical considerations

597
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,940
 about witchcraft.

598
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,540
 This is his famous book he wrote.

599
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,260
 And in this book, he mentions it.

600
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:04,100
 So this is how we got a lot of this information was from Joseph Glanville's investigation.

601
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:08,380
 And he goes, "This is a legit paranormal event.

602
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,820
 The kids have nothing to do with this."

603
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:14,840
 And so the fact that he specified that means that I think even back then people thought

604
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,160
 the kids were a part of it.

605
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,160
 He specified, "No."

606
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,080
 He goes, "The kids are like floating around the room."

607
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,080
 He's like, "Hmm.

608
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,080
 I remember being a child.

609
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,960
 I don't remember being able to do that."

610
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,840
 So as the first paranormal investigation, this is really cool.

611
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:34,080
 The first paranormal investigator at the very first documented poltergeist activity, and

612
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,160
 you have these two things colliding, he goes, "No, this is totally legit."

613
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:41,300
 This ends up becoming a super popular book around the same time, becomes a popular story.

614
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,660
 It's starting to be written into plays.

615
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,420
 So how does the story end?

616
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,420
 How does this story end?

617
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,420
 This is so fascinating.

618
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:51,140
 I love this story.

619
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:56,700
 There was a book published in 1827 called The Works of the Reverend John Wesley.

620
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:01,580
 This was volume three and it had all of these type of bizarre stories and just stuff about

621
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,860
 being a minister as well.

622
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:09,000
 And in this book in 1827, it wraps the story up.

623
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,280
 And this will happen a lot of times with Phenomenon.

624
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:16,680
 You'll see a glut of news articles when it first happens, when the stories first pop up,

625
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,080
 and then there's never any follow-up.

626
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,480
 We did that story a long time ago.

627
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,760
 It's one of the very creepy episodes at Dead or Abra Radio about the man who died while

628
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,680
 watching The Conjuring 2 in India.

629
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,840
 I'll put that in the show notes.

630
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,200
 I'm not gonna give away the ending for that story, but that one's really weird.

631
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,660
 And I spent a long time trying to find a follow-up, an ending to that story and no one ever published

632
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,660
 anything else.

633
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:43,660
 So either they don't know anything else or after the initial event when stuff comes down

634
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:48,340
 and maybe there is a rational answer for it, never gets published in the newspaper because

635
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,340
 it's not super exciting.

636
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:54,740
 But in 1827, in the books The Works of Reverend John Wesley, it wraps this story up and at

637
00:32:54,740 --> 00:33:00,780
 some point John came forward and said, "It's all fake."

638
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,820
 It was all fake.

639
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,320
 The drumming was fake.

640
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,960
 The kids levitating was fake.

641
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,120
 The scratches, the noise, it was all fake.

642
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,960
 I found out, it wasn't a part of it being fake, but I found out it was fake and I found

643
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:18,600
 out who faked it and that's it.

644
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,560
 And people were really disappointed by that, right?

645
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:26,960
 Because obviously there was nothing like this ever before in the world of the paranormal

646
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,280
 where you're having this much activity.

647
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:35,540
 People were disappointed by it, but at this point it had gone on for over two years, right?

648
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,540
 And so in 1663 he goes, "Yeah, it was all fake."

649
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,780
 And so was it the kids, right?

650
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,540
 Everyone's thinking that it must have been the kids.

651
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,660
 Joseph Glanville was fooled.

652
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,180
 We were all fooled, but it happens.

653
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,300
 We see a lot of fakery in this stuff.

654
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,860
 It's interesting that they faked the very first Poltergeist encounter because nowadays

655
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,700
 you could easily fake it because you have a bunch of stuff to base on, but he would

656
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,860
 say it was fake.

657
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:01,160
 And so that had happened at some point around 1663.

658
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,160
 He admitted it was fake.

659
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:08,280
 But in the book of the works of Reverend John Wesley, written in 1827, there's more information.

660
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:15,240
 This book says, "Yeah, we know that John eventually admitted that it was fake, but years later,

661
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:20,480
 years and years later, one of John's sons was in college."

662
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,080
 And the story was so popular that he'd still be asked questions about this.

663
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:30,580
 He was in college and some guy, one of his friends says, "Hey, why did your dad fake

664
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,860
 the whole haunting thing?

665
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,460
 What was the purpose of all of that?"

666
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:39,300
 And the son, who's now an adult attending college, goes, "Oh, he didn't fake that."

667
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:43,980
 And I go, "Okay, maybe he didn't fake it, but the kids faked it, right?

668
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,980
 It was all fake.

669
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,900
 I mean, what was the point where you guys just having fun?"

670
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:51,140
 And the son goes, "Oh, no, we didn't fake it."

671
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,140
 It wasn't fake.

672
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:59,240
 So many people were coming to the house, dude.

673
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,680
 We were getting visitors from all over.

674
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,160
 My dad couldn't take it anymore.

675
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,720
 Here's a quote from this book.

676
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:12,120
 "The resorts of gentlemen to my father's house was so great, he could not bear the

677
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,120
 expense.

678
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:19,400
 He therefore took no pains to compute the report that he had found out the cheat, although

679
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:26,420
 he and I and all the family knew the account which was published to be punctually true."

680
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:36,300
 It was easier to say, this was all fake and I found out who did it, because every time

681
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:40,860
 someone showed up to do this tea and grumpets time, he had to provide for these people who

682
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:46,060
 were traveling from all over to sit in his house and just financially, right, feeding

683
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,140
 them, giving them these treats.

684
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:54,440
 We also have a bunch of dudes spending the night in your house, getting pestered by

685
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,640
 people.

686
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,880
 All of this stuff, he just said, it's fake.

687
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,880
 It was all fake.

688
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,400
 I found out who did it.

689
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,600
 Sorry, guys, and everyone started to walk away.

690
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:11,320
 All the Lukey Luz went away, all the paranormal researchers disappeared, and the house settled

691
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,160
 down.

692
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:20,820
 And the event really, really happened.

693
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,260
 Fascinating, fascinating poltergeist story.

694
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:29,660
 It would be easier to come out and say it was all fake than to continue to deal with

695
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:33,780
 the Lukey Luz and the paranormal investigators and your neighbors, because obviously it's

696
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,780
 so loud.

697
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:42,220
 What I find fascinating is it seems once he declared it was fake, the phenomenon stopped.

698
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:48,160
 I mean, according to the reports we have, the son wasn't saying, yeah, and we just got

699
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,520
 used to the constant drumming.

700
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:55,200
 I think it stopped, which would make sense, because here was a man who was very proud of

701
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,880
 the position he had in society.

702
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:05,320
 And when he came across this bum banging on this drum, he used his authority to get that

703
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,960
 man thrown in prison.

704
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,960
 He did commit a crime.

705
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,640
 He did forge those documents.

706
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:14,460
 I mean, he used his authority, he used his place in society to have this man lose his

707
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:20,340
 livelihood, lose his drum, and then shipped off to another continent.

708
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:27,060
 And what's a better way to attack that guy than to attack his authority, to attack his

709
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:30,100
 pride?

710
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:36,060
 The phantom drumming, the noises, the children twirling around in the air, that all makes

711
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,180
 you feel very powerless.

712
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,180
 You can't stop it.

713
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,120
 You can't protect the people you love the most.

714
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:48,400
 But the fact that it pushed him to step in front of society and say it was all fake,

715
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,860
 all of it, means that he wasn't just a victim.

716
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:57,800
 People didn't see him as a victim of this satanic force, this unknowable, diabolical

717
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,600
 menace.

718
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,240
 It made him a fool.

719
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,920
 That's a curse, right?

720
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,540
 That's a curse.

721
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:13,240
 I guess the moral of the story is be careful who you cross.

722
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:18,180
 You may think you're going after someone more lowly than you, someone who can't strike

723
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,180
 back.

724
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:22,900
 You may think I'm a person you think I am.

725
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,200
 Just gotta be careful who you make your enemy.

726
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,780
 They may seem like they're harmless, just some...

727
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,420
 BOOM!

728
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:35,620
 But they may end up being someone so powerful.

729
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:39,840
 They can kill you and leave you alive.

730
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:43,700
 They can destroy your reputation and make you live out the rest of your natural life

731
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,520
 as a known fraud or a fool.

732
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,040
 Leave the man standing, destroy his reputation.

733
00:38:52,040 --> 00:39:03,640
 That is a truly, truly evil curse.
