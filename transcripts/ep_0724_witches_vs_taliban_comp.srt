1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Single ladies of the world, Shed a tear.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,040
 The world's most eligible bachelor ghost has gotten married.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,880
 And then we travel to Afghanistan to take a supernatural look at the current conflict

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,800
 raging over there.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,440
 Is it possible that a bunch of witches on Reddit may be able to defeat the Taliban today on

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:30,440
 Dead Rabbit Radio?

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,480
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,480
 I'm your host Jason Garminer.

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,480
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,080
 Hope you guys had an excellent weekend.

12
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,640
 We got a lot of stuff to cover so we're going to slide right into this.

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,280
 First off, let's give a shout out to one of our legacy patreons coming into Dead Rabbit

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,440
 Command right now.

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,440
 Give it up for Young Ghidorah.

16
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,160
 Everyone give a round of applause to Young Ghidorah walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

17
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,160
 Long time supporter of the show.

18
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,160
 Really really appreciated.

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,120
 Young Ghidorah, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,000
 If you guys cancel by the Patreon, I totally get it.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,720
 Just help spread the word about the show.

22
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,200
 That really really helps out a lot.

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,880
 Tell your friends, tell your family, tell your enemies.

24
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,520
 Tell them "ooh I'll hate it so much.

25
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,040
 If you listen to Dead Rabbit Radio that'll really get my goat."

26
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,520
 Young Ghidorah, I'm going to go ahead and tashi the oars to the Dead Rabbit Robo.

27
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,140
 We're going to take a nice leisurely sea journey.

28
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,240
 Sea bound journey.

29
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:30,200
 All the way out to a location I did not write down in my notes.

30
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,240
 So we're just going to swirl around in a boat for a bit.

31
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,640
 We're going to go through a magical whirlpool and we're there.

32
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,400
 Because this is one of those stories that the location doesn't really matter because

33
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,400
 we're talking about love.

34
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,400
 Right?

35
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,520
 Love doesn't have any geographical boundaries.

36
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,800
 Love doesn't have an address.

37
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,800
 So we're there.

38
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,260
 We're at the address where this woman lives which I clearly could have written down what

39
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,620
 country this story took place in.

40
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,500
 But that's lame.

41
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,900
 The reason why we're here, we're going to talk about this woman named Kathleen Roberts.

42
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,900
 She's a woman who is just going about life.

43
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,900
 Right?

44
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,420
 Just like the rest of us just trying to figure out where we belong.

45
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,700
 Our addresses are trying to figure out what country we live in.

46
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,700
 But she real...

47
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,620
 See some of us never get to figure out who we are.

48
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,220
 It's tragic, right?

49
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,800
 Some people just live their entire life going, "What could have been?

50
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,600
 Who am I?

51
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
 Where do I live?"

52
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,600
 Kathleen Roberts knows who she is though.

53
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,080
 She is the reincarnation of Marilyn Monroe.

54
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,280
 And she...

55
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,280
 You want proof?

56
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,280
 Okay.

57
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,280
 You want proof?

58
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,920
 You skeptic?

59
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,920
 There is a TikTok video.

60
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:43,560
 There's a bunch of TikTok videos of this woman dancing to a Marilyn Monroe song.

61
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,360
 Now I ask you.

62
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,960
 I ask you, listener.

63
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,940
 Could you dance to a Marilyn Monroe?

64
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,540
 Is there a Marilyn Monroe song?

65
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,460
 Is she known for her music?

66
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,340
 I guess she was in musicals?

67
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,780
 And I'm going to tell you this too.

68
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,620
 I don't want you guys to click off right away.

69
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,140
 You guys have to finish listening to this episode.

70
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,260
 She has her own podcast.

71
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,380
 Kathleen Roberts, aka Marilyn Monroe, has her own podcast.

72
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,260
 Actually, you should click off mine.

73
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:13,980
 Why would you want to listen to this big schlub talking a haunted closet about Marilyn

74
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,980
 Monroe?

75
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,000
 You can listen to Marilyn Monroe herself.

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,360
 And Marilyn Monroe is currently married.

77
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,000
 She's the reincarnation of Marilyn Monroe.

78
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,160
 But she's married to a ghost.

79
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,200
 There's just so many layers to this story.

80
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,360
 This is just...

81
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,120
 So Kathleen Roberts, aka Marilyn Monroe, is married to a ghost.

82
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,640
 The probably the most famous ghost of all time.

83
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,640
 You're like, "Jesus?"

84
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,640
 I'm like, "No, not Jesus."

85
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,280
 And technically he's not a ghost.

86
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,280
 But Michael Jackson.

87
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,420
 Okay, maybe the second most famous ghost.

88
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,740
 Maybe the 10th most famous ghost.

89
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,420
 I'm sure there's more famous ghosts out there.

90
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:55,660
 But the most famous ghost of our lifetime would be Michael Jackson.

91
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,140
 You're like, "You're shaking your head?"

92
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,500
 He's like, "No, he's not."

93
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,980
 Listen, man.

94
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:05,500
 If you were reincarnation of Marilyn Monroe, that would be the best you could do.

95
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,500
 That would be the best you could do.

96
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,420
 Who's better than Michael Jackson?

97
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:13,480
 So Marilyn Monroe is married to Michael Jackson.

98
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,280
 And you want proof?

99
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,840
 You want proof that any of this stuff is real?

100
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,840
 Why got proof?

101
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,840
 Are you skeptic?

102
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,320
 Why even listening to this podcast if you're just gonna go, "What?"

103
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,080
 No, this is just nonsense.

104
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,080
 Jason's just reading off the ramblings of a mad woman.

105
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,920
 There's video proof of this.

106
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,120
 She gets...

107
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,640
 So what happens is Michael Jackson possesses her.

108
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,060
 So they got married because Michael Jackson put this story in.

109
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,220
 We haven't even gotten to help us.

110
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,940
 This is still just scratching the surface.

111
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:50,620
 So Michael Jackson married this woman and he possesses her as well.

112
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,660
 So sometimes she's Marilyn Monroe...

113
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,560
 Well, she's always Marilyn Monroe because she's a reincarnation.

114
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,740
 But sometimes she talks in Marilyn Monroe's voice and sometimes she dances like Marilyn

115
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,740
 Monroe.

116
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,780
 But sometimes Michael Jackson possesses her and she can sing.

117
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,400
 There is a video clip of her and I really wish I could play it for you.

118
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,600
 There's no sort of copyright laws and probably like anti-bullying laws and things like that.

119
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,840
 But there is a clip of this woman.

120
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,840
 She's singing...

121
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,840
 Sorry, sorry.

122
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:28,480
 There's a clip of Michael Jackson singing through this woman all of me by John Legend.

123
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,640
 And here's the thing.

124
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,600
 I have this weird hang up.

125
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
 Don't do the whole song.

126
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,620
 Like obviously you're John Legend and you're performing it.

127
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,020
 Don't just do 30 seconds.

128
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,620
 But if you want to show me what a good singer you are or if you want to show me that same

129
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,940
 Michael Jackson as possessed your body, you don't have to go all the way to the bridge.

130
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,500
 You don't have to do the fade out of the end.

131
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,300
 Just give me a good couple bars.

132
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,080
 30 seconds, I'm good.

133
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,460
 She sings this whole song.

134
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,100
 Maybe she didn't sing the whole song.

135
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,220
 I couldn't listen anymore but I listened for about two or three minutes.

136
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,860
 She sings all of me by John Legend.

137
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,860
 I'm sorry.

138
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,120
 Michael Jackson sings all of me by John Legend through her body.

139
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,120
 That's proof guys.

140
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,800
 I kind of feel bad that...

141
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,520
 I'm a big Michael Jackson fan so I kind of feel bad that I'm shooting him down this much

142
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,520
 because there's proof of this.

143
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,760
 So they got married.

144
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,360
 And who?

145
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:28,360
 Okay so if Marilyn Monroe and Michael Jackson were getting married, who would officiate the

146
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,360
 wedding?

147
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:37,480
 This woman probably is suffering from something so I shouldn't be so giddy but when I was

148
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,420
 reading the story I kept going this can't get any better and yet it did and yet it constantly

149
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,340
 got better.

150
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:51,740
 Who would officiate the wedding between Michael Jackson and Marilyn Monroe?

151
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,100
 What's the most famous ghost you could see doing?

152
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,100
 You're like Jesus.

153
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,340
 I'm like no Jesus isn't a ghost for one.

154
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,120
 And two, who's the most famous minister that would...

155
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,280
 So now you guys got it.

156
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,680
 Who's the famous minister who would...

157
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,640
 You're like Jesus I have no idea where you're going with this.

158
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:13,760
 Who's the most famous minister who would marry Michael Jackson and Marilyn Monroe?

159
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,040
 As she was getting out of the bathtub one day, Kathleen Roberts was getting out of the

160
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,920
 bathtub one day.

161
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,800
 Michael Jackson showed up as a ghost.

162
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,280
 They'd been dating for a while.

163
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,880
 He's not a creepy stalker or anything.

164
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,200
 They'd been dating for a while.

165
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,460
 Because Kathleen Roberts had to get out of the bathtub one day.

166
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:34,900
 Michael Jackson showed up and Michael Jackson brought into this woman's bathroom Reverend

167
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,940
 Martin Luther King Jr.

168
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,260
 And he is the minister who officiated the wedding.

169
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:48,140
 She goes listen Michael Jackson is normally just in possession of my body and like he's

170
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,380
 like hanging out in there.

171
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,700
 It's like that movie identity.

172
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,060
 Spoiler alert for a 20 year old movie.

173
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:57,760
 It's a brilliant film but it's like that movie identity where there's like multiple people

174
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,800
 living inside of this woman.

175
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,480
 So one of his favorite things to do.

176
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,240
 Marilyn Monroe's been getting along swimmingly with Kathleen Roberts.

177
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,240
 They're the same person.

178
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,280
 They're not she's not possessed by Marilyn Monroe.

179
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,760
 I don't know why someone would make such a bizarre claim.

180
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,760
 That's not true.

181
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,680
 But Michael Jackson is possessing her and she goes Michael Jackson loves to make me eat

182
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,680
 cookies.

183
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,600
 Sorry I eat a bunch of cookies now.

184
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,460
 And he likes to so he's not always there.

185
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:30,180
 Sometimes he's like floating around but sometimes he's in her two distinct times whenever she

186
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,060
 eats cookies she's possessed by Michael Jackson.

187
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:38,300
 And when she goes to the bathroom Michael Jackson likes to be inside of her while she's

188
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,300
 using the restroom.

189
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,060
 I said earlier I'm a big Michael Jackson fan and I know that he's had a lot of scandals

190
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,220
 which I don't believe that he's guilty of.

191
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:51,460
 I would not be a big Michael Jackson fan and be like oh yeah but no he's totally guilty

192
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,200
 you know I think that was a lot of trumped up stuff and he went through multiple trials.

193
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,160
 But anyways I almost did a whole episode on it once and I didn't.

194
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,480
 So I'm not gonna do it now but anyways I think he's innocent.

195
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,800
 I wouldn't be a big fan of his if I thought he was guilty but if he does if he forget

196
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,960
 the old stuff because I don't think he's guilty of that.

197
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,840
 If he is currently guilty of making a woman eat cookies and then making her poop and being

198
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,800
 like yeah this is what I wanted.

199
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:21,380
 This is what I came back from the dead for to eat cookies and then poop him out.

200
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,380
 Bro you got some serious issues.

201
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:27,500
 I mean the other allegations were rough and I did believe him for a time.

202
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,300
 Like when they first I was not such a big Michael Jackson fan.

203
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,380
 That first trial I was like oh no dude that sucks I can't believe that he did that but

204
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,500
 then as time has gone on I don't believe it.

205
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:43,180
 But that aside if you do like possessing women and making them poop I might have to start

206
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,800
 burning my Michael Jackson albums again.

207
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,800
 She also says that when he possesses her she can't touch herself because he'll be in her

208
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,720
 body and be like oh Michael those cookies are so delicious she's rubbing her belly and

209
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,720
 Michael doesn't like being touched by her.

210
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,920
 So while she's trying to interact with Michael Jackson in her body this should be the clue

211
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,920
 right.

212
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,600
 If everything else wasn't a lead up to this woman might have some underlying issue she

213
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,440
 says that if Michael Jackson is in her body and she touches herself she sees visions of

214
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,440
 dead corpses.

215
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,420
 She just sees rotting bodies in front of her.

216
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:29,560
 Now you go that must mean that you need to go to a doctor.

217
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,980
 You're having hallucinations not only are you having hallucinations you're not hallucinating

218
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:38,020
 say like a smell you're not hallucinating a cartoon bird landing on your shoulder you're

219
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:44,400
 hallucinating an unending sea of decaying human bodies you might want to go get checked

220
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,400
 up.

221
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,720
 What happens is that's Michael Jackson in her brain saying I don't want to be touched

222
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,360
 I don't want to be touched by you so I'm going to show you the most horrific things a human

223
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,360
 can see.

224
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,440
 I'm going to show you corpses I'm going to show you rotting human flesh.

225
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:06,040
 So little heavy handed there Michael Jackson and really the question you're asking the

226
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:13,140
 question you're asking isn't why didn't Martin Luther King show up to my wedding no the question

227
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:22,460
 is why her and she has a good answer for this she says it's disgusting the answer is disgusting

228
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:27,660
 but it makes sense in her mind and in the minds of millions of other people the reason

229
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:33,140
 why Michael this is when I knew the story was fake this is why I totally believed everything

230
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:39,280
 else I was like whoa she is dancing like Marilyn Monroe but when she said this I go it's fake

231
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:48,640
 she goes the reason why he's attracted to me was because of her quote childlike of course

232
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,800
 you couldn't have a Michael Jackson story that bringing this up I'm not bringing it up

233
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:58,040
 she is but quote there this is the reason why he's attracted to her her quote childlike

234
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:07,140
 personality and small hands and feet unquote she's not a hobbit she's a normal sized human

235
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:12,820
 she didn't have particularly small hands I've watched multiple tiktoks of her but yeah so

236
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:18,340
 I did get a sense of the dimensions of her body so these articles are recently published

237
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:23,580
 in the Daily Star which is a trash website it's not even a step above the national choir

238
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:28,120
 it is the national inquirer I got the story though from the New York I normally don't

239
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,920
 read the Daily Star as entertaining as it is because there's so much fake stuff in it

240
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,960
 I've researched stuff and it turned out to be not true shocker of shocks the New York

241
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:42,880
 Post which I read every day ran an article on this woman and they linked it back to the

242
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,320
 Daily Star and she does to be fair Daily Star didn't make this up they're just reporting

243
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,160
 this as if this was real and so I went through all of her tiktoks and I was watching her

244
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,180
 I'm sorry Michael Jackson performed all of me by John Legend and she has her own podcast

245
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,900
 if you guys are like to listen to that but she's actually come out because these New

246
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:06,380
 York Posts article was fairly recent and she's come out since August 18th and she goes oh

247
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:11,420
 no no no no no no no no those articles are old like that or that news is old the articles

248
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:16,220
 are new but they're they're picking that up from old tiktoks and old podcasts me and

249
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,700
 Michael Jackson have gotten a divorce they've actually been divorced for a year now she

250
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:26,440
 said they got divorced we don't know where he's floating around he could be standing

251
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,800
 right behind you right now and if he was at vc we're jealous Marilyn Monroe is now dating

252
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:39,920
 what might be the best band name ever Marilyn Monroe is of course right the star just can't

253
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,240
 end with her not being I'm gonna be single I'm gonna be single until the ghost of Genghis

254
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:54,500
 Khan rides into town now she is currently dating an Astroly projected Johnny Depp if

255
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,060
 someone doesn't have a band called Astroly projected Johnny Depp by the end of the week

256
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:04,300
 I don't even know why I'm doing this so Kathleen Roberts aka Marilyn Monroe we wish you the

257
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,660
 best whatever that may be I'm not gonna make any assumptions that she does have some sort

258
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:14,760
 of mental illness I will say this though if you continue to have visions of dead corpses

259
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,240
 then you might want to go see someone because then it shows that it wasn't Michael Jackson

260
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:25,600
 doing it you're just hallucinating unending fields of the dead in the damned so that is

261
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,640
 worth going to a doctor to have a checkup on young Ghidorah I'm gonna go ahead and toss

262
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,960
 you the keys to the carbonicopter we are leaving behind wherever we were at people are like

263
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:40,180
 please I want to know where this story took place because I'm afraid it might be in my

264
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:44,900
 hometown I'm afraid I may know this woman young Ghidorah take us up up and away in

265
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:53,900
 the carbonicopter we are headed on out to Afghanistan and as we're headed out there

266
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:59,220
 I want to do really quick dead rabbit recommends this one's a bit unusual for dead rabbit recommends

267
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:03,780
 I recommend a lot of movies pretty much all movies this one's a book it's a children's

268
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:09,320
 book though it's basically for ages four to nine but I read it and I thoroughly enjoyed

269
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:16,200
 it it's called Mr. Waffles this book is dope I'm not gonna go super in a detail to avoid

270
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:21,560
 the plot but it's perfect it's the story of an alien invasion happening in the middle

271
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:28,840
 of the afternoon and the only person there to stop it is a house cat or depending on

272
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:35,820
 your point of view some alien explorers are just coming towards earth but they're tiny

273
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:40,660
 and they come across the path of a malicious black cat there's a little bit of English

274
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:47,140
 in it but the most of it is these aliens talking to ants and you kind of the kid can kind of

275
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:51,820
 make of their own it's really interesting because when I first read in it I thought one of this

276
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:57,940
 be hard for like a kid to like learn language but Sabine who who showed me the book she

277
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,960
 goes no it actually it's for the kids imagination like what are they saying this time what are

278
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:06,000
 they say and from the expressions on the aliens faces and what they're doing you can actually

279
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,320
 make up your own dialogue it's really cool it's really really cool I recommend checking

280
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,680
 it out if you guys I know a lot of you guys have kids it might be a great book to read

281
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,880
 to them and to read with them because there's a lot of imagination has aliens and it's a

282
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,120
 really cool adventure and if you got to get a gift for someone if you don't have kids but

283
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,900
 you got nieces or nephews or friends that have kids or things like that or you just want

284
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,500
 to buy copies of this book and throw them out into the neighborhood don't do do not do

285
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:37,580
 that but Mr. Waffles that rather recommends Mr. Waffles it's a really unique book and

286
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:42,700
 it's unlike an award-winning book it's it's kind of old I think it's like from 2013 but

287
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:48,700
 very highly recommended overall not just me but I do recommend Mr. Waffles that'll be

288
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:53,880
 in the show notes young Adore land this Carverner copter we're not going into Kabul it's a

289
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,340
 Taliban controlled really the whole country right now is Taliban controlled but there

290
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:03,340
 are uprisings there are freedom fighters see now Taliban's in control now they're the

291
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:07,420
 government now they got to worry about streets and electrical grids and pollution and stuff

292
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:12,940
 like that it's always easier to be the freedom fighter it really is you have no responsibility

293
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:18,940
 other than don't die which is pretty big responsibility but you're not worried about

294
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,380
 transportation you're not worried about are there potholes in the road when you're a

295
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,600
 freedom fighter you're starting to see there is this resistance movement growing up in

296
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:31,680
 cities on the outskirts or you know farther off from the capital in Afghanistan so we're

297
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,520
 starting to see that but we're out here where Afghanistan we're sitting on a mountain we're

298
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,600
 looking down and we're thinking man you know this country has just been in war for so long

299
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,640
 so it's invaded it then they went through like a four or five year civil war and the

300
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,480
 Taliban took control and then the United States invaded it and what could we possibly hope

301
00:17:49,480 --> 00:18:00,140
 for for this nation and that's when we hear a turn and there stands Michael Jackson Michael

302
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:05,060
 Jackson's there he's like hey guys and he sits down and he realized that Jason didn't do

303
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,700
 any Michael Jackson's so he's sitting there with all this mountain and we're looking

304
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:14,740
 over Afghanistan and then we hear and we all turn and we look and there's this witch standing

305
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:19,320
 there and we go whoa we know she's a witch not because she has the pointy hat and like

306
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,840
 the bumpy nose and the broom she does have all that stuff she totally looks like a stereotypical

307
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:31,320
 witch but we also just feel the energy coming off of her we kind of shirk back Michael Jackson

308
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:36,820
 so scared he possesses you Michael Jackson so scared he's now in your body he don't

309
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:41,000
 touch yourself and so this witch is standing there and she's looking over she goes foolish

310
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:48,060
 models while you sit on this mountain debating your human affairs we have already taken action

311
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:56,140
 and she snaps her fingers electricity shooting everywhere the Taliban run power grid is gone

312
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,860
 awry of course she's just but electrocuted and a bunch of people but that's not what

313
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:04,980
 she did she's looking and we see the landscape in front of us all these Taliban soldiers

314
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,860
 they're running with their guns our guns they're running with us made guns and body armor but

315
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:15,840
 they're running towards us and she just waves her hand and they just turn to butterflies

316
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:22,120
 and she goes you see you want to solve things with violence us witches are different we

317
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:31,000
 want to use magic I want to give a shout out to listener why do countries exist they've

318
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,040
 they've recommended a bunch of stuff on this show longtime listener of the show thank you

319
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,400
 very much they recommended this to me the other day really appreciate it super bizarre

320
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:45,460
 and I gotta say this I'm really torn on it because a lot of this comes from a subreddit

321
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:52,420
 called be which the Taliban which is I gotta be frank that you're seeing memes come off

322
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:58,020
 of this already when you've tracked the memes down to the user and you look at their username

323
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:03,460
 their trolls like there's a real popular meme going around right now saying do not face

324
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:10,920
 Allah alone while astral projecting and it tells this story about this woman who's trying

325
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:20,160
 to astraly project to weaken Allah so the Taliban will be weaker and she's floating around

326
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,600
 and Allah shows up and just totally owns her right just totally defeats her and she's like

327
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,800
 I had to come back to earth and she goes I man it was so he was like way stronger than

328
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,580
 I thought he was gonna be like totally messed me up I didn't expect him to be that strong

329
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:38,380
 throwing galaxies at me so I stopped meditating and had to light some candles and had it heal

330
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:44,460
 my soul you'll see that pasta pop around a bit do not face Allah alone when astral projecting

331
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:51,460
 and basically saying if we are able to weaken Allah then we can weaken the Taliban it's dumb

332
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:56,900
 and it's fake it's fake that was actually posted by a troll and I know it was posted

333
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,760
 by a troll because I was looking through their post history and someone called the mountains

334
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:07,560
 how dare you try to take down God they responded quote I'll have you know I graduated top of

335
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:12,000
 my class in the coven and I've been involved in numerous secret astral raids on al-Qaeda

336
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,440
 and I have over 300 confirmed banishings to the shadow realm if you don't recognize that

337
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:21,520
 right off the bat that is that is a pasta that's been going around that always gets modified

338
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:27,700
 it was originally a special forces guy and so yeah when we're talking about this banish

339
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:34,300
 the Taliban subreddit a lot of it is trolling stuff but it's hard to tell if it started

340
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:38,540
 off that way because it started off on the original witchcraft subreddit there was a

341
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:44,800
 user named Cogito ergo someone their initial post on the witchcraft subreddit was can we

342
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:50,340
 cause a mass hexing of the Taliban forces you want to do something you want to help

343
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:55,200
 people out so I can understand if you thought you were a witch thought you had magical powers

344
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,520
 that can we do this and I honestly believe and it could be wrong on this but I honestly

345
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:05,880
 believe that that initial post was sincere and that was it and then people started talking

346
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,920
 about it but it was mostly people fighting with each other sure the Taliban is bad but

347
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,640
 if you hex them hex is only going to come back on you even more other people say yeah

348
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,240
 hexing is bad but the Taliban deserves and it breaks into this weird fight that goes

349
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:24,980
 on and on and on and it seemed to be mostly people who actually believe in witchcraft

350
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:31,780
 believe in magic so I do believe the initial thing was sincere but then Cogito ergo someone

351
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:36,620
 starts their own subreddit called be witch the Taliban which immediately got taken over

352
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:42,540
 by trolls and that's when we see this person come in and leave this thing about actually

353
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:47,220
 projecting to fight Allah it's definitely meant to be inflammatory there's much stuff

354
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:53,280
 and then we saw another subreddit pop up from that called be witch Taliban they left out

355
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,320
 the the and they left out all the people who want to join them it seems to be dead at this

356
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:03,160
 point and then in some bizarre I don't know if this was something set up to show how ridiculous

357
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:10,920
 the whole thing was or there's now one called be witch the KKK and that has the same post

358
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,360
 someone took the same post from be witch the Taliban and just changed the words so they

359
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,980
 said oh I actually projected to fight God so I could weaken the KKK and blah blah blah

360
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:26,420
 so I don't know if they're trying to make a point what the point may be but whatever

361
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:31,860
 it is that one is trolley as well so the be witch the Taliban may have started out sincere

362
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:37,740
 it was overtaken by trolls very shortly be witch the KKK is trolley to begin with so

363
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,660
 this story here I'd say probably if you look at these forums I'd say you probably have

364
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:49,440
 70 to 80% of these people are trolls trolls are larkers and they know they're larkers

365
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,760
 and they're all trolling each other trolls like oh I can't believe that person actually

366
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,240
 took me seriously and the person who quote unquote took them seriously was like oh my

367
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,400
 god I can't believe they took that comment seriously and it's just like this back and

368
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,200
 forth thing and everyone thinks they're fooling other people but the people they're fooling

369
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,200
 also are fooling on each other and then there's probably a good 20% who actually believe this

370
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,300
 stuff not saying that they believe in magic overall but they believe that this is a movement

371
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:17,980
 and they're not getting the irony they're not clicking on the user names to see what else

372
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:22,780
 they've posted that's usually the first thing I do when I come across the ghost story that's

373
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:26,380
 too good to be true I click on their name and if they've posted four or five ghost stories

374
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:32,220
 that are too good to be true it's a bad sign doesn't mean they're lying but it does make

375
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:38,980
 it a little suspicious this is my issue with this story though I mean it could have easily

376
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,320
 just been a story I covered in the beginning and said this crazy thing's happening on Reddit

377
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,480
 these witches think they can fight the Taliban but it's mostly trolls let's move on to our

378
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:51,400
 next story I think this is dangerous stuff I am always joking around with witches and

379
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,120
 saying how lame they are and how their magic isn't real and stuff like that but at the

380
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,960
 same time I'm gonna stand by that stuff but at the same time I do believe in magic I do

381
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:05,280
 believe that magic exists and I've never really talked to you guys about stuff I used to do

382
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:11,820
 in college regarding that and maybe maybe I never will there's some of my stories are

383
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:18,380
 just so bizarre that you go that's just insane and I go you're right it is Michael Jackson

384
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:22,260
 was hanging out with me in college it was so bizarre I saw so many corpses with that

385
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:29,580
 man but I do believe that magic exists I don't believe it's as readily available as most

386
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:33,260
 people think it is I don't think you can buy a couple books and go on Reddit and start

387
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:38,880
 hexing people so their shoelaces fall off I think it's a combination of a learn skill

388
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,200
 which really this goes down to anything it's always a combination between learn skill and

389
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:51,240
 just natural ability but that's the individual that's the individual spellcaster what happens

390
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,080
 when people do take this seriously you're seeing all this horrible stuff going on over

391
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,680
 in Afghanistan you want to do something people start taking this seriously and it's not just

392
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:03,080
 one or two people but this movement will grow the footage coming out of Afghanistan is

393
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:08,020
 only going to get worse it's really only going to get worse over the months and the years

394
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:13,100
 must you know a miracle happens but you see this movement grow and you have people forget

395
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:18,780
 about the troll origin of it it actually gets outweighed by the earnest by the sincere and

396
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:24,260
 these people who believe that they're magic users if you get enough of them together can

397
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:32,180
 they accomplish something a single magic user single well trained practitioner of magic would

398
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:40,300
 be better than a hundred students but what about ten thousand students what about five

399
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:46,420
 hundred thousand students they're all really inept at it and they can barely do anything

400
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:53,180
 but if they're all focused on the same goal could they enact change if they you have five

401
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:59,100
 hundred thousand people meditating for an hour a day two hours a day whatever meditating

402
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:06,540
 to hex the Taliban could it work and you go Jason maybe that would be a good thing though

403
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:11,780
 wouldn't it their gun stop working their vehicles are breaking down good old American engineering

404
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:16,060
 helicopters are falling out of the sky that would be great if they could do a mass hex

405
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:21,900
 spell against the Taliban you would think so and I would think so too but I want to

406
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:29,700
 end it off with the thoughts of a Reddit user named dolly throw away 99 and they warned about

407
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:35,020
 this the last time you guys tried casting a mass hex against president Trump remember

408
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:42,260
 that which is against Trump that went on for four years we got the coronavirus you got

409
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:49,420
 rid of Trump you hexed them but your collective energy hexed all of us sure the Taliban maybe

410
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:55,300
 hex they may fall out of power they may be pushed out of the land but every true magic

411
00:27:55,300 --> 00:28:06,820
 user knows you pay a price for every spell you cast will the world be ready when that

412
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:36,100
 price tag comes due.

413
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,100
 you

414
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,100
 you

415
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,100
 you

416
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,100
 you

417
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,100
 you

418
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,100
 you

419
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,100
 you

420
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,680
