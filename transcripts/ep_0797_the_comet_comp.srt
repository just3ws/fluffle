00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,300
 The Black Bedroom Phenomenon. We've covered a couple stories about this already.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:11,000
 Stories of people waking up in their room, but their room is in another universe.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,500
 Kind of a bizarre story, that's what we talk about on a paranormal show.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:21,000
 We're gonna take one last look at this phenomenon and see if we can figure out any kind of answer.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,500
 And then we travel to Sri Lanka to see if a world famous science fiction author has a dark secret.

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:41,500
 And then we travel out to Chile. The year is 1540 and a tribe of Mapuche natives are about to collide with Spanish conquistadors.

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,500
 But before the first drop of blood can be shed, a comet hits the earth.

8
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,000
 And Virgin Mary jumps out of the crater. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,500
 [Music]

10
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,500
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

11
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,500
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:13,500
 Can you guys hear the enthusiasm in my voice? This is the last week before I take my break, aka.

13
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:21,500
 This is Jason running on fumes and anything else I could possibly get a hold of.

14
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:29,000
 And someone I can get a hold of and I hug them really tight, give a round of applause to our newest Patreon supporter walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 It's Live Nihilism. Everyone give a big round of applause to Live Nihilism. Or maybe Live Nihilism. I don't know.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 But Live or Live, what would you call you, Live Nihilism? I guess you could ask, I guess you could ask how to pronounce his name.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,500
 Live Nihilism, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode. If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

18
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,500
 Just help spread the word about this show really, really helps out a lot.

19
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,500
 We also have a merch store. And if you want to get me something for Christmas, I never talk about this.

20
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,500
 I said this stuff like 8-10 months ago and I was like, this is cringe.

21
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:05,500
 I have a Amazon shopping list. There's a bunch of books there. You're like, oh man, this guy really likes Star Trek.

22
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:11,500
 How many Star Trek books does he have on his wish list? No, I got a bunch of books there if you guys want to send me something for Christmas.

23
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,500
 You can do that. Or send me something to my PO Boxes.

24
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:21,500
 Well, I'm basically using this podcast. I did this podcast for 16 seasons just to get free Christmas presents.

25
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,500
 And I am really leaning towards doing a Christmas Eve livestream.

26
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,500
 I'm thinking that might be easier for people to attend right now.

27
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,500
 Tentatively, 5pm Pacific Standard Time, but I'll let you guys know.

28
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,500
 You can only listen one episode a week. You gotta give us all the information each episode. We'll figure it out.

29
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:46,500
 Oh, and I wanted to say this too, before we start, Live Nihilism has already started packing his gear onto the Dead Rabbit Durgible,

30
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,500
 but I went and saw Spider-Man No Way Home this weekend. I talked about it on Friday's episode. I really enjoyed it.

31
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,500
 I hadn't seen the second one. I watched that one. And I really enjoyed that one too.

32
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,500
 The first half sucked. It was super boring, but the second half was really good.

33
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,500
 The second one, this third one was really good. The reason why I'm talking about it, it's not a movie review podcast.

34
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,500
 The reason why I'm talking about it is I've talked about the director several times on this show.

35
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:17,500
 And I really think the director is watching and getting me too or something at some point, but I think the director, John Watts,

36
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:26,500
 is really like a hero to me. And this is why. John Watts is one of those guys that made me get off my own butt and start doing stuff,

37
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,500
 because John Watts, he was like a special effects guy working for some company.

38
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:36,500
 And then he decided to make his own short movie. It was a trailer called Clown. He got a bunch of money together,

39
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,500
 just like Robert Rodriguez back in the day, where he's a bunch of money, made a fake trailer for a movie called Clown,

40
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,500
 and put it on YouTube. And that's always the first step, right? It's always the first step to be creative.

41
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:53,500
 I'd much rather, honestly, there's a lot of days when I'm working on this show where I'd rather be playing Fortnite or Creeper World 4

42
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,500
 or watching Burn Notice or whatever. But I always find myself coming back to the show because I love it,

43
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,500
 but I wouldn't know how much I loved the show if I didn't start doing it in the first place.

44
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:09,500
 So, John Watts makes this short YouTube fake trailer for a movie called Clown, which doesn't exist,

45
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,500
 and it was a really good horror movie, just like you're imagining the scenario.

46
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:20,500
 And then Eli Roth saw it. Eli Roth hooked him up with the studio, so he gets a deal to make a full-length movie of Clown.

47
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,500
 And then Marvel said, "How would you like to direct a Spider-Man film?"

48
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:34,500
 And now he's done three. That would never have happened had he not gotten off his butt years ago to make that short film.

49
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,500
 And that's so important for creative people. It's the putting in the work. It's putting in the work.

50
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:44,500
 So, I love the Spider-Man character. The movies, they're okay. Some of them are better than others.

51
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:50,500
 But the story of John Watts, I think, should be an inspiration. It's an inspiration to me, and hopefully it brings inspiration to other people.

52
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,500
 Live nihilism, you got all your gear on the Dead Rabbit Durgable. Here, I'm gonna toss you the keys officially.

53
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:04,500
 Let's all hop on board. We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We are headed all the way out to a super spooky bedroom.

54
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,500
 [Dog growling]

55
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,500
 Dead Rabbit Durgable is flying around. It's your bedroom. Your bedroom, you didn't know this?

56
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,500
 Your bedroom is officially the spookiest bedroom on the planet Earth. You're like, "Aw, man."

57
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:22,500
 It's so funny because just recently, I don't remember if it was Thursday or Friday's episode, I talked about the black rooms.

58
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:28,500
 And that is this phenomenon where people are waking up in the middle of the night, and...

59
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:34,500
 Jason, are you saying they're waking up in the middle of the night and the room's dark? That's the way bedrooms normally are.

60
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:41,500
 It's different. It's a complete void. And what's weird is the furniture is still there in a sense.

61
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:50,500
 Like, sometimes the bed is there. Like, the bed's physically there, right? But when they're walking on the ground, they're walking in just this pitch black void.

62
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:57,500
 I'm wondering if they can see their dressers or are the dressers part of the void? Like, are they constantly bumping into stuff?

63
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,500
 So that is the phenomenon no one has in the black bedroom. We've talked about it on the show before.

64
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,500
 And you guys seem to be really interested. I've gotten a lot of feedback on these shows, on those stories as well.

65
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:15,500
 Edgar Escobedo just sent me this, just sent me this the other day. He found on Reddit, there...

66
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,500
 I saw this meme going around as well. I never really took a close look at it, so Edgar, thanks for sending it over.

67
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,500
 And I took a better look at it. It's a "how to give yourself a out-of-body experience."

68
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,500
 And what it is, I'll put it in the show notes, because I'm not going to explain it. There's like seven steps and all this stuff.

69
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,500
 But it basically is how to go from lucid dreaming to floating out of your body.

70
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,500
 Is this actually possible? I'm leaning towards no, honestly.

71
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:47,500
 It does tie into the black bedroom phenomenon, because it says if you do all the steps right, a rope will appear and you can climb up the rope and go...

72
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:53,500
 go hang out on a jungle gym in the actual world. And if you don't do it right, you end up in a gray void.

73
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,500
 You end up in your room, but it's like a gray singular light source void.

74
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:03,500
 And some people like to go there, but most people don't, because that's kind of not the goal of having the out-of-body experience.

75
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,500
 And I was thinking, but it's "agel," right?

76
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:14,500
 Like the idea of something paranormal, if it went wrong and it still caused a paranormal outcome, that's still a paranormal event.

77
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:20,500
 If you use the Ouija board and you're like, "Oh, that sucks. Ghosts don't exist and there's like a demon walking up behind you."

78
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,500
 It's still a paranormal event.

79
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,500
 So with this, I was like, "Well, that's still something."

80
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:33,500
 But the thing is, with the world of paranormal, it almost defies explanation. You can't prove it.

81
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:40,500
 So if there was something that you said, if you do these rituals, if you do X paranormal event will happen, if you do Y paranormal event will happen,

82
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:47,500
 this would have been vetted by science over the past 50 years, or maybe even the past 50 hours, since this meme has been going around,

83
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:53,500
 people would have been vetting it scientifically. And I would say nine times out of ten, it ends with you waking up being like,

84
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,500
 "Whoa, what a crazy dream I had."

85
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,500
 Actually, I would say that's probably 99 out of 100 attempts and then one of them, you may...

86
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:08,500
 I do believe that out-of-body experiences are possible and I do believe in astral projection, but I don't think it's anything you can learn on Reddit on a meme,

87
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,500
 on like an infograph.

88
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,500
 Maybe if you studied this infograph for years and years and years.

89
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,500
 "Edgar, thanks for sending over. I'm not knocking that at all."

90
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,500
 And it did, this is what gave me the idea to relook at the black bedrooms, but I just don't see it happening.

91
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:28,500
 And then it gives really bizarre instructions. Most of it is just like, fall asleep for a step if you're gonna lose a dream, it's taken half.

92
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,500
 But then, like when I was talking about, so once you're in the lucid dream, you have to stabilize the dream.

93
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:39,500
 You have to make sure that you know it's a dream, but the dream doesn't blow up, because I've lucid dreamed before and almost immediately,

94
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,500
 almost immediately I nuke the entire area.

95
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,500
 Almost every time I've lucid dreamed, almost every time I've realized I'm dreaming,

96
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,500
 I then just destroy everything near me. And it's not necessarily intentional.

97
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,500
 I'm not gonna say it's always accidental either, but you want to stabilize the dream.

98
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,500
 So it gives you three different ways you can stabilize the dream.

99
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,500
 Number one is once you realize you're dreaming, look at your hands really close in your dream.

100
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,500
 Look at your hands really close and it says this is actually the best way to stabilize the dream.

101
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,500
 The third option is touch anything.

102
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,500
 So if you're in the dream and you're like, "Oh, I'm dreaming."

103
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,500
 And then you can touch a wall and you'll be like, "Okay, the wall, it still feels real."

104
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,500
 But I know I'm dreaming. The second one, which I skipped, obviously you guys know how to count,

105
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,500
 is one of the most odd things. Like, okay, you're in a dream world.

106
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,500
 First one is to look at your hands. The second one, or the third one is to touch something.

107
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:37,500
 The second one is to chew anything.

108
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,500
 Chew literally anything. And he means literally anything.

109
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,500
 Chew anything. Basically, if you think you're dreaming, if you think you're dreaming,

110
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,500
 but you're not sure, you can pick something up and eat it.

111
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,500
 Now, it says chew anything, right? So you're thinking, "Oh, I'll just have gum in my pocket."

112
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,500
 Or, "I'll have it like a Twinkie." You're constantly eating Twinkies.

113
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,500
 You're like, "I don't know what's real anymore."

114
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,500
 They say, "Chew something absolutely anything will do."

115
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,500
 So that's pretty open-ended, right? And I would have thought, "Oh, I just pull a Snickers out of my pocket."

116
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,500
 Or, "I watch them at college." Or something like that. But he adds.

117
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,500
 Why would you add this? I don't get this at all.

118
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:24,500
 "Chew something absolutely anything will do even dead leaves."

119
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,500
 Why? Why would you add that? Why would you...

120
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,500
 I think he would have just said anything, and people would have assumed edible things.

121
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,500
 But this lunatic is like, "I don't know what's real."

122
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,500
 And he sees some guy raking. He sees some guy's raking.

123
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,500
 He's like, "Oh, Elysium." And he jumps into the pile of leaves he's eating.

124
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,500
 Like Scrooge McDuck swimming around the money bank.

125
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,500
 He's all, "Spin up the slugs." He's all, "Bleh."

126
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,500
 "Get off my yummy leaf." Why would you add that?

127
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,500
 Why would you say even dead leaves?

128
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,500
 It doesn't make any sense at all.

129
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,500
 And we're talking about a guy who's saying you can travel out of your body.

130
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,500
 Which again, I believe that's possible. I don't think I would ever...

131
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,500
 Because again, you don't know what you're dreaming, right?

132
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,500
 So in the real world, you would be like, "Oh, look at these delicious leaves."

133
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,500
 Then you know that you're actually trapped in the dream.

134
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,500
 I do want to say this though.

135
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,500
 That if you don't know of the movie Dead Leaves,

136
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,500
 I don't think I've ever talked about it on this show.

137
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,500
 I don't think I've ever Dead Rabbit recommended it, and I can't figure out why.

138
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,500
 When I saw this, it was almost like a trigger. It was like a hypnotic trigger.

139
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,500
 Dead Leaves is one of my favorite movies ever made.

140
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,500
 Dead Leaves is absolutely phenomenal.

141
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:38,500
 And if you've never seen it, I'll try to find a high-res version of the show notes.

142
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,500
 Like to put a link in. That's not a legal bootleg, but...

143
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,500
 Man, dude, Dead Leaves...

144
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,500
 Is amazing movie.

145
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,500
 But anyways, and I'm not a big fan of cartoons, so...

146
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,500
 But anyways, let's get back on topic.

147
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,500
 So let's leave behind your spooky bedroom, live nihilism.

148
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,500
 I'm going to go ahead and touch the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

149
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,500
 We are headed all the way out to Sochi in Russia.

150
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
 [imitates sound of a car]

151
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,500
 Weren't Sochi, that's in the Caucasus region of Russia?

152
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:15,500
 It's mid-July 1989. It's 1130 p.m.

153
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,500
 And we're staring in through the window of this young woman.

154
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
 She's sleeping in a bed.

155
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,500
 Actually, we have her address if we want to talk to this lady.

156
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,500
 I don't think she lives here anymore, so I think I'm okay.

157
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:31,500
 I mean, she lives in an apartment on Vor Vaskoga Street.

158
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,500
 I don't think it's considered doxing someone if you can't pronounce their address.

159
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,500
 I think I'm totally fine.

160
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,500
 She's sleeping there and she... Well, she's trying to sleep there.

161
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,500
 She can't fall asleep because her back pain is keeping her up.

162
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,500
 And it's July, so I guess even in Russia that's hot.

163
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,500
 So it's like a hot night, and she's like, "Oh, this totally sucks. My back hurts."

164
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,500
 And finally, though, finally she starts to fall asleep.

165
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,500
 So she's finally ready to fall asleep. She shuts her light off.

166
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,500
 That's probably why she wasn't awake rolling around so much.

167
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,500
 She had her light on, right? Shut the light off, lady. That's the first thing you do.

168
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:09,500
 She shuts her light off and the first thing she realizes is that the room is pitch black.

169
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,500
 You're like, "Jason, please, put your hand and make this a phenomenon.

170
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,500
 It's not a phenomenon. It's what happens when lights get shot off."

171
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,500
 But it's unusually black.

172
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,500
 And you're like, "Oh, you didn't say that."

173
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,500
 It's too dark. It's just too dark for normally the light just being shut off.

174
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,500
 So this woman, she gets out of bed. She's kind of standing there in the void

175
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,500
 and she goes, "What is going on? I don't understand this."

176
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,500
 And she starts to walk around her room.

177
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,500
 And what's described as she walks for a while.

178
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,500
 Now, I don't think she-- she lives in an apartment. I don't think she has this big room.

179
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:49,500
 But she seems to be walking for longer than it would take for her to get from one end of her room to the other.

180
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,500
 And then she sees her bedroom window. She's like, "Oh, I totally forgot I had one of those."

181
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,500
 She's walking around her room for a while. She remembers she has a bedroom window.

182
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,500
 So she walks over there and she looks out the bedroom window.

183
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,500
 Now, this is important because in all of our other black bedroom stories,

184
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,500
 they are trapped in a black void.

185
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,500
 The last one we covered last week, there seem to be some sort of--

186
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,500
 if I remember correctly, alien entities and some sort of portal, some sort of mechanical portal.

187
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,500
 And then the first one, it was just an endless black void.

188
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,500
 I think we even covered another one where someone got out of their bed

189
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,500
 and they looked down and the universe was underneath them.

190
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,500
 But it's always been fairly contained. And this one, she looks out the window.

191
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,500
 And the world is black.

192
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,500
 Now, not an unending black void where she can't see anything,

193
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,500
 but all the street lights are off, all the house lights are off,

194
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:48,500
 no moonlight, just a black--

195
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:53,500
 like a silhouette of houses, a silhouette of trees in the distance,

196
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:58,500
 a silhouette of power lines, against the black background.

197
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:05,500
 The world still existed, but it was the void of light.

198
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,500
 She goes back to lay back down.

199
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:13,500
 She lays down in her bed and she's laying there on her side and she looks

200
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,500
 and standing on the side of her bed--

201
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:23,500
 I don't even know if I should say standing, floating on the side of her bed

202
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:32,500
 were two large yellow-green eyeballs staring at her.

203
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,500
 And she said-- she couldn't believe what she was seeing.

204
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,500
 She's like the impossible black void that stretches on till the end of time.

205
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
 Poor thing, but eyeballs, I can't believe this.

206
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,500
 So she shut her eyes. She's like, "That must be dreaming," right?

207
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:51,500
 She reopens them and now there's two sets of eyeballs staring at her from the darkness.

208
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:56,500
 And she still can't believe what she's seeing and what she does is she kind of waves her hands in front of the eyeballs

209
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:02,500
 and they both disappear. Both sets of eyeballs disappear.

210
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:14,500
 So that story came from apparently a newspaper in Sochi called "Chernomuscarvie Dravitsia."

211
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,500
 And I don't know-- I don't know what type of newspaper that is.

212
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,500
 It is interesting that apparently that appeared in the newspaper.

213
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,500
 I got it from ThinkAboutItDocs.com.

214
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,500
 A lot of these stories we see appear in UFO journals and things like this,

215
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,500
 but this one says it was a newspaper in Sochi.

216
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,500
 So I could have been a UFO newspaper. You know, I don't know.

217
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,500
 But I guess that's my job. This story was in the maybe folder, okay?

218
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,500
 I'm sorry, usually I can track it down a little bit more.

219
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,500
 But yeah, it is my job to vet my sources.

220
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:48,500
 But it is an interesting story and I've gotten a lot of feedback from you guys about the dark bed story.

221
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:53,500
 Nick on YouTube, again, was like, "Hey, you did cover this another time.

222
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:58,500
 You covered it on an episode 398 about a Puerto Rican dude who got abducted by aliens."

223
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,500
 And I remember this episode. This was a really cool one.

224
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,500
 And he's in a room. It's not a black void, but it's a gray void.

225
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,500
 It was just-- there was no light.

226
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:11,500
 I don't remember if it was gray. It was just one color singular light source going on forever.

227
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,500
 So even though it's not a sinister as the black room, the black void,

228
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:20,500
 these things do pop up in the lore.

229
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,500
 And we're seeing a pattern here. I think when I first covered the black box story,

230
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,500
 the black bedroom story, I was thinking it was demonic.

231
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,500
 I think we talked about that. I thought that it was hell dimension or something like that.

232
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,500
 But we're seeing this mostly appear, like this story, the Sochi story,

233
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:39,500
 with the eyes appearing in the ending, it definitely lends it towards an alien interaction.

234
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,500
 Because they're three feet tall. Did I say that part? Did I say that the eyes are only--

235
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,500
 I don't know if I said that part. I'm sick. I've been trying to hold it in.

236
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,500
 The people listening to the Patreon live episode on Patreon, they've been hearing me say,

237
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,500
 "Complete about how sick I am this whole recording. I can't hide it from you guys."

238
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:01,500
 If you're not listening to it live, I'm not-- I'm just-- my tummy's doing backflips and stuff.

239
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,500
 But anyways, so I'm a little off my game, but I gotta get my episodes out, right?

240
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,500
 And I enjoy doing this. I do enjoy doing this.

241
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,500
 But again, you're like, "Jason, go to sleep, man. Make the episode a little bit late."

242
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,500
 Okay, so we got that story. We got that story, the black bedrooms.

243
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,500
 And we may end up covering more of them. I don't want to just keep doing them over and over again

244
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,500
 if they're kind of the same. But this one, I thought we had some really good information

245
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,500
 from other sources, and I wanted to talk about that stuff as well.

246
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:32,500
 I don't think we're gonna have time for the famous science fiction author story,

247
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,500
 but it is a good one. I don't want to give it away. It is so gross. It is so gross.

248
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:44,500
 And I think it'll shock you. It shocked me, but with that teaser, we'll save that one for tomorrow,

249
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,500
 because I don't have a lot of time to do it, and it takes a little more dig into,

250
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,500
 because it's a true crime story, and you can't gloss over a lot of elements on that one.

251
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:59,500
 So, live nihilism. Take this carbonar copter up, up and away. We are headed all the way out to Chile.

252
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,500
 [imitates caroling]

253
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,500
 You're like, "Jason, if you edited out all that stupid Spider-Man stuff,

254
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,500
 you'd probably have enough time for three stories." Maybe I would, but...

255
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:17,500
 I do think it's a good lesson. Do your work. Do your creative work, even if there's more comfortable stuff to do.

256
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:24,500
 The reason why we're headed to Chile. This is an interesting story, because I kind of explained it in the intro.

257
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:29,500
 It's fairly short, but there's just a lot of ways to dig into this.

258
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:35,500
 We're flying around this battlefield. It's the year 1540 in Chile.

259
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:45,500
 I'm fascinated by the conquistadors. I've been wanting to do an episode on that event for...

260
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,500
 It really since the beginning of the show. That's one of the stories I've never covered.

261
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,500
 Maybe I started thinking about like third season. I really wanted to do a story about it.

262
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:58,500
 But it's just too complicated. It's too complicated to talk about people walking around in black bedrooms.

263
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,500
 Which I find fascinating. Don't get me wrong. Everything I cover, I don't cover stuff on the show.

264
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,500
 I don't find fascinating. I'm fascinated by that idea.

265
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:14,500
 Because what we see in the conquistadors coming to the New World is an alien invader attacking Earth.

266
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:22,500
 I think that is why we have these stories about alien invaders coming to Earth.

267
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,500
 But I think the idea of the conquistadors coming to the New World...

268
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:33,500
 We're the New World. The Aztecs and the Mayans and the natives of the Northern America, the Blackfoot and the Pachina, all that stuff.

269
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:40,500
 They're the human race. Just chilling on planet Earth in the middle of nowhere.

270
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,500
 They may be thinking there's probably something out there. There's probably something across the waters.

271
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:52,500
 But we don't know what it is. And then one day this technologically advanced foe had things like horses and wheels.

272
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:59,500
 We didn't know what those were. The Aztecs, the only time they saw the horses, they were walking very gently.

273
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:10,500
 They were walking very gently along paths. And the Aztec soldiers were like, "Those things are weird. But what use are they? They walk very gingerly."

274
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:18,500
 So the very first time that I was reading the story, the very first Calvary Charge in the New World.

275
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:23,500
 Where you had 100 horses galloping across the battlefield.

276
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,500
 That was when the Aztec warriors go, "Uh-oh."

277
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:36,500
 They had no idea that was possible. They had never seen a Calvary Charge before. They had never seen mounted troops collide into...

278
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:41,500
 It was that time. And that's what it would be like with an alien invasion.

279
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,500
 Stuff we can't even imagine. We can imagine laser guns and space ships.

280
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:51,500
 All that stuff. Because that's earthly concepts.

281
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:58,500
 But the Aztecs could imagine, "Oh, they'll probably have these guns of thunder. They're shooting out these metal things and da-da-da-da."

282
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:04,500
 It's just a spear. It's just a spear without the stick. All a bullet is is a flying knife.

283
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,500
 It's a little piece of metal that puts a hole in you.

284
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:14,500
 I could do it with a sword, about a foot away. Or I could do it with a bullet from about, you know, 500 feet away.

285
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,500
 It's the same thing. But the horse was a complete game changer.

286
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,500
 And I find that story so fascinating. So...

287
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:29,500
 That whole expan- and I think that may play into why we have these alien invasion movies, because a good chunk of the-

288
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,500
 I think every culture in the world has been invaded at one point or another.

289
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:38,500
 Invaded by technologically superior foe. And I think that's part of our cultural memory.

290
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:44,500
 There's no better view of that than the Europeans coming to the New World. Because it was...

291
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:49,500
 That's what it'll be like when aliens come here. And it was- I mean, check your history books.

292
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,500
 It did not work out well for the natives. And a lot of people have said that before.

293
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,500
 So when we look at this story here in 1540 Chile, I know that was a long rant.

294
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,500
 They're probably again gonna have done the sci-fi author story.

295
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:05,500
 But, I find this whole period of human history fascinating. I find all of it fascinating.

296
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:11,500
 1540 Chile. It's a Saturday afternoon, according to this report.

297
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,500
 And there's the local tribe of the Mapuche.

298
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:21,500
 Is ready to lay siege. They're gonna take out this Spanish outpost that's been built on their territory.

299
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:27,500
 So the troops have assembled, and they're overlooking this outpost. And the Spaniards are like, "Ah, this is gonna suck!"

300
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:32,500
 Because we are an outpost! We're out of the normal range of all of our supply troops.

301
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,500
 We're here to like, wave to ships and like, send out scouts and deliver messages.

302
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:41,500
 We're not here... I mean, we are kind of built to be able to fight off an enemy force.

303
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,500
 But we don't want to do that, right? You don't want to do that.

304
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:51,500
 So when the soldiers appeared, when the Mapuche tribesmen appeared to lay siege to this outpost,

305
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,500
 everyone is- their tensions run high, obviously. Tensions run high.

306
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,500
 And then all of a sudden, from the blue sky...

307
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,500
 [Mapuche noises]

308
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,500
 A comet comes hurtling towards Earth.

309
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:11,500
 And it lands right by the Mapuche troops. "Oh, step back! Step back!"

310
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:16,500
 Pfft! Dirt's getting in everyone's eye. They're like, "Oh, why did I volunteer to stand in front?"

311
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,500
 "Ah, I got dirt in my eye!"

312
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,500
 And the Spanish troops are actually watching this as well.

313
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,500
 They see this comet come down and hit in front of the tribesmen, and they're like, "What?"

314
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,500
 Now, a comet crashing into Earth, or meteorite crashing into Earth, fairly common, right?

315
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,500
 It's landing in front of when someone's watching it.

316
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:37,500
 Very, very uncommon. Extremely rare.

317
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,500
 Most of the meteorites that fall just either burn up or they land on the ocean.

318
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,500
 So the fact that you have people watching this...

319
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,500
 That in and of itself is a bizarre event.

320
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:52,500
 But it's a mathematical- it's a mathematical event. It's probable, but not likely.

321
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,500
 It's possible, but not probable, is what I meant to say.

322
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,500
 But now this isn't probable at all. This just becomes completely weird.

323
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:07,500
 Out of the wreckage of the comet, appears a beautiful woman dressed in all white.

324
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:15,500
 Now, in the intro I described her as the Virgin Mary, they don't specify that that's who this is.

325
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:20,500
 It could just be a random woman, dressed in all white.

326
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:25,500
 But from her next statement, I'm thinking... Mother Mary.

327
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:31,500
 Mother Mary, maybe, or maybe an emissary, because what this feminine figure says, quote,

328
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,500
 "I serve the Christians."

329
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:40,500
 Don't go against them because they are very brave, and will kill you all.

330
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:48,500
 And according to this story, the tribe- the tribesmen didn't believe that.

331
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:53,500
 They didn't believe that story. They were like, "What? I remember the last time someone came down on a comet,

332
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,500
 and warned me, and it turned out not to be true. They told me not to buy Bitcoin, and I lost tons of money.

333
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:04,500
 So move out of the way, lady." And they laid siege to the outpost, and they were defeated.

334
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:11,500
 I got this story from ThinkAboutItDocs.com. They got it from a book called "Return to Magonia" by Chris Aubeck.

335
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,500
 Chris Aubeck, apparently, is an up-and-coming- I've been seeing him pop up a lot recently.

336
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:23,500
 He's an up-and-coming- I mean, he's been around for a while, but "Return to Magonia" is kind of a play on Jacques Valet's book.

337
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,500
 Journey to Magonia, I think it is. And so it's just kind of an exploration of the world of the weird.

338
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,500
 I've been seeing Chris Aubeck's name pop up a lot more recently, so that's interesting.

339
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:37,500
 It's always cool when we have new people exploring the stuff, especially when they're exploring stuff we haven't heard before.

340
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,500
 Now, I have never heard this story before.

341
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:44,500
 I like this story because it talks to us about omens.

342
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,500
 It talks to us about warnings.

343
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:54,500
 Now get your seatbelts on, because we're about to do a 180-degree turn from where we're at to finish this episode up.

344
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:59,500
 I saw a warning the other day. It's not, it wasn't magical, it wasn't paranormal.

345
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:05,500
 But I was reading a news article the other day, and I felt like I was one of the last people in Invasion of the Body Snatchers.

346
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,500
 I honestly couldn't believe I was reading this article.

347
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:13,500
 And it gave me a vision of the future of America that is shi-

348
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,500
 I- I- I- I-

349
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,500
 Okay, so let me tell you about this.

350
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:25,500
 I- a long time listeners of the show know I have this weird habit of reading people's misery online.

351
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:30,500
 That's how I go to sleep. I read stuff online of people going through really bad events.

352
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:35,500
 Now, nothing like too horrible, right? I don't read about, like, people who've lost loved ones in car accidents, and stuff like that.

353
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:40,500
 I read about, like, drug addicts, people being like, "Why can't I stop doing this drug?"

354
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,500
 Like, if I'm scrolling through Reddit and people are like, "Oh, man, heroin's so cheap in my city."

355
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:49,500
 I'm like, "Ah, pass." And then I get to one that's, like, lowest point in my life last night, and I'm all, "Read."

356
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,500
 I'm gonna read this one, I'm gonna read this one before I go to bed.

357
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,500
 So I read that, I found the new subreddit the other day called Friend Zone.

358
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:01,500
 And that's brutal. It's just people going, "I'm in love with my best friend."

359
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,500
 And... [laughs]

360
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:12,500
 There was one, there was one I read, and this guy was like, "I'm in love with my coworker, but she doesn't know I'm in love with her.

361
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:18,500
 I'm in the Friend Zone, and... but we live near each other, so I started picking her up, she doesn't have a car.

362
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,500
 And I was taking her to work. I was taking her to work every day.

363
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,500
 'Cause I'm a friend, and that's what friends do.

364
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:35,500
 And then she started dating someone who also lived near them and worked at the same building, and he didn't have a car either.

365
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:40,500
 So this dude is picking up his crush.

366
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,500
 He's law, he has to drive his crush and her boyfriend to work.

367
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:49,500
 And she's sitting in the backseat with her boyfriend, and he's watching them in the rear-view mirror.

368
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:55,500
 It sounds like cuck-porn, but it's not, apparently.

369
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:00,500
 And, oh man, it's just soul-crushing. Everyone's been in the Friend Zone, I've been in the Friend Zone. It does suck.

370
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,500
 It totally does suck. But you just gotta move on.

371
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:07,500
 But yeah. Oh! That's brutal to read.

372
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:13,500
 But one of the things I've actually thought about doing it on episodes before, I've never really talked about it before,

373
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:18,500
 but one of the subreddits that I go to is gambling anonymous subreddits.

374
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:29,500
 And the people who suffer from gambling addiction, I would rather be addicted -- 100% would rather be addicted to a drug than gambling.

375
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:34,500
 100%. I'd rather be addicted to cocaine or meth or fentanyl or something like that than gambling.

376
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:39,500
 Because at least if I'm addicted to a drug, I'm gonna start having drug-addicted behavior.

377
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:43,500
 People are gonna see -- let's take meth, for example. People are gonna see rapid weight loss.

378
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,500
 People are gonna see me be able to fight 10 cops at the same time. He's got so much energy.

379
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,500
 People are gonna see me start to pick up my face and my dental and all that stuff.

380
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,500
 I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but it happens.

381
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,500
 And people will start to intervene. First people will ignore it, but eventually they're gonna intervene.

382
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,500
 And hopefully before it gets too late, right?

383
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,500
 But then I start stealing from people and law enforcement gets involved. And there's this slide.

384
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:08,500
 And we know it's a slide. We've seen it enacted over and over and over again through the course of, like, I'd say --

385
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,500
 we're all aware of it.

386
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:18,500
 Gambling addiction's not like that. What happens is you have a gambling addiction and nobody will be aware of it until you lose your house.

387
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:25,500
 Like, you will be the exact same. You will look the same. You'll go to work. You'll go home with your family.

388
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:34,500
 But you will lose $10,000 a day. People lose more money on that subreddit than I've ever had in my life.

389
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:41,500
 And these are people who are really struggling with gambling addiction. I never really -- it's so weird because I've gambled before,

390
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:48,500
 but I've never thought of, like, being addicted to it, but these people go -- the way, like, you'll see people on a drug subreddit say,

391
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:53,500
 "I wish I had never, ever gotten that first prescription of OxyContin when I had the knee surgery,"

392
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:58,500
 because now I'm addicted to heroin. Now I'm addicted to heroin and I'm afraid of having an overdose, but I can't do it.

393
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:05,500
 You'll see people talk about that. This one guy goes, "My mom took me on my 18th birthday to a casino and I wish that she had never done that.

394
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:10,500
 I've been addicted to gambling since." And I'm like, "That's interesting." I mean, I understand why it would be addictive.

395
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,500
 The highs and the lows and the flashing lights and all those things. That's fascinating.

396
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:19,500
 But I'm pretty -- I've been looking into the world of gambling addiction for quite a while now.

397
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:24,500
 I've been thinking about doing a segment on it and just never worked out, but it's something that I've been keenly aware of

398
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:29,500
 and how it's such a hidden epidemic and how it destroys families and people.

399
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:35,500
 And there are things online like casino workers. What's the worst story you can tell about working at a casino?

400
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:41,500
 And I've never been able to even read them all, because there are so many. And there are so many suicides --

401
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:48,500
 so many suicides at the casinos. Because these people have gambled away all of their money.

402
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:54,500
 They've gambled away their house. They've gambled away their cars. Kids showing up at the casino crying,

403
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:59,500
 trying to get their mom away from the machine. This fascinating, tragic stuff.

404
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:07,500
 But yesterday a comet came from the sky and showed me the end of America.

405
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,500
 I really believe that gambling is a huge, hidden problem.

406
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:19,500
 But it's always been regulated to Nevada, Atlantic City, and then illegal sports betting here and there.

407
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,500
 But back in 2018 -- this totally flew under the radar. I didn't find out about this the day after the day.

408
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,500
 I had to keep checking the headlines of these articles. I go, "This can't be recent."

409
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:31,500
 Back in 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that sports gambling would be okay.

410
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,500
 It could be okay across the United States. It's up to the states to legalize it.

411
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:42,500
 And since then, the sports gambling industry has boomed. In June 2018, before sports gambling was legalized,

412
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:50,500
 June 2018, sports gamblers wagered $310 million for the month of June 2018.

413
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:58,500
 By October 2021, in one month, they wagered $7 billion.

414
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,500
 And what's making this worse is that you can do it on your mobile phone.

415
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,500
 The laws are now -- and every day, more states are trying to legalize this --

416
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:10,500
 you can now sit on your phone and place wagers all day long.

417
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:15,500
 Bet $100 here on the Lakers, but $100 here on the Buckeyes. Is that a team?

418
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,500
 Bet $100 here.

419
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:28,500
 This is -- this is -- I don't want to sound like an alarmist, but this is the beginning of the end of the social structure of America.

420
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:33,500
 You are going -- you're like, "Jason, it's not a big deal. You're being a conspiracy theorist."

421
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:38,500
 You are going to have landlords lose their houses to gambling.

422
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:45,500
 You are going to have businesses go under because some dude who never ever thought about stepping into a casino

423
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:50,500
 is seeing these mobile ads where he can earn real cash, win real cash.

424
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:56,500
 Think about how much money people spend on clash of clans and Farmville and all these mobile games,

425
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,500
 these three-match games, they're already spending money.

426
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:05,500
 Now they can win money. They can win real money sports gambling on their phone.

427
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,500
 People are going to go bankrupt within a year.

428
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:13,500
 This will be an equivalent of us going into prohibition.

429
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:22,500
 We will look back on this time period the same way we looked back on when Vicodin and Oxycontin was able to be prescribed by doctors for the first time.

430
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:27,500
 This is going to be a moment. This year is going to be a moment where 20 years people look back and go,

431
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:33,500
 "This is when things changed. This is when the economy really fell apart, not because of inflation,

432
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:40,500
 not because of supply chains, but because you had people spending their time at work gambling away their paychecks

433
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:45,500
 while the business owners are gambling away the business."

434
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:50,500
 Mobile gambling? Are you kidding me? Are you absolutely kidding me?

435
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:55,500
 I was shocked. I felt like I was in a sci-fi movie as I was reading those articles.

436
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,500
 This is the beginning of the end. This is the comet.

437
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:03,500
 This is something that people, rational thinking people should look at and go, "That's not right."

438
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,500
 But I think most people don't know about gambling addiction.

439
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,500
 I think most people go, "Ah, I lost $500, so I'm not going to do that again."

440
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:15,500
 That's what a rational person does. That's what a non-addicted person does.

441
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:19,500
 But we're going to expose these people who say, "I wish I had never gone into a casino."

442
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:26,500
 We're going to expose millions of people to the power, the magic of gambling.

443
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:32,500
 Tied in with the addictive nature of mobile games?

444
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:38,500
 And tied in with the ego that I can figure out the sports scores.

445
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:44,500
 Sports are rigged for the most-- I don't even want to get into that.

446
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,500
 But if sports gambling is a billion-dollar business, there are referees paid off.

447
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,500
 The whole game is predetermined. But there are people paid off.

448
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,500
 There is no one worth their salt who's going to take a bet.

449
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:59,500
 No casino is going to take a bet that they don't think they have a high chance of winning.

450
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:04,500
 This is the comet. This is the moment where something comes down and it says,

451
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:09,500
 "Don't do this because you're all going to be killed."

452
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:15,500
 But we ignored the comet. All these states, there's like 25 states now where this is legal

453
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:20,500
 and more states are looking to make it legal to gamble real money on your phone.

454
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:24,500
 It is absolutely insane.

455
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:29,500
 So maybe we don't need an alien invasion to come down and wipe out the world.

456
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:33,500
 We might just end up doing it ourselves.

00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,500
