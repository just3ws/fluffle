1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 A tragic, true crime case gets even worse.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 You can believe that?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 I guess you can, because you don't know what it is yet.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Maybe you do.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 You're like, "I expected that."

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 And then we traveled back in time to Latvia.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 But it wasn't called Latvia.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 It was called Livonia.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 That's how far we're going back in time.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 To meet a man who was a simple witness during a criminal trial.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 But when he's brought before the judges, he has an astonishing revelation.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 He's just not a witness.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 He's actually also a werewolf who fights Satan today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 I hope you guys had a good week off.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 I didn't really get a whole week off because I was doing the Dead Rabbit Radio classics.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 I think what we're going to do is in the future, the classics seem to really work.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 We're going to do those, but I'm going to do them throughout the season.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 And then when the break comes, I can just take the whole week off and just upload them.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 But because I didn't get my full break, there's a chance that here and there I'm going to sneak in a day off.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 I'm not going to do it. I'm not just going to use an excuse to only do four episodes a week.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 But maybe coming up, I'll end up taking a three-day week.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 And I really need to have that week off from the show.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 And I was spending time debating what episodes to put up for Dead Rabbit Radio classics and all that.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 And I'm sure you notice I only put up four because by the time it came to the fifth one,

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 I was like, I really just need to take a break.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 So let's go ahead and move on to our first story.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 And our first story is one that I covered recently, maybe two or three weeks ago.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 And I'm going to do an overview because not everyone listens to every episode.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 And it's been a while since I've talked about this.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 We're going to Kempton, Pennsylvania.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Now this started in September 23rd, 2019.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 So this happened this year.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Once I start talking about it, you're going to be like, "Damn it, Jason. Really? This story again?"

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 But there's been an arrest.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 So the story is basically over at this point.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 But you're like, "I don't want to hear this story again."

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 You can go ahead and fast forward.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 And I'm like, "Where, Wolf?"

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 "Where, Wolf?" is just driving us to Kemptown.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 But it's an important story for closure, for closure.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 And it's also quite disgusting and horrible.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 So Lisa Snyder, well, yeah, it's that story.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Lisa Snyder was a mom.

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 She had two kids, eight-year-old Connor Snyder and four-year-old Brinley Snyder.

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Now, apparently she has three kids.

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 She also had a 17-year-old son, which we weren't aware of outside of the investigation.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 So we're all now at the scene of the crime.

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 I don't know why I'm doing this narrative device.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 I don't want to be here.

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 We're at a donut shop, and we're sitting there, and we're discussing this over with a couple police officers.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 And we go, "So, we heard that there were some developments in this case."

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 And the detective's like, "Yeah, yeah, man. This was a gnarly case. Let me go back over it. Let me..."

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Now that we've re-framed the narrative device, we're no longer standing outside the crime scene.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 The detective's going to tell us about this.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 What happened was, authorities get a 911 call.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 My kids are hanging in the basement. Both of them.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Two kids both hanging at the same time.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Ambulances get down there.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 They find eight-year-old Connor and four-year-old Brinley dead, basically.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Like, they were declared dead at the hospital just minutes after each other.

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 But, I mean, for all intents and purposes, they were dead there.

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 I guess, scientifically, they were still alive.

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 My point is that they were hung to death.

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 This is a great way to start off the new season.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 So, the attic had a beam crossing the ceiling.

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 And there was a long dog leash wrapped around the beam.

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 And when the cops came down there, there was two chairs.

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 And it looked like they were... No, this is what it looked like. This was actually what happened.

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 They had nooses tied around the dog leash, and both chairs were kicked on the ground.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 And you had these two children hanging.

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Absolutely tragic story.

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Now, the cops are, like, taking notes, and they're, like, taking measurements,

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 and they're, like, "Oh, man, this is a terrible crime."

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 We got to talk to the mom.

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 "Hey, mom, what?" And they turned, and the mom's, like, not in the basement.

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Now, to be fair, that is where her kids just died.

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 But the cops still thought it was a little weird.

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Like, generally, the people are like,

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 "What happened to my babies? What happened to my babies?"

83
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 And annoying the police officers, right?

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 For clues, for answers.

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 But the mom seemed kind of distant during this whole process.

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 "Ah, that's kind of weird."

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Like, the only reason you wouldn't want clues is if you knew the answer to it.

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 That's the reason why adults don't watch Blue's Clues,

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 because we already know where Blue is.

90
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 So...

91
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Anyways, I got a light in this somehow.

92
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 They're taking these notes. She's not around.

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 But they did find Blue, so, you know, that helped.

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 They were very friendly, and then they had to find Blue.

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 He was in the same spot the next day.

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Okay, whatever.

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 The point is, is that they're suspecting the mom at this point.

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 Now, that is pretty much all the information we knew for months.

99
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 When I first covered the story, that was basically it.

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Two kids found hanging.

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Oh, and the mom said, "This is what happened."

102
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Her son was getting bullied all the time.

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Super depressed, getting picked on all the time.

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 And he told her, "I want to kill myself, but I don't want to go alone."

105
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 So, the mom thought that Connor tied a noose around the daughter's neck.

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 Not his daughter, his sister.

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 And then a noose around his neck, and then they both jumped off the chairs.

108
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 That was her working theory.

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 And she had actually told her friends that.

110
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 She told her friends before all this that Connor was getting bullied.

111
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 And he had made suggestions about this.

112
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 We also knew that CPS was involved in some way.

113
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 So, that was all the information we knew.

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 The cops were looking for their main clues.

115
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 They were looking for, well, one, if anyone saw anything, that would be a big clue.

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Two, they wanted to find the family dog, because they said,

117
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 "We believe the dog would be essential in solving this mystery."

118
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 And the mom was like, "Oh, I got rid of the dog."

119
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 So, the cop is done drinking his coffee.

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 So, we go, so, now we're back into the coffee shop.

121
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 We're sitting there, and we go, "So, you have a suspect?"

122
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 And he's like, "Oh, yeah, we got a suspect."

123
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 We got the suspect that everyone kind of thought it was in the beginning.

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 And we're like, "Is it Connor?"

125
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 And they're like, "No, no, that scenario was stupid."

126
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Because what happened was, when the police began investigating this,

127
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 they began going to Connor's school, and Connor, and he was an eight-year-old kid.

128
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 So, what would that be?

129
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 And what, like, third grade?

130
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 They're going to a school, they're talking to his classmates,

131
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 they're talking to Lisa's friends, the mother's friends.

132
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 "None of them!" said Connor was being bullied.

133
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 None of them.

134
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Connor's friends are like, "No, he, no, he, I never saw him get bullied."

135
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Like, he was a big kid, he was kind of overweight, but they're like,

136
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 "No, I never saw him get bullied."

137
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Schools like had never been reported to us that he was being bullied.

138
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 There, the 17-year-old son, who also lived in this house, was like,

139
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 "Mmm-mm."

140
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 No, and he hadn't told me that he was being bullied.

141
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 I had never heard that before.

142
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 When they were talking to Lisa, they said, "So, what happened? Why were the kids in the basement?"

143
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 And they go, "Well, Connor really loves to build forts."

144
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 And they're like, "Check that, check that, Bob, make sure he likes to build forts."

145
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 And it turns out that he does like to build forts, Connor did like to build forts, unfortunately.

146
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 And they want to, he came home from school that day, and he goes,

147
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 "I want to build a fort in the basement."

148
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 And she's like, "Oh, okay."

149
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 And then she helped bring the chairs downstairs as part of the fort. Lisa did.

150
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 And Bob's like, "Okay, taking notes."

151
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 They asked the 17-year-old son, "Hey, so, um, they, we heard that he wanted to build forts in the basement."

152
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 And the 17-year-old's like, "What? Nah, he never played in the basement."

153
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Like, it's weird that he was down there in the first place.

154
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Like, he built forts, that's true.

155
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 But not in the basement. He always built in the living room, which to be fair, the,

156
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 don't do anything in a basement. I don't even know why basements exist.

157
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Basements exist so Dorothy can outrun hurricanes or tornadoes, whatever it is.

158
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Like, really, what is the purpose of a basement?

159
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 You're like, "Jayson, are you really going to go on this rant right now?"

160
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 Yes! What's the point of a basement?

161
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 It's to keep your vegetables cold, right?

162
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Like, you throw a bunch of like, uh, potatoes down there, and then they don't spoil,

163
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 because it's cold, and you store your tools down there.

164
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 The only reason why people have basements, really, is because houses are built with basements.

165
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 But new houses are new houses built with basements?

166
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Like, I know old houses have basements, right?

167
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Because they had needed places, but they're potatoes!

168
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 But if you bought a brand new house, would they have a basement in it?

169
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 I don't think so. And if they do, I think it's a gimmick.

170
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 I think it's a conspiracy from the construction companies that want to use their big digger machines.

171
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 They're like, "Listen, buddy, you don't want, you want to have a basement, right?

172
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 You want to have a house. We got to spend an extra $10,000 to bring this big old yellow...

173
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 ...burrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

174
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 ...and those brambles." But the radios weren't working that day,

175
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 so all they heard was the helicopter guy go, "I don't know where he's at."

176
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 So a police officer says, "Can I borrow your bulldozer to like, some random dude who's hanging out in the forest?"

177
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 And I think it was on the edge of the forest.

178
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 This bulldozer wasn't in the middle of like, the Hundred Acre Woods.

179
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 It was like, on, it was like, there was a field and then a bunch of other stuff.

180
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 The cops like, "Hey, bro, can I borrow your bulldozer to hunt this guy down?"

181
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 The goal was, I'm going to just go through all of this bramble, all of these bushes and knock him over,

182
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 and then the dude will jump up and run away.

183
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 You're like, "Jason, can you only tell one true crime story at a time?"

184
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 So anyways, the helicopter at this point is like, "Okay, I see him. He's in the bramble.

185
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 Wait a second. No, guys, no, no, no, no, no."

186
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 And he's, the helicopter pilot's watching this bulldozer go through the stuff right towards him.

187
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 He sees a suspect hiding in the bushes.

188
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 This bulldozer's just like, "Ahhhhhhhhh."

189
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 [Burps]

190
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 [Burps]

191
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 The helicopter pilot's like, "Oh my God, I just watched the guy get squished."

192
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 So there's a huge trial right here. He's dead, obviously. They don't only just squish his ankle.

193
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 He's like, "Ah, he killed him."

194
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 He was stuck in the bushes. Bulldozer ran him over.

195
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Huge trial going on.

196
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 The helicopter pilot goes to try to warn him.

197
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 I saw it, saw from where I was at, and the radios weren't working.

198
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 And the cops are saying that the dude saw the bulldozer coming

199
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 and then jumped about the bushes, ran behind the bulldozer to hide behind a moving bulldozer,

200
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 and then the bulldozer turned and squished him.

201
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 So it was his fault for getting squished by a bulldozer.

202
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 And they're also saying he shouldn't have run from the cops in the first place.

203
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 That's another legal battle that's going on.

204
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 But anyways, basements are only there so people can use their fancy, dancy construction machines.

205
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 And in this case, Connor didn't want to go in the basement.

206
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 The story's going on too long. The point is, let me get to this.

207
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 She's arrested for murder. They are able to say that she's arrested for murder

208
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 because her story doesn't make sense.

209
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 She brought the chairs down. They don't believe that Connor was getting bullied.

210
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Nobody else was saying that but her.

211
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 And she bought that 20-foot dog leash the day before the crime.

212
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 She looked on Google. You're like, Jason, you could have told us this stuff made this a five-minute story.

213
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 They found these things on Google, these Google searches.

214
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Carbon monoxide in a car, how long to die?

215
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Dude, you know what? Google searches are going to trip you up more than anything, really.

216
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 You're leaving this forensic evidence trail. Here's some other ones.

217
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Does a hybrid car produce carbon monoxide while idling?

218
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 That's a good question. But she just wasn't like it. That was an environmental thing for her.

219
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 She apparently owns a hybrid and was trying to murder people.

220
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Then she was googling, "I almost got away with it. Best episodes."

221
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Which is some show. Why would you want to watch a show about people who got caught?

222
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 If you're trying to plan a murder, you're like, "I want to know how people almost get away with it.

223
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 I don't want to know about people who never got caught."

224
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 And then she started looking at a suicide website called Lost All Hope about how to sufficiently kill yourself

225
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 using a short drop. So, hanging. How to hang people.

226
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 And what does any of this have to do with the dog that they've been looking for, this dog that's a material witness?

227
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 She was banging the family dog. She was having sex.

228
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 One of the charges was bestiality, or sex with an animal. I don't know bestiality is like a legal term, but...

229
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 And then cruelty to animals, because she was banging the family dog.

230
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Just to make everything even worse, at this point where we've put our donuts down,

231
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 there were no longer eating donuts on the cop's drink and his coffee's like, "Yeah, it's pretty disgusting."

232
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 So she's been charged with first degree murder, third degree murder.

233
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 This just happened. She was just charged on December 3rd, and having sex with a dog.

234
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 So I think that's why they wanted the dog. I think they had probably come across that pretty early in their investigation

235
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 and they wanted to check the dog out. I guess? I don't know.

236
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 I thought it was because they wanted to see if their dog would require a 20 pound leash. How big was the dog?

237
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 But I think in the beginning they may have wanted that dog early on to check it out. I don't know. That's gross.

238
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 So banging a dog and she murdered two children. She murdered her own two children.

239
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 And she almost got away with it. She didn't. What was that? Two or three months?

240
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 And apparently the whole CPS thing, we still don't know what that was about.

241
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 The chill, this is probably the worst detail of the whole story.

242
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 The kids were removed from her care in 2014 and then they were given back to her in 2015.

243
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 They're like, "Ah, you're probably not that bad of a mother." Here you go.

244
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 I think she kills her kids a couple years later.

245
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Great way to start the season, Jason. Yeah, I know. I probably, I didn't think that segment would go on as long as it did,

246
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 but it's recorded. Let's go. That's the excuse. I think that story's interesting and I wanted to wrap it up.

247
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 I have no regrets. No regrets for that story. I have regrets that had happened,

248
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 but I don't have regrets that I told it. It's a good follow-up and a good ending and a good segue, honestly.

249
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Because now we're going to Latvia. You're not going to make any dog sex jokes. I'm not, actually.

250
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 We're going to Latvia. Now, back in time, and I'm going to say this to you, this might have been a recommendation.

251
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 So if you did recommend this story, hit me up, tell me how you got it to me and I'll make a correction.

252
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 But we're going, that all being said, we're leaving behind Captain Pennsylvania.

253
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 We are going to modern-day Latvia. It used to be called Livonia, because you lived there.

254
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Makes sense, right? What are you doing in Russia? You rush. What are you doing in Germany?

255
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 You're a German. That's not racist. That's not racist. What are you doing in Bulgaria? You burgle.

256
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 I'm sure there's a lot of thieves over there. And what do you do in America? You just Emma. You just exist.

257
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 And you're great. But anyways, so Livonia. Two quick things about Livonia.

258
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 There's really only two things I know about Livonia. One, that it sounds like a country that Dr. Doom would rule.

259
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 Or any dictator from any fictional universe. Two, they had this bomb group.

260
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Now I'm going to say this now. These guys may have turned out to be super brutal killers.

261
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 So don't hit me up with a bunch of articles showing how insensitive I am to Livonian history.

262
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 But you can, but I just won't be concerned about it. There's a group, or was a group, or maybe they're still around.

263
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 I guess the country doesn't exist anymore. So they're probably not. Livonian brothers of the sword.

264
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Sling, sling, sling. Hitting swords around, chasing people.

265
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 They were German. Tell me this isn't an awesome combination of words.

266
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 German, you're just called Germans, germs. German warrior monks. That's pretty dope, dude.

267
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 That's a D&D class. That's like a real life thing.

268
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 They sat around all day, they prayed, all night, they fight. Dude, I just came up with that.

269
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 I'm surprised nobody's come up with that before. All day, they pray, all night.

270
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 I guess no one's ever thought about warrior monks that much before.

271
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 Anyways, they also went by the term. These are other teams, other names, not other teams.

272
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 These are other names for their group. The militia of Christ of Livonia. It's okay.

273
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Christ Knights. That is a dope name for a band. Christ Knights. Pretty dope.

274
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 I like this one better. Sword Brethren. Where the sword bros, but sword brethren.

275
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Anyways, not gonna get distracted anymore for the rest of the episode.

276
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 The other thing I know about Livonia is this story. The year is 1692.

277
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 We are in Juergensberg, Livonia.

278
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Stained glass window. I don't know if it's stained glass window. It was a church gets robbed.

279
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Pssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

280
00:17:45,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Pssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss

281
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 They go, "Is there any suspects?" They always ask that. Are there any witnesses? Did anyone see the church get robbed?

282
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 This 80 year old man is old octogenarian. How do you say it? Octo-negarian?

283
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Anyways, 80 year old man. Easier way. What's a 90 year old man? I know a septetrigerian is, I think, a 70 year old man.

284
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 So what's a 90 year old man? It doesn't matter. There's not a 90 year old man in this story.

285
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Dude, 80 year old man starts walking. His name is Thies. Thies. I believe. Thies.

286
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 Thies of Cantalbrun, which I'm assuming is a province. So Thies walks up and he's like, "I saw something."

287
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 They're like, "Are you a pirate?" He's like, "No, it's just an affectation."

288
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 So the judges are like, "Let's talk to you." They take him to court.

289
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 And I go, "Will you please tell us what you saw on the date of this church getting broken into?"

290
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 And he goes, "Yes, yes I will. I'll sit down. I will tell you this story."

291
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 But first, I have been to court before and they're like, "Really? That's not germane to the topic, sir.

292
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Could you just tell us about this burglary?" And he goes, "Well, let me tell you first. I'm an old man.

293
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 I'm 80 years old. You can't really tell me what to do. I've been to this trial before.

294
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 Not this particular trial. That'd be weird. But I've been to court before.

295
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 You see, 10 years ago, I actually took a man to court because he broke my nose.

296
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 And I'm like, "Oh, that's horrible. You'd have been in your 70s then."

297
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 He shouldn't walk around with a broken nose. Sad. Sad story.

298
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 He's like, "Yes, yes. And to make it even worse, this man was a witch."

299
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 The judges are like, "Oh, great. Now, this is 1692. And it's funny because this and a follow-up story I'm going to do tomorrow."

300
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 Like, I always thought back then the whole world was just basically populated with country bumpkins

301
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 that believed that if you ate a spiced pumpkin under the eighth full moon of the year,

302
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 you'd be able to have a girl, baby, or something like that.

303
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Like, you know, all this folk medicine and witches flying around, something like that.

304
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 But for the month, it's like it is today where you basically had two...

305
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 By 1692, and even in the 1500s, you started to have a divide in society.

306
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 You had the learned. You had people who were like, "Oh, this is how you have female babies.

307
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 It's just flip a coin. It's genetics."

308
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 I didn't know about genetics, but I mean, they didn't believe in magic.

309
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 You had people who... they might have been a little superstitious for the most part.

310
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 They didn't believe in magic. And then you had people like Theus or the people of town who still believed in this stuff.

311
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 So these judges, when they start hearing this old man talk about witches, they're like,

312
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 "Oh, my God, we're in one of those bumpkin towns where they still believe in all this stuff."

313
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 Now, we're religious, but we don't believe in magic and witchcraft and stuff like that.

314
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 We've heard that it exists, but that's like old-timey stuff.

315
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Whatever, dude.

316
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 So they're trying to ignore this old man. They just want to find out who robbed the church.

317
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 They want to get out of town before the sun goes down.

318
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 They really don't want to be here that long.

319
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 And the old man goes, "Listen, man, so I got my nose busted by a witch."

320
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Judges are like, "Let's just humor this dude, and let's just get to the point."

321
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 How did your nose get busted?

322
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 He goes, "Well, here's the thing. So the witch, that dude, he stole a bunch of grain and he took it to hell."

323
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Judges are like, "Okay."

324
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 Oh, seriously, seriously. This is the case we got.

325
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 My mom wanted me to be a painter, but here I am.

326
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 Okay, tell us the story.

327
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 This guy, this farmer, he was a witch.

328
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 He grabbed a bunch of grain and he took it to hell.

329
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 So I did what I did as like a citizen, as a servant of God.

330
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 I did what everyone should do.

331
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 I took the form of a wolf and followed him, and they're like, "Wait, wait, wait. Go back."

332
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 He's like, "No, no, let me finish."

333
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 I followed him into hell, and I began attacking him, and he grabbed the metal pipe and smashed my nose in.

334
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 Now, I did your honor just to be clear.

335
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 I did get the barley back, okay, and that ensured a good harvest for us.

336
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 But the dude broke my nose.

337
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 So when we returned to the earthly realm, I took him to court, as you should.

338
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 And just like, that's the end of the story.

339
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 And theus goes, "Yeah, pretty much."

340
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 They laughed me out of court, and the judges are like, "We're about to laugh you out of court now."

341
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 That makes sense.

342
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 But theus goes, "Listen, man, here's the truth.

343
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 I had a bro-- I walked into court with a broken nose, and the harvest was good that year.

344
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 What other evidence do I need that I'm actually a werewolf?"

345
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Now, the judges are getting rid of this dude.

346
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 The judges are like, "You're gone. We're trying to solve a basic B&D."

347
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 But what happened was the judges started to think about it, and they're like, "The story's weird, right?"

348
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 And there's like three of these judges.

349
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 They're all sharing a hotel room together.

350
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 One guy's laying in bed, he's like, "I just can't stop thinking about that werewolf story and the other guy got it."

351
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 And he's like, "Me too! We just want to solve this burglary, but that is the weirdest story I've heard."

352
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 That's a fairy tale story.

353
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 So the judges basically forget-- this is all true story, by the way.

354
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 This is all court documents that they found.

355
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 The judges completely forget the history.

356
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 Nobody knows who broke into the church. Nobody knows.

357
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 But they begin investigating this theist guy. They begin going around town and they're like,

358
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 "Hey, do you know anything about theists at Canthalburn?"

359
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 And the townspeople are like, "Oh, yes! The werewolf man! Yes!"

360
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 That trial was really popular in that area when it happened.

361
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 And they're like, "So what happened?"

362
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 They're like, "Oh, that's pretty accurate."

363
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 He did have a broken nose.

364
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 He goes to trial. He uses that as exhibit A, tells the werewolf story. He's laughed out of court.

365
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 But what was weird was that that case actually made him famous in town,

366
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 and not famous like a foolish guy famous like, "Oh, that guy's so dumb." Blah, blah, blah.

367
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 People began to respect him. People actually believed the story, for the most part.

368
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 They believed that something happened. They didn't all believe that he could turn into a werewolf.

369
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 But they did because that is weird. He did have that broken nose and the harvest was good.

370
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 And his reputation increased in town.

371
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 So the judges are like, "Let's bring him back in. Let's talk to him again."

372
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 So they bring him back into the trial and they say, "Tell us everything. Tell us your whole story.

373
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Tell us how you became a werewolf."

374
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 So the old man sits down. You've got a court stenographer there. She's typing on a wood carving.

375
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 She's got little buttons that's making tiny little wood carvings.

376
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 He says, "Here's what happened. I used to be a beggar. I used to be a man of not ill repute.

377
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 I wasn't a prostitute. I wasn't blowing dudes for money to buy blueberries.

378
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 But I was a hobo, basically. Which is a huge divide.

379
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 There's a lot of stuff in between blowing people for blueberry money and just simply laying on the street corner.

380
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 He was more of a laying on the street corner, I believe. Could be wrong.

381
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 As he's suspiciously looking at the judges' blueberry pies, they have in front of him, he's like, "You gonna eat that?"

382
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 They're like, "Yeah, we're gonna eat this." But maybe, maybe later.

383
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 So anyway... Anyways.

384
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Whenever I tell a joke like that, I get a complaint.

385
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 From at least two people. It's always the same two people.

386
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 One person complains that I tell jokes about gay dudes kissing.

387
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 And the other one complains that I don't tell enough. It's the most bizarre thing.

388
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 I love you guys. The audience is... You guys are amazing.

389
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 But every so often, I'll make a joke like I just made.

390
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 And I'll get a complaint saying that I'm part of the homosexual agenda trying to corrupt the planet.

391
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 And the other one that I'm too politically incorrect.

392
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 And I shouldn't joke about dudes kissing. Because dudes kissing real life.

393
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Super bizarre. I get the same two emails from the same two different people all the time.

394
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 Let's go ahead.

395
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 Well, see, I haven't told a joke like that in a while, actually. I think the last one was some Bigfoot story.

396
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 Or the giant sloth kicking down the door. I think it was... That's like episode 200.

397
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 Anyways, the point is that... This is gonna be an extra long episode. It's season premiere.

398
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 He's a hobo, right? He's a hobo blueberry blueberry all over his mouth. He's a very successful hobo.

399
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 And this guy's walking through the wilderness. This guy wasn't a very effective hobo, apparently.

400
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 Because he was in the middle of nowhere. And this dude walks up to him and he toasts him three times.

401
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 He says, "You will become like me." Holds up a little thing of liquor. "You will become like me."

402
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 "You will become like me." And then he blows into a jug.

403
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 Hey, I wonder if I can actually do that with my root beer.

404
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 No, it didn't work. Anyways, I think you need like a ceramic jug.

405
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 Not a plastic bottle. And you just can't... Don't do that tomorrow at work or at school.

406
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 Don't walk up to someone and say, "You will be like me three times and blow in a jug."

407
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 You'll probably get escorted off of campus or your workspace.

408
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 You have to be a werewolf already. Forgot that part.

409
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 The guy walking up to Theos, the hobo, was already a werewolf.

410
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 He says, "You will become like me. You will become like me. You will become like me."

411
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 Blows into jug.

412
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 Now, that gave him the ability to turn a werewolf.

413
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 Now, he actually ran with a crew of other werewolves. They did this dirt together.

414
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 Ride or die. And three nights a year, they could travel to hell.

415
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 They could go to hell on St. Lucia's Day, the Pentecost, the Night of the Pentecost, and St. John's Day.

416
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 And Catholic, those mean nothing to me. I get that the word, Pentecost, that's supposed to be something like some big holiday, right?

417
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 But anyways, Catholics out there are like, "Oh yeah, this episode's for me. I get a reference."

418
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 I know three references Jason doesn't know. To be fair, you guys probably know every reference I don't know.

419
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 But they would travel to hell on those three days.

420
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 And at that point, so this is the big story that busted out of this, was the judges were like,

421
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 "So, wait a second. You got turned into a werewolf.

422
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Now, actually, let me go back. They first said, "Turn into a werewolf right now."

423
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 Before all that stuff, before it went off and all that stuff, they said, "Turn into a werewolf right now."

424
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 And he goes, "Well, I can't. I gave this power up 10 years ago."

425
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 "Can't turn into a werewolf." It's funny because just last, the end of last season,

426
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 I did another story about a werewolf in Spain, and he was like, "Same thing."

427
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 He was like, "Well, if you had asked me a week ago, I could have turned into a werewolf, but now."

428
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 So he used to go, "And 10 years ago, I was able to turn into a werewolf, but I gave up the gift."

429
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 "I gave it up. I didn't want to be a werewolf anymore."

430
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 But when I was a werewolf, I could turn into a werewolf, and me and my buddies, what we would do,

431
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 is we would run into the bushes, take all of our clothes off the judges, like, "That's weird."

432
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 He's like, "Yeah, it's a little weird, but it's not like that."

433
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 We'd go into the bushes, we'd take our clothes off, we'd come out, we'd have blueberries smeared all over our bodies.

434
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 They're like, "Judges are like, "What?"

435
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 "No, that's not true. That's not real detail. I'm confused."

436
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 They do take all their clothes off, and then they would jump out of the bushes, and they'd be wolves.

437
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 And the first thing they would do is kill a bunch of farm animals.

438
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 So the judges are like, "Wait, what? That's actual property. The farmers need that."

439
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 And the theus goes, "Yeah, yeah, but we need to eat, so what we do is we do."

440
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 They run through the forest, not the forest, they're eating farm animals. Why weren't they eating deer?

441
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 They're attacking sheep, they're ripping their throats out, eating them.

442
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 And then they would cook them.

443
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 So the judges are like, "Wait, how do you cook meat?"

444
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 He got wolf paws.

445
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 And theus goes, "Oh, we want wolves then."

446
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 And the judges are like, "This story's not made in any sense at all."

447
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 And that's real. The story he's telling is quite jumbled.

448
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 This isn't just a typical dead rabbit radio getting his facts mixed up, except for that one part where I did,

449
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 where they asked him to turn into a werewolf.

450
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 He goes, "We'd jump out of the bushes, we'd become wolves, we'd kill farm animals,

451
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 and apparently then they would turn into humans so they could roast the meat and salt it.

452
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 But he's like, "But your honor, we never used bread."

453
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 Crosses his arms, he's like, "We don't care if you're using bread.

454
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 How are you killing the farm animals? Are you ripping their throats out

455
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 and then shifting back into human and then eating them?"

456
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 Super bizarre story. But that's just the beginning.

457
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 They're getting the... I'm getting hung up on it too.

458
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 The judges get hung up on it. How were they eating and preparing these meals?

459
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 But they were. The most important part of the story was on those three days,

460
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 on St. Lucie's Day, the night of the Pentecost, and St. John's Day,

461
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 they would travel to hell to beat up witches and attack the devil.

462
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 So he would say, "Werewolves are actually the hounds of God.

463
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Werewolves are not a bad creature."

464
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 And I get that people want to think that werewolves are the bad guys, but we're actually good guys.

465
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 We actually make sure that we have a great harvest.

466
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 So we'll go down to hell.

467
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 And we're like attacking witches.

468
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 And the witches, every year, they still barley and wheat and animals,

469
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 those sweet, sweet, delicious animals we maim at night and eat.

470
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 And the judges are like, "Ah, not this again."

471
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 They take all this stuff to hell because Satan wants to destroy our society.

472
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 And it's up to us werewolves to go to a place beyond the sea,

473
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 which is actually just a swamp like 10 miles outside of town.

474
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 He makes it sound like it's the east, like where the elves are going in Lord of the Rings,

475
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 but it's just a dirty old swamp that you could walk to in a day.

476
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 They'd turn into werewolves, they'd go into the swamp, and then they'd go into hell,

477
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 and they would attack the witches.

478
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 The witches would use iron pipes to kind of beat them, but they would just, they'd fight them.

479
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 And their goal was to bring back as much wheat and barley and honey,

480
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 whatever the people in the town were harvesting to bring back.

481
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 Farmers were like, "Yay, look at all that wheat and barley he was saying, where's all my sheep?"

482
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 "All my sheep got taken out too."

483
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 The werewolves have all these bloody mouths, they're like, "Oh, we didn't see no sheep down there."

484
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 Big old bellies, we didn't see none of that.

485
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 One of them's wearing a wool coat.

486
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 Yeah, no, I went to hell with this.

487
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 I had this one, I went down to hell.

488
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 But anyways, they'd bring it back and that would guarantee a good harvest.

489
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 God created the werewolf to fight Satan.

490
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 And all this fake news you've heard about werewolves being bad, that's spread by the witches.

491
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 We're the good guys, if it wasn't for us, the economy would completely fall apart.

492
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 You'd be starving, Judge.

493
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 You wouldn't be eating that blueberry pie right now.

494
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 Case dismissed, and the judges are like, "You can't dismiss the case, that's our job."

495
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 And this trial's still going on, it's not even a trial, we're just questioning you, sir.

496
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 Now you're getting us twisted.

497
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 But they did still have some questions.

498
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 Can you prove any of this?

499
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 And the old man goes, "I can actually."

500
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 Last year, we had a great harvest, didn't we?

501
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 I mean, I'm sure that you can obviously see there's wheat everywhere.

502
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 Your chairs are made out of wheat, they're like, "Oh yeah, they are."

503
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 That's why they're so comfortable and/or scratchy.

504
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 I've never sat on wheat before.

505
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 He goes, "Yes, that was because I went down and battled Satan myself last year and brought all this barley up."

506
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 And one of the judges goes, "Wait a second."

507
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 I thought you said that you gave up the vampire...

508
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 Not the vampire, Judge starts looking through his notes again.

509
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 It's like, "Oh, werewolf trial, vampire trials later."

510
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 He goes, "I thought that you said that you gave up your werewolf powers a month ago."

511
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 Not a month ago, damn it!

512
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 This Judge, he's so sure of himself.

513
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 The other judges are like, "Why didn't we bring this guy along?"

514
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 He's floating through his notes again.

515
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 He goes, "Let's see if I can get it right this time."

516
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 This Judge with a big smirk on his face, he's super smug.

517
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 He got it this time.

518
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 The Judge goes, "I thought you said you gave up your werewolf powers 10 years ago."

519
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 That's what he told us, right?

520
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 The other two judges look at him, they're very proud.

521
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 They're very proud that the Judge got it right this time.

522
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 And he's like, "Thank you."

523
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 And the old man realizes that he's been caught in a lie.

524
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 So he goes, "You're right. You're right."

525
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 "I didn't give up. I'm still a werewolf."

526
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 Fuck, I didn't give up my werewolf powers.

527
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 He doesn't admit that he made the whole story up.

528
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 He simply says, "You're right. I actually still am a werewolf."

529
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 But, but you want me to turn in a werewolf.

530
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 We're gonna need to bring in bushes.

531
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 I'm gonna have to take all my clothes off.

532
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 They're like, "Whoa, okay."

533
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 Maybe not that.

534
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 I think also he might have had to only turn in a werewolf on those particular nights.

535
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 I don't know if he was allowed to run around as a werewolf all the time.

536
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 But anyways, the Judge has kept asking,

537
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 "You're a werewolf."

538
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 You're still a werewolf.

539
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 And that means you're a satanic.

540
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 Like, that's a creature that, if it exists, and we don't even know if it does,

541
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 we're learned men, we don't even know if it does.

542
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 We're kind of just enjoying this story this old man is telling us.

543
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 But if it does, it's a satanic creature.

544
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 And this is when Theus starts to get really upset.

545
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 He's like, "No, we are the hounds of God.

546
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 That story is fake."

547
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 Werewolves are the good guys.

548
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 And the Judge is like, "They're just..."

549
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 We're gonna keep doing some investigation.

550
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 And the Judge is, and this old man leaves, and the Judge is go,

551
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 "What do you think about that story?"

552
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 And they're like, "I don't know.

553
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 Like, here's the thing.

554
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 If the story is real and he's turning in a werewolf,

555
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 then that's not a good thing for society or for God."

556
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 Now, like I said, these guys were learned men.

557
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 They weren't like super superstitious.

558
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 But at the same time, they worked for a religious government.

559
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 So they weren't gonna immediately like go,

560
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 "Witch, witch, witch."

561
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 But they still thought a man who walks around telling people he's a werewolf,

562
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 even if he's saying he's fighting Satan,

563
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 is just a bridge too far.

564
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 But at the same time, they're thinking,

565
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
 "Technically, he's like a holy werewolf?"

566
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 So they're debating this, and they go back out into the streets.

567
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 They've been in town.

568
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 They basically had to get like a six-month extended stay hotel at this point.

569
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 They're investigating people, and they find out that he,

570
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 on top of being a werewolf, on his non-werewolf nights,

571
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 he does folk medicine.

572
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 So here, rub this little thing under your nostril when the moon's half full,

573
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 and then your warts will go away, stuff like that.

574
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 They're investigating that, and they're going,

575
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 "This is something that we can kind of dig our teeth into."

576
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 And so they begin asking people, like, "What are the type of charms?

577
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 What are the type of things?"

578
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 And people would tell them, "Oh, well, he would come,

579
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 and he would tell us this, and he would give us his blessing."

580
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 And the judges realized that all of his blessings,

581
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 and all of his cures, and all of his charms,

582
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 none of them invoked Christ.

583
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 So the judges kind of had to split it on the middle.

584
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 They go, "We don't want to punish a guy for being a werewolf who fights Satan."

585
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
 If the story's true, it probably isn't.

586
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 They don't want to be to do it up for fighting Satan,

587
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 because werewolves are Satanic, but maybe this guy's a good werewolf.

588
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 Maybe the guy's insane as well.

589
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 However, he's helping people out, and he's not saying Jesus' name,

590
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 so they found him guilty of that.

591
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 Now, remember, he was just a witness of a burglary.

592
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 He was not on trial at all, even the second time,

593
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 they were just asking him questions.

594
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 But they go, "Well, we're not going to punish you."

595
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 And they go, "Well, we don't know if you're a werewolf or not."

596
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 That's kind of a moot point.

597
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 It was an interesting story.

598
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 However, you walked around and you helped people,

599
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 and you didn't say that Jesus, you didn't say,

600
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 "Let Christ protect you."

601
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 You just gave him an amulet and said,

602
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 "Blessed are the ones who wear this amulet."

603
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 So this 80-year-old man, they flogged him,

604
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 and said he just whipped him,

605
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 [imitates whip]

606
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 and then banished him from town.

607
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 Which, to be fair, his name was Theus from Cantalbrun.

608
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 So I'm sure he just went back to Cantalbrun.

609
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 So not the worst punishment ever.

610
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 If you're going to be banished,

611
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 if your name was Johnny New York,

612
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 and you get banished from San Diego,

613
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 I think you'll be okay.

614
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 But that's the end of the historical record

615
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 of Theus of Cantalbrun.

616
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 Now, we don't know how much longer he lived after that.

617
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 True story, though.

618
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 We don't know how much longer he lived after that.

619
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 We don't know if the judges all seriously died

620
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 in claw-related accidents.

621
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 We don't know if they were found underneath each body,

622
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 a half-eaten blueberry pie,

623
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 just sitting underneath their body.

624
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 Is there a mall to death?

625
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 We don't know.

626
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 We do know that he was banished,

627
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 and it's kind of the end of the story.

628
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 But it's an interesting story nonetheless,

629
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 despite not really having a satisfactory ending.

630
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 An old man gets beaten and kicked out of town,

631
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 and then people just stop keeping records,

632
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 because the trial that wasn't even a trial is over.

633
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
 It does raise some interesting questions.

634
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 One, the witches didn't get banished.

635
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 People accused of being witches didn't get banished.

636
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 Is it possible that all the stories we've heard

637
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
 about werewolves being the bad guys

638
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
 is fake news?

639
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 Is the power structure would be the witches?

640
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 They'd be the high-level farmers in your society.

641
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
 You've heard of witch doctors.

642
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
 You never heard of werewolf doctors, right?

643
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 You would have witches in high-levels of society.

644
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
 They wouldn't want to perpetrate the myth

645
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 that werewolves are bad guys, that werewolves are evil.

646
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 They are the hounds of hell.

647
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 They kill children, they eat them,

648
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 they take them away, and all that stuff.

649
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 But what if the werewolves were the good guys?

650
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 What if werewolves were sent by God to protect us

651
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 from the witches?

652
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 But the victors write history.

653
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 Theus was kicked out of town, never to be seen again.

654
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 But the people who he accused of being witches remained.

655
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 Even today are the creatures we consider evil and supernatural,

656
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 like the rake or mothman.

657
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 Are these actually the good guys sent to protect us

658
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 from even darker forces out there?

659
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 Who knows?

660
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 But tomorrow we'll profile an entire culture of people

661
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 who fought the same battle Theisted.

662
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 He was one of a small group of werewolves who fought Satan.

663
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 Tomorrow we'll learn about an entire region of white witches

664
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 who fought against hell's hordes.

665
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 And they were also mysteriously written out of the history books.

666
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 Are the good guys being demonized by the demons?

667
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
