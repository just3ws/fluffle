1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
 The often mentioned but never before released story never talked about this publicly on the

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:15,560
 podcast of the time that I had to come face to face with the snarling dog of war.

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,000
 And then because I'm already on the subject of dogs, I want to talk about yet, we talked

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,560
 about this on Friday, but I have yet another bizarre unexplainable story of the time I saw

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:34,760
 a dog right in front of me middle of the day try to attack some children and then when I jumped

6
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:40,080
 in to help things got weird today on dead rabbit radio.

7
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:50,800
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of dead rabbit radio.

8
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,800
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,800
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,800
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,800
 I hope you guys had a great weekend.

12
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,800
 I hope you guys had lots of fun doing whatever you're doing.

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,800
 On Friday's episode I talked about ghost dogs and my relationship with dogs and I ended

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:11,480
 the episode on a rant about dogs and I mentioned the time that I went toe to toe with an Akita

15
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,360
 that had just mauled a man right in the middle of the street.

16
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,920
 Me and this dog had a fight.

17
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,080
 I've mentioned it a couple times on the podcast and now I think it's time to actually tell

18
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,200
 that story also because in my journal I just got done recording that episode.

19
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,000
 Like I said I'm trying to record some episodes in a batch before I go on vacation and I just

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 feel that it's time.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,880
 We're going to talk about that but first off let's go ahead.

22
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,400
 He didn't get to fly the Carvener copter last episode.

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,000
 Let's re-invite into Dead Rabbit Command Christmas live stream contributor Alex.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,200
 Everyone give a big round of applause to Alex walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

25
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,920
 You're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

26
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,520
 If you guys can't support the show financially I totally get it.

27
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,840
 Just helps read the word about the show.

28
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,920
 That really really really helps out a lot.

29
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,120
 Now like I was saying in the intro there I'm super amped up.

30
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,360
 So let's get started Alex.

31
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,680
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

32
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,640
 Or leave me behind Dead Rabbit Command.

33
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,440
 We're headed all the way out to Orangevale, California.

34
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,160
 Let's travel back to the year.

35
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,160
 It's so funny.

36
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,080
 As monumental of a story this is I don't even remember what year it takes place.

37
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,120
 It's par for the course for me really.

38
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,160
 I have a really hard time.

39
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:25,240
 I really keep track of everything that happened before or after Terminator 2 came out.

40
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,840
 This story was passed Terminator 2.

41
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:34,320
 I think it was between 97, 98, 99 probably closer to 1997.

42
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,640
 And listen when I was in Sacramento I got in fights a lot.

43
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,080
 It was constantly fighting people or starting fights whatever.

44
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,440
 It's so hard to own weapons in California legally.

45
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:50,240
 To have a gun, to transport a gun, you have to have the ammo in one part of your car locked

46
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,080
 up and the gun itself in another part of the car locked up.

47
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,120
 So people will keep a lot of times their gun in their glove compartment, the ammo in the

48
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,520
 trunk.

49
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,080
 It's almost too much trouble.

50
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,800
 You're like Jason are there a ton of shootings?

51
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,200
 Are there a ton of gangs in California?

52
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,960
 Yeah they're not carrying their guns around legally.

53
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,280
 It's not like they're like we're going to mug people all day long but we will follow

54
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,960
 the law regarding guns.

55
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,600
 And also in California I don't know if it's the same but any crime you committed with

56
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,600
 a gun was an automatic extra five years for using a firearm in California.

57
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,920
 I'm sure it's actually higher nowadays.

58
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,640
 So it's too much trouble to own a gun.

59
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,120
 I did have knives but even those were very, very tricky in California.

60
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,040
 The reason why I feel comfortable telling this story on this podcast is it's true crime.

61
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,240
 There's a lot of true crime on it.

62
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:40,040
 I carry knives but I never carry them on my person because in California the knife has

63
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,200
 to always be visible.

64
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,600
 I carry a knife all the time up in Oregon because the laws are more permissible.

65
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,560
 I always have a knife on me.

66
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,560
 But California if you carry a knife on you it has to be visible at all times so it clipped

67
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,120
 on the outside of your pants.

68
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,760
 It has to be a knife you use two hands to open.

69
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,640
 It couldn't be larger than 12 inches.

70
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,040
 Which I mean at that point in Gerambo right?

71
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,800
 It couldn't be larger than 12 inches.

72
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,440
 It couldn't be a gravity knife.

73
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,240
 It couldn't be a switch blade or anything like that.

74
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,480
 It couldn't just come to a point so no dirks or daggers.

75
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,920
 Now obviously you'd have people with fishing knives.

76
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,480
 Those long filet knives you'd have people with those hunting knives.

77
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,880
 But when you couldn't be walking around with a hunting knife in downtown Sacramento that

78
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,780
 would be a cop would stop you, a cop would question you and again any cop can take you

79
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,480
 off the street and throw you in jail for 24 hours and say "Yeah we decided not to charge

80
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,480
 you."

81
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,280
 So you could say you're following the law but at the end of the day the police can do

82
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,600
 whatever they want and have you detained.

83
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,080
 They're not arrested you're simply detained.

84
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,640
 If you have a filet knife at downtown mall and it's 13 inches long you're going to have

85
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,400
 a really hard time saying "I was about to go fishing because you're in the middle of

86
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,400
 this city."

87
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,840
 But I did keep some knives in the trunk of my car.

88
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,720
 I actually did have a dagger at the time and then I had a couple folding knives and stuff

89
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,720
 like that.

90
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,200
 But again remember I'm also constantly getting in squabbles and those were generally just

91
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,200
 fist fights.

92
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,200
 Right?

93
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,480
 I was in California and nobody cares.

94
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,480
 But I remember once I was down at Folsom Lake.

95
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,080
 I was just driving around one day back when gasoline was 98 cents a gallon.

96
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,840
 Drive around sometimes just listening to music and I remember one day I was driving around

97
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,480
 I decided to stop at Folsom Lake.

98
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,480
 Just walk around.

99
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,240
 I wanted to have an excuse to carry my giant filet knife.

100
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,240
 And as I was walking around I found a boat ore.

101
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,360
 This giant piece of wood looked like a Gandalf staff.

102
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:40,600
 And it was rounded, not like a ball at one end but it started to taper into like a rounded

103
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,520
 thicker end at the top and it would taper down.

104
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,200
 It was this old wooden paddle and the paddle part had been broken off.

105
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,120
 So basically I just had this giant stick.

106
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,960
 It was probably around five feet long.

107
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,240
 And I remember like holding it up as if I had found Moses' staff.

108
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,000
 I thought this would be awesome for smashing people's windows open.

109
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 Yay!

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 People were like "What did you say?"

111
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 I was like "Nothing."

112
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,760
 I'm going to smash his window open when he's not looking.

113
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,680
 So I took this giant boat ore and I threw it in the trunk of my car.

114
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,480
 The stain on my grandma's house, which I talked about on yesterday's episode, I lived

115
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,720
 with my grandma for a long period of time.

116
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,320
 This is in the Woodward Way area of Orangevale is where we're at now.

117
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,880
 And then Pecan Avenue is right around the corner.

118
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,160
 And I remember this particular day I had to go to college.

119
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,160
 I had to go to class.

120
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,200
 I worked for the school newspaper, the American River Current and I was headed there and my

121
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,960
 cousin Rachel asked if I could take her somewhere.

122
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,480
 I don't remember where I was driving her off.

123
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,800
 But I was like "Yeah, sure, no problem."

124
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,560
 I was staying with my grandma at the time.

125
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,960
 I talked about that on Friday's episode and my cousin Rachel was over there.

126
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,960
 So we get in my car.

127
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,760
 This is back when I was driving my Ford Mustang.

128
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,080
 And we start driving.

129
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,240
 We come off Woodward Way.

130
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,760
 We're driving now down Pecan.

131
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:56,320
 Right when we get onto Pecan, there's this house there on the left hand side of the road.

132
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,480
 It's like this white tract house, right?

133
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,480
 Just look like a normal house that came out of a, came out of a machine.

134
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,520
 You know, they all kind of look the same.

135
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,960
 And in the front yard there is a man rolling around with a dog.

136
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,960
 This big dog.

137
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,880
 I mean this guy was probably around my height, right?

138
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,760
 I'm like 5'11", he's probably close to that.

139
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,640
 And this dog looked as big as him.

140
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,640
 From tail to snout.

141
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,920
 And they're kind of rolling around.

142
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,640
 And I remember it caught both mine and Rachel's eyes.

143
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,760
 We were kind of just chatting about whatever when we came around the corner.

144
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,440
 We both saw that.

145
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,080
 And one of us, I don't remember which one said it, one of us said "Are they playing around?"

146
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,400
 You know people wrestle their dogs all the time and grab tennis balls out of their mouths

147
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,960
 and stuff like that.

148
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,960
 I slowed down.

149
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,320
 I'm driving very, very slowly now down Pecan Avenue towards Greenback.

150
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,240
 We're both kind of craning our necks to see what's going on.

151
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,680
 And I probably get maybe 75 yards away and Rachel goes "I don't think they're playing."

152
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,280
 So I stopped the car.

153
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,920
 Now this is a time before cell phones.

154
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,280
 I mean sure they existed.

155
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,120
 Donald Trump had one, you know they had the giant block cell phones, the yuppies and stuff

156
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,120
 like that.

157
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,280
 We all had pagers maybe.

158
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,800
 I don't even know if I could afford a pager back then.

159
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,280
 And I remember stopping the car.

160
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,200
 There's no way we could like alert any authorities.

161
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,520
 Plus we didn't know what was going on yet, right?

162
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,600
 We don't know if this guy is still kind of wrestling, having fun with this dog.

163
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,360
 But I walked to my trunk.

164
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,640
 We both hop out of the car.

165
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:27,880
 And I walked to the trunk and by the time I get there I realize that this dog is attacking

166
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,640
 this man.

167
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,520
 The attack is so savage.

168
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,440
 He's not screaming out for help.

169
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,400
 He's not making any noise whatsoever.

170
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:41,680
 He's spending, this man is spending every ounce of energy he has just fending off this

171
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,680
 dog.

172
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,600
 And it's latching on and shaking on a body part, then latching on to another body part

173
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,600
 and shaking.

174
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,520
 It's trying to murder this man.

175
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,040
 Now what I found out later that this was an akita, which is a dog that the Japanese

176
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,400
 bred to be a war dog.

177
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,520
 Nowadays they're a pet.

178
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,360
 And what I found out later too is the people who raised this akita was this, you have this

179
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,400
 really nice house.

180
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,960
 I like tracked housing, right?

181
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,400
 I like that kind of cookie cutter house.

182
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:17,000
 And then I think one or two houses down was this old decrepit Adams family, Munsters type

183
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 house.

184
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,680
 It was gray with the paint flaking off and the spooky staircase and the spooky windows

185
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,680
 and all that stuff.

186
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,440
 And that's where the akita came from, from what I found out later.

187
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:31,320
 There had been several reports to authorities that that dog, that akita was getting loose

188
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,440
 and chasing kids around the neighborhood.

189
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,600
 So this dog was not brought up well and the owners were not treating it well.

190
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,880
 And this dog was a problem.

191
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,280
 And this was the day things got as bad as they were going to get.

192
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,960
 And I didn't know any of that stuff though.

193
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,960
 I just saw this giant dog.

194
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,960
 I didn't know the breed.

195
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,760
 I just saw this giant dog attacking this guy and I walked to my trunk.

196
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,800
 And I remember as I was walking to my trunk I thought, I might have to stab this dog.

197
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,240
 Like I might have to stab this dog.

198
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,920
 And I remember popping the trunk and I looked and I was looking for my knives.

199
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,120
 Now this is such an interesting story for me.

200
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,360
 I hope it's interesting to you, but just my mindset.

201
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,520
 I remember going to the trunk looking for the knives because the knife is such a final

202
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
 weapon.

203
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,520
 There's no defensive use for a knife except brandishing it, right?

204
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,640
 I figured I might have to stab this dog.

205
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,880
 It's mauling this man.

206
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:29,440
 So what I didn't realize in the moment was that to use a knife, remember you can't have

207
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,040
 a knife over 12 inches so my knives are fairly small.

208
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,960
 Most of them are folding knives.

209
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,160
 And I would have to get incredibly close to this dog to stab it, right?

210
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:48,560
 I mean within arms reach, within, you know, I'd have to get up close.

211
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,680
 But I wasn't thinking that at the time.

212
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,080
 I thought I might have to get a knife.

213
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,760
 I might have to stab this dog.

214
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,720
 I wasn't thinking about how close that combat would be.

215
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,160
 You brandish a knife on a human, the fight's over, right?

216
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,000
 People are like, "No, I'm done."

217
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,520
 Dogs, they're not thinking like that, right?

218
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,680
 I walk and I remember kind of moving stuff around in my trunk looking for my knives.

219
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,680
 I couldn't find a single one.

220
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,280
 I had like seven of them.

221
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,120
 And I remember being upset that I couldn't find my knife because this is a Leverdust situation.

222
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,760
 We don't have phones.

223
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,480
 Something needs to be done right now.

224
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,400
 And then I was like, "I don't know what I'm going to do."

225
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:30,840
 And then all of a sudden I realized that in my trunk I have a five foot long piece of wood.

226
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,120
 Little did I know that that was exactly what I needed.

227
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:39,640
 I picked the boat ore up out of the trunk and just to be clear, I was not dressed to

228
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,040
 fight anyone this day.

229
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:46,520
 I was wearing Birkenstocks in my shorts and t-shirt.

230
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,240
 And I start walking towards this melee.

231
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,480
 And again, it's probably about 75 yards away from me.

232
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,000
 I start walking towards it and I turn to Rachel and I say, "Get back in the car."

233
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,240
 I realize that is ill-equipped as I may be.

234
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,240
 What else is going to happen?

235
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,240
 Who else can do anything?

236
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,480
 And right when I'm thinking that, this is such a crazy thing.

237
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,080
 This guy's rolling around with this dog.

238
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,240
 Right when I'm thinking like, "Okay, Rachel, you get back in the car.

239
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,240
 So you be safe."

240
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,480
 Because right now my brain's still kind of putting forth scenarios like, "What if this

241
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,480
 happens?

242
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,480
 What if the dog comes into the car?

243
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,720
 I don't want Rachel to get hurt?

244
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,760
 Like I'm sure I can take it."

245
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,280
 But I can't even say there was any sort of rational thought.

246
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,480
 Just these scenarios were kind of playing in the back of my head like someone doing quick

247
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,160
 mathematics.

248
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:39,400
 I remember once I was involved in this giant start of a gang melee.

249
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,560
 Nothing happened.

250
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,560
 Nothing happened.

251
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,880
 But I happened to be there with about 20 dudes.

252
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,000
 Maybe about 20 feet in front of us was another 20 dudes.

253
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,520
 And we're walking towards each other.

254
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,440
 I was 35 by the way.

255
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:58,600
 This story, this gang story, I should have been in this type of thing at that age.

256
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,000
 I'm walking with about 20 guys.

257
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,680
 I got 20 guys coming towards us.

258
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,720
 And I could see them holding weapons.

259
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,840
 You could see the silhouette of them holding bats and things like that.

260
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,560
 A pool stick.

261
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:14,480
 All basic rumble weapons like it's West Side Story or something.

262
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:21,280
 And as we're walking I hear someone on our side say "They've got a gun."

263
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,040
 They said it a little more panic than that but they said it loud enough for everyone

264
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,040
 to hear.

265
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,280
 And I remember as I'm walking and within a step.

266
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:32,120
 Like I remember myself clearly lifting my left leg up to step and I remember in my head

267
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,440
 I go "They have a gun.

268
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,000
 You can't see it.

269
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,320
 That means it's a handgun.

270
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,520
 Six to 15 rounds.

271
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,360
 You're not going to get shot."

272
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:49,000
 Statistically out of 20 people the way we were spaced out.

273
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,680
 Six to 15 rounds the chances of me getting shot in that moment as far apart as we were

274
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,480
 in the dark.

275
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,280
 My chances of getting shot was incredibly slim and I remember that entire thought process

276
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,880
 went through my head at a single moment.

277
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,840
 And we continued to walk forward because obviously if I thought the odds were against

278
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,320
 me I could have walked backwards.

279
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,320
 Now nothing ever came of that.

280
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,960
 The fight never materialized.

281
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,960
 People called the cops.

282
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
 Everyone showed up.

283
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,960
 I was not there to fight.

284
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,960
 I was hanging out with some friends and they wanted to rumble with some dude.

285
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,400
 It was a whole thing.

286
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,920
 It was a whole thing.

287
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,400
 But anyways your mind processes stuff super fast in that situation.

288
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,680
 You're incredibly calm.

289
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,680
 That's the weird thing.

290
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,000
 I get more anxious thinking about the story now than when it happened.

291
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,880
 So I have the boat ore and I'm walking towards this guy and I'm thinking I don't, I don't

292
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:44,440
 even remember kind of thinking hypotheticals but I don't remember thinking what I was actually

293
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,440
 going to do.

294
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,160
 And around that time I saw a minivan pull up and now it is directly across from the

295
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,160
 guy.

296
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,720
 Like they're maybe separated by 20 feet.

297
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:59,320
 This minivan pulls up and there is the guy on the grass.

298
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,680
 And behind, what are they going to do right?

299
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,960
 They're watching this.

300
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,160
 And I found out later it was a mom and a little boy in this minivan.

301
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,320
 Again no cell phones.

302
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:17,000
 And then behind the minivan pulls up an unsung hero, a male woman.

303
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,360
 Male woman out on delivery.

304
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,200
 She jumps out, I get chills just thinking about this part.

305
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:32,920
 She jumps out of her male truck and runs towards that Akita spraying it in the face with mace.

306
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,920
 Pepper spray whatever it was.

307
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,480
 She's running towards it and she's just blasting this dog in the face.

308
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:45,840
 And I'm standing there with the boat ore and I'm thinking oh okay somebody can stop this.

309
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,400
 That.

310
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,120
 I'm going to try my best not to cuss because I normally don't cuss on the show because

311
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,880
 I know people listen to this stuff at work.

312
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,640
 But I may start to lose the plot on that one.

313
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,960
 That dog turned.

314
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,960
 No Joe.

315
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,720
 This was so insane.

316
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:11,600
 That dog stopped biting the guy, turned, looked at the male woman and ran directly into the

317
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,960
 stream of mace.

318
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:18,480
 He was headed right for her.

319
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,720
 I remember thinking this situation is totally gone sideways.

320
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:31,720
 And I remember watching that stream get smaller and she's just like blasting this dude.

321
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:37,120
 And the dog is literally running into the stream and I'm watching the stream get smaller

322
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,120
 and smaller and smaller as the dogs close in the distance.

323
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,600
 And it gets within, fuck maybe like 10 feet of her.

324
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
 She runs.

325
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,520
 Like what are you going to do?

326
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,000
 This dog is enraged.

327
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:01,680
 It ran into the stream and now she, I'm watching her run and she runs.

328
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,120
 Runs around the minivan.

329
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,080
 Because you know the male truck has a giant opening in it.

330
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,840
 She can't get in the car because the dog will follow her.

331
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,320
 She runs around the minivan and the dog is right behind her.

332
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,320
 It's like a fucking loony tune.

333
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:21,000
 I watched them do three laps and each time she would run around the minivan and the dog

334
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,600
 was right behind her and then I'd see him disappear behind the back of the minivan.

335
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,280
 And then she reappears and the dog is running right behind her and I watch her disappear

336
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,880
 back behind the minivan.

337
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:37,520
 And on that third pass, that kid, that eight year old boy opens up the side of the minivan.

338
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:43,720
 I watch the male woman straight up like shoulder jump into the minivan and that kid slams that

339
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,240
 door.

340
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,840
 It was right on her.

341
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,640
 The man is lying prone on the grass.

342
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,960
 I don't even know if he's alive at this point.

343
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,000
 He's just lying there.

344
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,080
 I remember thinking maybe I can get in my car.

345
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,240
 Maybe I can run in my car.

346
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,280
 And when I turn around, I realize at this point I have walked a good maybe 20 yards,

347
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,000
 maybe 15 yards from my car.

348
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,160
 I was like slowly walking with my stick.

349
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:19,320
 I realized not only is my car about 15 yards away from me, I'm wearing Birkenstocks so

350
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,280
 I can't run.

351
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:27,480
 I just saw how fast this dog was and my stupid cousin Rachel shut my door as well.

352
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,360
 When I told her to get in the car, I didn't mean turn it into a tank.

353
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,240
 So I thought even if I'm able to get back to my car, I'm not by any long shot a runner

354
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,400
 anyways.

355
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,640
 And I remember thinking this very clearly.

356
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,520
 I turned around and I looked, even if I can get back to the car in time, even if I get

357
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:51,360
 open the door in time and jump into my car, that only leaves one other person for this

358
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,120
 dog to attack, the man who is laying on the grass.

359
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,120
 It will go back.

360
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,440
 I remember clearly thinking that you could try to run.

361
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,600
 You might be able to beat it to the car.

362
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,760
 But even if you did, let's say it did not attack you when your back was turned because

363
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,080
 this fucker was fast.

364
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,960
 This dog was so fast, even if you could get back to the car in time, it's just going to

365
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,920
 go and it will kill that man.

366
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,920
 He's not already dead, it will finish him.

367
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:25,360
 And that dog saw me and it began to charge.

368
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,120
 And I realized the second that it laid eyes on me and began to run, I realized at that

369
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,760
 point I could not turn my back.

370
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,720
 I had to fight it.

371
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,200
 I realized at that point that once it saw me and began to run, there was no way that

372
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,600
 I was going to be able to outrun this thing.

373
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,600
 There's no way.

374
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,440
 I had a moment where I kind of considered it, but once it started to run towards me.

375
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,680
 I'm not an athletic person by any means and I just don't mean that physically because

376
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,680
 you know I love to lift weights.

377
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,120
 I love to walk and do stuff like that.

378
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,120
 I love to do the stairs.

379
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,600
 When I say athletic, I mean athletic ability.

380
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,120
 I'm terrible at putting a basketball through a hoop.

381
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,480
 I'm horrible at tennis.

382
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,120
 I'm horrible at anything like that.

383
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:11,400
 And here I am with this boat ore and I remember taking a batter's stance.

384
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,360
 I turned it so my right arm was my right shoulder's farther back and I took this batting stance

385
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:21,040
 and I'm holding this boat ore and I'm waiting.

386
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:27,480
 Had you pitched a ball to me and gave me a bat and said hit this ball, I would have a

387
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,480
 hard time doing it.

388
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:34,680
 I just don't have that mechanism in me to play sports.

389
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,200
 And I remember taking this batter's stance.

390
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,880
 It was so natural, right?

391
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,720
 Take this batter's stance with this five foot long piece of wood and the dog is getting

392
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,560
 closer and closer.

393
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,960
 It's moving so fast, right?

394
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:59,440
 And I square up and as it gets close enough to me, I see literally this is no exactly

395
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,520
 exaggeration because I remember this so vividly.

396
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:10,080
 I saw the mace dripping off of its face.

397
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,200
 I could watch all of this stuff just dribble down its fur.

398
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:21,880
 Its entire face was wet and I squared up and I don't know how I calculated this.

399
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,000
 I had, I mean it had just been a miracle from on high.

400
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:38,600
 That dog got right within striking range and I swung that ore so hard I heard a crack.

401
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:45,600
 I hit this dog, this Akita attack dog right in the head.

402
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,720
 I swung and I don't remember aiming, I don't remember calculating, I don't remember figuring

403
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,720
 anything out.

404
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:59,880
 I swung it just the right time that that tip, that bulb of the boat ore smashed into the

405
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:06,440
 side of its head with more force than I've ever put into anything before.

406
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,680
 And I heard a crack.

407
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:15,520
 But then I heard a louder crack.

408
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:21,720
 And I hit that dog so hard and I heard that first crack and then I heard the second crack

409
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,960
 and I knew what that second sound was.

410
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,160
 The ore had snapped in half.

411
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:35,040
 I busted a solid piece of wood on this dog's head and I heard that second crack, crack,

412
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,800
 that unmistakable sound of wood snapping.

413
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:42,040
 And the thing is is that when I swung it as a baseball player, when I swung it like a

414
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:48,520
 bat at just the right moment, I followed through like a baseball player hitting a homer.

415
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:54,400
 My entire body twisted to the left and I remember I hit it and I heard that first crack and

416
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,560
 then I heard the second crack and I followed through and now I'm looking up at the beautiful

417
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,160
 California sky.

418
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,160
 My entire right side of my body is exposed.

419
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,680
 And I remember swinging through like a baseball player and I look up and the only thought

420
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,320
 that popped in my head was, "You're dead."

421
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:17,880
 I've exposed the juiciest part of Jason, all of those delicious organs and muscle tissue

422
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,920
 to this attack dog and I have no way to fight it off.

423
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,600
 My ore is broken.

424
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:29,400
 I remember following through and I look up at the sky and I thought, "You're dead."

425
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,040
 The street was silent.

426
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,880
 In a moment passed.

427
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,120
 I was waiting, I was literally waiting for the end.

428
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:45,040
 And then another moment passed and after about two or three seconds, which seemed like forever,

429
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:51,200
 I'm still frozen in this weird position like a baseball player, how he's followed through

430
00:23:51,200 --> 00:24:00,200
 and I turn my head and I look down and the dog is just standing there.

431
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:08,280
 And then I kind of readjust my body so I'm facing it full on and the dog goes, "Huh."

432
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,120
 Shakes his head.

433
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,120
 It's not looking at me now.

434
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,880
 It's looking straight ahead like this height of a dog and I'm looking down at it and I'm

435
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:23,480
 holding this boat ore and the dog just turns, walks back home.

436
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,680
 So I take off running or jogging.

437
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,320
 Really I'm in Birkenstocks.

438
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:34,240
 I start jogging to the man on the ground covered in blood.

439
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:41,040
 The male woman gets out of the minivan.

440
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,040
 At this point people had called the authorities.

441
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:46,320
 Because what happened was I did not know this at the time when I was standing there with

442
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,440
 that boat ore and that dog was running towards me because it's really close to that neighborhood.

443
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,200
 At least it was back then.

444
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,360
 There was a guy right across from me, really right at you like she were on Pecan Avenue

445
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,680
 on one side of the street, Spooky Old House with the crazy dog.

446
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,160
 On the other side of the street there was a man who was cleaning his rifle out.

447
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,200
 He had taken his rifle apart and was cleaning it on this day.

448
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,760
 He had seen what was going on apparently because he told my grandma this because over time

449
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,160
 like that's how I found out that the dog was chasing kids around the neighborhood.

450
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,880
 There are elements that I heard afterwards.

451
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:22,400
 This guy told my grandma, he goes, "I was cleaning my rifle and I saw what was happening

452
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,200
 and I was assembling that rifle as quickly as I could."

453
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,920
 He was putting it together and he goes, "And I watched your grandson stand in that road."

454
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,560
 And he goes, "I'm just putting it together.

455
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,760
 I'm putting this gun together."

456
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,680
 And he knocked the shit out of that dog.

457
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,120
 Fire department shows up.

458
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,600
 They're bandaging this dude up.

459
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,600
 Ambulance shows up.

460
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,680
 The neighborhood is so noisy now, right?

461
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,680
 All the sirens.

462
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,480
 It was so interesting.

463
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,480
 They throw him in the ambulance.

464
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,120
 They take him off and I remember the firefighters hosing down the driveway because there was

465
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,360
 just blood everywhere.

466
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,920
 I had blood on my feet when I was, I don't know how to help the guy too.

467
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,400
 We got over there, it was just blood.

468
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,880
 This guy had gotten chewed up.

469
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,920
 And I remember I got blood all over my Birkenstocks.

470
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,240
 I got blood all over my feet.

471
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,760
 The male woman, she had jumped out and we're kind of like, "What do we do?"

472
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,600
 We're still in shock.

473
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,600
 Ambulance fire engine shows up.

474
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,800
 And I remember one of the firefighters was watering down the, washing the blood off the

475
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,440
 driveway and then they left.

476
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,200
 And I remember walking back to my car and thinking, "I don't know anything about this

477
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,320
 dude who just got attacked, but somebody's going to come home from work or from school

478
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,560
 and they're going to have no idea that this just happened.

479
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,200
 There's no blood, there's no evidence, nothing.

480
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,920
 There would have been blood on the grass, but who looks at the grass every time he come

481
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,920
 home?"

482
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,480
 I dropped Rachel off.

483
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,680
 I went to school.

484
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,840
 I had to, I have to do stuff, right?

485
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,320
 I'm always doing something.

486
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:53,560
 And again, it wasn't sinking in exactly what I had gone through.

487
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,280
 So that's the end of that story.

488
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,560
 What I found out later, sorry this has gone on way longer than I thought it would, but

489
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,800
 what I found out later was, I talked to the guy after about a month or two, I went to

490
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:07,640
 the dude's house who got attacked and I said, "Hey man, you know, I, I, I, it was in the

491
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,880
 newspaper.

492
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,800
 There was a little paragraph in the Sacramento Bee, man mold by dog.

493
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,720
 It said nothing about the heroic actions of a future podcast.

494
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,200
 They didn't have to, right?

495
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,240
 A little, little blurb in the Sacramento Bee.

496
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,560
 I remember talking to the guy later.

497
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,040
 I said, "Yeah, I was there.

498
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,840
 I helped fight that dog off."

499
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,840
 And he said, "Yeah."

500
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,680
 He goes, "Listen, I grew up in Germany.

501
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,520
 And I have never had a problem with dogs."

502
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,080
 He goes, "I have two dogs myself.

503
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,080
 I grew up with dogs."

504
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,840
 He was like, his dad was in the military or something like that in Germany.

505
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,000
 He goes, "I grew up with dogs, dog farm dogs, regular dogs, house dogs, all that stuff."

506
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 He goes, "I never had a problem with dogs."

507
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,280
 He goes, "But that dog was a terror to the neighborhood.

508
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,720
 He never bothered me, but I'd always hear reports of kids complaining about it and people

509
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,000
 had filed complaints with the city or the authorities and no one ever really cared."

510
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,120
 He goes, "And then one day, that day, he was sitting at home and he heard a commotion outside

511
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,120
 of his house."

512
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,160
 "Two dogs in the garage were going nuts."

513
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,360
 And he heard a dog outside the garage.

514
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,560
 And so he's like, "I wonder what's going on.

515
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,560
 Does this dog need something?"

516
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,560
 Right?

517
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,480
 And he's never had a need to be fearful of a dog.

518
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,640
 He goes, "I walk and I look out and I see it's my next-door neighbor's Akita."

519
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,640
 Or that neighborhood's Akita.

520
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,520
 Again, I don't know if there was a house in between the two, but I saw that it was the

521
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,200
 Akita and I thought, "Oh, maybe he needs help."

522
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,200
 He goes, "I opened that door.

523
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,200
 I was home all alone."

524
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:27,160
 He goes, "I opened that door and the dog immediately jumped on top of me and began attacking

525
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,160
 me.

526
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:33,920
 And I'm fighting this dog off and we're in my foyer, right?

527
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,240
 We're in the opening, the entrance of the house."

528
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:42,320
 And he goes, "That dog tried to drag me into the house.

529
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,680
 My dogs in the garage are going insane.

530
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,320
 They're barking so loud, but they're locked in the garage."

531
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:52,880
 And he goes, "I remember thinking, this dog is trying to murder me.

532
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,440
 This dog, if it gets me into the house, it will kill me.

533
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,480
 My only hope," he told me this, this and that.

534
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:07,440
 He goes, "I knew that my only hope was to get out of the house and maybe someone would

535
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,240
 see what was going on."

536
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,360
 So as this dog was trying to drag him in the house, he used really the last reserves of

537
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:21,360
 his strength to push himself and the dog out into the lawn where they rolled across the

538
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:27,480
 lawn and my car is coming around the corner right then.

539
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,480
 Absolutely insane.

540
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,480
 It broke his wrist.

541
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,480
 It bit him so hard.

542
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,480
 It broke his wrist.

543
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,720
 He had a giant gash down one of his arms like it took out muscle tissue.

544
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,240
 And I go, so what happened with the dog?

545
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,040
 He goes, "Oh, they put it down.

546
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,480
 Not only did they put that dog down, I owned their house."

547
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,480
 He's like, "Really?"

548
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,480
 He goes, "Yeah, I sued him.

549
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,280
 I own that house now."

550
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,240
 It might have been more than two months afterwards, another thing about that, but he's like, "No,

551
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,440
 yeah, I took their house.

552
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,360
 I sued him and I own it now."

553
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,360
 The dog had been reported to be a problem.

554
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,960
 So that's the Akita attack dog story.

555
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,840
 I again, it went on a lot longer than I thought it would.

556
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,280
 Hope you guys are entertained by it.

557
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,360
 It gave me for a long time I had PTSD from it.

558
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,440
 I don't know if I'd go so far as having PTSD from it, but I definitely would sit around

559
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:15,520
 and I would fantasize about different ways that I could have beaten that dog.

560
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,720
 I would sit around and go, "Dude, what if I had a sword in my trunk and I just locked

561
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,680
 its head off?

562
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,080
 What if I had a shotgun in my trunk?"

563
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,960
 Put it away.

564
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:32,760
 I'd sit there and I don't want to say fantasize, but I'd get stuck in these loops about fighting

565
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,200
 that dog and I hated dogs for the longest time.

566
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,640
 When I grew up, I didn't really care about dogs.

567
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,640
 I mean, I thought they were cool pets, but I wasn't a dog person.

568
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,200
 I didn't love them or hate them.

569
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,000
 After that event, I couldn't be around dogs at all.

570
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,200
 People would say, "Oh, my dog's nice and I still wouldn't want to be around them."

571
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,720
 The way that I got over that was at one point I was homeless and I had friends that were

572
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,720
 helping me out.

573
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:58,040
 I was staying at one guy's, living in one guy's garage for a while.

574
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,160
 Great guy, my friend Gerkin.

575
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:05,320
 And then my friend Kara offered me to stay at her place for a while.

576
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,320
 I was going to watch her kid during the day.

577
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,840
 She worked during the day and it was this awesome kid named Liam who just played PlayStation

578
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,760
 all the time.

579
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,320
 Stay at her place.

580
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,960
 But she had two dogs.

581
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,040
 This giant German shepherd named Tango.

582
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,920
 He was a super smart dog.

583
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:27,640
 He was like a $50,000 German shepherd, super trained and stuff like that.

584
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,140
 And then little Jake.

585
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,880
 Jake, this little wiener dog.

586
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,920
 But when I walked into the house, I was homeless so I was like, "Are you kidding me, dude?"

587
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,640
 But Tango kind of stayed out of my way.

588
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,400
 But Jake was just constantly barking and he was afraid of me, which was making me afraid

589
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,480
 of him.

590
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,520
 And I remember that very first night I was like, "Dude, I don't know if I can do this."

591
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,840
 And like Jake, because Tango was chilling wherever.

592
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,480
 I oddly wasn't super nervous around him, but Jake was making me nervous because he was

593
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,440
 so unpredictable.

594
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,600
 And I remember thinking, "Dude, it's been like 10 years.

595
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,200
 It's been like 10 years you've been afraid of dogs."

596
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:08,840
 And on that very first night, my very first night staying with Kara, I grabbed Jake and

597
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,080
 I took him to bed.

598
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,520
 I said, "You're sleeping with me, bro."

599
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,760
 Because otherwise, I don't know if I can do this.

600
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,800
 Like I got a bond with you now.

601
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,800
 And he's a wiener dog.

602
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
 What's he going to do, right?

603
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
 He's a little schnauzer.

604
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,520
 And I pick him up and he's like squirming and I put him in my bed and I crawl in a

605
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,080
 bed and I shut the light off.

606
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,280
 And within like five minutes he was nuzzled next to me.

607
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,520
 And we were best friends after that.

608
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,280
 Like I think he was nervous and I was nervous.

609
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,960
 And that's what got me over my, I would say, hatred of dogs, right?

610
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,480
 I had really hard time being around them.

611
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,560
 Now I'm still, I can still get nervous around them, especially loose dogs.

612
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,200
 That's what I was talking about on Friday's episodes.

613
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,720
 But now, you know, Hood River's a huge dog town.

614
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,880
 People are constantly carrying their dogs, walking their dogs, stuff like that.

615
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,560
 And I just enjoy the puppy parade.

616
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,560
 I do enjoy the dogs.

617
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:01,080
 I've gotten over my hatred of dogs.

618
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,840
 Let's wrap this up because I want to talk about, I know this episode is going to run

619
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:08,560
 long and I really do apologize for that, but I want to add, that was a true crime story

620
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,560
 technically, right?

621
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,560
 An assault.

622
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:14,920
 Let's talk about a weird paranormal story and then we're done with the dogs.

623
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:18,280
 We're done with the dog stories and I also want to toss Alex the keys to the carpenter

624
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,280
 copter.

625
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,760
 We're leaving behind Orangevale, this is short guys, don't worry.

626
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,040
 Alex, we're leaving behind Orangevale, California.

627
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:32,040
 We're headed all the way out a couple of miles away to Del Paso Heights.

628
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:39,000
 This story would have taken place in 2005.

629
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,080
 So around 10 years, right?

630
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,600
 1997, 2005, what is that?

631
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,600
 Eight years.

632
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,880
 Afterwards, so at this point I have not met Jake yet.

633
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:53,880
 I still have an issue being around dogs and I'm still on the lookout for dog attacks,

634
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,880
 right?

635
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,380
 People who are having trouble.

636
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,240
 And the boat or cracked, right?

637
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,000
 I don't, I wonder what happened to that boat or should probably put it in a museum.

638
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,240
 Or something just a museum that I'd want to visit.

639
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:10,640
 But I didn't have the boat or anymore but I had a nice collection of baseball bats in

640
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,640
 my trunk.

641
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:17,160
 Now again, here's the thing, in California, true, granulated, this is so bizarre dude,

642
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:21,400
 like listen man, California has some good stuff about it but their laws are insane.

643
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:26,520
 In California, you cannot have a baseball bat in your car unless you also have a bat

644
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,480
 and a glove.

645
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,600
 Because technically a baseball bat is a weapon and I've got pulled over by police and questioned

646
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,600
 are you a baseball player?

647
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:39,680
 I was like no, I'm not a baseball player because I have an aluminum bat in my back seat and

648
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,240
 I don't have a ball and a glove.

649
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:47,000
 And so yeah, but you know the cops let me go, they just harassed me but I had a collection

650
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,480
 of baseball bats in my trunk and I also had a baseball glove and a ball at that point.

651
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,560
 And I also would often, you'll see me if you ever hang out with me in real life and we

652
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,920
 happen to go to the Goodwill, if that super specific series of events takes place, people

653
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,640
 have noticed this, when I go to Goodwill, I will buy baseball bats at Goodwill.

654
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,640
 People go why?

655
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,000
 I don't know why people ask me why anymore because I know it's going to be something

656
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 insane.

657
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,640
 I have a good collection of baseball bats just sitting in my apartment right now, I buy

658
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,640
 them at Goodwill.

659
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,360
 You go why do you buy baseball bats at Goodwill?

660
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:21,160
 And I go because they're covered in fingerprints.

661
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,680
 You buy a brand new baseball bat from Walmart, first off you're paying full price.

662
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:28,800
 Secondly, it only really will probably have one set of fingerprints on it, yours.

663
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:34,800
 But if you buy a baseball bat at a Goodwill, let's say you smash someone's car window,

664
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:41,200
 let's just say hypothetically speaking, you smash someone's car window with a baseball

665
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,600
 bat, you can leave it there.

666
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,480
 You wear gloves obviously, hypothetically speaking, you would wear gloves but you just

667
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,480
 drop it.

668
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,960
 First off, it only cost you three bucks, right?

669
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:56,760
 Smash the window, drop the bat, do whatever you're doing and then leave.

670
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,760
 It's covered in fingerprints.

671
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,640
 It's covered in fingerprints of a bunch of eight year olds and everyone who walked

672
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,040
 through the Goodwill picking it up and pretending to swing it around.

673
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,120
 Not your fingerprints because you are wearing gloves.

674
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,000
 You're going to Goodwill and I'm putting on gloves.

675
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,320
 Buy your bats at, here's another true crime tip.

676
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,320
 Where was I going?

677
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,840
 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, so I was driving through Del Paso Heights.

678
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,360
 I was leaving work, it was really late in the day.

679
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:23,240
 Del Paso Heights, they've recently been gentrified but it used to be kind of a rough neighborhood.

680
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:28,280
 It had a reputation like Oak Park that it was not the best place to be but it's also

681
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,720
 as a major thoroughfare, right?

682
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,000
 To get from one part of Sacramento to another, you can drive through Del Paso Heights.

683
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 Now there's a lot of art museums and stuff there and when I was driving through the area,

684
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 it was half and half.

685
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,440
 I don't know what it looks like now but I remember when I was living in Orangevale,

686
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:48,320
 Del Paso Heights was one of those areas you didn't go into after dark.

687
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,480
 Parts of Rancho Cordova or parts of North Highlands.

688
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:58,280
 I was driving through this residential area of Del Paso Heights.

689
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,920
 Like 5pm, it's late in the day, there's a lot of traffic, barely drive.

690
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,040
 The story is so weird, I don't even know how to classify this.

691
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:10,400
 Driving down the road and because we're going so slow, I see on the opposite side of the

692
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:16,960
 street, in this residential neighborhood, I see a young girl maybe like 8 years old.

693
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,480
 I'm really bad with ages and stuff like that but maybe 8 years old and she was there with

694
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,160
 her 6 year old, what I would assume, brother, right?

695
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,760
 And they're completely like frozen.

696
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:34,600
 And standing maybe 5 feet in front of them is a dog.

697
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,440
 And the dog's barking at them and I remember it now I'm going really slow.

698
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:43,760
 This is still when I just could not even be around dogs and I'm kind of having flashbacks,

699
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,760
 right?

700
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,760
 I'm barking at them and I see the girl and the boy, their body language is there terrified.

701
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,320
 This is something they're not playing around.

702
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,320
 And I remember like they were trying to figure out what to do.

703
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,600
 I think the little boy started to step forward maybe to try to get around the dog and the

704
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,520
 dog, I've never seen a dog do this like in anger before.

705
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:09,920
 It reared up, it stood up on its back two legs and just barked so loud and the girl

706
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,800
 straight up flinches backwards.

707
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:20,920
 She grabs the boy and then all at once the girl starts running, the boy starts running

708
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,160
 and the dog starts running after embarking.

709
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,040
 And at this point when I was watching what's going on, I'm already slowing down.

710
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,000
 I'm already stopped in traffic.

711
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,760
 I remember putting the car in park like in this weird motion.

712
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,480
 I must have had a baseball bat in the back seat now to think about it.

713
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:42,840
 I put the car back, pulled out my goodwill baseball bat and now I am running down the

714
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,560
 sidewalk.

715
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,760
 Middle of the day traffic jam like in one motion now and this again, I'm not a runner

716
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,560
 but like I had tennis shoes on at this time.

717
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,400
 I'm running down the street and I see this dog in front of me.

718
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,720
 It was like this tan dog.

719
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,640
 I don't know what breed it was.

720
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,640
 It's running.

721
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,920
 I see the girl running and the boy running in front of me and then the dog behind them

722
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,640
 and then I'm behind the dog and I'm running with this bat.

723
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:11,880
 And I watch the girl make a quick left turn into a yard and then the boy, because she,

724
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,680
 I think she realized she wanted to save her little brother, but she also had to be fast,

725
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,680
 right?

726
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,280
 I see her make a quick left and disappear in her front yard and I see the boy make a quick

727
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:26,960
 left and disappear into the front yard and I see the dog make a quick left and turn into

728
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,960
 the front yard.

729
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:32,920
 And then I run and I make a quick left and I turn into the front yard.

730
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,960
 This dad is sitting there.

731
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,840
 This mom is standing there.

732
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:42,320
 There's two children sobbing, screaming.

733
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,160
 I'm standing there with a baseball bat.

734
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,960
 The dog is nowhere to be seen.

735
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,200
 I have no idea where this dog went.

736
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,360
 At this point, a bunch of things are happening.

737
00:39:53,360 --> 00:40:03,600
 The whole family only speaks Spanish and the boy and the girl are sobbing and screaming

738
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:08,720
 and I'm holding this bat and the dad is looking at the kids and then looks at me and stands

739
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,720
 up and I'm like, there was a dog.

740
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,480
 I remember going, there was a dog.

741
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:20,520
 There was a dog and the mom is super confused about what's going on.

742
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:25,040
 This dude, here's the thing, you can't fight this guy, right?

743
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,480
 I can't fight this guy.

744
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,720
 I might just have to take an ass weapon right now or try to run away and get back.

745
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,320
 I don't know what to do.

746
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,400
 I can't lay this guy out.

747
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,400
 He's the hero.

748
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,360
 He's the one who just sees this man run into their front yard right after their children.

749
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,600
 The children are screaming.

750
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,640
 I'm holding this bat.

751
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,520
 I'm trying to explain there was a dog.

752
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,520
 There was a dog.

753
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,000
 I don't speak Spanish.

754
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,560
 They don't speak English.

755
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:54,280
 The daughter then starts to be able to kind of collect her senses.

756
00:40:54,280 --> 00:41:00,080
 She starts sobbing so hard and she starts to try to tell him what's going on.

757
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:06,040
 I could see her talking to the dad as he's walking towards me and he wasn't a big guy,

758
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,040
 right?

759
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:11,160
 This guy didn't tower over me but I honestly was probably a foot taller than him and probably

760
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:15,080
 had like 50 pounds on him but I can't fight that fight.

761
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,080
 He's the good guy.

762
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,560
 I would be the bad guy.

763
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,280
 I remember I'm holding the bat and I kind of have the bat to my side and I'm walking

764
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,520
 and also I'm totally afraid the dog's going to jump out of somewhere.

765
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:29,080
 I saw the dog and I see the daughter kind of like talking to the dad and the dad is

766
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:35,560
 just like very slowly, methodically with Terminator type fashion walking towards me.

767
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,160
 Now he's not right up against me.

768
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:42,400
 We still got maybe like a good 10, 15 feet distance and the mom starts to, I think the

769
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,000
 mom, see he's not listening to his daughter at that point, right?

770
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 Like what would you do?

771
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,600
 The mom starts to like touch his shoulder.

772
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:54,840
 Now she's saying something and the girl's saying something and he starts to like kind

773
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,840
 of look at them.

774
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,840
 I'm gone.

775
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,840
 I leave.

776
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,840
 I go back.

777
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:02,320
 There's a huge traffic jam.

778
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,200
 You know, I left my car in park on the road.

779
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,800
 This whole thing took place over the matter of like maybe two minutes.

780
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,760
 If that, like again I was running and I'm not a strong runner.

781
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,160
 I couldn't run for two minutes.

782
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,520
 It was, it was a very short period of time.

783
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,400
 All of that stuff happened.

784
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,720
 I don't know where that dog went and what I, again, I don't know any Spanish.

785
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:26,520
 I imagined the girl was trying to explain to them there was a dog as well.

786
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,520
 There was a dog.

787
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,080
 There was a dog because they were getting pursued by the dog.

788
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,880
 I saw the whole thing, but I don't know what happened.

789
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,440
 I don't know where that dog went at all.

790
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:42,400
 And I totally understood what the dad would be thinking if a guy comes around a corner

791
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,800
 with a baseball bat.

792
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,800
 Right?

793
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,800
 And these kids are screaming.

794
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,080
 They run in the yard and you just see some stranger run into your yard with a baseball

795
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,080
 bat.

796
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,280
 But I don't know what happened to that dog.

797
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,760
 I don't know even how to classify it.

798
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,800
 I don't know if that dog belonged to like Whiplash Knightley or whatever and he's trying

799
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,800
 to pull a prank.

800
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,800
 He's like, "Hehehehe."

801
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,200
 And the bushes, who knows.

802
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:06,320
 Phantom dog, ghost dog, sly dog that somehow realized that it was out of here, but there

803
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,320
 was no dog in the yard.

804
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,560
 It definitely wasn't their dog.

805
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:13,360
 The girl turned the corner and it was like, when I say turn the corner, this was a house

806
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,360
 on the middle of the street.

807
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,360
 So it was like a chain link.

808
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,720
 It was like a waist-high chain link fence into their yard.

809
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:23,360
 So the girl came around the chain link fence right to where her dad would be.

810
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:26,280
 The boy came around the chain link fence right to where the dad would be.

811
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,920
 I watched the dog turn into the yard by that chain link fence.

812
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,040
 I came around, there was no dog.

813
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:36,240
 I have no way to classify that story, but I will say this.

814
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,480
 I don't think we'll be talking about dogs for a while, but I hope you guys did enjoy

815
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,480
 that.

816
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,040
 That's a story that I hope you guys found interesting, both of those.

817
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,200
 I don't, you know what I mean?

818
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:52,520
 I feel like you guys have given me a gift by listening to this podcast and being part

819
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,160
 of the Dead Rabbit Radio family, being part of the Fluffle.

820
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,560
 And I don't ever want to abuse that.

821
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:01,400
 I don't ever want to just sit around and talk about myself because there's more interesting

822
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,400
 things to talk about.

823
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,200
 But because I talked about it so much on Friday's episode, I figured you guys, and I've

824
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,560
 mentioned it so many times on this podcast, I never told the Akita story.

825
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:15,320
 And in full, I told it on the Patreon Discord, and then I've never really told the vanishing

826
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,320
 dog story.

827
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,400
 I've told it to my friends and stuff like that.

828
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,800
 I don't want to ever take this show for granted and be like, "Oh, they'll listen to whatever

829
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,280
 gibberish I spout out."

830
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,360
 So I really do hope you guys enjoyed this.

831
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,520
 It's true crime, adjacent.

832
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,080
 And the second dog, I know, a Mandela effect.

833
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:34,680
 They fire up the CERN generator for the very first time, and that dog Mandela out of here.

834
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:35,680
 Who knows?

835
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,680
 I'll classify that second story.

836
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,640
 But I really do appreciate you guys.

837
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:43,600
 I really do appreciate you guys, and I hope you found this episode entertaining.
