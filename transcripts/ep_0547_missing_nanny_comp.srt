1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
 A man falls in love and goes to great lengths to prove it.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,840
 And then we travel to Spain to meet a family ready to get away for the weekend.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,840
 Little do they know what they're getting away to is an alternate reality today on Dead Rabbit

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,840
 Radio.

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:30,840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,840
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,840
 I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,760
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,760
 Just a heads up, you got today's episode, tomorrow's episode, then I'm taking a week

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,640
 off and taking a week off every 50 episodes and I enjoy it very, very much.

11
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,760
 I've been listening, I've actually gone to my Patreons and asked them for what their

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,480
 favorite episodes of Dead Rabbit Radio have been.

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,520
 We got five great episodes for reruns next week with brand new intros.

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,320
 I always like to give you guys a little behind the scenes.

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,840
 What happened before the episode, what happened after the episode.

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,000
 It's a really cool look.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,240
 I think it's a lot of fun for me and if I was a listener of a podcast, I would want

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,040
 to know that stuff too because I'm a big old nerd.

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,240
 I'm a big old nerd about stuff I love and I hope you guys enjoy all of that as well.

20
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,240
 Let's give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreons, Gottmaster Gray.

21
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,680
 Thank you to everyone, give a round of applause for this fellow.

22
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,920
 You're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

23
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,640
 Whatever vehicle we take, you're in charge of.

24
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,840
 If you can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

25
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,560
 Just help get the word out about the show.

26
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,520
 That helps out a lot and I see you guys are running you guys in the wild and you guys

27
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,600
 will be talking about the show and I just do a little smirk because I see you guys are

28
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,200
 spreading the word and that really, really means a lot.

29
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,040
 Gottmaster Gray, we're going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

30
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,720
 Let's go for a little road trip.

31
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,720
 Give us on out here.

32
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,760
 Basically our chauffeur, we're all sitting in the back smoking big Cuban cigars.

33
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,400
 He's like, "Oh, I want a cigar."

34
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,880
 He doesn't get one.

35
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,640
 We're driving out to La Palma, California and we get out of the car.

36
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,960
 We're like tipping Gottmaster Gray.

37
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,520
 We're like, "Here you go, sir.

38
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,520
 Keep the meter running."

39
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,360
 He's like, "No, Gottmaster, come out.

40
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,360
 We're going to give him a couple cigars."

41
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,720
 He can smoke for the rest of the story.

42
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,440
 We're in La Palma, California.

43
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,720
 It's November 2016.

44
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,800
 We're going to walk into this office complex.

45
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,200
 There's just normal people filling out paperwork, sitting little cubicles.

46
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,520
 You guys know what these places look like, right?

47
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:28,120
 Very drab, very gray, probably a catty calendar on someone's desk.

48
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,880
 Pretty standard stuff.

49
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,400
 There's a young woman sitting there.

50
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,640
 She's typing on her keyboard and stuff like that.

51
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,360
 She has a little office, a little cubicle office area.

52
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,200
 She has her water bottle, photo of me, probably, because who wouldn't?

53
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,200
 She has tea.

54
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,200
 She's always drinking tea.

55
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,080
 She's got a little bit of honey, that little honey bear thing.

56
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,080
 You scored it out of that little pointed hat on its head.

57
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,840
 Put a little honey in there.

58
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,840
 Drinking some tea.

59
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,160
 That's all she does.

60
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,160
 She types.

61
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,240
 She drinks tea.

62
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,080
 She has a water bottle and a photo of me.

63
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,000
 It's the best workplace ever.

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,720
 But often the shadows.

65
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,720
 Allegedly.

66
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,360
 The rest of this stuff, I have to say, is alleged because it involves criminal issues.

67
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,000
 But off-scolking in the shadows, the lightning strike.

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,920
 We see a silhouette.

69
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,760
 A silhouette in the shape of Steven's millen castro.

70
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,760
 [imitates lightning strike]

71
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,760
 I'm standing there.

72
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,880
 It's like, "Oh, if only I could have her.

73
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,160
 The woman who's not named because of the complaint.

74
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,640
 I will call her Janet."

75
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,280
 [imitates lightning strike]

76
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,400
 I don't know what her real name is, but we'll call her Janet.

77
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,840
 And Steven is sitting there.

78
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,200
 Wherever he walks, there's a shadow following him.

79
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,880
 He's like, "Hello, Janet.

80
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,880
 My name is Stevens."

81
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,480
 And they talk and stuff like that.

82
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,400
 And you talk to the silhouette in the corner.

83
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,680
 But she does.

84
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,000
 She doesn't actually know where the story is going to go.

85
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,040
 And at a certain point he asks her out.

86
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,840
 You know, pretty young girl is going to get asked out.

87
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,840
 And she goes, "No, no, I don't want to go out with you."

88
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,440
 She's probably a little more subtle than that because she added in the thing.

89
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,760
 You know, but we can be friends.

90
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,320
 We can hang out and stuff like that.

91
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,320
 Oh, awesome.

92
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,320
 Let's go check a cheese tomorrow.

93
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,320
 She's like, "Okay."

94
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:15,880
 I didn't really mean the friends thing either, but at work we will be cordial towards each

95
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,880
 other.

96
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,640
 She thinks that's kind of the end of it, right?

97
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,560
 But she starts to notice that Stevens is always staring at her.

98
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,160
 She's making her tea, staring at her.

99
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,160
 She's making photocopies.

100
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,160
 She's in the machine.

101
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,160
 He's staring up at her.

102
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,720
 She's like, "Oh."

103
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,240
 She gets the feeling that he's always watching her.

104
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,880
 And she goes, "This is kind of the way you're supposed to handle it."

105
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,360
 She goes up to him and she goes, "Hey, you know, it's kind of creepy.

106
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,320
 I don't know if she actually used to wear creepy, but basically she said, 'Could you

107
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,160
 please stop staring at me?'

108
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,920
 It's making me feel uncomfortable.

109
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,160
 Whenever you have these complaints, if you're not in danger, it's best to address it with

110
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,600
 the person first because they may not be aware of what they're doing.

111
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,800
 They may have some sort of awkward quirk."

112
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,280
 And they go, "Oh, I'm so sorry.

113
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,200
 Yeah, I didn't know that I was actually bugging you."

114
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,800
 And you just let it lie there because some people are doing it accidentally.

115
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,320
 But she said, "Hey, can you stop staring at me?"

116
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,960
 He's like, "Oh, yeah, yeah, totally."

117
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,960
 And she's walking away.

118
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,880
 He's like, "Oh, I'm going to stare at you so hard for that comment."

119
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,000
 He begins staring and just kind of being a nuisance around the workplace.

120
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,520
 She's addressed it with him and hasn't stopped.

121
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,280
 She goes to her boss and she goes, "Hey, listen, he's still kind of harassing me.

122
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,240
 Like he's constantly staring at me and stuff like that.

123
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,720
 I'm pretty sure I saw him inside the photocopy machine the other day."

124
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,640
 So the boss talks to him and says, "Hey, I got a complaint about your behavior.

125
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,280
 First off, we need to fix the lighting around your office because you just look like a silhouette,

126
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,160
 a Steven-shaped silhouette sitting here.

127
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,160
 Can you leave her alone?

128
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,160
 Leave Janet alone.

129
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,160
 I got a complaint about it.

130
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,160
 You need to leave her alone."

131
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,320
 Now that is, again, the second step.

132
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,760
 There's a process to this.

133
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,680
 Well, some time passes and she goes back to her boss and she's like, "It's not...

134
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,200
 If anything, it might be worse."

135
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,200
 He seems to be...

136
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,360
 I don't know how it's possible, but he's staring even harder now.

137
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,160
 He's not staring daggers into my back.

138
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,680
 They're broadswords.

139
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,120
 So at this point, the boss has to get HR involved and says, "Hey, listen, we got this guy staring

140
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,120
 at this woman."

141
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,560
 And really, that's all he's doing up to this point.

142
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,360
 That's making her feel uncomfortable.

143
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,720
 So HR has him go to sexual harassment training.

144
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,000
 Just sit down in a room, you watch a video, and it's like...

145
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,600
 And then Tom walks into the room and Sally says, "Don't.

146
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,600
 What did Tom do wrong?"

147
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,600
 And then, you know, it's like a half hour video.

148
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,720
 It's no big deal.

149
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,720
 That should have been the end of it.

150
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,160
 Really, when she said, "Hey, stop.

151
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,160
 Knock it off.

152
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,160
 That should have been the end of it."

153
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,000
 99% of rational people would be like, "Oh, I'm sorry.

154
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,840
 I didn't know I was staring so much."

155
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,840
 And you got the one...

156
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,840
 You have a bunch of weirdos around her.

157
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,840
 I'm not fair, unfortunately.

158
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,640
 So it had to go up the ladder.

159
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,240
 She didn't go to HR right away.

160
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,440
 She didn't make a big muck of it.

161
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,440
 She did the steps.

162
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,920
 She talked to him, then she talked to the boss, and then she talked to HR.

163
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,040
 That should have been the end of it, though.

164
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,760
 Sexual harassment training, all of this stuff.

165
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,760
 Not saying that that's the cure.

166
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,080
 I'm not saying that he's been in this 30-minute video.

167
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,880
 You're like, "I'm no longer weird."

168
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,880
 You're running through the streets.

169
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,880
 You're like, "Hey, everyone.

170
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,440
 I'm a totally normal human being now.

171
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,680
 I don't stare anymore."

172
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,160
 You're like, "What?"

173
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,720
 No, that's not what happened.

174
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,960
 So one day, what did we name this girl?

175
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,960
 Janet.

176
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,440
 One day, Janet goes into her little cubicle, and her water bottle is sitting there, and

177
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,320
 she's looking at it, and she goes, "Oh, that's weird.

178
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,320
 It looks cloudy.

179
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,960
 You know, normally water isn't cloudy.

180
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,040
 I don't live in Flint, Michigan, right?

181
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,920
 Normally water should just be see-through, but it's cloudy.

182
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,440
 She's like, "Ah, poison out."

183
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,440
 She gets rid of it.

184
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,440
 She didn't really think much of it.

185
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,440
 A little pin goes into her brain, but she didn't really think much of it.

186
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,440
 She pours it out.

187
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,440
 She has her tea anyways.

188
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,440
 She drinks her tea.

189
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,760
 A couple days later, a week later, whatever amount of time passes, she goes into her little

190
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,760
 cubicle.

191
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,160
 Her water bottle is cloudy again.

192
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,660
 A different water bottle.

193
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,660
 I'm assuming, right?

194
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,400
 She didn't just empty the water on it.

195
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,400
 She goes, "This is safe to drink."

196
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,600
 It's like a, you know, like a plastic bottle of water.

197
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,680
 She notices it's cloudy again.

198
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,680
 She's like, "Oh, great."

199
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,680
 She starts to get suspicious.

200
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,080
 She tells her boss about it.

201
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,080
 Suspicions.

202
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,560
 She's like, "You know, I'm coming into work.

203
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,560
 I think someone's putting something into my water."

204
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,560
 Boss is like, "Okay."

205
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,080
 I'm sure he was probably a little more concerned than that.

206
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,560
 It's like, "Well, it's Monday.

207
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,880
 It's put toxins into people's water day.

208
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,880
 Don't you know the rules here?"

209
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,720
 He goes, "Tell you what, you know, because we need, we, let's find out if this is what's

210
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,720
 going on.

211
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,240
 Let's find out if this is true or if you're just being paranoid or something like that."

212
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,400
 Again, I don't think he accused her of being paranoid, but let's put a hidden camera up

213
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,400
 in your little office.

214
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,400
 So she's sitting there.

215
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,440
 At this point, she's really no longer bringing water to work.

216
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,080
 I would assume not at least.

217
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,600
 She's drinking her tea.

218
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,120
 She's making her tea there.

219
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,400
 So she knows that that is safe.

220
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:47,080
 And then one day she goes in to her office and there is a milky white substance spread

221
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,440
 across her keyboard and her mouse.

222
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,720
 We know what this is, right?

223
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,760
 I mean, any adult would know exactly what this is.

224
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,320
 And it was probably what she says.

225
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,400
 She actually, she probably didn't suspect this was what was in the water bottle, but

226
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,960
 if you see it live in the wild, you know exactly what it is.

227
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,960
 She's looking at it.

228
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,680
 She's not touching it.

229
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,880
 She has like a little CSI toolkit.

230
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,880
 She's picking it up.

231
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,000
 She's touching a little Q-tip to it.

232
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,720
 She goes to her boss and she goes, "We need to review that camera because I'm pretty sure,

233
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,240
 not a scientist, but I am an adult.

234
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,480
 I'm pretty sure that's semen on my keyboard."

235
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:29,960
 Are you expecting, you're running like a call center or something, right?

236
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,880
 He thought it was weird enough he had to put up a secret camera in this woman's cubicle

237
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,760
 and now he's investigating semen deposits, right?

238
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,920
 He's like, "Oh man, it's not even semen Thursday.

239
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,200
 What crazy workplace is this?"

240
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,240
 So they start reviewing the video.

241
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,840
 So they're fast forwarding it.

242
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,840
 It's just like an empty cubicle.

243
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,240
 It's nothing.

244
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,000
 And then they see a movement.

245
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,080
 They hit pause and then they hit play and they see in slow motion, they see a slow motion

246
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,080
 blurry object.

247
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,080
 They start moving in.

248
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:08,160
 It's like paranormal activity.

249
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:15,640
 They see this figure take out like a tissue and begin to smear it on the keyboard and

250
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:22,360
 the mouse and then the figure turns very quickly and then they pause it, enhance it.

251
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,840
 You guys, they knew who it was.

252
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,840
 You know who it was.

253
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,680
 It was Stevens.

254
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:34,200
 Stevens was smearing semen on her keyboard and her mouse.

255
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,440
 The boss is like, "Wow, okay.

256
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,480
 We got to involve the authorities.

257
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,480
 This is beyond...

258
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,960
 I wasn't trained for this."

259
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,240
 So the cops come down and this is what the story is.

260
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,040
 So yes, well, allegedly.

261
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,920
 This semen Stevens was masturbating in the bathroom.

262
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,920
 Hopefully, right?

263
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,400
 He said his chemical.

264
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,640
 He was doing it.

265
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,920
 He was masturbating somewhere on the work premises.

266
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,760
 He's in the janitor's closet.

267
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,680
 And then he would take...

268
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,440
 First he was putting it in her water bottle.

269
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,960
 But then when she got rid of the water bottle, he began to smear it on her keyboard and her

270
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,460
 mouse.

271
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:21,760
 And little did she know that this whole time he wasn't just masturbating into her water

272
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,880
 bottle, not masturbating into it, that would be a feat of engineering.

273
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,000
 He was bringing it and dripping it in there.

274
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,880
 He was also putting it in her honey.

275
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,840
 So all that time, and she's like, "What?

276
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
 That water looks contaminated.

277
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,900
 It's time for some delicious honey infused tea."

278
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,960
 He was masturbating and then putting his semen in her honey.

279
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,280
 So he is facing some serious charges.

280
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,280
 He actually...

281
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,000
 Actually, I don't have to say allegedly.

282
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 He was found guilty.

283
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,880
 He was actually found guilty.

284
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,920
 This investigation took a while.

285
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,600
 Even these incidents took a while.

286
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,720
 So we had 2016 when this initially happened.

287
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,680
 He was just found guilty and he's...

288
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,680
 He hasn't been sentenced yet.

289
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,880
 He's going to be sentenced later this month.

290
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,660
 His defense...the prosecutors, the police and the prosecutors were like, "This was like

291
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,660
 a sex crime."

292
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,100
 Like this guy was obviously getting off on this.

293
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,660
 He's jacking off on people's stuff.

294
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,620
 I wonder if he was doing this to anyone else in the workplace too, but he's jacking off

295
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,540
 into people's stuff.

296
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,140
 This was a sex crime.

297
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,260
 Now his defense was like, "Your honor."

298
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:30,780
 Yes, our client is a big old weirdo, right?

299
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,780
 Total weirdo.

300
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:35,140
 He's using his own bodily fluids to get back at somebody for rejecting him.

301
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,160
 However, it wasn't sexual.

302
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,160
 It was not sexual.

303
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,120
 And the judge probably raised his eyebrow and goes, "Explain to me this avenue of defense.

304
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,840
 What do you mean masturbating is not sexual?"

305
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,080
 And they go, "This wasn't sexual, your honor.

306
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,960
 This was simply petty revenge."

307
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,640
 You see, he was afraid he wouldn't get the promotion because he had been reported to

308
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,600
 HR for sexual harassment.

309
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,760
 He was afraid he was up for a promotion and he would have gotten that promotion, sir.

310
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,860
 He would have totally gotten that promotion, but just because he was staring at somebody

311
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,340
 multiple times was still to stop.

312
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,820
 Wouldn't stop.

313
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,340
 That is why he got mad.

314
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:17,420
 He was afraid he wouldn't get promoted or he would get fired for being a big old weirdo.

315
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,500
 So he wasn't masturbating for sexual release.

316
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,500
 No, your honor.

317
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,140
 He was masturbating for revenge.

318
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,380
 Imagine Charles Bronson in "Death Wish."

319
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:30,020
 But instead of shooting gang members, the judge is like, "Okay, okay, I've heard enough.

320
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:33,920
 You're not going to ruin the movie "Death Wish" for me because that's my favorite movie.

321
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,520
 That's why I became a judge in the first place.

322
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,200
 It was this or shoot criminals in the street."

323
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,200
 So that didn't work.

324
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
 It didn't work, obviously.

325
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,080
 That's a terrible defense.

326
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,040
 He's facing two and a half years in prison.

327
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,040
 It's funny.

328
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,800
 I've been watching a ton of true crime stuff lately, a ton of it.

329
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,440
 And I hadn't been watching it for a long time.

330
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,240
 I've really been watching a lot of it.

331
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:59,840
 And I'm constantly amazed at how people do stupid stuff and then get thrown in prison.

332
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,060
 I don't understand.

333
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:08,300
 I mean, okay, I used to do stupid stuff too, but I didn't get caught doing it.

334
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,940
 That's the key component.

335
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:15,100
 And two, it was always a cost-benefit analysis thing, right?

336
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,540
 Like sure, I could engage in a fistfight with this person.

337
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,780
 How likely is it that this person is going to call the cops?

338
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,780
 They're punching me.

339
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,780
 They're punching me over and over again.

340
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,780
 I'm like, "Hmm, let me think.

341
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,500
 Should I punch this guy back?

342
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,500
 Let me see."

343
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,640
 If I punch this guy in the kidney, it won't kill him, right?

344
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,840
 It'll just hurt a lot and the fight will be over.

345
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,720
 And if I punch him multiple times in the liver, then it'll be over even sooner.

346
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,720
 At this point, they're kicking me.

347
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,520
 I'm like, "Hmm, but now I'm weighing the cons.

348
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,440
 You have to do a cost-benefits analysis with this stuff."

349
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,720
 This guy, what was his endgame?

350
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,720
 What was he thinking?

351
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:56,720
 Like, before I go and smash someone's car up with a baseball bat at 4 AM, I think, does

352
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,440
 this person know any police officers?

353
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,420
 Is this person a police officer?

354
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,620
 Am I at a police station?

355
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,540
 Is this a police car?

356
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,700
 You think, does this person have a lot of money?

357
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,380
 Does this person know anyone in a gang?

358
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:14,580
 Is there any way that I will get any blowback from this act?

359
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,580
 If yes, then really think a lot about it.

360
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:22,300
 If no, then just start smashing.

361
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,300
 And you have to do that.

362
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,700
 Again, I'm not a sex criminal, so I don't get that.

363
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,720
 I mean, maybe he was driven by some other force.

364
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,440
 I was just driven by wanting to smash things up real good.

365
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,440
 So I don't get it.

366
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,560
 That type of stuff is totally alien to me, but he had to carry the song.

367
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,240
 I mean, if he did it once, it's still awful, but he could have just done it once and never

368
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,240
 got caught.

369
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,000
 He kept escalating it.

370
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,160
 And that's what makes me think it was a sex crime.

371
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,780
 He kept escalating it.

372
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,960
 So don't be a big old sicko, but you're just like an average criminal.

373
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,260
 If you're like picking locks, breaking into...

374
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,820
 You can break into a shed.

375
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,820
 You'll be fine.

376
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:00,920
 I'm not taking legal advice from me, but breaking into a shed is a lot different than breaking

377
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:05,400
 into an occupied house or bank, which is federal.

378
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,800
 I don't know if I've ever told a story before, but I used to hang out with this dude who

379
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,320
 used to knock over liquor stores.

380
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,320
 And he told me...

381
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,320
 He did time for that.

382
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:19,000
 He did seven years for robbing liquor stores, but this is back in the 80s when he was doing

383
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 this stuff.

384
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,720
 He said he knew these dudes who used to knock over check cashing stores.

385
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
 And the way that they did that...

386
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,340
 I'm going to give you a bit of a tip here.

387
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:33,340
 I know this segment's running long, but the way that they did that was one guy would hold

388
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,340
 the door open.

389
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,660
 You know, cash checking stores have all that bulletproof glass.

390
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:43,220
 He goes, "Bulletproof glass is used to stop small arms, like pistols."

391
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,780
 He goes, "AK47 will tear right through most bulletproof glass.

392
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,780
 It's just not built for it."

393
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:52,780
 But he goes, "It's built to protect you from gunfire, but it's not built to protect you

394
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,260
 from a sledgehammer."

395
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,800
 So one guy would hold the door open.

396
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,000
 Imagine you're working at a check cashing place.

397
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Got master gray.

398
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,120
 Let's hop in the Jason Jalopy and go cash our checks.

399
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,520
 We're sitting in there and the door...

400
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:09,160
 Some guy holds the door open and then someone else runs in top speed holding a sledgehammer

401
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,280
 and they would smash the sledgehammer against the bulletproof glass.

402
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:17,040
 And he said the entire structure would disintegrate.

403
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,560
 He goes, "It was getting hit with so much force.

404
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,400
 It wasn't designed for this.

405
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,040
 It would just shatter."

406
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,300
 And he goes, "Everyone..."

407
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,300
 Now I'm thinking about it.

408
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,980
 Maybe he did this because he was quite detailed about it.

409
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,380
 He goes, "Everyone would think a bomb went off.

410
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,820
 It was so loud."

411
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,380
 Imagine you're sitting there and you have your back turned.

412
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,780
 You're typing something in or you're reading a magazine.

413
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:40,420
 All of a sudden you hear a boom and just glass shatters.

414
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,180
 Not even real glass, but...

415
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:46,660
 He goes, "They would jump over, rob the place and get out like in a minute or two.

416
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,300
 Super, super fast efficient robbery."

417
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,300
 He goes, "They were doing this all over the state.

418
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,200
 It was like Northern California they were doing this stuff."

419
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,840
 One day they go, "Hey, you know, we're making a lot of money hitting these check cashing

420
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,480
 places, but I bet you we can hit a ton of money hitting a bank."

421
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,840
 And they ran into a bank.

422
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,280
 I don't know if they did the sledgehammer trick in there.

423
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,280
 They're awaiting the line.

424
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,280
 The music...

425
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,280
 He's holding a sledgehammer.

426
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,360
 I don't know if they did it there, but they robbed a bank within a half hour.

427
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,880
 They were both caught and they ended up doing like 10, 15 years in federal prison.

428
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,480
 This is the cost-benefit analysis.

429
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,700
 Check cashing places are not federally insured.

430
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,660
 It was a local police crime.

431
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:29,700
 Banks are federally insured, so the FBI is on the case in minutes.

432
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,060
 You got federal officers looking for you.

433
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,860
 He goes, "Within a half hour they were caught."

434
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,420
 Before it was just cops were looking for him, but they couldn't find him and they're just

435
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:43,540
 like, "Oh, I guess that check cashing place just lost a bunch of money."

436
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:47,900
 Cost-benefit analysis, really the best cost is don't commit crime at all.

437
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:52,760
 Even young Jason knows better, so I'm not out beating people up anymore.

438
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,800
 Do you like that pause there?

439
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
 Got master great.

440
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,360
 Let's go ahead and hop in that carbon helicopter.

441
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,040
 We are headed out to Barcelona, Spain.

442
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:08,160
 I got a fight club going on in the back of the helicopter.

443
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,160
 Got master great.

444
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,160
 Puts it on autopilot.

445
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,160
 We're boxing.

446
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,160
 We're boxing.

447
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,160
 The helicopter lands.

448
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,160
 We're all bruised.

449
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,160
 We're all beat up.

450
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,380
 We're all jumping off the carbon helicopter.

451
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,700
 We're in Barcelona, Spain.

452
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,700
 It's Easter week.

453
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,700
 We're in the month of April, 1976.

454
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,100
 This is actually a perfect story for the carbon helicopter because we landed in airport.

455
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,780
 This actually takes place at Pratt Airport.

456
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,020
 And here we're going to meet a very well-to-do couple.

457
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:37,140
 They're getting ready to go on a vacation to the island of Mall Orca.

458
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:41,980
 So we'll call the dad, Joseph, the mother, Samantha, and then they have a nanny.

459
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,980
 We'll call her Margarita.

460
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:43,980
 Is that her name?

461
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,980
 Is that her name?

462
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,840
 Is that just a drink?

463
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,600
 We'll call her Margarita and then they have a little baby, a little toddler, and we'll

464
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,640
 call her Jonesy.

465
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,280
 So I forgot the dad's name.

466
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,280
 It doesn't matter.

467
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:03,560
 The dad goes, "Honey, Samantha, you stay here with the nanny and little Jonesy.

468
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,020
 I'm going to go buy the tickets.

469
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,440
 You stay in this waiting area."

470
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,920
 And the wife's like, "Okay, yeah.

471
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,960
 Go ahead, honey."

472
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,200
 So the husband walks off and buys the tickets.

473
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,160
 And you know, it's pretty busy weekend.

474
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,180
 And as he's walking back to the waiting area, he sees his wife just sitting there reading

475
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,180
 a magazine.

476
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,100
 He doesn't see the nanny or their baby girl.

477
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,940
 "Hey, where'd the nanny go?"

478
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,940
 He tells his wife.

479
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,740
 "Very brusque with his wife."

480
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,700
 "Yes, his wife.

481
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,180
 You know, I got the tickets.

482
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,300
 Where's Margarita and Jonesy?"

483
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,300
 Wife's like, "What?

484
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,300
 They're...

485
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,300
 They're...

486
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,300
 They're...

487
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,940
 She's looking around on the bench and they're gone."

488
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,580
 She goes, "She was sitting right here just like a minute ago."

489
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:44,840
 Like, literally a minute ago, like, I didn't even see her leave.

490
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,000
 And the dad is like, "It's kind of bizarre."

491
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,720
 But the wife's like, "She must have just gone to the restroom.

492
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,920
 Like, it couldn't really been anything.

493
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,840
 You don't really think anything in these first initial moments."

494
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,600
 But a little bit of time passes and the father goes, "You know what?

495
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,000
 We need to check the bathroom.

496
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,400
 Can you go in and check the bathroom?"

497
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:09,400
 So the mother goes in, "Jonesy, Margarita, we're going to the bathroom."

498
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,340
 They're like, "Man, can I have some privacy?"

499
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,840
 Just yelling out names.

500
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,140
 They're not in the bathroom.

501
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,380
 Now, at this point, she's starting to get panicked.

502
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,860
 At this point, any parent would get panicked.

503
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,220
 They walk up to airport security and they go, "Hey, listen, our daughter's missing."

504
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,780
 The last time she was seen was with our nanny.

505
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:31,100
 And we know her fairly well, but we're really, really concerned because they just disappeared.

506
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,100
 They're not here at all.

507
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,420
 So airport security starts looking around for them.

508
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,180
 They start calling over the PA.

509
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:44,040
 "Will Margarita and Jonesy please come up to gate A?"

510
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,280
 More time passes.

511
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,520
 Now this couple was very well off.

512
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,360
 So when they start to panic and they start to push on security, they're literally pushing

513
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,360
 them.

514
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,360
 They're like, "Where's my kid?

515
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,360
 Where's my kid?"

516
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,360
 Security's like, "Hey, stop it.

517
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,360
 Stop it."

518
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,360
 And pushing them.

519
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,920
 They begin to basically say, "You need to stop this airport.

520
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,180
 You need to ground all the flights because I need to know where my daughter is and the

521
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,180
 nanny."

522
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,340
 It's always a secondary concern because you really want your kid.

523
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:17,980
 The airport actually goes to the extraordinary measure of halting all flights.

524
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,980
 Now I'm sure it was just all flights out.

525
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,300
 I don't think there was a plane circling overhead.

526
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,300
 They're like, "Listen, the missing kid's not over here.

527
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,300
 From France."

528
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:30,020
 And the air traffic control's like, "Listen, we can't take any chances planes are running

529
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,020
 out of fuel."

530
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:35,040
 I'm pretty sure planes are still allowed to land, but they weren't letting planes go

531
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,540
 up.

532
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,540
 Crowdgatherers.

533
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,920
 Everyone's looking for this kid now because basically either you're concerned for the

534
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,900
 kid or you really want to get to your destination.

535
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,280
 So everyone's looking for this kid now.

536
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,660
 And eventually a giant group of people kind of surround the mother, consoling her.

537
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,660
 That's probably all they were doing.

538
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,100
 They were like, "So, did you watch television last night?

539
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,220
 What did you think of one day at a time?"

540
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,620
 Oh, that Schneider.

541
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,620
 He's so funny.

542
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,620
 What a crack up.

543
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,220
 No, I did not watch television last night.

544
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:06,460
 Eventually this old woman walks out of the crowd and she walks right up to the grieving

545
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:14,940
 mother and says, "Just pray for your daughter to return."

546
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,140
 That's not a bizarre thing to say when someone's grieving.

547
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,140
 Just pray.

548
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,640
 God will help you.

549
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,860
 Something about it strikes the grieving mother in a weird way.

550
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,740
 She turns to talk to the old lady.

551
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,780
 The old lady has now walked into the crowd and has vanished.

552
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,540
 She's not there.

553
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:38,860
 And then the mother, Samantha, turns back to the bench where she had previously been sitting

554
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:46,360
 with the nanny and sitting there on the bench is the nanny holding little Jonesy.

555
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,940
 The mom freaks out.

556
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,340
 She has this mixture of joy and just being really pissed off.

557
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:56,940
 She found her daughter, but she can't figure out what led to the sequence of events and

558
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:02,260
 she starts kind of tearing into the nanny and the nanny is puzzled.

559
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,300
 She goes, "What are you talking about?"

560
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,940
 They're like, "You disappeared."

561
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,940
 The father shows up.

562
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,940
 "Where were you?

563
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,940
 You disappeared."

564
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,940
 Everyone's getting back in lines.

565
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,900
 The planes are going to be able to take off now.

566
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,500
 You disappeared.

567
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,300
 We shut down the whole airport looking for Jonesy.

568
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,620
 Nanny goes, "I was sitting here the whole time.

569
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,620
 I never got up.

570
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:26,100
 I was sitting here the whole time and I had no idea what's going on."

571
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:31,980
 Now, at a certain point, you do want to question the sequence of events, but at the end of

572
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,820
 the day you have your child back.

573
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,860
 You can figure out the rest later.

574
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,740
 So the mom goes to take her child into her arms.

575
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,740
 Baby's totally calm.

576
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,660
 Wasn't freaking out or nothing about all this.

577
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:48,220
 The mom goes to pick up the little Jonesy and the nanny won't let go of the kid.

578
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,700
 Now the mom's getting really pissed off.

579
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,700
 "Give me my kid.

580
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,700
 Give me my kid."

581
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,180
 And the nanny goes, "I can't.

582
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,180
 I can't."

583
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,460
 And her hands are open.

584
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,220
 This toddler is laying in her arms.

585
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:04,380
 She's not gripping it or holding it in any tight fashion.

586
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,820
 She's stuck to the nanny.

587
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,860
 The mother continues to pull and pull and pull.

588
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,860
 She's sobbing at this point.

589
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,940
 I mean, "Nanny got a whole new other set of circumstances.

590
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,180
 You have to deal with it."

591
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,420
 The dad goes, "Enough.

592
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,420
 This, enough of this."

593
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:20,340
 And he goes to get his daughter out of the nanny's arms.

594
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,540
 The daughter stuck.

595
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:27,140
 He finally is able to get a good enough grip on little Jonesy.

596
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:33,500
 And I imagine put one of his foot on the bench that they're sitting on and "errrrgh!"

597
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,020
 Pull Jonesy.

598
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:40,940
 Literally tear her from the nanny's arms because they say, because the report said, that where

599
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,780
 her arms didn't have any clothing.

600
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:47,740
 So her bare forearms were holding on to Jonesy.

601
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,340
 There were red marks on her arms.

602
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:55,700
 As if someone had peeled off, then layer of flesh.

603
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,140
 Like a burn.

604
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,140
 For whatever reason.

605
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,420
 I think that should be the end of the holiday, right?

606
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,580
 That should be the end of it.

607
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,460
 They decide, "Listen, we have Jonesy back.

608
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:07,220
 Sorry that you have that weird alien third degree burn on your arm.

609
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,380
 We are going to go to Barcelona.

610
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,380
 We're gonna go.

611
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,380
 The planes are flying again."

612
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,180
 They get on their flight and everything's totally normal.

613
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:17,580
 Plane takes off, little Jonesy's doing little Jonesy stuff.

614
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,020
 About halfway through the flight, the nanny.

615
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,020
 "Ahhhhhhhh!"

616
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:29,100
 She's making ambulance noises.

617
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,660
 She's freaking out is what she's doing.

618
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,820
 I couldn't really portray that as well as I wanted to.

619
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,820
 She's freaking out.

620
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:39,780
 Now, not just like she's moaning and making ambulance noises, to the point that stewardesses

621
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,220
 have to try to calm her down and that doesn't work.

622
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,540
 They have to physically restrain her.

623
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,540
 She's fighting against them.

624
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,540
 "Ahhhhhhhh!"

625
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,540
 "Ahhhhhhhh!"

626
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,540
 And they're holding her down.

627
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,140
 They have to do that all the way to Barcelona.

628
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,300
 They don't turn the plane around.

629
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,300
 This is 1976.

630
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,780
 It would be a totally different story nowadays.

631
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,300
 Probably just shoot her.

632
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,860
 Have some air marshal put a bullet on the back of her head.

633
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:06,660
 They land the plane and she is at that point, that's like, "Okay, vacation's over."

634
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:14,620
 I don't know what happened with Jonesy and the nanny, but that was the icing on the cake.

635
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,620
 The nanny freaking out.

636
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:18,300
 So they actually get on another airplane, they sedate the nanny.

637
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:22,900
 They get on another airplane and they head back home to Barcelona, where they put the

638
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,540
 nanny in a hospital and they continue to sedate her.

639
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:29,580
 And at a certain point, doctors want to figure out what's going on.

640
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,780
 You have two mysteries here.

641
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:34,220
 One you have the mystery that she vanished into thin air and then reappeared and said

642
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,220
 nothing happened.

643
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,580
 Doctors don't really care about that.

644
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,580
 I'm sure they were curious.

645
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:40,900
 I'm sure they told their loved ones, "Now sit here on my knee, kid, and hear about the

646
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,780
 day the nanny disappeared."

647
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:47,740
 But they're there to cure whatever's going on now, which is her hysteria.

648
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,780
 She doesn't remember what happened on the plane.

649
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,140
 People are like, "You went crazy on the plane."

650
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,140
 She's like, "What?

651
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,140
 I don't remember that.

652
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,140
 I don't remember anything, really.

653
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,140
 I don't remember disappearing.

654
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,140
 I think they were making that up.

655
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,540
 I was sitting there the whole time and now they're saying, "I'm going crazy on a plane.

656
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,540
 I don't remember that."

657
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,420
 She undergoes hypnosis.

658
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,980
 This is what she remembers on the plane.

659
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:09,660
 She said she's sitting there next to her bosses, the father and the mother.

660
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:13,620
 She's sitting there and she hears a voice in her head.

661
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,380
 Come here.

662
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,340
 Come over here.

663
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,340
 Come on.

664
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,540
 You're looking around.

665
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,540
 Come here.

666
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:27,020
 Come to me.

667
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:36,100
 What she described was, "An unpleasant sounding male voice summoning her."

668
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:40,740
 She said, "While this is going on," she goes, "No one else was reacting to this voice.

669
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,740
 She's just sitting there.

670
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,580
 She feels herself getting panicked.

671
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:48,460
 She's hearing clearly this voice, this unpleasant sounding male voice."

672
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,460
 It's Stevens from the first story.

673
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,780
 He's sitting behind her.

674
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,940
 Want some honey?

675
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,140
 She's like, "Uh."

676
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,300
 She says that she's sitting on the plane.

677
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:03,460
 She's hearing this voice and then on the floorboard of the plane, she sees a little light appear,

678
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:13,380
 this red light.

679
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,740
 Glowing on the floor of the plane.

680
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:21,860
 Doctor goes, "Well, okay, then what do you remember?"

681
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:33,260
 And Margarita is under hypnosis and she's laying there.

682
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,740
 She starts screaming, "Goes into hysterics!"

683
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:41,060
 And they have to end the hypnosis session.

684
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:45,260
 Every time they try to press her to remember something beyond the red light appearing in

685
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:51,620
 the plane, she became hysterical and they had to shut the session down.

686
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:55,740
 This story came from a book written by Antonio Ribeira.

687
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:59,220
 He's considered the father of Spanish ufology.

688
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:06,180
 This is from a book called "Sucrestidos por extraterstias" or in English, "Kidnapped

689
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,660
 by extraterrestrials."

690
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:13,900
 It's possible, I think in 1976, or I think he wrote this book in the 80s, but I think

691
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:18,140
 when you didn't have a lot of different layers of the paranormal, if you only had to put

692
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:25,380
 stuff under religious miracle, demonic, UFOs, or cryptids, out of those four categories,

693
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,260
 the UFO would be the one that would fit.

694
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:34,460
 But I think we have such a more broad understanding of the paranormal world that this seems like

695
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:40,300
 a time-slip Mandela-effect alternate reality event.

696
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:44,740
 Where she actually went somewhere where the wife was just sitting on the bench next to

697
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:48,660
 her and they were waiting for the dad to come back with tickets and everything was going

698
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:52,620
 fine and she slipped into that reality out of our own.

699
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,700
 In our reality, she just disappeared.

700
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:00,780
 As far as how that plays with the red light, was she being summoned back to that reality?

701
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,780
 Who knows.

702
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:05,100
 The thing I like about this story, and it's something that I talk about a lot on this

703
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,580
 show but I can almost not talk enough about it, is that it's going to make you paranoid,

704
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:15,260
 that we have this idea that there are times we are safe and there are times that we are

705
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,760
 not.

706
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,900
 Spooky spooky graveyard, not safe.

707
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:24,260
 Sitting at home watching television with your family, safe.

708
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:27,980
 But the world of the paranormal, there is no "safe".

709
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:33,060
 We are taught rules that are supposed to keep us safe, but think about it.

710
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:37,420
 A demon that is older than the universe.

711
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:41,260
 A demon that existed before God created reality.

712
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:45,220
 Can be stopped by a circle of salt on the ground.

713
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:52,340
 Or that you can take sage, you can take an herb that evolved on the planet earth, that

714
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:59,500
 somehow going to protect you from something that fought angels in the war against heaven.

715
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,140
 That new God that probably was like, "Hey dude, what's up?

716
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,140
 Remember me?

717
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:06,420
 Like I used to be one of your angels and now I'm a demon."

718
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:12,860
 Your herb that you can buy at the witch store is going to protect you from something that's

719
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,900
 older than time itself.

720
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:20,220
 It doesn't make sense, we're constantly taught these things about being safe.

721
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:24,100
 All these stories we talk about aliens abducting people late at night, we've covered stories

722
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,940
 where people have been abducted in the middle of the day.

723
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:32,940
 This woman was sitting at an airport surrounded by hundreds of people, hundreds of witnesses,

724
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:37,900
 sitting right next to somebody and she vanished.

725
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,980
 Assuming this story is true, right, assuming this just isn't a work of fiction, assuming

726
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:46,820
 all this stuff is true, she simply vanished in front of everybody.

727
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:53,380
 The world of the paranormal, it's not normal, the word itself is next to normal, so normal

728
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,980
 rules don't apply.

729
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:02,620
 I know that my door will keep out bad elements, bad physical elements.

730
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:06,860
 And so we go, "I'm making a door of salt to keep out these evil spirits."

731
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,380
 It's not the same.

732
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,660
 It is 100% not the same.

733
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:15,580
 If a ghost can float through a door, why can't it float through salt?

734
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:18,900
 What about all the sodium in my body, right?

735
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,460
 Demons still possessing people.

736
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,540
 You're not safe when we talk about the world of the paranormal, when we talk about these

737
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:29,540
 extraordinary events, broad daylight, alien abductions, kids playing in their backyard

738
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:35,220
 attacked by multiple aliens, we covered that story, the Kosoblanka invasion.

739
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:39,660
 Kids playing soccer in a park in the Soviet Union, attacked by robots.

740
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,020
 It was like five in the afternoon.

741
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,980
 It doesn't matter who you're around, it doesn't matter how safe you feel.

742
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:51,700
 If the paranormal world wants to muck your reality up, it will.

743
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,700
 And it could be a fluke.

744
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,660
 You could happen to just walk through a portal and end up somewhere that you don't want

745
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,660
 to be.

746
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:04,180
 The fact that the red light and the voice was calling to her at the end makes me think

747
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:07,260
 that this was intentional.

748
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:10,180
 An obscure story, almost forgotten.

749
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,620
 I never heard of this story before.

750
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:16,440
 In 30 years of research, this happened the year I was born.

751
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,020
 Never ever heard this story before.

752
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:22,780
 This story I think should be up there with the man from Toured, but it's forgotten.

753
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,860
 It's not talked about at all.

754
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:29,580
 And it being obscure doesn't make it any less frightening.

755
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:34,020
 Actually, it makes it more frightening, because you wonder how many other stories are out

756
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:37,820
 there like this that we don't know about, or that we never had the opportunity to hear

757
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:38,820
 about.

758
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:42,260
 Because the only witness was the one who simply vanished.

759
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:45,340
 The world of the paranormal is not your friend.

760
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:48,300
 It's as friendly as a hurricane.

761
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,940
 Or a pack of wild chimpanzees.

762
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,140
 We study this stuff, we have fun looking into it.

763
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:56,500
 It's creepy stories to tell ourselves and tell others.

764
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,620
 We get little willies.

765
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:01,180
 But it's swimming with sharks.

766
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,700
 It is swimming with sharks.

767
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,900
 And the creepy thing about the world of paranormal is I can avoid hurricanes.

768
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,140
 I can avoid wild chimpanzees.

769
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:14,500
 I can avoid serial killers and grizzly bears and avalanches.

770
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,420
 But you can't avoid this.

771
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:20,260
 It gets you if it wants you.

772
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,620
 It can get you in your bed at night.

773
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,140
 It can crawl out of the back seat of your car.

774
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:27,020
 It can chase you as you're jogging down the street.

775
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:34,780
 And it can snatch you up when you're sitting in a room of a hundred witnesses.

776
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:44,420
 And your story may not have the "happy ending" of simply reappearing and going hysterical.

777
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:48,620
 Your story may end with you never being seen again.

778
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:55,940
 And although people would always try to find a rational reason for your disappearance,

779
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,820
 some would know the truth.

780
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:03,900
 Some of us know that the world of the paranormal is vicious, it's violent, and it's always

781
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:10,820
 looking for another victim.

782
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,340
