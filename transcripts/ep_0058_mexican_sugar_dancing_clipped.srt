1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 A horror movie who had more horror behind the scenes than in front of the camera.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,700
 And what exactly is Mexican sugar dancing?

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,200
 Today on Dead Rev. Radio.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:17,000
 [Music]

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rev. Radio.

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,700
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,800
 I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,200
 I hope you're having a great day too.

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,100
 I just finished watching Twin Peaks Season 3 about, I don't know, an hour ago.

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,900
 I will talk about it more when I digest it more.

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,200
 I'm a big fan of the original series.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,000
 I felt like this third season was the best of the three.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,800
 But to give any more feedback on that, I really need to kind of digest it.

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,200
 It's a heavy show if you've ever watched it.

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,000
 So we're gonna go ahead and get started otherwise.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 And I wanted to go ahead and get started on...

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,700
 Mexican sugar dancing.

18
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,600
 Now, Mexican sugar dancing is something that pops up on the iceberg conspiracy list.

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,000
 We've talked a lot about the iceberg conspiracy list.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 It's this main list of all these conspiracies.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,500
 As you go deeper down the iceberg, they get more obscure.

22
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,100
 Mexican sugar dancing is one that I've gotten requests on before.

23
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,000
 And it's an odd duck.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,400
 It was a weird one for me to research.

25
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,400
 And I have an opinion on it, but I'm gonna go ahead and go through everything that I found.

26
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,900
 So the first thing you find is when you type in Mexican sugar dancing,

27
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:30,100
 you find a couple of links to things like Urban Dictionary or Funny Junk,

28
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:34,000
 where they explain Mexican sugar dancing is this.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,300
 Mexican sugar dancing is where you take...

30
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,600
 I'm not... Okay.

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,900
 To be... I don't think...

32
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,000
 I don't want to give it away.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,500
 Okay, so Mexican sugar dancing is where you take two corpses, two dead people,

34
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,700
 and you make them dance.

35
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:56,900
 Like, so some of the explanations were they strung them up like marionette puppets

36
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,800
 and made them move around and like bumped them against each other to have sex.

37
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,100
 Like a kid would be doing with two dolls.

38
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,700
 Then the explanations became a little more elaborate,

39
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:12,500
 i.e. a little more, I got quote-unquote believable, where you take two corpses.

40
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,100
 I don't know.

41
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:13,800
 You still... Oh, no, no.

42
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,400
 Sometimes you can use one corpse, but anyway,

43
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,000
 you take two corpses and you electrify them and the bodies start moving

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,100
 because they're jerking around from the electricity and they dance that way as well.

45
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:28,200
 And then there's the third, even more ridiculous option, if you can believe that,

46
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,900
 where you take a corpse, electrify it so it moves,

47
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,900
 and then have sex with a electric corpse.

48
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,700
 Now, I think from that third one, you can already see some issues arising,

49
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:45,600
 i.e. being electrocuted yourself while having sex with a corpse.

50
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,500
 So, you know, this is when they popped up and I was like, "Ugh!"

51
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,500
 Like, I knew it was going to be a struggle to research

52
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,100
 because one of two things were going to happen.

53
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:59,700
 I was either going to find out it was true and see a bunch of footage of these

54
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:05,200
 bodies dancing around and people banging these bodies, which I didn't want to see.

55
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,200
 Or I was going to find out that it was absolutely false with nothing to back it up

56
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,900
 and it would be a waste of my time.

57
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,900
 The third option, I guess, is that it's fake, but it was interesting to research.

58
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,500
 And the other one was, I guess there's a fourth option.

59
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,400
 It was real, but it wasn't what we thought it was.

60
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,200
 So anyways, like I said, when I go into these conspiracy theories,

61
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,300
 I go in with the working idea that they're true.

62
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,300
 And so I started looking up Mexican sugar dancing.

63
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:38,500
 Now, it's interesting because I think on our "Golf Rumors" episode,

64
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,400
 I dated the conspiracy iceberg that I generally go off of.

65
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:50,800
 The one I could find the earliest mention of "Golf Rumors" was made in January of 2017, I believe.

66
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,900
 So it's fairly recent.

67
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,200
 It's a long time in internet time, but fairly recent.

68
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,200
 I found another "conspiracy iceberg" list.

69
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,400
 It's the same type of image, but it's all sexual acts.

70
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,900
 And this one was made back in...

71
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,500
 It was first posted, I should say.

72
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,300
 The earliest posting I could find of it was in March of 2015.

73
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,700
 And this was...

74
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:18,100
 It starts off with stuff, is stuff like phone sex and feeds and PIV,

75
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,600
 which means penis and vagina that needs its own terminology nowadays.

76
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,500
 And then you go down to, say, Femme Don or BDSM.

77
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,700
 I already know this video is getting adult filtered.

78
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:34,000
 You go down next lever, cuckold, and then another one, urethra sounding,

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,300
 which is real, I guess I should do an aside right now.

80
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:48,700
 That is where a man takes a metal rod, sticks it, or has someone else do it,

81
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:55,500
 sticks it into their urethra, and then they hit it.

82
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:02,400
 The small hammer, like a tuning fork inside your dick.

83
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,700
 I've seen those videos.

84
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,800
 I do not want to do an episode on that.

85
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,100
 Anyways, we keep going down this list.

86
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:15,600
 The last part of the list is things like floor tiles, obese, concrete enemas,

87
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,800
 genital mutilation, unbirthing, and Mexican sugar dancing.

88
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,300
 Now, some of those I am familiar with, obese is just feeder sex,

89
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,700
 or just sex with half people in general, I guess.

90
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,200
 Concrete enemas is where it's what it sounds.

91
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,900
 You inject concrete into your stomach, or, you know, up into your digestive tract,

92
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,200
 and it hardens, and you can actually survive the process, but you feel really full.

93
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,800
 Genital mutilation is disgusting and unbirthing.

94
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,200
 I've actually heard of that before as well.

95
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,200
 I think you crawl into it.

96
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,000
 I don't remember.

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,200
 I don't remember, but I'll have to look into that.

98
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,400
 But anyway, floor tiles is people who get sexually aroused by floor tiles.

99
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,600
 I'm getting off topic.

100
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,400
 Mexican sugar dancing is also on this list.

101
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,800
 So this was the earliest reference I could find to Mexican sugar dancing.

102
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,400
 Now floor tiles are real.

103
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,000
 I mean, not floor tiles probably are real because it's a fetish.

104
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,200
 Concrete enemas, I've seen the x-rays, the footage of that.

105
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,400
 It could be fake, but we'll assume that's real.

106
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,600
 I'm sure it kills some people.

107
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,700
 Genital mutilation, obviously real.

108
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,700
 Unbirthing, I've heard that term before.

109
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,800
 So Mexican sugar dancing.

110
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,600
 So what's interesting is that on this list of these five things,

111
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,000
 and actually everything on this list is real.

112
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,600
 Somebody does this stuff.

113
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
 But, so Mexican sugar dancing.

114
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,600
 So again, now I'm like, okay, so this is the earliest reference I have to it,

115
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,200
 but it's simply just a phrase.

116
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,800
 And again, with these icebergs, we don't know who made them.

117
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,200
 We're never able to get like an author on it.

118
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,000
 Actually, I might be able to track this author down,

119
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,800
 but we're going to table that for a second.

120
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,100
 So the question is, what is Mexican sugar dancing?

121
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:49,000
 Now in March of 2015 is the first time that I'm able to see this online,

122
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 at least like on the Surface web.

123
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,100
 Okay, so that conspiracy iceberg is from 2015.

124
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,600
 The very first, the very first reference I could find,

125
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:03,200
 in regards to Mexican sugar dancing being anything other than just that phrase,

126
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,700
 was on a, I believe, a French video gaming website.

127
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,300
 So this was in April of 2015.

128
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,700
 Someone posted the subject, Mexican sugar dancing.

129
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,500
 The first response is sexual relationship with a skeleton,

130
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,900
 question mark, scat, question mark, the enigma remains.

131
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:27,700
 From that post, the legend grew that this is what Mexican sugar dancing was.

132
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,800
 And I think it's interesting to think that either,

133
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,500
 because this person simply asked him a question,

134
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,600
 is it sex with a skeleton?

135
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,700
 Because you think Mexican sugar skulls dancing, blah, blah, blah.

136
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,000
 From this simple question, this myth grew that now people say,

137
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 oh no, I know what that is.

138
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,600
 I went on the deep web and I found out Mexican sugar dancing is dancing with,

139
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,800
 or having sex with an electrified corpse.

140
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,500
 So it's interesting again to see how these myths grow.

141
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,300
 It went from being just someone put it on an iceberg of sexual phrases.

142
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,600
 It became someone asking the question, what is it?

143
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,400
 Is it sex with a skeleton?

144
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,900
 And now on Urban Dictionary, and a lot of times when you see this brought up on

145
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,100
 Reddit or 4chan, they'll be like, oh, I know what it is.

146
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,000
 It's, it's this.

147
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,500
 It's, you know, dancing corpses.

148
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,100
 And again, even that myth evolves.

149
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,800
 Like, it's like we have, how we saw golf rumors in the myth evolve.

150
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,000
 But I still wasn't satisfied because I'm thinking,

151
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,100
 maybe there is something more to this.

152
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,600
 Then I was like, aha.

153
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,200
 I had my aha moment.

154
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,600
 What's another name for Mexican sugar?

155
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,200
 Agave.

156
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,400
 So I did a bunch of research on agave.

157
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,600
 Dead end.

158
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:38,700
 I started researching the county where agave, the parts of Mexico where agave comes from

159
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:43,600
 for any sort of weird sexual perversions strike.

160
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,800
 I began to research whether or not you could torture somebody with an agave plant.

161
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,100
 You can.

162
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,300
 And I'm sure people have, but they're actually very valuable for food and stuff like that.

163
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,100
 It's very thorny.

164
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:59,400
 I want to want one pushed up my butthole, but I don't know if that, again, that may work

165
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,900
 in another context, but this phrase was on a sexual, like how many, how deep are you

166
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,100
 sexually list?

167
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,800
 So I was like, okay, now I'm going too far down the rat, quote unquote rabbit hole.

168
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,500
 And I'm looking at like real conspiracies.

169
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,000
 I have to remember this is like a sexual thing.

170
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 And I kept looking around and then I came across.

171
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,600
 I was looking, I was looking through like old textbooks.

172
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,800
 I was okay.

173
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,300
 I won't.

174
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:25,600
 Okay.

175
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,300
 So I was looking, I was doing some deep research on this stuff, even though at this point I'm

176
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,200
 like, this is, I think this is completely fake.

177
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,000
 I'm almost 99%, but I figured keep doing the research.

178
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,700
 Jason might stumble across something.

179
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:42,100
 Then I found out that Agave is actually the name of a character from Greek mythology who

180
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:48,600
 is known for engaging in lesbian sex, her son finding out and them killing the boy and

181
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,900
 the mother Agave herself mutilating the body.

182
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,900
 So that brings us back full circle.

183
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,100
 That may be how the term Mexican sugar dancing came about in the first place pulling from

184
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,300
 the old Greek mythology.

185
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,800
 I don't know, but I was like, okay, so I'm back to square one.

186
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,800
 I'm back to sex and violence and death.

187
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,300
 I don't hear this is the interesting thing about this.

188
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,800
 I don't think it was true.

189
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:18,100
 I think before that post in March, 2015 and then the follow up posts on a completely different

190
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:24,400
 forum, the first post I could find the one from March, 2015 was on a Malaysian online

191
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,400
 community website.

192
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,800
 That's the first time I saw and we may be able to find an earlier iceberg, but this

193
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,800
 was the earliest that I can find the April, 2015 first reference of having sex with a

194
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,600
 skeleton is on a French gaming website.

195
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,900
 So myths just travel around the world.

196
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:49,300
 I don't think that this was true before March, April, 2015, but I think in the meantime,

197
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,600
 somebody has probably tried it out.

198
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,800
 People have probably made marionettes out of dead people and stuff like that.

199
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,200
 People have tried reanimating corpses of electricity, but the idea of it being some sort of sexual

200
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,600
 act is what would make this different.

201
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,400
 Having a little bill and Judy show or as a punch and Judy show with dead bodies, I'm

202
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,300
 sure that's been done a hundred times before, but to do it for sexual gratification is what

203
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,300
 this is referencing.

204
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,900
 And it may have been done before in history.

205
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,600
 I'm sure it has, but this is the kind of thing it wasn't referred to as Mexican sugar

206
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
 dancing.

207
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,800
 If someone did it today, there's some creep out there who has two people in their bodies

208
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,600
 and he's like dancing them around and having sex with them.

209
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,560
 He's calling it Mexican sugar dancing.

210
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,440
 That's when the myth becomes real.

211
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,400
 These little comments have basically named something that was unnamed before.

212
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:44,600
 It may have been named scientifically like puppeterious, necrophilius, electrophicus,

213
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:51,680
 I don't know, but it being named in the culture, now it's real.

214
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,600
 So yeah, that's I think where we stand with Mexican sugar dancing.

215
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,880
 I think that it wasn't a thing.

216
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:03,160
 This might sound a little confusing, but I think it was a thing that was unnamed that

217
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,160
 a couple of freaks did throughout history.

218
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,780
 And now it has an official name and the myth is grown around it.

219
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:15,360
 And there's probably more than more than a few people that would make you feel comfortable

220
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,460
 who are masturbating to the thought of doing their own Mexican sugar dancing.

221
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:25,080
 Now that it has a name, now that it's in their consciousness, now that this is a thing, they're

222
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,760
 like, oh yeah, I can't wait to do that.

223
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,360
 Oh, I don't know why simulation orgasm over the podcast.

224
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,920
 I think you get the point.

225
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,600
 So yeah, I think that's where we stand on this rumor or fake phrase, maybe turns into

226
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:48,200
 rumor turns into people fearing it is real and then people making it real.

227
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:54,200
 And I think that's another interesting side of modern mythology is how it evolves like

228
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,200
 that.

229
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,200
 Hey, cool.

230
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:24,560
 Okay, so now we're going to switch gears to a, I can't say it's a happier story because

231
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,240
 it's actually more tragic because it's 100% real.

232
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,280
 There was a movie that I saw last year.

233
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,280
 I just saw it on a whim.

234
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,240
 Now a lot of times I'll start watching a movie and I'll be doing something else.

235
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,480
 I'll be reading or be writing or something like that.

236
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:45,040
 I put this movie in and I started reading some news articles and the first 10 minutes

237
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,760
 is just the monologue with all these weird visuals.

238
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:54,120
 And I was like, what a, what a, what a pretentious monologue the character is using in all these

239
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,120
 $3 words.

240
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,760
 And I was like, it's a little overwritten.

241
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,120
 The visuals, I kept catching them out of the corner of my eye.

242
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,080
 The visuals just kind of started shocking me.

243
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,280
 Very, very well done visual.

244
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:11,760
 And about 10 minutes in, I realized I needed to stop reading, to rewind the movie and to

245
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,640
 watch it from beginning to end.

246
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,880
 And that movie is called the evil within.

247
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,520
 It's not based on the video game.

248
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:24,080
 It is a extremely, I shouldn't say extremely, but it is a cult.

249
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,360
 Cult movie without a following.

250
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:33,120
 I guess I should say critics have said if Tommy Wiseau and David Lynch made a movie

251
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,200
 together, it would be the evil within this movie came out of nowhere.

252
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,200
 Okay.

253
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,400
 So the evil within it's, it's a, it's a fairly basic horror movie plot wise.

254
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,040
 A young man lives in a house.

255
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,960
 There's a haunted mirror that is put into his bedroom and a demon begins to communicate

256
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,960
 with him through the mirror.

257
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,960
 Movie was, I think, shop for like maybe like three to $5 million is very low budget.

258
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,760
 It's very helpful when you have one actor playing multiple parts.

259
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,960
 Obviously, he's the good guy and the bad demon in the mirror because it's a reflection.

260
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,400
 And the story is about him trying to overcome this demon in the mirror.

261
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,360
 Those type of stories, those type of movies are diamond as in what makes this one interesting

262
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,360
 is for several reasons.

263
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,720
 One, what the movie is really about and the story behind it.

264
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,320
 So the hero of the movie.

265
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,040
 I can't believe I used that word.

266
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,240
 The, he's not even protagonist.

267
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,920
 The main character in the movie, he's, it starts off giving this huge monologue about

268
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,280
 dreams and the nature of dreams.

269
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,760
 Like I said, he's using these $3 words.

270
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,680
 He's just really, it's very overwrought.

271
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,120
 He's talking about all these dreams he had.

272
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,040
 And then he begins in the real world, but he's still dreaming.

273
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,800
 The movie goes on for another 15 minutes of this monologue full of stop motion monster

274
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,800
 effects.

275
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,040
 It gets really nightmarish.

276
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,680
 And then he delivers the first of many twists.

277
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,760
 He said, well, that's my monologue.

278
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,760
 You're going to hear my real voice now and you might have to get used to it.

279
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,800
 And then we realize when he's not monologuing, he is a severely mentally disabled man.

280
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,960
 And so he's basically playing three characters.

281
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,540
 He's playing the monologue.

282
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,640
 He's playing this mentally disabled kid and he's playing the demon in the mirror.

283
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,800
 And that's why he can't just move the mirror out of his room.

284
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,000
 He's trapped there.

285
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,440
 His older brother's there.

286
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,000
 His older brother's his caretaker.

287
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,320
 This goes on and on.

288
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:26,320
 And the demon starts to tell the boy, the mentally disabled boy, you're not really mentally

289
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,320
 disabled.

290
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,520
 See, you need to evolve.

291
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,680
 You need to evolve.

292
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,240
 And the way to evolve is to prove to people that you're smarter, that you've realized

293
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,960
 the rules of the game.

294
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,680
 We eat animals, right?

295
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,360
 So that means it's okay to kill animals.

296
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,360
 Everybody does it.

297
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,860
 Even kids kill animals.

298
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,860
 They know the rules.

299
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,860
 You don't.

300
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,920
 You need to go out and kill a dog.

301
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,080
 And the mirror is constantly upping this game.

302
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:02,240
 And the whole time you're watching this movie, you're thinking, where is this going?

303
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,800
 And as I'm watching it, I'm about, the first time I'm watching it, I was maybe an hour

304
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:11,560
 into it and I was on the edge of my seat and I thought at that point, I go, this, at this

305
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,720
 point, it is all about the ending.

306
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:20,100
 Like this movie can stick the ending.

307
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,220
 It is so flat out bizarre.

308
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,740
 It truly is like David Lynch made a terrible film because that's what's interesting about

309
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,740
 it too.

310
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:33,740
 There's a whole lot of flaws in the, there's weird dead ends.

311
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,820
 There's a point to where two people, they go to this, the same restaurant over and over

312
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,260
 again because the movie is so low budget.

313
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:45,560
 They only had one set and it's like an outdoor park and they go there and it's the same extras,

314
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,640
 but one time they go there and everyone's different and they even go, hey, none of the

315
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,840
 same people are here that were here last time.

316
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,680
 And it makes you think, is it because of the events that Dennis, the kid is doing or was

317
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,320
 it because the director couldn't find the original cast?

318
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,960
 I'm not going to spoil the movie anymore for you, other than to say it is a great horror

319
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:12,900
 movie both on the levels of a twisting plot, great special effects and the fact that it

320
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:18,780
 is so amateurish that it is like watching someone else's dream.

321
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,540
 So let's go to the behind the scenes story.

322
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:24,980
 So this movie took 14 years to make.

323
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:32,700
 It was made by Andrew Getty, heir to the Getty Oil Fortune and a horrible, horrible

324
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,700
 method.

325
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:42,600
 Now he believed, he believed that dreams were stories told by somebody else to you while

326
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,000
 you slept.

327
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,560
 And that is also the trauma that Dennis is going through in the movie.

328
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,440
 Dennis says, I can't make up my own dreams.

329
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,960
 It's impossible because you can't tell a joke without seeing the punchline coming, right?

330
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,080
 So how can you have a dream that is so scary?

331
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,620
 It scares you if you're the one making it up because you know the ending.

332
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,100
 You know that you're making it up.

333
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,100
 So how can it scare you?

334
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:13,780
 The only way for you to have a nightmare that truly scares you is for somebody else to tell

335
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,100
 you that nightmare.

336
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:20,140
 So that's kind of the thought process that runs through the movie.

337
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,860
 It's all about dreams and nightmares.

338
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,020
 And I will tell you this right now.

339
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,740
 The whole movie is not just a dream.

340
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,140
 That was one of my worries as I was watching it.

341
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:31,720
 It hangs very much in the world of dreams and nightmares and what is reality.

342
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,520
 But it is not a trick ending at all.

343
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,720
 It totally sticks the ending.

344
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,720
 You can tell the enthusiasm in my voice is here much more than Mexican sugar dancing.

345
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,760
 I know a ton about agave plants now.

346
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,760
 I don't even drink a tequila.

347
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,040
 Andrew Getty was a meth addict and a millionaire.

348
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:54,600
 And ever since he was a kid, he was tormented, tormented by these horrible nightmares.

349
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:01,260
 So back I believe in like 2004, he started shooting this movie called The Storyteller.

350
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,380
 And it took about a year or two to shoot.

351
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,500
 Pretty basic shoot in the beginning.

352
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:12,220
 But he spent the next 12 years working on the editing, the stop motion.

353
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,540
 He would sit in his mansion.

354
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:19,220
 He turned a part of his mansion into a recording like a production booth.

355
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,540
 He was burning through his available cash.

356
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,660
 They said he was eating cereal like the producer would come over and he's like, "Yeah, I'm

357
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,800
 just eating cereal for like two weeks straight."

358
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,160
 Part of that was the fact that he was spending all of his time and money on the movie.

359
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,600
 The other part of the fact he was spending all of his time and money on meth as well.

360
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,760
 And so I can't imagine being a meth addict for one, but also to be a meth addict and

361
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,880
 being like, "Time to edit my horror movie.

362
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,440
 Time to delve into my childhood trauma about how horrible nightmares are."

363
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,720
 And that's how he was spending his life.

364
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,080
 So he had all of his money.

365
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,780
 And so he was hiring people to do it, experts to do it.

366
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,300
 He had people on.

367
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,540
 He had Sean Patrick Flannery was in it.

368
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,540
 He was the older brother.

369
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,540
 He had Dina Meyer.

370
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,180
 She was dizzy from Starship Troopers.

371
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,180
 She was in it.

372
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,820
 But as the movie kept going on, so they filmed the original movie, but he kept tweaking with

373
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:12,380
 it, doing more special effects, writing new scenes, people started dropping out.

374
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,380
 A couple of the cast members died in the 14 years.

375
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,340
 And that's why I think the scene when they're sitting in the restaurant, they go, "None of

376
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,780
 these people have been here before.

377
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,940
 These are all new people."

378
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:25,120
 I think it's the fact that he couldn't find those people again and he just wrote it into

379
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,120
 the script.

380
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,080
 It works brilliantly, not that particular scene.

381
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,800
 Because some of the stuff is really just wooden, but the only two people who stayed

382
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,680
 with the movie from beginning to end was the star, Frederick Kohler and Michael Berryman.

383
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,040
 Michael Berryman's a famous horror movie actor.

384
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,480
 He's the guy from The Hills Have Eyes.

385
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,040
 He looks like a monster, stuff like that.

386
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,240
 This guy was tortured over this movie, Andrew Getty.

387
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,800
 He was tortured over this movie.

388
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,160
 He was working on it.

389
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,500
 So he's working on this movie.

390
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:53,740
 Andrew Getty is trapped and tortured working on this bizarre horror movie, constantly doing

391
00:21:53,740 --> 00:22:00,060
 reshoots, working on the stop motion effects and injecting meth this whole time.

392
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:04,700
 And what's interesting is you know that this movie was about the fears of his life and he

393
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,580
 was still felt driven to make this.

394
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:15,460
 And then in 2015, he began having stomach pains and finally in March 2015, which weird

395
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:20,240
 coincidence is the same month that the Mexican sugar dancing meme started.

396
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,240
 Didn't realize that.

397
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,280
 He bled to death in his stomach and died.

398
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,080
 The movie wasn't finished.

399
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:34,240
 And so what happened was the producer got together and realized, okay, what do we need

400
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,240
 to do?

401
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,160
 Because this was this guy's passion project.

402
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,080
 So the producer actually finished the movie for him.

403
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,680
 It's like, you know, this movie needs to be seen.

404
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,920
 This was the thing he worked on.

405
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,920
 They finished the movie.

406
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,260
 It was called The Storyteller.

407
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,660
 They sold it to a distributor.

408
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:51,900
 They renamed it to the evil within, which is generic as that title that as that is, it's

409
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,140
 much better than the storyteller.

410
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,860
 And they released it and it just disappeared.

411
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,780
 As far as I know, it's still not available on Netflix.

412
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,980
 It just kind of came out.

413
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,840
 It was no wide release.

414
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,740
 But the reviews, there's tons of articles about this movie and the reviews are like,

415
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,880
 it's a mess, but it's a beautiful mess.

416
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,540
 I had as much fun researching it as I did watching the movie.

417
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:17,520
 This movie is completely amateurish, but it shows such a level of genius.

418
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,440
 We wish this guy could have stayed alive.

419
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,880
 And of course, the review, if Tommy Wiseau and David Lynch directed a movie together,

420
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,440
 it would be the evil within, which is 100% accurate.

421
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,320
 I definitely recommend watching this movie, the evil within.

422
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:36,480
 I think that the story behind it adds to the tragedy because basically you're watching

423
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:44,220
 a man's waking nightmares and then you're watching a man's obsessions 14 years on one

424
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,780
 project.

425
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:50,060
 That's insane, but he kept working on it.

426
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:56,500
 And you just have to wonder what was going through his head as he was watching his own

427
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:03,020
 visions on screen only to die alone in a bathroom.

428
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:10,720
 Like the age of 47, the drugs eating at him, the terror is eating at him.

429
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:18,840
 He's working on this project that is all about terror and he dies alone.

430
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:25,040
 The good thing is, is the movie was released and it's found a small fan base, but I think

431
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,280
 it will find a bigger fan base as more people watch it, as more people find it.

432
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:34,980
 So I highly recommend watching the movie, the evil within.

433
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:44,940
 And it's just sad to think of what could have been, because I definitely think he had some,

434
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,940
 he was definitely a great visual director.

435
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:53,900
 He wasn't amateur, it was his first film.

436
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,020
 Take care of yourself guys.

437
00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:01,120
 And do unhealthy things.

438
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:06,240
 Don't do unhealthy things.
