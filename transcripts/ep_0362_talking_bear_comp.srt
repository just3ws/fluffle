1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,740
 A couple has a mysterious experience camping in the woods.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:12,260
 And then we travel back to the 1890s where America has been plagued with UFO sightings.

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,760
 But they weren't your typical UFOs.

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:20,200
 These things were known as airships, big old blimps from another planet.

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,140
 If you think that's ridiculous, there's a story that one of them crashed in Texas and

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,360
 the alien pilot may be buried in the local cemetery today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:38,120
 [MUSIC]

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,960
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,800
 I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,680
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,280
 It's the new year, it's New Year's.

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,020
 You're probably listening to this if you're quick on New Year's Eve, but

14
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,320
 most of you are gonna be listening to this on January 1st,

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,960
 2020, the most futuristic sounding year since the year 2000.

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,280
 We are in a new decade.

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,280
 We're in, my God, all the newspapers tomorrow or today depends on when you're

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,360
 listening to this or a couple days from now if you listen to the future.

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,360
 All the headlines tomorrow, I'm gonna make a prediction.

20
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,640
 They're gonna say the Roaring 20s.

21
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,960
 They're gonna be able to pronounce the word Roaring, Roaring, right?

22
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,960
 It's my speech impediment coming out.

23
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,360
 The Roaring 20s, all the headlines tomorrow are gonna say that.

24
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,520
 But hopefully it is, hopefully the 20s is the decade that everything gets back on

25
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,440
 track because you whippersnappers, you don't remember what things were like

26
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,040
 before 9/11.

27
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,160
 It was awesome.

28
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,160
 It was totally awesome.

29
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,080
 This past 20 years has been kind of rough.

30
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:47,400
 But dude, September 10th, 2001, it was pretty dope.

31
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,880
 All that stuff that was happening before that, you could have an entire generation

32
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,320
 of people who just go, "Eh, whatever."

33
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,320
 Which was the greatest generation.

34
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,560
 Of course, Generation X.

35
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,720
 Yeah, I feel bad for you guys.

36
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:06,440
 But anyways, hopefully the 2020s, the Roaring 20s is a time of great prosperity

37
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,880
 and peace all across the land.

38
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,880
 And also, I'm sick.

39
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,280
 There's not a good way for me to start the new year, but it doesn't matter if I have

40
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,440
 to have a little bit of illness to start off the new year so the world will be at peace.

41
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,440
 I won't take that.

42
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,120
 But I have to have a touch of the flu so I can bring about peace to all man.

43
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,000
 I'm willing to make that sacrifice.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,160
 Let's go ahead and move on to our first story before the illness completely takes over my

45
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,840
 body and I become a living embodiment of the Musenix man.

46
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,240
 Because honestly, I'm not far off already.

47
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,840
 Our first story was actually sent to me by Scary Man Esquire.

48
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,080
 I always appreciate suggestions and I definitely appreciate suggestions when they're this

49
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,080
 weird when they're totally this bizarre.

50
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,680
 So thanks Scary Man for sending me this.

51
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,800
 Scary Man's been listening to the show for a long time.

52
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,600
 We're going to Pierce County, Washington.

53
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,000
 Let's hop in the Jason Jalopy.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,760
 We haven't used this in a while.

55
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,800
 Our best mode of road transportation.

56
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
 Hop on in.

57
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,000
 We're watching copyrights right now for that.

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,840
 They've been watching my channel, dude.

59
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,600
 I got hit real hard when I did that Christmas song.

60
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,520
 We're driving through Oregon.

61
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,720
 We're going to go up into Washington.

62
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,640
 We're going to go to Pierce County, Washington.

63
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,160
 It's about in the middle of the state.

64
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,640
 Now if you're not familiar with the Pacific Northwest, it is the hub of Bigfoot activity.

65
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,480
 You got a lot in California and then you have like Swamp Apes in the South and of course

66
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,360
 the Yeti and the Malaise stuff like that.

67
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:36,640
 But Bigfoot, actual like Bigfoot trademark, that name is the Pacific Northwest.

68
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,940
 We own that, dude.

69
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,480
 So the fact that we're up in the Pacific Northwest and you have reports of Bigfoot,

70
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,440
 that's not anything unusual.

71
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:50,200
 I mean, it's unusual as far as any science or rational thought is.

72
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,360
 But as far as the paranormal goes, that's where you would expect to find these things.

73
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,880
 We have a story from 2005.

74
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,040
 This couple is camping in the woods.

75
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,040
 They hear, "Ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh."

76
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:05,200
 And they're like, "What in the world is that noise?"

77
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,120
 Now the noise I'm doing, it's 10 times louder.

78
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,720
 The woman said it was so loud it felt like it was going to knock her off of her heels.

79
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,880
 It was like this shockwave coming at her.

80
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,880
 Her husband was a hunter.

81
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,920
 He grew up in the area and never heard the sound before.

82
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,080
 She's freaking out.

83
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,200
 And she's like, "Let's leave."

84
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,640
 And the dude's like, "No, we're good.

85
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,640
 We're good.

86
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,640
 We'll stay the night."

87
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,800
 So all night long, "Ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh."

88
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,640
 I wouldn't stay in my living room if I heard that noise.

89
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,360
 I don't think I would stay on like a heavily armored military base if I heard that noise

90
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,360
 anywhere near me.

91
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,600
 And that night they hear a bunch of pots and pans.

92
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,760
 "Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam."

93
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,760
 Okay.

94
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,080
 To be fair, they're pots and pans.

95
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,880
 These are pots and pans the campers brought with them.

96
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:51,480
 It wasn't like this mysterious noise also had a bunch of dishes and stuff like that.

97
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,160
 He's like, "Oh, they don't like my screaming.

98
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,040
 Time to bust out my pots and pans."

99
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,880
 This was their stuff that they had left out because they're camping.

100
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,120
 They're not going to put all their dishes away each night.

101
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,120
 They hear that.

102
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,000
 There's a big storm rage and they hear all these pots and pans banging and you're like,

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,720
 "Well, Jason, it's the storm knocking them together."

104
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,320
 That's what I thought as well.

105
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,960
 But the woman says when they woke up, all the pots and pans were still there.

106
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,120
 She did relay this particular story to this Bigfoot researcher that she had bought some

107
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,400
 hot links and she took a bite out of them and they were too spicy for her.

108
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:27,680
 So she threw them 20 feet away, which first off, that's a pretty good throw for a girl.

109
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,240
 Secondly, I've never eaten a hot link that was too spicy.

110
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,160
 Like who made those hot links?

111
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,200
 Anyways, that's not...

112
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,840
 Jason, you're talking about Bigfoot's walking around.

113
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,920
 You haven't even gotten to the weird stuff yet.

114
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:49,400
 You're questioning the credibility of the story because a woman threw something 20 feet,

115
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,080
 which really isn't that far, and because the hot link was too spicy.

116
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,440
 You're probably questioning the wrong things.

117
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:04,880
 Anyways, she throws the hot links and she says later that night, she heard the creature...

118
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,960
 Because they stay the other night.

119
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,080
 They stay the other night.

120
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:14,760
 So here's the creature supposedly eating the hot links that she threw and going...

121
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,240
 And she says, "You're not having an orgasm?"

122
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,280
 "Oh, I really love these hot links."

123
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,920
 You're wondering where he's putting these hot links to make that noise.

124
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:27,340
 She said it was similar to the sound of when you bite into something too hot.

125
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:32,320
 The word she actually used was "who", "who".

126
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,440
 So like H-O-O, H-O-O.

127
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,160
 So I guess it's less orgasmic and more like, "I don't know."

128
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,260
 But anyway, she said that the hot links were too spicy even for Bigfoot, which would be

129
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,600
 an amazing marketing gimmick.

130
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,680
 She should have called up the hot link company.

131
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,920
 Too hot for Bigfoot.

132
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,880
 But anyways, eventually the campers leave, they leave the area so on and so forth.

133
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,280
 So you're like, "That is an okay Bigfoot story."

134
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,560
 They just hear, they don't see it.

135
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,520
 They hear a bunch of weird noises.

136
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,640
 There's some hot links that are too hot for Bigfoot.

137
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,640
 Okay.

138
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,560
 So it's not the story that Scary Man sent me that got me interested in this.

139
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,280
 So that is to set the mood for Pierce County.

140
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,000
 It's a weird place.

141
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,680
 Super spicy food, pots banging but don't move.

142
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,080
 Women have the ability to throw three times their normal distance.

143
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,440
 It's a true vortex of the paranormal.

144
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,840
 But now we're going back to your 1985.

145
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,640
 It's July 6th, 1985, Pierce County, Washington.

146
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,720
 So these two campers run into a police station.

147
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,720
 Ding-ling!

148
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,720
 They throw the door open.

149
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,160
 Apparently cop, cop stations have a little bell on their door.

150
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,160
 Ding-ling!

151
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,160
 They walk in and they're like, "Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh,

152
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:53,640
 They say, "We're just camping out in Pierce County."

153
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,640
 Okay.

154
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:00,720
 We're in our tent and a monster showed up.

155
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,400
 Starts banging on the tent.

156
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,360
 We were scared, obviously.

157
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,520
 Terrified.

158
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,080
 But then we realized it wasn't a monster, wasn't a creature from our dreams.

159
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,280
 The police are getting scared.

160
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,800
 They're like, "Oh, good, good.

161
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
 I'm afraid of monsters."

162
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,480
 They're like, "No, it wasn't a monster.

163
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,640
 It was a bear, but not just any bear.

164
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,320
 An eight foot tall bear."

165
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,480
 Now the cops kind of look at each other and they're like, "There's no bears that tall

166
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
 in this area."

167
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,240
 And the campers are like, "We know what we saw.

168
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,240
 We know what we saw."

169
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,280
 Eight foot tall bear was banging on our tent.

170
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,760
 And that's not even the weird part.

171
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,920
 What happened was as the bear was pounding on our tent, it asked us a question.

172
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,560
 The cops are like, "What?"

173
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,880
 The people go, "We're sitting there and the bear starts pounding on the tent and says,

174
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,240
 in a high voice, 'Now if a bear is talking to you,' you would imagine it's either going

175
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,880
 to be like, 'What is your name?'

176
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,160
 Or 'Hey boo boo, what is your name?'

177
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,520
 Like something bear may be winning the poo.

178
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,520
 Oh bother.

179
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,520
 What is that?

180
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,520
 It's like a British Butler.

181
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,520
 You get it.

182
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,400
 What are the names we associate with bears?

183
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
 Maybe a blue.

184
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,800
 He's a little high.

185
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,920
 This bear though had a high voice.

186
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,720
 So the bear is banging on this tent and it goes, 'What are your names?'

187
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,520
 Brr, brr, attacking the tent.

188
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,820
 They go, they say their names.

189
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,280
 The bear then goes, 'Do you have permission to be here?'

190
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,400
 Apparently he's also now the cribkeeper, banging on the tent.

191
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,040
 They're like, 'Yes, yes, we have permission.'

192
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,520
 And then the creature goes, 'Get out!

193
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,520
 Get out!

194
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,520
 It's an evil witch!

195
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,520
 Get out!

196
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,520
 Get off this property!

197
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,520
 Now!

198
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,400
 Go immediately!'

199
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,440
 And the people jumped out of their tent and ran.

200
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:49,280
 And as we're packing up to leave, the bear starts picking rocks up and throwing them

201
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,280
 at us.

202
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,720
 So just now rocks are falling.

203
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,800
 Which is kind of a jerk move on the bearish behalf.

204
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,720
 Like he already, he already is breaking the laws of reality by being a giant talking bear.

205
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,720
 That's bad enough.

206
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,800
 And he tells them to get lost, they do, and then for good measure the bear's like, 'You

207
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,800
 know what?

208
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,800
 My work here is done.

209
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,040
 But I'm just going to throw rocks at him.'

210
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,360
 Because it's possible that the bear would smash one of their heads in and now the bear

211
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,960
 has a body there and then he's like, 'Well, I have to murder you too and it kills you.'

212
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,280
 Just let him leave!

213
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,520
 Just let him leave, mysterious bear person.

214
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,120
 You don't have to, you've won.

215
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,120
 You've won at that point.

216
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,000
 Got in their car, got to the police station.

217
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,680
 Now at this point the cops basically are about to run these guys in for being publicly

218
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,760
 intoxicated, for wasting their time, for running some sort of scam, whatever.

219
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,600
 They don't believe it but they have to do their due diligence and I'm sure they were

220
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,600
 kind of curious as to, 'Well, maybe.

221
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,560
 That's why it would be a terrible cop because anytime anyone reported anything weird I'd

222
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,960
 be like, 'Well, maybe Sergeant.'

223
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,560
 Maybe there really is, maybe Gerald Ford really is hiding in her closet.

224
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,440
 Like I don't know, they're like, 'Jason, that woman has dementia.

225
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,480
 She's mentioned to every president so far is in her closet.'

226
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,320
 And I'm like, 'But maybe this one's true?'

227
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,320
 So I'd be a terrible cop.

228
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,800
 But anyways, they go out, they get other authorities, like the fire department gets involved, they

229
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,640
 go out looking for Ford for some reason.

230
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,000
 The cops are too scared, they were afraid it was going to be true.

231
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,160
 The fire department goes to the campsite, they just see some animal tracks, but not

232
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,160
 bear tracks.

233
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,520
 The police start interviewing neighbors who live around the campgrounds and someone goes,

234
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,000
 'Oh, yeah, those campers?

235
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,520
 Yeah, I totally ran them off.'

236
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,520
 They're like, 'What?'

237
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,120
 He's like, 'Yeah, I walked up to their tent and I said, 'Dude, who are you guys?'

238
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,760
 And they told me their names and I was like, 'Do you have permission to be here?'

239
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,760
 And they said, 'Yeah.'

240
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,760
 And I said, 'Get out of here!

241
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,760
 Go away immediately!

242
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,760
 Get out of here!'

243
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,160
 Because they had a fire and it's like, 'Oh, look at all that brush.'

244
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,120
 They didn't keep it so I showed up and I ran them off.

245
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,600
 Cops are like, 'You don't happen to be an eight foot tall talking bear, do you?'

246
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,920
 The neighbor looks down and they're like, 'No, no, I'm obviously not.'

247
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,360
 So the police go back to the people and go, 'We, this is what happened.

248
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,280
 Somebody showed up at your tent and told you exactly what you told us and you got out of

249
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,280
 your tent and ran away.'

250
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,600
 But the people go, 'Oh, so you found the bear.'

251
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,360
 Cops are like, 'No, it was a normal person who showed up who said all this stuff.'

252
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,720
 You're like, 'Jason, is this really one of your stories?

253
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,520
 Some people who mistakenly think a normal human, the guy wasn't even eight foot tall.

254
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,400
 We're not like an eight foot tall human wearing a fur coat.

255
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,400
 Just a normal person walked up in the woods.

256
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,120
 Is this really your story?

257
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,800
 That these people are just stupid?

258
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,240
 Well, hold on.

259
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,600
 What we know to be true is that the people ran into the police station.

260
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,520
 The people were camping there.

261
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,760
 The people existed.

262
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,560
 These are all things we know that are true.

263
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,800
 The people existed in this reality.

264
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,480
 They were camping there that day.

265
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,160
 Somebody ran them off.

266
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,760
 They leave and then they go to the police station.

267
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,960
 The question is, was there really a bear talking bear there?

268
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,120
 But this is an interesting story.

269
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,240
 And again, scary man, thanks for the recommendation.

270
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,560
 This is an interesting story for a couple of different reasons.

271
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,000
 We have the answer to the mystery.

272
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,760
 The people were mistaken.

273
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,760
 But here's the thing.

274
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,960
 How do you mistake a human with an eight foot tall bear?

275
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,720
 I would argue you can't.

276
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,160
 And the cops say we just think they had an overactive imagination, which I would believe

277
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,120
 if they were six.

278
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,320
 But let's put on our conspiracy hats for a moment.

279
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,040
 Let's break them out.

280
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:36,320
 What if the person who showed up and was running them off was the spirit or personification

281
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,480
 of this bear?

282
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,240
 I don't think they made the story up.

283
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,240
 Because that's such a bizarre story to make up.

284
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,720
 They could have said, generally if they were making it up, they could have went to the

285
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,960
 cops and said hey we were minding our own business.

286
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,920
 Some weirdos showed up and started making lewd gestures and humping the tent.

287
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,920
 We got up.

288
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,320
 They're super gross and we can point them out and send them the cops.

289
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,920
 If they're making it up, they can make up all sorts of stuff.

290
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,160
 They can get somebody in trouble.

291
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:06,840
 If they were mistaken, it is hard to mistake a human with an eight foot tall talking bear.

292
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:12,520
 But what if the person personified the bear?

293
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,560
 In the moment they saw some five foot eleven person walk up to the tent and say hey get

294
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,560
 out of here.

295
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,960
 It wouldn't have any effect on them.

296
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,400
 Yeah bug off person.

297
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,560
 This is our camping site.

298
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,720
 They're kicking embers at them.

299
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,720
 Guy runs off.

300
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,240
 The fact that he could personify the bear is what scared them off.

301
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,160
 And it's just like old native legends where you have people like transform into the eagle.

302
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,160
 I get it.

303
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,520
 It's not an 80s cartoon.

304
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,520
 They're not the Centaurions.

305
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,760
 They don't have like a hologram that comes out of their chest.

306
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,840
 They turn into a giant eagle.

307
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:48,400
 And the spirit of the bear, the spirit of the fox, which to be honest would be kind

308
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,920
 of a lame spirit to have.

309
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,400
 I don't want to say that's possible, but I'm going to.

310
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,400
 That's possible.

311
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,440
 In the realm of the paranormal, haven't you ever been in a room and somebody walks in?

312
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,440
 Maybe it's you.

313
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,080
 Maybe you're the person walking in the room.

314
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,360
 Somebody walks in and they just have something about them.

315
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,000
 You're out at a martini bar because I know my audience is really into martinis from the

316
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,720
 surveys I sent out.

317
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:18,160
 You got a martini bar and some dude walks in and you're like, that guy has the power

318
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,160
 of a rhino.

319
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,960
 He's knocking stuff over.

320
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,040
 Stuff that's not even by him is getting knocked over.

321
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,200
 Some dude gets gored.

322
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,360
 The bartender's all, "Ahh!"

323
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,360
 Blood everywhere.

324
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,360
 You know what I mean.

325
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,360
 That was a joke.

326
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,360
 But you know what I mean?

327
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,160
 Like some people can exude and we use words like, "Oh yeah, he has this magnetism where

328
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,520
 he exudes confidence" or stuff like that.

329
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,280
 But what if it is something more than that?

330
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,560
 Something that our spirit is reaching out.

331
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,760
 And I think everyone does it.

332
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,520
 And I think everyone actually gives off a sense of who they are, whether or not they

333
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,520
 want to.

334
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,040
 Some people are really adept at hiding it, but for the most part it's pretty easy to

335
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,040
 read.

336
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,800
 That's why you can be standing next to someone and get a weird feeling and be like, "I don't

337
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,800
 want to hang out with this person."

338
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,800
 Now I'm not saying that if you look over that person has the spirit animal of a lizard,

339
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,840
 but what I'm getting at, this is what happens when you don't pre-plan how your episodes

340
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,840
 end.

341
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,160
 Because this is pretty much the ending.

342
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,040
 Because I'm too sick to do a second story.

343
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,280
 What if that person came to the tent and was a bear?

344
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,640
 Like a spirit animal was a bear.

345
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,960
 And that's what these people saw.

346
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,520
 That's what chased them up.

347
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,640
 Because really there's only two other scenarios.

348
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,880
 One, there really was a talking bear there who said exactly what a real person said.

349
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,600
 A real person said this, the people go, "Bug off!

350
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,080
 Kick the embers at him!"

351
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,280
 And then a bear was lurking in the forest and goes, "What?

352
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,280
 They're picking on my buddy!"

353
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,640
 And then came out and said the exact same thing.

354
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:45,760
 Or the people were completely mistaken and someone came up to them and told them to leave.

355
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,560
 And what they thought happened was a giant magical bear showed up.

356
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,560
 Which if that's the case, these people shouldn't be in normal society.

357
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,040
 They're on a bus and the bus driver's like, "Can I get your ticket?"

358
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,520
 And they're like, "Ah!

359
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,520
 Bears!

360
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,640
 Everyone else is an ostrich or something like that."

361
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,400
 They're either mentally insane.

362
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,480
 A bear sawed in the woods.

363
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,520
 And what I'm saying is that the person who lodged the complaint did lodge the complaint

364
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,000
 but they saw it as a bear.

365
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,840
 I guess that does make them mentally insane.

366
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,520
 Now that I say that, you know what I'm talking about.

367
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,960
 Spirit animals, what if these people saw one?

368
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,640
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

369
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,440
 Now you heard me in the beginning talk about we're going to do airships.

370
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,720
 We've totally run out of time to do airships.

371
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,880
 So we're going to save that for tomorrow.

372
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,640
 But I'm not going to leave you hanging.

373
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,560
 I'm going to give you another story here.

374
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,560
 Let's take a look here.

375
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,800
 Let's see what we got.

376
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,800
 Here's a creepy one.

377
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:42,360
 We'll end the New Year's with this spooky one.

378
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,960
 July 18th, 2015.

379
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,600
 We're leaving behind Pierce County.

380
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,600
 Hop on board.

381
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,960
 We're going to take the Carpenter copter.

382
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,600
 We're going to fly out to Charleston, West Virginia.

383
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,320
 And there we're going to meet a young woman named Heather Sol.

384
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,320
 She's an escort.

385
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,080
 She makes her money giving people sexual pleasure.

386
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,080
 Using Backpage.

387
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,840
 Which I think they got shut down right.

388
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,840
 They're done.

389
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,880
 There used to be a website called Backpage.

390
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,600
 That was basically the naughty neighbor of Craigslist.

391
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,600
 You could hook up with people, buy prostitutes, stuff like that.

392
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,560
 Using Backpage, she meets a man named Neil Falls.

393
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,920
 She ranges for this dude to come to her house.

394
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,960
 So she's sitting there in her living room.

395
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,880
 She's like, and she hears a knock, knock, knock.

396
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,880
 She's like on the clock.

397
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,400
 Time to have sex for money.

398
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
 She gets up.

399
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,400
 She's very, very blunt about her own profession.

400
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,400
 She gets up.

401
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,160
 She's like, or here's this man standing in front of her.

402
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:38,200
 And he puts a gun to her chest and just asks, "Liver die."

403
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,880
 And she's thinking, is this viral marketing for a new Die Hard movie?

404
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,880
 But instead it's not.

405
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,680
 It's a murder attempt.

406
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,680
 They start fighting.

407
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,080
 He gets her in a chokehold.

408
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,080
 They start fighting.

409
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,440
 She reaches and she grabs a rake.

410
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,280
 And she starts swinging it around.

411
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,840
 She knows that this really is liver dying.

412
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,240
 He puts the gun down.

413
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,920
 This guy, Neil.

414
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,880
 He puts the gun down and begins overpowering her, trying to get the rake out of her hands.

415
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,400
 She lets go of the rake at this point, because there's a better weapon that's available.

416
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,480
 She grabs the gun and without looking, she reaches over her shoulder and pulls the trigger

417
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,080
 once, killing him instantly.

418
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,240
 Just blows him away, bullet right through the brain.

419
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,120
 She does probably the smartest thing at this point, and this is a piece of advice for all

420
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,600
 you other escorts or just basic criminals out there.

421
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,480
 She calls the police.

422
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,880
 There's so many times where people do stupid stuff and then they make even dumber decisions.

423
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,400
 Because they're like, "Oh, I'm a criminal.

424
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,640
 I don't want to get the police involved."

425
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,320
 But she has a body in her house now.

426
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,820
 She's an escort.

427
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:40,320
 She may have had other paraphernalia or something in that house who knows.

428
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,720
 But she's like, "No matter what my career choices or my life choices are, there is a

429
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,320
 dead man who tried to murder me right in my house."

430
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,320
 She calls cops.

431
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,600
 So good on you, Heather.

432
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,280
 Cops show up.

433
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,080
 They immediately arrest her for being an escort.

434
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,080
 I'm just joking.

435
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,080
 Then cops show up.

436
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,560
 There's this body laying there.

437
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,560
 She tells him the story.

438
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,720
 This guy points a gun at me.

439
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,000
 He tells me live or die.

440
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 We fight over it.

441
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 I shoot him.

442
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 Cops go, "Well, okay.

443
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,600
 That's self-defense."

444
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,480
 We'll check the story, obviously, because it's just your story, but we'll look into it.

445
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,840
 They go to Neil's car.

446
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,840
 They open it up.

447
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,280
 This is what they find in his trunk.

448
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,200
 There's photographs of this, by the way.

449
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:25,960
 Four handcuffs, a machete, two axes, a sledgehammer, a small battle axe, several knives.

450
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:35,760
 Clean shoes, clean underwear, bleach, and a plastic bin big enough to hold a human body.

451
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,840
 Neil falls, has lived all over the United States.

452
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,680
 And when they started looking into him, they noticed that in about 15 different states,

453
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:50,840
 he had had background checks done by patrol officers, street police, where they had pulled

454
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,480
 him over for a routine traffic stop.

455
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,480
 They ran his background.

456
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,520
 Now a lot of times they'll run your plates, but it's unusual for the police to actually

457
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,800
 do a background check.

458
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,200
 It takes a little bit longer, but the police officers at these routine traffic stops were

459
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,480
 doing this over the years, 15 different states.

460
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:13,120
 So they think that something in the person's demean- something in Neil's demeanor, something

461
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,560
 in the way he was interacting with the officer, raised some red flags and the officer would

462
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:23,880
 go back to the patrol car, type in the info, wait a while, get back, clean record.

463
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,160
 Give him a back his driver's license, let him on his way.

464
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:32,200
 Never really under suspicion for anything, but now we have a guy dead threatening to

465
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,920
 kill a woman with what the police go, this is a murder kit.

466
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,520
 This isn't something that people would just kind of have sitting in their backseat.

467
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,400
 They start piecing stuff together.

468
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:50,600
 Almost every place that he lived in over the years, bodies of prostitutes, young drug addicts,

469
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:56,040
 were found dismembered or not found at all.

470
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,920
 Young women disappearing near places he stayed.

471
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:04,880
 When he worked at the Hoover Dam in Nevada, three prostitutes were found dead, one gone

472
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,560
 missing, never been found.

473
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,960
 When he worked in Ohio, four women found dead, two missing.

474
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,760
 Whenever they have these serial killer profiles, they'll have a number of victims.

475
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,560
 His goes from zero to eight or more.

476
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:25,840
 Because it's possible that he just lived in a place where other serial killers lived,

477
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,760
 or he lived in a high crime area.

478
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,920
 So if you lived in Baltimore, Baltimore is having some serious problems over there.

479
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:37,560
 They have more murder, they just broke their record, the most murders of all time in the

480
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,560
 city this year.

481
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,720
 But if you lived in Baltimore for a while and you lived in Oakland for a while and you

482
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,080
 went to San Francisco for a while and DC, is DC bad?

483
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,240
 DC was really bad when I was a kid in the 80s.

484
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,760
 DC was like the criminal capital of the world.

485
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,320
 But anyways, enough about my boomer crime statistics.

486
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,320
 It's possible that he just moved to areas, he is working low income jobs, he's living

487
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,480
 in bad neighborhoods, he lives in high crime areas, people go missing.

488
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,480
 Possible.

489
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,200
 But they just look at this thing and they're like, we have a guy who tried to kill an escort

490
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,360
 who was found with all these weapons in his car.

491
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,640
 Body disposal things.

492
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,360
 He wasn't, you know, auditioning for an American gladiator.

493
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,800
 Like these were ways that you chop up a human body.

494
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,440
 Victims are prostitutes, he's targeting this prostitute.

495
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,760
 Possibly he just wanted to be a serial killer or just a killer.

496
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,160
 Showed up at this woman's house and his first kill went wrong.

497
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,480
 Possible that he killed up to eight women or even more.

498
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,040
 They're still investigating this guy.

499
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:42,360
 But when they were searching his body, there was a piece of paper in his pocket.

500
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:48,680
 It was a list of six other escorts in the Charleston area.

501
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:55,040
 Women that they believe that Neil was going to visit after he was done with Heather.

502
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:00,760
 Heather was just trying to do her job one night and most likely saved the lives of at

503
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:09,560
 least six women and uncovered a serial killer who was prowling America's back streets.

504
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:18,080
 So as we go into the year 2020, let us make a New Year's resolution to be safe.

505
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,160
 Be careful who you are inviting over to your house.

506
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,280
 You're like, Jason, I didn't need a segment.

507
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,200
 I didn't need a segment to tell me that.

508
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,600
 And I say, maybe you did.

509
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,640
 Maybe you did.

510
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,640
 Because let's be careful.

511
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,920
 You're like, Jason, you don't have a way to end this episode to you.

512
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,680
 And I go, I don't.

513
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,680
 I don't.

514
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,680
 I never have a way to end my episodes.

515
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,920
 I'm always pulling them out of my butt.

516
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,800
 And I'm pulling this one out of my butt too.

517
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:45,200
 Let 2020 be the year where nobody lets strangers come into their house.

518
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,960
 Shut off your tinder.

519
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,360
 Close your grinder.

520
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,360
 What's the other one?

521
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,360
 Bumble.

522
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,360
 Get rid of that.

523
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,720
 Get rid of all your dating apps.

524
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,840
 Get rid of them because it's possible that a serial killer's out there.

525
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,120
 Instead, what you should do is walk around town.

526
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,640
 You really don't have a way to end this episode.

527
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,640
 You're really reaching.

528
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,720
 Couldn't interrupt you, me.

529
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,400
 You're only making it more difficult.

530
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,680
 Walk around town.

531
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,680
 Get out.

532
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,800
 Get to know people.

533
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:16,880
 Because that way it's less likely you will be killed by a stranger.

534
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,600
 Most people are murdered by somebody they know.

535
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:27,640
 So if 2020 is the year you're going to be murdered, get to know your murderer.

536
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,640
 That's a resolution.

537
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,040
 There we go.

538
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,320
 So that's the end of this episode.

539
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:40,880
 The last episode recorded on New Year's 19...no, no, you're wrong.

540
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,320
 The fever has now gripped my brain, by the way.

541
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:49,200
 The last episode that will be recorded in the year 2019.

542
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,480
 We didn't talk about airships.

543
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,400
 We talked about a prostitute blowing a guy's head off instead.

544
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,960
 But it's all the same, right?

545
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,560
 It's pretty weird stuff.

546
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,600
 We'll do the airships tomorrow.

547
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:06,040
 As we sail into the year 2020, we'll talk about some old time airships and then some

548
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,960
 other weird story as well.

549
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,600
 So I'm waving even though I'm talking on a microphone.

550
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,040
 I'm sure you can hear my hand waving in front of the microphone.

551
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,760
 Thank you so much for the awesome year 2019.

552
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,760
 Remember 2020, the year of the rabbit.

553
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,960

561
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,800
 DeadRabbit Radio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

562
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,800
 You don't have to listen to it every day.

563
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,720
 But I'm so glad you listened to it this year.

564
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,720
 Have a great one guys.

565
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,720
 See you in 2020.

566
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,720
 Bye.

567
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,720
 Still waving in front of the microphone.

568
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,720
 I don't know.

569
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,720
 Can you hear that?

570
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:58,400
 That was what you were waving.

571
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,400
 Have a great one guys.

572
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,400
 I love you.

573
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,640
 And be safe.

574
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:11,800
 Bye.

575
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,380
 (upbeat music)

576
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:24,380
