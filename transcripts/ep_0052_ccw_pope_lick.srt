1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
 our ghosts trying to beat the heat this summer.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,780
 And we wrap up Cryptid Week with a look at a local legend

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,440
 with the body count today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,020
 (upbeat music)

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:18,160
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,180
 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,200
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,440
 I'm a great day, I hope you're having a great day too.

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,320
 So we've been experiencing some technical difficulties

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,240
 on our side here.

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,720
 You'll notice that today we're wrapping up Cryptid Week.

12
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,240
 It's a little late.

13
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,600
 This file actually got deleted.

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,800
 This is my fourth time recording this episode.

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,020
 We did release the Gulf Rumors episode on Friday.

16
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:40,840
 That's proved to be immensely popular.

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,080
 So everyone who's downloaded that, listened to that

18
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,320
 and even sent me emails.

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,440
 Got a lot of emails about that.

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,280
 Thank you for that.

21
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,900
 Thanks for paying attention to the show.

22
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,480
 So we're gonna go ahead and wrap up Cryptid Week though.

23
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,080
 Now, one thing I did wanna talk about

24
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,420
 during Cryptid Week was my own Cryptid.

25
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,760
 So you know, I've talked to before

26
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,000
 about how I'm an author, a writer.

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 That's a better way to put it.

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,200
 And I love watching sci-fi channel movies.

29
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,480
 Watched a lot of those monster movies.

30
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,680
 Three-Headed Shark Attack.

31
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,040
 Five-Headed Shark Attack.

32
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,880
 Ghost Shark.

33
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,720
 That was good.

34
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,540
 I liked that one.

35
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,280
 I tried watching Santa Jaws the other day,

36
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,320
 but the other people I was with weren't that into it.

37
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,800
 So I had to shut it off.

38
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,440
 We ended up watching The Nest instead

39
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,480
 about Killer Cockroaches.

40
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,760
 That's not a sci-fi channel movie,

41
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,480
 but it's incredibly disgusting.

42
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,320
 Check it out.

43
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,160
 The Nest.

44
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,200
 It's from the late 80s.

45
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,200
 But anyway, so I watched a lot of those monster movies.

46
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,920
 I actually started to write my own monster movie

47
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,040
 for a sci-fi channel.

48
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,840
 Croco Mile.

49
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,600
 It's about a mile long crocodile.

50
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,440
 I think it's a great idea.

51
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,560
 This crocodile, this alien satellite crashes into Earth

52
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,160
 and starts to infest this crocodile.

53
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,640
 And every time he eats, he gets bigger and bigger and bigger

54
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,800
 till, of course, spoiler alert.

55
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,160
 He becomes a mile long,

56
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,720
 and the good guys have to drive a Jeep

57
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,920
 into his mouth to drop it.

58
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,000
 'Cause you figure of a mile long crocodile,

59
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,840
 it's getting big.

60
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,480
 It's not just like a snake.

61
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,400
 It's getting big all over.

62
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,200
 It's like Godzilla size at that point.

63
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,200
 I don't even think Godzilla's a mile tall.

64
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,760
 Anyways, they drive a Jeep into its mouth,

65
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,840
 and they're like setting bombs.

66
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,400
 And there's like a fist fight

67
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,520
 on the edge of its stomach acid,

68
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,040
 'cause the bad guy got swallowed earlier.

69
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,520
 And then there was the evil general,

70
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,880
 who the whole movie, he's talking about

71
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,840
 how much he hated mosquitoes.

72
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,120
 And then a mosquito gets giant

73
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,760
 and like sucks all his blood out.

74
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,440
 They had, I had a character named Crossbow Jones.

75
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,640
 He was a mercenary, was with an attitude

76
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,960
 and a specialized Crossbow that had different explosives on it.

77
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,880
 He wasn't the star though.

78
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,240
 He was kind of like the second in command.

79
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,760
 But he was this team of mercs that had teamed up.

80
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,080
 Each of their own, they were all with different military units

81
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,920
 and they had all faced the crocodile

82
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,320
 at different stages in its growth.

83
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,080
 And they all are telling these stories.

84
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,160
 They're like, yeah, man, I, me and my men,

85
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,000
 we fought this crocodile.

86
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,440
 He was like 50 feet tall and he just decimated us.

87
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,240
 And then the female command was like,

88
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,280
 when we faced the crocodile, it was 80 feet tall.

89
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,280
 And the other guy's like, you know,

90
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,060
 when we fought it, it was 120 feet tall.

91
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,600
 So they kind of learn early on this thing's growing

92
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,200
 exponentially.

93
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,920
 So they all have to team up even though they're with

94
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,440
 different nations to try to take this down.

95
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,160
 And of course you have the Bikini wearing co-ed

96
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,440
 to kind of be the every man in the story

97
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,680
 plus to have a bikini wearing co-ed in a horror movie.

98
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,000
 'Cause you want those.

99
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,040
 Who doesn't want those?

100
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,480
 I want those.

101
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,600
 I think every movie should star a bikini girl.

102
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,560
 I actually watched a movie called,

103
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,300
 I think it was The Stepfather and the, right,

104
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,420
 whoever wrote it was a genius because the main star,

105
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,700
 the boy was a swimmer and it was summertime.

106
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,260
 So it gave the excuse for his girlfriend to wear a bikini,

107
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,820
 the whole movie and sit by the pool.

108
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,980
 And I was like, this is genius.

109
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,540
 Like whoever came up with this idea knew exactly the

110
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,820
 audience for this movie.

111
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,620
 That being said, Croco Mile, sci-fi channel hit me up.

112
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,780
 Forget all those sexist comments I just made.

113
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,980
 (laughs)

114
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,980
 And if you wanna work with a podcaster on an amazing movie,

115
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,860
 now that Sharknado's wrapping up, hit me up.

116
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,140
 Dead Rabbit Radio and Gmail.com.

117
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,860
 If you wanna see my script, it's ready to go.

118
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,120
 It's ready to go for you.

119
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,940
 I haven't submitted it out, but I have written

120
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,760
 other horror movie scripts that I've submitted out

121
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,400
 to other various production companies.

122
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,080
 And they liked the pitch, but no one's ever actually

123
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,900
 bought the script.

124
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,160
 So maybe there's a, I don't know, I don't know.

125
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,060
 I still send them out though.

126
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,480
 Okay, so let's go ahead and get started here.

127
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,980
 So the first thing we're gonna talk about is there is

128
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,580
 a British paranormal, actually let me back up here

129
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,400
 because the headline is very important.

130
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,620
 So this was "In the Sun" one of Britain's magazines.

131
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,380
 Again, a brilliant headline.

132
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,500
 I gotta love these headlines.

133
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,380
 This is about paranormal activity raising,

134
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,580
 being more heightened during the heat wave,

135
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,620
 the current heat wave that's going on.

136
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,140
 The headline of the article, "Who You Gonna Cool?"

137
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,240
 Who you gonna cool?

138
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,640
 I mean, you know, you gotta tip your hat.

139
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,400
 You gotta tip your hat to these reporters

140
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,240
 and these editors who are coming out

141
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,720
 with these catchy headlines.

142
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,080
 I think it's becoming a lost art.

143
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,960
 You have to give props to these old school headlines

144
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,920
 because now all of the headlines are so clickbaity.

145
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,440
 And the headlines tell us what opinion to feel

146
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,000
 when you're reading the article and why it's awful

147
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,160
 and why it's beautiful and why it's great

148
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,200
 and why it's important.

149
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,280
 Let me decide.

150
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,980
 But all the headlines nowadays are becoming clickbaity.

151
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,940
 Who you gonna cool?

152
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,780
 That's a great headline.

153
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,180
 So, "Hats Off to You Sun."

154
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,700
 However, I do have to deduct points

155
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,180
 for writing the article in the first place.

156
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,260
 So basically, this is the premise of this article

157
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,500
 that because of the heat wave,

158
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,340
 there has been an unexplained spike in ghost sightings

159
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,980
 according to this ghost hunter.

160
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,100
 So this ghost hunter is professional

161
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,660
 paranormal investigator Gary Parsons

162
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,320
 said that ghostly apparitions have been summoned

163
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,600
 by the scorching sun.

164
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,040
 And he's like, "I don't know why."

165
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,240
 He goes, "I have this device that we've invented

166
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,720
 that can pick up ghost noises

167
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,120
 and we're seeing a lot of more ghosts."

168
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,480
 So here's one of his quotes.

169
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,240
 "We have received a major spike in the number of calls

170
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,560
 during June and July with people reporting scary

171
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,000
 supernatural phenomenon."

172
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,920
 Why, what?

173
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,760
 What?

174
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,680
 Why are you defining it as scary?

175
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,900
 Like, yes, ghosts by their general nature is scary.

176
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,860
 But you never hear a physicist being like,

177
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,220
 "Black holes are super spooky."

178
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,260
 Like, just be like, yeah,

179
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,220
 you don't have to throw scary and spooky

180
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,540
 and all sorts of stuff.

181
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,860
 He does that a couple times in here.

182
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,820
 I think he uses the word haunting at one point.

183
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,820
 Oh, he later on, he goes,

184
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,300
 he's talking about this box he made.

185
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,860
 So of course they're selling it.

186
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,500
 He says, "It is designed to search out

187
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,720
 unexplained orb lights, eerie voices and deadly spirits."

188
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,040
 Just come on, man.

189
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,480
 You're not doing your profession any good

190
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,680
 when you have to use adjectives like that.

191
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,200
 It's hard to take you seriously

192
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,760
 when you use words like spooky and eerie.

193
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,500
 So he's saying that ghostly activity is spiking

194
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,920
 during the summer.

195
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,520
 He doesn't know why, but they're being,

196
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,680
 in his words, summoned by the scorching sun.

197
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,960
 This is one of my issues with ghost researchers,

198
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,220
 is that it's all guesswork.

199
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,060
 It's all guesswork why any of this stuff happens.

200
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,060
 If you were a ghost,

201
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,580
 why would you most likely come out during a heat wave?

202
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,820
 As opposed, like, let's say,

203
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,020
 actually, here's a better question.

204
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,100
 Where do ghosts go when they're not ghosting?

205
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,620
 Where are the paranormal?

206
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,540
 I would assume they're not in heaven or hell

207
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,020
 because they would stay there.

208
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,300
 So what actually are ghosts doing

209
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,940
 when they're not walking down your hallway?

210
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,200
 Do they exist?

211
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,760
 Do they go off to some ghost resort?

212
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,240
 Is it super cold there right now?

213
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,600
 And that's why they're coming out to the sun now?

214
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,960
 These are quite, and you know, actually,

215
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,400
 I never thought about that.

216
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,000
 These are kind of legitimate questions you have to ask.

217
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,800
 Where do ghosts go when they're not walking down your hallway

218
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,280
 or having spooky conversations with you

219
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,120
 or standing in the mirror?

220
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,440
 Where are they?

221
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,320
 I don't know, because I've actually never even

222
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,640
 thought about that before.

223
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,520
 I've always wondered though, why ghosts wear clothes?

224
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,540
 And why ghosts wear clothes that they didn't necessarily die in?

225
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,980
 Most people die in their underwear or naked.

226
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,180
 So why are Victorian ghosts wearing these, like,

227
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,340
 beautiful ball gowns and stuff like that?

228
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,260
 Why aren't there more naked ghosts?

229
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,180
 Why aren't more ghosts wearing boxers with holes in them

230
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:24,180
 and, like, a Walmart, you know, a Walmart journey shirt?

231
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,860
 'Cause that's how most people die.

232
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,840
 Most people don't die in a neatly pressed

233
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,340
 Civil War uniform.

234
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,180
 Yeah, of course.

235
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,060
 Okay, maybe that's a bad example, because a lot of people

236
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,920
 did die in Civil War uniforms.

237
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,720
 But not everyone died in their Victorian costume

238
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,120
 or their regal clothes.

239
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,920
 So do you die?

240
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,160
 Do you haunt in the clothes you're most familiar with?

241
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,760
 Like, if I saw the ghost of, like, an old Gothic dude,

242
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,880
 would he be wearing his trench coat and, like,

243
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,880
 10-inch heel boots or those thick soles with all the spikes?

244
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,920
 Or would he be wearing his, you know, white tank top

245
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,680
 and no shorts because he died on the toilet?

246
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,960
 We need to, these are, to me, those are more questions

247
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,500
 that we need answers to rather than

248
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,220
 is the sun summoning ghosts.

249
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,740
 But anyways, if you know the answers

250
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,620
 to any of those questions, hit me up.

251
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,460
 'Cause I don't, I don't, why do ghosts wear,

252
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,700
 why do ghosts wear clothes at all?

253
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,460
 Anyways, where do ghosts go when they're not haunting?

254
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,180
 So anyways, and I have a logical explanation

255
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,340
 for this story, so he's saying that during June and July,

256
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,260
 the ghost sightings are up,

257
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,860
 he's being called out to more locations.

258
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,900
 The author of the article says, you know,

259
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,120
 if you see a ghost, give us a call.

260
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,240
 And he's doing all these investigations during the summer.

261
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,920
 Now, I think kind of the typical idea

262
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,780
 is that ghosts come around at night

263
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,860
 and really, like, the fall and the winter,

264
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,800
 for me, are like the scariest time for ghosts.

265
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,260
 I'm never like, oh no, it's 90 degrees out

266
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,460
 and there's people windsurfing on the river,

267
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,600
 there might be a ghost tonight.

268
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,360
 Like, there's certain elements of time

269
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,000
 where things get spookier, it gets darker earlier,

270
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,540
 all the trees look dead, streets are quieter,

271
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,000
 'cause you don't have all, like, the tourists.

272
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,840
 I live in a tourist town,

273
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,580
 but, you know, there's a time period

274
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,980
 where things are quieter and creepier.

275
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,740
 And to me, I'm a little more on edge during fall and winter

276
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,420
 than I am during the spring and summer.

277
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,660
 I, okay, let's put it this way.

278
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,760
 If I'm out at the beach in my shorts

279
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,760
 and like an inner tube around my waist

280
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,560
 and a little like sunblock on my nose

281
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,960
 can basically look like a character

282
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,900
 from an '80s movie going to the beach.

283
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,440
 And I saw a ghost on the beach, that's not scary.

284
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,540
 That's completely not scary.

285
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,000
 If it's sunny outside and I'm like, oh man, it's so hot

286
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,100
 and I'm like working in my garden

287
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,800
 and I look up and there's like a butler standing there,

288
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,280
 a ghost butler, not a real butler,

289
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,080
 a ghost butler standing in my garden,

290
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,780
 I'll be like, dude, grab a rake, bro.

291
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,080
 Like, it's hot out here and I just wanna get back inside

292
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,620
 as quickly as possible.

293
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,780
 There's a ghost blocking your air conditioner,

294
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,280
 you're like, God damn it.

295
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,920
 Get out of the way, man.

296
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,620
 It's not scary.

297
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,180
 It's not scary during the summer.

298
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:03,220
 And here's my reasoning for why this article is coming out

299
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,360
 and why this guy's saying that

300
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,020
 it's been a spike in the summer.

301
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,560
 Summertime, people don't read as much.

302
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,220
 People don't listen to podcasts as much, honestly.

303
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,020
 People have a completely different set of activities

304
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,900
 during the summertime.

305
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,740
 And there are people who read during the summer,

306
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,260
 but generally when I was a writer,

307
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,740
 you would see drop-offs during the summer months

308
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,920
 because people do stop buying the amount of volume books.

309
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,020
 They're out doing more things.

310
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,160
 I think that's what's going on here.

311
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,840
 He's realized, oh crap, it's the summer slump.

312
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,360
 I'm not gonna get as much business.

313
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,520
 People aren't gonna call me up to tell me

314
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,300
 that their Aunt Judy is floating around their kitchen

315
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,600
 or maybe I'll start telling people

316
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,120
 that the summer sun is making ghosts appear.

317
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,800
 So he's basically just drumming up business.

318
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,880
 Now, I know you could be saying you have no proof of that

319
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,280
 and you're kind of disparaging them.

320
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,280
 And sure, probably.

321
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,560
 However, and not probably, yeah, that's absolutely right.

322
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,060
 I have no proof of what I just said.

323
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,620
 However, just knowing the way that the economy works

324
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,940
 and sometimes you need to pay bills

325
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,220
 in the middle of the summer,

326
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,780
 because here's the fact of the matter.

327
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,580
 The sun is not summoning spooky spirits

328
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,100
 to invade your cabana.

329
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,820
 That's just simply not happening.

330
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,020
 Not happening at all.

331
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,460
 So the idea that this guy has legit proof

332
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,300
 that the summer sun is summoning ghosts

333
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,940
 is just ridiculous on the face.

334
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,740
 It really, I mean, you could say

335
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,520
 that ghosts in general is ridiculous,

336
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,140
 but if you, okay, let's say that you were

337
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,080
 haunting apparition who died brutally

338
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,800
 or you were just a haunting apparition

339
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,960
 who tripped down the stairs.

340
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,520
 The point of being a ghost is kind of to be scary.

341
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,160
 And there's nothing less scary than the noon day sun.

342
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,160
 And you could say, yeah, but it gets hot at night too.

343
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,720
 But yeah, at that point, okay, imagine it's cold

344
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,360
 and you're huddled in your living room

345
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,200
 and you're reading a book

346
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,960
 and you see like a little ghost girl

347
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,840
 like creeping around the corner.

348
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,220
 You're gonna be freaked out.

349
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,060
 If it's 100 degrees, it's 100 degrees

350
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,900
 and you're just sweating your balls off

351
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,160
 and you're super irritated

352
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,320
 and everything pisses you off

353
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,520
 because you can't get comfortable.

354
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,780
 You got four fans on you.

355
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,720
 The air conditioner is running top speed

356
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,000
 and you're still sweating.

357
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,860
 You see a ghost girl crawl around the corner.

358
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,460
 You're not gonna care.

359
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,400
 'Cause you're so, actually, you probably kick the shit out

360
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,200
 of it because you're so irritated anyways.

361
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,680
 Absolutely irritated.

362
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,000
 And now you've got some creepy 12 year old

363
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,880
 singing lullabies in your bedroom

364
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,960
 while you're trying to sleep.

365
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,180
 And you can't even sleep because you're covered in sweat.

366
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,620
 So I think if there are ghosts

367
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,060
 and they are like spooky ghosts as he's claiming,

368
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,100
 the last time they're going to show up

369
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,140
 is when you're already ready to like

370
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,820
 beat the crap out of somebody.

371
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,380
 They'll be like, "Oh, I'll come back later.

372
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,180
 "I'll come back when he's totally comfortable

373
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,380
 "on like falling asleep.

374
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,460
 "And then I'm gonna like crawl under his bedsheets

375
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,780
 "and like, let's forget that."

376
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,660
 Forget that example, that particular example.

377
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,780
 You know what I'm saying.

378
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:53,380
 There's a time and a place for ghosts to scare you.

379
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,720
 And it's not during the summer.

380
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,100
 And if the ghost is just trying to communicate you,

381
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,860
 when's the worst time to talk to somebody?

382
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,140
 When they're sweating.

383
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,980
 If I'm sweating and my mom calls,

384
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,780
 I'm like, "I'll call her back."

385
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,980
 I'm not talking to someone

386
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,280
 when I'm losing a leader of water a minute.

387
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,360
 So if my Aunt Judy wants to float back from the netherworld

388
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,140
 to warn me about the coming apocalypse,

389
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:17,860
 don't do it under the noon day sun.

390
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,520
 He's drumming up business.

391
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,860
 He's drumming up business to sell his box.

392
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,620
 He calls it the Huff Wonder Box,

393
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,580
 which again is a terrible name.

394
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:29,780
 If you put wonder in the, okay, I've trashed this dude enough.

395
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,020
 I've trashed this dude enough.

396
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,540
 Great headline though.

397
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,940
 Great headline.

398
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,780
 Total nonsense.

399
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,340
 Okay, we're gonna go ahead and move on to our next story.

400
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,180
 So, the Pope Lick Monster.

401
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,740
 Now this is gonna end off our cryptid week.

402
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:47,060
 The Pope Lick Monster is a local legend in Kentucky.

403
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,420
 He's called the Pope Lick Monster,

404
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,320
 not 'cause he licks popes,

405
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,200
 but because he apparently haunts an area

406
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,920
 called the Pope Lick Creek in Kentucky.

407
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,000
 I don't know why it's called Pope Lick.

408
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,520
 I don't know, I have no idea why the creeks called that.

409
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,800
 Anyways, probably 'cause the Pope did get licked there,

410
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,120
 but it's probably bad timing for that joke.

411
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,680
 So, Pope Lick Monster is a creature who is half man.

412
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,480
 No, no, no, sorry.

413
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,480
 Part man, part goat, part sheep,

414
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,460
 which is the worst animal to be a part of.

415
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,760
 I mean, outside of a slug,

416
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,160
 it's probably one of the worst mammals to be part that.

417
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,400
 What does a sheep do?

418
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,240
 What supernatural abilities

419
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,480
 or what advantages would you have as a sheep?

420
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,620
 You're extra wooly?

421
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,260
 What do sheep do?

422
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,500
 They just get sheared and they taste okay?

423
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,240
 Part sheep.

424
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,880
 If I was part sheep, I would be pissed.

425
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,480
 I would rather be a bloodthirsty werewolf

426
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,720
 and have to deal with the constant struggle to eat humans

427
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,480
 because at least you could fight crime at that point.

428
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,040
 The part sheep?

429
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,880
 Ridiculous.

430
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,520
 So anyways, he's, well, at least he's part goat

431
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,200
 and part goat's actually kinda lame too.

432
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,400
 You can't really run that fast.

433
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,960
 Your legs are all messed up.

434
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,000
 You have horns, I guess.

435
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,840
 I guess that's the trade-off.

436
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,760
 Anyways, Pope Lick Monster is part man, part goat,

437
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,960
 part sheep, and this is the legend.

438
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,960
 So, back in the day, I think it was like the 1920s, early,

439
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,120
 no turn of the century,

440
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,120
 there was a very cruel ringmaster, circus dude, right?

441
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,680
 And he had this circus, obviously.

442
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,280
 And one day, there is a baby, a deformed baby,

443
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,720
 dropped off at the circus.

444
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,960
 I'm assuming like outside of the bearded lady's tent

445
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,600
 and she's like, "Oh my God, it's so beautiful."

446
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,440
 Whatever.

447
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,000
 Anyways, so they get this, you can,

448
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,160
 they get this little deformed baby

449
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,000
 and they look at it and they're like,

450
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,240
 "Oh dude, this is part man, part goat,

451
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,960
 and part sheep, this is extra wooly."

452
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,600
 And so the circus ringmaster goes,

453
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,520
 "Oh, this will go perfect, perfect in my freak show.

454
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,860
 This guy is like the ultimate freak."

455
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,840
 So he, what does he do?

456
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,840
 He immediately begins abusing the baby.

457
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,680
 'Cause he's a dick,

458
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,260
 'cause the ringmaster's like a total jerk.

459
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,760
 So he's like beating up the baby and he abuses it.

460
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,380
 He abuses it for years and years and years.

461
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,220
 And here's my thought.

462
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,160
 If I found a mutant baby, let's say I was a circus freak.

463
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,000
 No, no, I'm not the circus freak.

464
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,880
 Let's say I'm a ringmaster

465
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,200
 and I find a mutated baby.

466
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,320
 I too, I'm gonna say,

467
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,880
 "This will go great in my freak show."

468
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,280
 But I'm not gonna beat it up and here's why.

469
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,560
 I'm gonna take that little baby

470
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,680
 and during the day he's gonna be in the freak show.

471
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,820
 And at night, I'm gonna send him to adult learning classes.

472
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,840
 I'm gonna send him to University of Phoenix online

473
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,100
 so he can help me with my finances.

474
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,280
 So he can actually, like there's so much other stuff

475
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,880
 this ringmaster could have done with this mutant baby.

476
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,520
 Put him in the freak show, yes.

477
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,720
 But why not send him to business management school

478
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,720
 or just teach him how to like do architecture

479
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,760
 and build better tents?

480
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,680
 I don't understand why his default mode

481
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,320
 was to kick the shit out of this little baby.

482
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,880
 But he did and he did it for years and years and years

483
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,680
 and eventually the popolic monster,

484
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,760
 that wasn't his name back then.

485
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,300
 His name was probably like Harold.

486
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,160
 But anyways, this little freak is growing up.

487
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,200
 He becomes like a surly teenager.

488
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,340
 He's smoking cigarettes and he starts to hate his ringmaster

489
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,280
 as you would because he got beat up.

490
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,080
 Again, if you sent him to adult learning annex,

491
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,040
 he wouldn't have hated you so much ringmaster,

492
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,680
 but you beat him up every day.

493
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,120
 Now he's this super strong,

494
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,760
 he has the strength of a sheep

495
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,560
 and they're coming across the pope.

496
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,040
 So this was a traveling circus.

497
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,560
 The circus is traveling across the popolic creek bridge.

498
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,760
 It's stormy out.

499
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:38,520
 And then a lightning strike hits the bridge.

500
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:45,200
 The train goes (makes lightning strike)

501
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,300
 If I actually had more time,

502
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,040
 I probably would edit in professional sound effects.

503
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,520
 But I don't, so that's what you get.

504
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,520
 A lightning bolt, train, bridge, seagull,

505
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,520
 bears, seeing it all through the woods.

506
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,460
 Okay, anyways, anyway, the train crashes.

507
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,400
 The popolic monster is now free of his cage

508
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,100
 and he's like, "Ugh."

509
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,120
 So what does he do?

510
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,480
 He starts eating the dead.

511
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,380
 And everyone's like, "Oh, I'm so glad I'm not dead

512
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,200
 "because that goat monster is totally eating that dude."

513
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,180
 Then he starts eating the living,

514
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,020
 'cause you know why not?

515
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,120
 He's been abused all his life.

516
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,360
 And then he finds the ringmaster and eats him.

517
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,400
 So that's the initial legend of the popolic monster.

518
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,680
 There's other ones that it was a farmer

519
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,440
 who made a pack with Satan and became a goat.

520
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,120
 That's, I like the circus one

521
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,860
 'cause it's just more, there's more to it.

522
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,260
 And also a little more believable

523
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,860
 than making a pack with Satan and becoming a goat

524
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,660
 because a lot of people make packs with Satan.

525
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,020
 They don't become goats.

526
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,580
 It's very believable that a circus freak was misused

527
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,860
 and turned into some sort of monster.

528
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,940
 And we'll get into that a bit more.

529
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,940
 But anyways, so today the legend of the popolic monster

530
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,780
 is that this part man, part goat,

531
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,460
 part sheep stalks that area.

532
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,100
 There's a couple of things that will happen.

533
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,360
 One, if you're in, if you walk by any place

534
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,120
 that has darkness, he reaches out, grabs you,

535
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,280
 you're never seen again.

536
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,720
 Sometimes he carries an axe.

537
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,640
 And if you're walking across the bridge,

538
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,080
 the popolic creek bridge,

539
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,400
 that's how you summon him.

540
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,840
 He'll appear with an axe and he'll chase you

541
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,360
 and you have two choices.

542
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,440
 You can either get chopped up 'cause he's really fast.

543
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,080
 He has the speed of a sheep.

544
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,360
 He can chop you up or you jump off the bridge and die

545
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,080
 'cause it's like a 60 foot drop.

546
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,160
 And I don't believe that it's like a creek.

547
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,060
 So it's not like a river.

548
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,660
 It's not like you can jump in and then swim away

549
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,180
 like Jumanji or something.

550
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,380
 I don't know if they do that in Jumanji,

551
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,820
 but I never saw that movie, either of them.

552
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,220
 But anyways, so the other one is that,

553
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,580
 and this one's a little more devious,

554
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,020
 is that he can imitate voices and he can hypnotize you.

555
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:54,300
 And the way he hypnotizes you is that he makes it

556
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,500
 so you don't hear the train coming.

557
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,500
 Now, again, you're on a bridge with a train track

558
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,420
 and you're saying, well, Jason,

559
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,740
 didn't the bridge blow up?

560
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,840
 And I said, yes, yes, it did, but they repaired it.

561
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,920
 Well, actually, no, I don't know if the bridge actually blew up.

562
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,000
 I think that's all just legend.

563
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,080
 But anyways, there is a working train track there.

564
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,800
 And if you're walking across it

565
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,360
 and the popolic monster sees you,

566
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,240
 he can make it so you can't hear the train coming.

567
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,800
 Train's one of the most notoriously loud land vehicles.

568
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,800
 You don't hear the train coming.

569
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,840
 You're on the middle of this bridge.

570
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,720
 You look up there, so train 20 feet in front of you.

571
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,500
 It hits you, splatters you, you're dead.

572
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,160
 So people say, don't go to that area.

573
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,400
 Now, obviously that's a really entertaining local legend.

574
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,020
 Kids go across the train tracks.

575
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,860
 Teenagers are like, hey, man,

576
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,900
 let's go down to the popolic monster's house

577
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,900
 and see if we can see how he's doing

578
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,620
 on his community college courses.

579
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,580
 It's trespassing.

580
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,940
 The train company, the people who run it,

581
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,260
 are like, please don't walk on that bridge.

582
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,100
 It's super dangerous.

583
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,580
 It's an active train bridge.

584
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,260
 20 to 25 trains cross it, 8A,

585
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,260
 is not a place for you to go hang out with the goonies.

586
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,580
 Now, but people do.

587
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,100
 And this is where the idea that the popolic monster

588
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,500
 actually has a body count.

589
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,560
 Because people have fallen off the bridge,

590
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,160
 fair enough, people are gonna fall off bridges

591
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,600
 or jump off bridges.

592
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,440
 But something more interesting happened recently.

593
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,240
 So there was this young couple who they were legend tripping,

594
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,720
 which is something I've talked about before.

595
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,200
 We talked about it during Ong's hat episode.

596
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,720
 That's where you go to these places with these legends

597
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,440
 and with these hauntings and you go around

598
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,800
 and take pictures and then do your own investigation.

599
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,000
 It's kind of like ghost hunting,

600
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,680
 but it's with not just ghosts,

601
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,640
 it's with all sort of local legends.

602
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,560
 I think it's fascinating.

603
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,680
 I used to do something like that in Sacramento.

604
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,200
 It's, you know, just go around and,

605
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,440
 oh, this is where that happened.

606
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,840
 This is where that happened.

607
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,360
 But this young couple,

608
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,440
 they are on a trip around the East Coast, that area.

609
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,920
 And they say, hey, the girl's like,

610
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,360
 hey, let's go to the popolic creek

611
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,120
 because there's this legend of the popolic monster.

612
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,320
 And the boyfriend's like, yeah, that's okay.

613
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,320
 It's a little out of our way,

614
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,320
 but it's kind of what we're doing anyways.

615
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,520
 We're looking at these local legends.

616
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,840
 So they go out there and they say,

617
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,320
 hey, well, we have to walk across the bridge

618
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,040
 to summon the popolic monster.

619
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,440
 So the boyfriend tells the cops,

620
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,160
 so you know where this is going,

621
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,920
 that him and his girlfriend are walking across the bridge

622
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,600
 and he looks up and there's a train coming at him.

623
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,120
 Didn't even hear it coming.

624
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,600
 Which again, I live miles away from a train track.

625
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,680
 I can hear it.

626
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,160
 And it's kind of hard not to hear it

627
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,440
 while you're walking on the train track.

628
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,840
 But anyways, he says, we looked up,

629
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,880
 the train was on the bridge.

630
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,280
 It was near us.

631
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,480
 There was nowhere for us to go.

632
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,400
 So he leans off the bridge

633
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,040
 and he wraps his arm around a girder

634
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,240
 and just leans back as far as he can.

635
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,120
 And the train, he's so close.

636
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,640
 The train is so narrow.

637
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,960
 The train actually clips his arm and scrapes his arm up.

638
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,600
 Doesn't like rip his arm off or anything.

639
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,080
 But cuts his arm up really badly,

640
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,280
 but as he's hanging on,

641
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,840
 he looks and he sees his girlfriend

642
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,780
 flying off of the train track.

643
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,680
 She couldn't get safe.

644
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,160
 The train hit her and she fell to her death.

645
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,080
 Tragic, you know, it's tragic.

646
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,400
 He got cited for misdemeanor, trespassing.

647
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,840
 Again, just to tell people this is not safe

648
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:03,000
 and she lost her life and the legend continues.

649
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,880
 You know, you had this young couple up there

650
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,840
 that the train was coming and they didn't hear it

651
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,800
 and the poplick monster may have claimed another victim.

652
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,320
 Do I think that's likely?

653
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,320
 No, I don't know,

654
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,040
 thank the poplick monster hypnotized them.

655
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,980
 But it is a weird part of that story

656
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,040
 that how she died was the same way

657
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,440
 that the legend has always been,

658
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,560
 that he could hypnotize you

659
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,560
 so you don't hear the train coming.

660
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,440
 One thing that I've always thought was interesting

661
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,080
 about these local legends is the train story itself

662
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,080
 is relatively true.

663
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,480
 The beginning of the actual legend

664
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,440
 that you could have this deformed baby

665
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,280
 that got loose from a circus or escaped an accident

666
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,480
 and was running around the woods of that area.

667
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,560
 But once you start giving him magical powers

668
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,360
 and let's say that happened,

669
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,520
 let's say in the 1920s,

670
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,240
 the circus freak kid got loose in the woods of that area.

671
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,960
 Let's say it happened when he was maybe 20

672
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,920
 in human years, not sheep years.

673
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,520
 And he gets loose.

674
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,400
 He would be like 90 today.

675
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,240
 He would be collecting social security.

676
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,960
 He would be watching like the price is right.

677
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,040
 Like at a certain point, the legend,

678
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,080
 and that's what's interesting,

679
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,440
 these legends never die,

680
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,640
 like these characters never age.

681
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,800
 You think they could be like,

682
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,920
 yeah, back in the 50s,

683
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,720
 he was like totally tearing shit up

684
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,280
 out in the middle of the public.

685
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,440
 But the last time I saw him,

686
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,760
 he was sitting on Park bench,

687
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,120
 playing chess with the Mothman.

688
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,760
 But what happens is they have to keep the legend going.

689
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,280
 So now he's this magical creature

690
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,920
 who can teleport in and out of darkness

691
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,800
 and he can hypnotize you and stuff like that.

692
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,360
 It's possible that a mutant was running around in the woods

693
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,240
 in the turn of the century.

694
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,920
 And then he just fell down a hill and died

695
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,680
 or died 'cause he was, you know,

696
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,440
 three different species mixed together.

697
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,120
 And that was just too much mutation

698
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,440
 for your heart to handle.

699
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,280
 But the initial legend could have a hint of truth.

700
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:58,280
 The mind control stuff, not far, far less likely.

701
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,240
 But like I said, it's kind of creepy

702
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,960
 that she died the way that he hunts.

703
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,400
 So that is a local legend that possibly,

704
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,600
 possibly actually has a body count.

705
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,040
 So that's it, we finally got through Cryptid Week.

706
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,840
 I really hope this episode sounds good

707
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,280
 because I can't record it a fifth time.

708
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,720
 We just weren't in a new environment.

709
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,240
 We're recording some things differently and all that.

710
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,720
 But I'm so glad you stuck around with us.

711
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,840
 I'm so glad you've been patient.

712

 paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

720
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,880
 You don't have to listen to it every day.

721
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,520
 But I'm glad you listened to it today.

722
