1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
 A larper reveals himself and ruins an alien invasion.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,360
 What happens when kids fight back against the man?

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:13,520
 And then we take a look at the story of a young mother who was kayaking with some friends

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,520
 in Chile.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:20,240
 It was supposed to be a fun afternoon, but instead she died.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,640
 And then came back.

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,240
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:33,760
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,760
 I'm your host Jason Garbender.

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,760
 I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,200
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,480
 I hope you guys got some awesome plans for the weekend.

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,640
 Speaking of awesome, take a look at our artwork for today's Ban Art Friday.

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,680
 This is done by Mountain Man Jake.

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,680
 Look at that.

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,840
 This is actually a scene from one of my previous episodes, episode 654, The Windigo Demands,

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,800
 Flesh and Bone, where I talked about people who are fighting for the rights of cryptids

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,360
 and the cryptids in this picture are tearing them apart.

19
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,240
 Thank you very much Mountain Man Jake.

20
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,240
 Really appreciate that.

21
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,600
 And let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter.

22
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,080
 Coming as a Dead Rabbit Command dressed up as the world's sexiest chocolate bar, it's

23
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,080
 Johnny Thunder.

24
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,080
 Everyone give a round of applause for Johnny Thunder.

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,520
 You're trying to figure out what a sexy chocolate bar looks like.

26
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,520
 It looks like Johnny Thunder.

27
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,520
 Duh.

28
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,000
 Johnny Thunder, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode if you guys can't support

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 the Patreon.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,640
 I just realized it's probably a bad combination for my other story coming up.

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,240
 Or you're not a sexy chocolate bar.

32
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,240
 Oh sorry, the world's sexiest chocolate bar.

33
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,240
 Sorry Johnny.

34
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,240
 That's okay too.

35
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,160
 Just helps read the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

36
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,560
 Everyone take a big bite out of Johnny's costume, get your fill full of chocolate and we are

37
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:47,320
 going to need the endorphins from chocolate to get through this next story.

38
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,200
 Johnny Thunder, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit rocket

39
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
 ship.

40
00:01:52,200 --> 00:02:01,000
 We're headed into deep space to intercept an oncoming alien invasion.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,800
 This is our segment known as Apocalypse Watch where we take a look at people who have made

42
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,600
 predictions and when they don't come true then it's immortalized in this podcast.

43
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,040
 This podcast will be around a lot longer than these posts, than these predictions and you

44
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,280
 can listen back and go wait a second none of that stuff ever happened.

45
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,760
 That's why it's called Apocalypse Watch.

46
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,000
 And this is actually really a popular Apocalypse Watch, what we're about to talk about.

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,640
 We covered this guy that I'm about to talk about.

48
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,640
 We covered him on episode 593.

49
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,400
 It was a big episode.

50
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,480
 A lot of you guys really liked it.

51
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,960
 It was Will Aliens Destroy Jazz in July 2021.

52
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,440
 I referenced it on a recent episode.

53
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,520
 Premise of the episode was this.

54
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,720
 There was a law passed early this year saying that the Pentagon and the FBI had to release

55
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,520
 all the documents they had involving an unidentified aerial phenomenon.

56
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,520
 Which is great.

57
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,880
 I mean I don't think anything will come of it but I love that people are pushing for

58
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,880
 it.

59
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:01,320
 And at the same time I covered this dude on Reddit who went by the name ThrowawayAlien.

60
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,800
 It's like a throwaway account where you talk about alien stuff.

61
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:09,040
 In case you don't know anything about Reddit you're like is he throwing aliens in the garbage?

62
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,280
 I talked about this dude and to do a quick refresher on ThrowawayAlien.

63
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,920
 Just call him Throwaway because that's what this whole story has become.

64
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,320
 Throwaway story was this.

65
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,040
 He posted this seven years ago.

66
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,600
 He posted this Reddit thread seven years ago and responded a single time and then hasn't

67
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,920
 done any posting in the past seven years.

68
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,120
 He was done.

69
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,400
 And seven years ago made the prediction that aliens were going to have, let me actually

70
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,160
 read you this quote that he said, "Alien's" what he's talking about here when I say

71
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,160
 "they".

72
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,160
 They will make contact with Earth on a wide scale in 2021.

73
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,720
 And he specifies July 18th, 2021.

74
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,680
 So we have this Reddit account that posted something seven years ago that hasn't posted

75
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:00,960
 since said in July 2021, July 18th, 2021 aliens were going to make themselves known to Earth.

76
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,280
 And we covered this.

77
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,280
 He also said that he was showing videos of like pyramids floating around, not pyramids

78
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,080
 that humans made but like pyramid shapes or something like that.

79
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,560
 He was watching some sort of movies.

80
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,160
 He was watching some sort of alien Netflix scene stuff.

81
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,120
 He also said that aliens, this part really endeared me to great aliens.

82
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,140
 I know I'm always talking about beating them up, but I found out they hate jazz.

83
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,200
 Some things just transcend the stars.

84
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,240
 I also hate jazz, my space brothers.

85
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,800
 The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

86
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,600
 So maybe before I beat all of you up, we can destroy jazz together.

87
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,920
 But anyway, so it was this interesting adventure.

88
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,800
 He went on to say things like aliens don't have a religion.

89
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,080
 And it was a really cool episode.

90
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,560
 I really liked it.

91
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,560
 Past tense.

92
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,360
 He's in a lot of past tense here.

93
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,160
 The other day I got an email from can't think of a good name.

94
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,440
 He goes, "Hey man, there's this Reddit account called ThrowawayAlien."

95
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,960
 And so he sends me this and I look at it.

96
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,960
 I don't click on the link.

97
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,960
 I don't click on the link.

98
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,960
 I read the email.

99
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,480
 He kind of talks about this ThrowawayAlien guy and I go, I respond and I said, "Oh yeah,

100
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,680
 I already covered that guy."

101
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,520
 And I sent him the link to episode 593 and then he responded, "Oh yeah, no, I know that.

102
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,800
 I just listened to that episode."

103
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,680
 And I went to go check on the guy.

104
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,400
 He's back.

105
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,920
 After seven years, he's posting again.

106
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,120
 So thank you can't think of a good name for this story.

107
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,120
 And thanks for persevering.

108
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,320
 Because I didn't kind of blow, I didn't mean to blow you off at first, but I was like,

109
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,680
 "Oh yeah, yeah, I'm aware of this."

110
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,120
 So I'm glad you didn't take it that way.

111
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,120
 And I'm go, "Maybe you did.

112
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,120
 What I mean?

113
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,280
 Thanks for correcting me."

114
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:41,280
 And this story is a correction because now I think it is safe to say and I hate it.

115
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,400
 I thought I had a friend up in the skies.

116
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,040
 This story is a lark.

117
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,720
 It's a hard lark.

118
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,320
 Let's go through it though.

119
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,760
 To be honest, I was actually torn about covering this.

120
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,720
 On the one hand, I wanted to cover it to complete the story.

121
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,360
 I didn't want to find information that made me believe the story was false and then hide

122
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,880
 it from you.

123
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,280
 But I also, this was my dilemma.

124
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,280
 I didn't want to do that.

125
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,160
 I wanted to, but I also didn't want to give this guy any more attention either.

126
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,080
 So here we are, we're doing the attention thing.

127
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,120
 We're going to kind of go through this because I'm sure other people will send this to me

128
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,120
 as well.

129
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,840
 And sure enough, in between recording this episode and it being edited, Soul Survivor

130
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,600
 on YouTube also recommended this story.

131
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,000
 So I wanted to give Soul Survivor a shout out as well.

132
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 He's back.

133
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 He is back.

134
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,720
 It's his account.

135
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,160
 There's no suggestion that somebody hacked the account or anything like that.

136
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,280
 He has come back after seven years and this is a lark.

137
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,840
 And let's go through it.

138
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,520
 He starts off by saying, there's been a lot of imposters and he doesn't name them by name,

139
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,600
 but he goes, there's the guy who always talks about this and the guy who always talks about

140
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
 that.

141
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,400
 They're impostering me.

142
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,240
 It was a weird thing to start off.

143
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,600
 I mean, you've been absent for seven years.

144
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,120
 It was kind of a weird way to start off and to not even name them.

145
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,160
 Just the guy, he could have just said imposter.

146
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,920
 I almost feel like this is going to be a book review because he basically wrote a book.

147
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,320
 But anyway, so bad way to start your return to civilization.

148
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,320
 But here we are.

149
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,320
 I throw away Aileen.

150
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,320
 He's back.

151
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,640
 He's here to set the story straight, right?

152
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,600
 We're a month away now.

153
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,720
 A little more than a month away from full on.

154
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,960
 Let's read this quote again.

155
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,840
 They will make contact with Earth on a white scale in 2021.

156
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,440
 We need to know more information about this from the only guy who was able to predict this

157
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,080
 seven years ago.

158
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,040
 He predicted it to the month that a government report was coming out.

159
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,600
 Was the government trying to get in front of this information where they're trying to

160
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,880
 reveal stuff before their mothership showed up in the sky?

161
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,840
 That's what made the story, just the story existing seven years ago wasn't fascinating.

162
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,600
 It wasn't until the timing came up that this government report was going to be due that

163
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,600
 same month that set everything into motion.

164
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
 So what's he talk about?

165
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,560
 He talks about these stupid make believe alien friends he met named Jack and Gina.

166
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,880
 Which I don't even know if I mentioned them in the original story.

167
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,120
 I know that I talked about him talking to aliens and stuff like that, but this just goes on

168
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,720
 and on about Jack and Gina and then Jack leaves but he starts to have a bond with Gina and

169
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:19,440
 I was like I don't care about your dumb fan fiction bro.

170
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,680
 Tell us about the aliens.

171
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,080
 Now technically there are aliens, but this isn't Riverdale bro.

172
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,800
 The world is going to get invaded in a month or colonized or whatever.

173
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,760
 I don't care about your relationship with Jack and Gina.

174
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:39,480
 He says when I'm reading through this, my aggravation is not aimed at, can't think of

175
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,080
 a good name.

176
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,480
 I'm glad that you sent this over, but as I'm reading as I'm wasting my time reading this.

177
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,200
 Cause the first time I'm like oh this is cool.

178
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,840
 I'm super excited to read this.

179
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,840
 Three paragraphs in, three paragraphs in that change.

180
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,920
 He starts saying stuff like the government was after him.

181
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,920
 They actually kidnapped him and held him prisoner for seven days and tortured him.

182
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,640
 Yeah, I do not believe that at all and here's why.

183
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,440
 If someone, if the government can kidnap you for seven days, you go missing for seven days,

184
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,440
 right?

185
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,720
 You're tortured for seven days.

186
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
 Why would they let you go?

187
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,400
 Obviously no one's looking for you.

188
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,200
 You're missing an eyeball or maybe it was tickle torture or something like that or anywhere

189
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,000
 in between and the government just goes you know what, sure you now know that we know

190
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,960
 you exist and we know about Jack and Gina and what happens next?

191
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,200
 Will they or won't they?

192
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,880
 You're ending up in a black box somewhere in Guantanamo Bay.

193
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,400
 I don't believe these stories where people get kidnapped by the government and they're

194
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,560
 like don't ever reveal our secrets.

195
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,480
 We know that you post on Reddit, but don't ever post this.

196
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,480
 Should we let him go?

197
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,480
 Yeah, sure let him go.

198
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,480
 We've tortured him enough.

199
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,280
 Then he's just going to blab about it on Reddit cause that automatically does not ring

200
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,280
 true.

201
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:53,640
 One of the big things in the original and now pretty much confirmed the LARP is he said

202
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,000
 aliens don't have a religion.

203
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,800
 That was something we talked about on the show.

204
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,160
 Aliens don't have a religion.

205
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,200
 And this should be LARP 101.

206
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,320
 Never let the mythos, never let the mythos, the world building, grow.

207
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,880
 You actually want to keep, where does Slender Man come from?

208
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,280
 Has that ever been named?

209
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,440
 Has he come from the under realm?

210
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,440
 Don't add too much detail.

211
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,600
 So anyways, when he said the aliens don't really have religion, I remember kind of talking

212
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,960
 about that how fascinating I thought it was.

213
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,840
 They hated jazz, they hated classical music, and they hated string instruments cause it

214
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,480
 kind of sounded like the way they talked.

215
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,280
 That was vague enough and it was evocative.

216
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,200
 That's great LARP.

217
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,520
 That's delicious delicious LARP.

218
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:39,480
 Now he builds this whole stupid mythos about alien religion.

219
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,840
 He goes oh I was wrong and Gina was mad at me.

220
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,520
 She didn't let me get to third base that night.

221
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,720
 I wasn't able to touch her eight nipples.

222
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,080
 He says so aliens do kind of believe in religion.

223
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:55,360
 Apparently there's millions of life sustaining planets in the universe.

224
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,840
 And when I say life sustaining, not just they have like a puddle on them, there's actually

225
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,240
 a dominant life form on millions of planets.

226
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,880
 But across the cosmos.

227
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,880
 This is so ridiculous.

228
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,360
 It's great for science fiction, great for science fiction, not for something you're trying

229
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,760
 to pass off as a real.

230
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:22,480
 In the whole cosmos there's only seven planets that have what earthlings would call magic.

231
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,840
 Some call it prayer or faith.

232
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,800
 And earth is one of these seven planets.

233
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:38,640
 And out of those seven planets only three of them experience deja vu.

234
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,040
 What?

235
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,680
 Only three planets.

236
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,260
 Seven of them believe in magic or prayer or sorcery like you're able to control things

237
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,040
 with power of thought.

238
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,880
 And out of those seven only three of them, the people on there or the aliens on there

239
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,720
 experience deja vu or believe in prophecies or worship idols.

240
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,640
 And earth is obviously one of those three.

241
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:06,040
 So what the guardians, okay I'm going to call them the guardians of the universe.

242
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,120
 You know what he calls them?

243
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,200
 He's had seven years to come up with the name by the way.

244
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,480
 He's had seven years to come up with the name.

245
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:20,040
 This galactic federation that his waifu Jina is part of is called the friends of friends.

246
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,760
 Friends of friends.

247
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,120
 Which just reminds me of the ambiguously gay duo.

248
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:32,080
 The friends of friends is this galactic federation or this race of aliens or whatever nonsense.

249
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:38,680
 And they along with other alien species can't figure out why there are only three planets

250
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,920
 that believe in magic and have deja vu and worship idols.

251
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,120
 So their working theory is this.

252
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:55,760
 That these three planets were created by an intelligent creator or one of the planets

253
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,680
 was created by an intelligent creator and the other two were posers or they're just

254
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,320
 random planets and these planets they have something wrong with the species.

255
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,560
 It's a mistake they're not really thinking things through.

256
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:16,320
 Or there's only one real planet in the galaxy in the universe that an intelligent creator

257
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:24,520
 created and those people are in tune with that creator and every other planet is a mistake.

258
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:31,560
 And they evolved almost out of necessity to make the one planets world more life like.

259
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:37,120
 You know like the universe was basically filled up with life so that Earth would have something

260
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,120
 to look at.

261
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:44,480
 It has all this mishmash of thought, projection, tulpa, simulation theory, creationism, all

262
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,680
 this stuff.

263
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,680
 All the hits.

264
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,400
 All the great ones.

265
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,240
 Too much.

266
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,760
 Too much information.

267
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,260
 It's interesting.

268
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,760
 Don't get me wrong if I was writing a book about urban magic and I wanted to have some

269
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,280
 aliens in it that's perfect.

270
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,080
 That's a perfect setup for that.

271
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,320
 But you're not Jim Butcher.

272
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,520
 I don't think so.

273
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,520
 Maybe you are.

274
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,800
 But anyway so he's adding all this extra backstory and this kind of goes on and on and explains

275
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,560
 why aliens are interested in us.

276
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,080
 And I'm really hitting the highlights.

277
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,560
 This is paragraph after paragraph of paragraph blog stuff.

278
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,440
 He goes on to talk about his employment.

279
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,040
 I mean seriously dude.

280
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,820
 He invasions coming in a month and he's like yeah I've always worked at fast food joints

281
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,060
 and I don't make a lot of money.

282
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,340
 Yeah what do you think aliens are about to invade in a month?

283
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,820
 I think that's the least of your worries.

284
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,820
 At least you're getting discounts on Mickey D's.

285
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,140
 But here is the thing.

286
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,980
 You go Jason why do you keep calling this a lark?

287
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,860
 I mean he's just adding stuff to it.

288
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,540
 He's not really taking anything away from it.

289
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,540
 He's adding to it.

290
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:50,500
 He's coming back because we're close to the deadline and that's when I go we haven't

291
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,820
 even got started yet.

292
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,000
 But we're wrapping it up with this because I don't want to spend a lot of time on this

293
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 dude.

294
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,040
 Let's go back to his original statement talking about July 18th.

295
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:05,120
 "They will make contact with Earth on a wide scale in 2021."

296
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,160
 Here's a quote from his newest Reddit post.

297
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:18,760
 "Whatever was planned for July is still going to happen so far as I know but it has definitely

298
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,760
 changed."

299
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,760
 What?

300
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,140
 Oh it's still going to happen but it's changed.

301
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,140
 What does that even mean?

302
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:30,220
 And he, I mean you have to read all of this dumb genus stuff even to get down to here.

303
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,260
 But it's, see it's changed because the deadline is too close.

304
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,340
 It's too close.

305
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:41,620
 If he had never posted to this again and July 18th passed and nothing happened it would

306
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,180
 have just fallen off people's radar.

307
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,780
 People would have never paid attention to it again.

308
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:51,220
 It would end it up in the dustbin of failed predictions.

309
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:57,140
 And I think he felt he had to say something but that was the wrong thing to do because

310
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,200
 now it's confirmed to be fake.

311
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,440
 You can't move the prediction this close.

312
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,060
 If the friend, if the friend of friends is trying to colonize Earth because they think

313
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:10,760
 it may be the homeworld and it may be the only real world in existence and then they

314
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,080
 find out that the federal government's going to release a report and they're going to

315
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:22,180
 call off their millennia's long investigation into who or what created the universe because

316
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:27,900
 some dudes in a little place called Washington DC signed a paper.

317
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,980
 That's ridiculous.

318
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,980
 It doesn't make sense.

319
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,780
 He should have just let the LARP die.

320
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,980
 But he has to act so something different is going to happen.

321
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,220
 You go, well Jason, at least he's given us something different.

322
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,260
 What is the something different?

323
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,020
 Well, he's not really giving us anything.

324
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:46,040
 He says the friend of friends are leaving so let's all say goodbye to Gina.

325
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,280
 He says someone else is coming very vague.

326
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,280
 Don't care at this point.

327
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,800
 I've already spent a good half hour reading your blog post.

328
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,400
 But what's the new prediction?

329
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,560
 This is what the original seven years ago made this prediction.

330
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,520
 And to be fair, people go Jason.

331
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,520
 He made it seven years ago.

332
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,920
 That's a pretty long LARP.

333
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,800
 Someone told a five year long joke on Twitter.

334
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,840
 They're quoting sweet transvestite from Transylvania and they made people wait five years for the

335
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,840
 punchline.

336
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,100
 People do stuff like this.

337
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,740
 Here's this quote from this new one, new prediction here.

338
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:22,140
 "I've seen maps up there and it looks like on the 18th."

339
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,060
 So he's still predicting something on July 18th.

340
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:28,060
 So hold on to your hats if you're in one of these incredibly vague locations.

341
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:33,340
 "I've seen maps up there and it looks like on the 18th something will happen at least

342
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,540
 in Western Africa."

343
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,020
 If you're not a geography major, massive continent.

344
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:44,840
 Somewhere in Western Africa, something in, no joke, this is what he actually said, something

345
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,280
 in maybe China or around China.

346
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,480
 Again, one of the largest land masses on the planet Earth.

347
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,800
 Something's going to happen on July 18th.

348
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,520
 In or around China.

349
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,760
 And return to this quote.

350
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,000
 And in Wyoming, so that's pretty specific.

351
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,600
 You don't let me finish.

352
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,620
 And in Wyoming or Colorado, that's still pretty specific.

353
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,820
 You didn't let me finish.

354
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:16,140
 And in Wyoming or Colorado or Utah.

355
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,200
 So just to verify, just this guy went from seven years ago saying aliens were going to

356
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:27,340
 land or make themselves known on July 18th, 2021, knocked a coincidence home run when

357
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,860
 a government report was saying the same thing and now has changed.

358
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:37,360
 For a month away from alien disclosure, now something will happen in Western Africa, maybe

359
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:44,560
 China or around China, or in one of three states, Wyoming, Colorado or Utah.

360
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,460
 This is what happens when the LARP gets too larpy.

361
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,760
 You should have just let it lie.

362
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,040
 I now look back on that episode and again, can't think of a good name, thanks for sending

363
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,040
 this over.

364
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,520
 We do need this for completion, but I love that episode.

365
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,320
 I loved thinking that this guy maybe did have some insight knowledge.

366
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,420
 I didn't, did I, was I really holding out hope for aliens to show up on July 18th, 2021?

367
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,420
 No.

368
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,740
 But you could at least in your head kind of create, go, maybe they just decided not to

369
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,740
 come.

370
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,740
 Maybe all their ships broke down.

371
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:16,100
 I still like the idea that he created about them not believing in religion, about the

372
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,100
 jazz thing.

373
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,020
 Cause I also hate jazz and now it's just nothing but lies, man.

374
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,780
 It's nothing but lies.

375
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,020
 He larped too hard in the end.

376
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,860
 But you know what, that went on way longer than I thought it would.

377
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:32,160
 That actually is almost the full episode in and of itself, but I kind of wanted to, cause

378
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,320
 I do like to address it when the show, when we need to clarify stuff, even though that

379
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,640
 was a really fun episode.

380
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,080
 He came out, he ruined it, nothing.

381
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,080
 Here's the thing.

382
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:48,520
 Is there a chance that something on July 18th will happen in two of the largest continents

383
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,920
 and in any one of three states?

384
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,320
 Sure.

385
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,000
 Something will happen, right?

386
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,700
 Something will happen and his adherence, because right now a lot of people, it's not just me,

387
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,140
 a lot of people are going up.

388
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,540
 Well, that was fun while it lasted.

389
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,340
 But other people are like, send in your soul visions, brother.

390
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,660
 I hope you get a better job than your pizza hut job.

391
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,660
 So there we go.

392
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:16,220
 Previously awesome story now over larped.

393
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,220
 That's really what happened.

394
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,660
 You over larped it, but he had a decision to make.

395
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:24,540
 He could have said nothing and then that post would have just disappeared.

396
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,400
 He would have stopped paying attention to it or he can make another super.

397
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,920
 I don't know why he wrote 32 paragraphs or whatever it was.

398
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,480
 That is a slight exaggeration, but not my mind.

399
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,960
 I don't know why he wrote so much talking about all this other stuff.

400
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,080
 He could have, again, seven years to come up with this.

401
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,880
 Johnny Thunder, let's go ahead and wave goodbye to my girlfriend, Gina.

402
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,800
 Oh, throwaway alien didn't know that, meaning Gina were seeing each other the whole time.

403
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
 What's up girl?

404
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,800
 Wave and goodbye.

405
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,760
 Johnny Thunder's all like, this is super awkward.

406
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,160
 I'm like, hey, Johnny Thunder.

407
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,460
 Keep that carbonicopter warmed up.

408
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:59,300
 I'm about to have a close encounter of the third base kind of.

409
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:04,020
 That's the worst porno song ever.

410
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,020
 Okay, I'm done.

411
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,340
 It didn't take that long.

412
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,340
 She's super hot.

413
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:12,060
 Johnny, that's why I use Johnny Thunder.

414
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,180
 Johnny Thunder calling that carbonicopter.

415
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,180
 I'm going to toss you the keys.

416
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,900
 You're like, dude, wash your hands before you throw me those keys.

417
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,980
 No, I throw you the keys of the carbonicopter where leave me behind my bedroom.

418
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:27,840
 We're headed out to British Columbia.

419
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:33,160
 We're going to save the dying mom story.

420
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,880
 It's actually a near-death experience story.

421
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,880
 And it's funny, I've had it on the docket for a while.

422
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,960
 It's depressing though.

423
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,960
 It's still depressing.

424
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,920
 So we're going to leave behind the life after death mom story.

425
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,160
 You're like, I don't want to hear that on a Friday.

426
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,320
 Johnny Thunder, go ahead and take us to Lady Smith.

427
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:56,380
 It's in British Columbia, Canada.

428
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,700
 It's April 25, 1947.

429
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,580
 And we're walking outside of the Whig Whom Cafe.

430
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:08,020
 It's this little candy store/luncheon place in Lady Smith.

431
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,380
 These kids are running down the street.

432
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,860
 They're each holding a Canadian nickel.

433
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,060
 They're each holding a five-cent piece in Canadian currency.

434
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:17,820
 It's worth a penny in America, but it's worth five cents to them.

435
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,820
 They're running down the street.

436
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,520
 Oh my goodness, I can't wait to spend this nickel.

437
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,520
 This is going to be so swell.

438
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,760
 And they get to the Whig Whom Cafe and they walk in and they go, one chocolate bar, please.

439
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,320
 And they slap that nickel down on the counter.

440
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,240
 And the employee goes, well, kids, I know you all ran down here with your nickels.

441
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,280
 I know three of you got killed and that car extended down the street.

442
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,800
 You guys really shouldn't look both ways.

443
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,160
 They're like, no, we need candy.

444
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,160
 We need candy.

445
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,240
 He's like, you do.

446
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,080
 You do need candy, but you also need to look both ways.

447
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,660
 But I can tell you these candy bars, but they're not five cents anymore.

448
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,660
 They're eight cents.

449
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,580
 And the kids are like, what?

450
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:56,660
 And the guy points at this big sign and it says candy bars, eight cents.

451
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:59,740
 And they're like, but they were just five cents yesterday.

452
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,020
 And now that I know how economics work, my voice has gotten deeper.

453
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:09,300
 He goes, yes, yesterday were five cents, but now and forever more candy bars will be eight

454
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,300
 cents.

455
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,260
 They'll never get more expensive than that, kids.

456
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,220
 But now they are eight cents apiece.

457
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,160
 So would you guys like to go out and scrounge for pennies?

458
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,320
 I'm sure those friends of yours who got hit by the car, they probably had nickels on them.

459
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,600
 And these kids, they're like, let's think about this.

460
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:30,160
 And they walk out of the wigwam cafe and they are like, that's not right.

461
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,240
 Just yesterday, a candy bar, a chocolate bar was five cents.

462
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,520
 Now a chocolate bar is eight cents.

463
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:41,080
 Now some of them begrudgingly bought their chocolate bars, but other ones, they go, that's

464
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,040
 not fair.

465
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,900
 An ice cream cone cost five cents.

466
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,860
 A soda cost five cents.

467
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,940
 A chocolate bar should cost five cents.

468
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:57,460
 Within a day or two, the word had spread through town.

469
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,740
 Chocolate bars had gone up three cents.

470
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,340
 And you didn't just have children, like little kids affected by this.

471
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,380
 You even have teenagers affected by this.

472
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,140
 Adults, they're like, whatever, they're just like burning dollar bills.

473
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,500
 They're like, ha ha ha, you lose your children.

474
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,500
 The adults, whatever.

475
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:16,240
 But the kids who were scrounging money were picking it out of the pockets of the dead.

476
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,520
 This is a big deal.

477
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,640
 The cost of these candy bars went up 60% in one day.

478
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:27,280
 Now what was going on in the economy was, in 1947, the government stopped subsidizing

479
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,400
 certain companies because the war was over.

480
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,680
 And that was an excuse.

481
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,120
 The chocolate companies really just wanted to hike up their prices.

482
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,360
 Because remember ice cream cones, sodas were still pretty cheap.

483
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,200
 But the chocolate companies go, ah, you know, we'll raise it to eight cents.

484
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:46,260
 The kids of Lady Smith decide to boycott all chocolate bars.

485
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:50,540
 Their slogan, don't be a sucker, that's pretty clever, right?

486
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:55,780
 And 40 kids are marching down the street for three days in a row, from noon to one.

487
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,540
 So basically they're lunch break from school.

488
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,860
 40 kids marching down the road.

489
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:04,900
 One of the teenagers had a car and they covered it in slogans.

490
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,140
 They painted a bunch of slogans on it.

491
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,640
 They were walking down the street with these placards and they had this song that they

492
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,640
 sang.

493
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,120
 Don't copyright strike me, you two.

494
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,520
 I'll sing it to the tune of Single Ladies by Beyonce.

495
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,680
 No, I'm just joking.

496
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,160
 Here's their song.

497
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,880
 We want a five cent chocolate bar.

498
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,280
 Eight cents is going too darn far.

499
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,120
 We want a five cent chocolate bar.

500
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,880
 Oh, we want a five cent bar.

501
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,880
 They kind of gave up.

502
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,240
 They kind of gave up those last two lines.

503
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,240
 That wasn't the tune either.

504
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:42,460
 So I don't know if it was as cool as mine, but we want a five cent chocolate bar.

505
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:45,180
 Eight cents is going too darn far.

506
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,180
 That's going to be stuck in your head.

507
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:49,060
 I'm going to do a remix of that later.

508
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,220
 They're walking down the street.

509
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,380
 There's this picture of this little girl.

510
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,900
 She holds a sign saying, let the sucker pay eight cents.

511
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,900
 We won't.

512
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:59,780
 I don't know if sucker wasn't vogue back then.

513
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,740
 I assume it's a call back to the actual candy.

514
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,120
 It's a double entendre, but let the sucker pay eight cents.

515
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,120
 We won't.

516
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,720
 Remember this started on April 25th.

517
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:14,920
 By April 29th, the protest begins to spread to the city of Victoria in British Columbia,

518
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,920
 nearby city.

519
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,080
 So you had 40 kids three days in a row marching down the street.

520
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,680
 We want a five cent chocolate bar.

521
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,560
 I'm already, that's actually the tune to Scooby Doo.

522
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,160
 I'm already messing the tune up.

523
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,440
 By April 29th, the protest spreads to Victoria, British Columbia.

524
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:37,820
 Who, listen on this, 200 children, the first 40 kids walking down the street singing that

525
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,700
 John T. Toon.

526
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:46,300
 April 29th, Victoria, British Columbia, 200 children stormed the legislature building.

527
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,780
 It doesn't say if one of them was dressed up like a Viking that was not in the news

528
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,180
 report, but they stormed the legend.

529
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:56,300
 200 people are trying to pass laws.

530
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,100
 200 kids run into the building.

531
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,320
 They're like, what are you guys doing here?

532
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,480
 We want a five cent chocolate bar.

533
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,800
 Now that's definitely the Scooby Doo theme song.

534
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,360
 Now it's going to get copyright strike.

535
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:14,720
 The news is covering it and every time the news covers it, it spreads, right?

536
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,720
 Every time.

537
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,400
 How are you not going to cover 200 children interrupting the legislature?

538
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,400
 You have to cover that, right?

539
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,800
 People are like, hey, how come those laws didn't get passed?

540
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,000
 Cops are trying to arrest people.

541
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,960
 They're like, it's not illegal yet.

542
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,960
 They're running away.

543
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,840
 Those darn kids.

544
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,840
 The news is covering it.

545
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,300
 Every time the news runs a story on it, the strike spreads.

546
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:36,300
 In Edmonton, Alberta, 300 children march.

547
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,900
 Ottawa, the capital of Canada.

548
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,180
 You have 60 kids march.

549
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,460
 That's kind of, is the thing dying down.

550
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,740
 You went from 200, that's the legislature building.

551
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,020
 You had 300 in the Southern city.

552
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,020
 You only had 60 in Ottawa.

553
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,620
 But they also had, you had 60 kids.

554
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,340
 They had 10 buglers with them.

555
00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:00,800
 They had 10 people playing trumpet, super loud, doing loud as they're walking on the street.

556
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:06,680
 So each one of those counts as like at least 10 normal children.

557
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,880
 They march on parliament.

558
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,680
 They go into the capital of Canada.

559
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:16,400
 Blowing pews in toots faces.

560
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,320
 We want a five cent chocolate bar.

561
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,000
 Eight cents is going too darn far.

562
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,100
 And we're like, this madness has to stop.

563
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,980
 Now I'm covering the story for two reasons.

564
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:31,900
 Well, it's hilarious and I wanted you guys to hear my amazing singing skills.

565
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:36,580
 And two, because this is when the conspiracy kicks in.

566
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,860
 Chocolate companies aren't selling any chocolate bars.

567
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:46,220
 Chocolate bar sales because of the, just within the matter of like a week dropped 80%.

568
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:50,980
 Some stores reported they'd go a whole day without selling a single chocolate bar.

569
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:54,840
 This strike was incredibly effective.

570
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,600
 So you need to break the strike.

571
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,960
 Now normally, like in American history, if you needed to break a strike, you hired Pinkerton

572
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,400
 detectives to punch people in the stomach.

573
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:08,320
 I'm sure they were probably scouring the city for every available bully to take these kids

574
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:13,880
 and shake them upside down to give them wedgies and swirly's and break the back of the strikers.

575
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:18,200
 But the bullies were probably, probably wanted five cent chocolate bars as well.

576
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,400
 So what do you do?

577
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,660
 The conspiracy starts.

578
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,860
 Somebody, whether it was the government, whether it was the chocolate companies, it was probably

579
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:29,540
 both honestly, said we gotta stop this.

580
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,940
 An anonymous source, that's all it took.

581
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:36,340
 An anonymous source called up a newspaper on May 3rd.

582
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:40,740
 These children who are striking, you think it's fun, you like their jaunty song, it's

583
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,780
 a communist plot.

584
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:47,540
 These children are nothing more than commie puppets.

585
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:52,440
 You see, they were starting to get attention from real life labor groups.

586
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:59,960
 And one of them, an anonymous source said that group was being supported by communists.

587
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:06,560
 Within a day, you had almost every labor group pull out of backing this strike.

588
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,680
 They didn't want to be associated with communism.

589
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:13,440
 1947, they didn't want to be associated with the commies, with the reds.

590
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,080
 As the labor unions pulled out their support for these kids, and the newspapers turned

591
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,820
 against these kids, you can be out there talking to the street all day long if you're not getting

592
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:30,220
 the publicity and no one is helping to bolster your message, your voice will not be heard

593
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:32,520
 outside your city block.

594
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:36,700
 So the strike ended and chocolate bars remained eight cents.

595
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:40,780
 I think it's a fascinating story just because of the determination of these children to

596
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,780
 fight for what they thought was right.

597
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:49,020
 And everyone went along with it until someone shouted "communist."

598
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,680
 And it completely fizzled out.

599
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:55,840
 And I do believe, my personal conspiracy theory is that was led by the chocolate companies,

600
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:01,340
 and I'm sure that they were talking to politicians, they're like, "This is really bad for business."

601
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,920
 My own plumpus needs to eat too, right?

602
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,560
 I got a lot of these weirdos to feed, and I'm not able to sell any chocolate bars.

603
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:12,380
 And so you had this cascade effect until it was crushed.

604
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:17,660
 It wasn't crushed by brute force, it was crushed by public opinion.

605
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:23,580
 And public opinion was crafted by an anonymous source called up a newspaper.

606
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:27,300
 Said that guy's a communist, those kids are communist puppets.

607
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,620
 If you support those kids, who are you supporting?

608
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,860
 And it was done.

609
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,940
 Now in the long term, what do these kids have won?

610
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,920
 Is there an alternate future where they actually won their strike and now parts of Canada are

611
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,000
 made out of nothing but pure chocolate?

612
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,120
 It is their dreamscape?

613
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:48,480
 No, I mean that's obviously never going to happen, but they probably could have gotten

614
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,920
 the price rolled back, or simply just said we're going to buy ice cream.

615
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,120
 That was one thing in the process they were eating ice cream cones.

616
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,120
 See they were able to think, "I'll just spend my money on something else."

617
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:02,680
 But even the act of eating an ice cream cone at a certain point became unpatriotic.

618
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,920
 You weren't supporting the chocolate industry, and the communists wanted to take down the

619
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,340
 chocolate industry.

620
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:15,060
 They took this really cool thing that kids were doing and crushed it.

621
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:22,500
 All these kids wanted was a candy bar at the rate they bought it the day before.

622
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:27,060
 Instead they were labeled as traitors to their country.

623
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:31,900
 And you know when those children of Canada finally did acquiesce and plop down another

624
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:39,080
 three Canadian pennies to buy that chocolate bar, they knew they had lost the first political

625
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,440
 fight they had ever been involved in.

626
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:47,720
 They took a bite of that chocolate bar and it tasted like defeat.

627
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,080
 But at least they weren't a communist.
