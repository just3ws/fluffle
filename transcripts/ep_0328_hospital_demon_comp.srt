1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 What happens when aliens make first contact with someone who has radical beliefs?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 And then we take a look at the story of a young nurse simply going about her day.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 But after she treats a burn patient, the next seven months become a tale of demonic possession, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys had a safe and fun Halloween.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 We did do the Halloween livestream on YouTube and then the next day I did a follow up to it as well.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Those are both available on the YouTube channel. I'm not gonna put them as podcast episodes. The audio quality's not up to snuff.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 If someone was listening to the podcast for the first time and discovered those, they're gonna be like, "That's weird."

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Why does he keep, why are there long sections of him just silence? Because I'm dodging cars or I'm pointing at something in the distance that people can see.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 So if you want to check those out, you can check out the YouTube videos. So that is that.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 And now we're gonna go ahead and get started with the episode. So oh no, no, no, no, we're not.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 We got two patrons, two new patrons. Thank you guys, thank you very much for all of this.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 First one is Jen vs. Infinity, the long time listener of the show. She's been listening to it for quite a while.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 I see her pop up in the comments fairly regularly. So thank you very much, Jen.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Secondly, we have Moonman. Moonman. He didn't add all the extra O's I did, but Moonman.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 So thank you Moon, thank you Jen, Jen vs.

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 And let's go ahead and get started with the episode. Really appreciate the patronage.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 And if you can't support the show via Patreon, that's okay. Just get the word out about the show. Really, really helps a lot.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Let's go ahead and hop into Jason. Let's hop into the carboner copter actually. We haven't used this in a while.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 No, we haven't used the dead rabbit dirgeable in a while. Get on board the dead rabbit dirgeable. You're like, dang it.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 I wanted to ride on the copter. I'm like, nope, it's my show. It's my ride. I don't know why all of a sudden I'm Rosco P. Co-Train.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Or any Southerner, really. Get on. Come on, hurry up. Get on the dirgeable. We're taking off.

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Now we're going to fly from Oregon. We're flying out to Pennsylvania, right?

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 The year is 2017 and we're going to land in this big field. That noise was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 We're going to fly from Oregon to Pennsylvania. We're going to fly from Oregon to Pennsylvania.

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 We're going to fly from Oregon to Pennsylvania. We're going to fly from Oregon to Pennsylvania.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 We're going to fly from Oregon to Pennsylvania. We're going to fly from Oregon to Pennsylvania.

28
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 We're going to fly from Oregon to Pennsylvania. We're going to fly from Oregon to Pennsylvania.

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 We're going to fly from Oregon to Pennsylvania. We're going to fly from Oregon to Pennsylvania.

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 We're going to fly from Oregon to Pennsylvania. We're going to fly from Oregon to Pennsylvania.

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 We're going to fly from Oregon to Pennsylvania. We're going to fly from Oregon to Pennsylvania.

32
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 We're going to fly from Oregon to Pennsylvania. We're going to fly from Oregon to Pennsylvania.

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 We're like, "Dude, why are you going off on this rant about Mufon? Look, there's a UFO descending out of the night sky."

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 I was like, "Oh yeah, that's way more important. Does it have any glazers on it?"

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 It's all, "Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah,

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 This UFO is landing, right? Now, the door opens up. This alien walks out. Walks out all like noble prints. I don't even know what that means.

37
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 He's strutting a bit, I guess, he walks out. Now, in this group of scientists and collaborators,

38
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 I don't know why I'm using the word "collaborators." In this group of scientists and researchers and stuff like that,

39
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 one of them, his name is John Ventray. He is the president or the CEO of the--

40
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 He's the state director of the Pennsylvania branch of Mufon. Is who he is?

41
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 As Jason looks at his notes, he walks up to this alien and he extends his hand and he says,

42
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 "Now, just so we're not confused, just so we're not confused about the next five minutes of what I'm about to say,

43
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 this didn't actually happen. Obviously, we're not there. A UFO did not land in Pennsylvania

44
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 and John Ventray did not shake his hand and no one walked princely."

45
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 But John Ventray is a state director of the Pennsylvania Mufon. It's a real organization and they're dedicated to finding

46
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 proof of aliens and contacting them and all sorts of stuff. So, he didn't say this to an alien directly.

47
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 He wrote this on Facebook. He wrote the follow-- What am I about to say? He wrote the following on Facebook.

48
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 But I want you to imagine him saying it's when alien, because this guy's job was to research this stuff.

49
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 Are aliens real? Are there more advanced civilizations out there? Is there someone or something trying to make contact with us?

50
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 It is a weighty responsibility to try to contact other beings.

51
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 You really just don't let anyone become a priest or minister or rabbi or a-- What are the other ones called?

52
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 Cleric. Well, and whatever the other really do. Swamis or whatever. Anyway, the point is, is that you usually have to go through some sort of training

53
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 because basically you're talking to gods and ghosts and spirits, right? You don't want your aunt doing it.

54
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 And when your aunt does it, she's messing around with a Ouija board and the next thing you know, she's killing your cat.

55
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 They have to have some semblance of training because they're talking to deities or trying to interpret the word of deities

56
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 or just, you know, whatever. So you don't want just anybody in charge of this-- the Pennsylvania move on.

57
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 Because one of these guys are the first people to meet aliens is what this whole setup is.

58
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 So I'm getting at, okay. Here we are. He's getting ready to shake this dude's hand.

59
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 And John Ventre says this. Netflix announced the new anti-white show, Dear White People, that promotes white genocide.

60
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 I canceled my account. Do the same. Shake and shake and shake this alien. Aliens looking nervous.

61
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Like what is this guy talking about? He continues. I don't find this funny.

62
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 The last thing blacks want is for white males to organize and that's not too far away.

63
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 White males are the absolute target of the government with illegal affirmative action.

64
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 And at this point, me and you are looking at each other in the field and we're like, what in the world is going on here?

65
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 I'm looking at you and you're looking at me and everyone is super nervous.

66
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 But John Ventre, he's on a roll, dude. He at this point, he pulls out a literal soap-- so he pulls out a literal soapbox,

67
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 gets on top of it, while shaking his hand the whole time, which violates the 14th Amendment and the Supreme Court refuses to hear the case because they know it does.

68
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 The media also attacks us constantly, constantly, with interracial couples in every show and commercial.

69
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 And we're like, oh no, dude, can this get any worse?

70
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 At this point, other aliens are kind of poking their head out of the ship and they're like, what's going on? What's taking this so long?

71
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 This is usually pretty like, take me to your leader. Why is our alien leader blushing? How?

72
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 We didn't even know our species could get embarrassed. John Ventre continues,

73
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 "The media also attacks us constantly with interracial couples in every show and commercial and portraying white males as incompetent."

74
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Everything this world is was created by Europeans and Americans.

75
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 And Americans, not the fact that Americans are technically Europeans, really, if you go far enough back,

76
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 what was created by Europeans and Americans, effing blacks, okay, do not, do not, do not grab, like, do not take this audio clip and just be like,

77
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 dead rabbit radio is totally racist. This is the voice of John Ventre. This, we're not even, we're almost done and it gets worse.

78
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 We're almost done and it's not even as bad as it's going to get.

79
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 But let's go ahead and let's do the coup de gras here. So John Ventre is writing this.

80
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Well, he, and he's also telling this alien leader, and we're just like, oh my God, this is first contact, dude. This is really bad.

81
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 He goes, "Effing blacks didn't even have a calendar, a wheel, or a numbering system until the Brits showed up."

82
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 And you and I look at each other, we're like, okay, well, that was bad, but it could have been a whole lot.

83
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 And then he continues, "Google serotonin by race, IQ by race, and violent crime by race."

84
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 And then compare that to the effing message the media portrays. Time to turn off the TVs.

85
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Now, the reason why I'm covering this story is for a couple of reasons.

86
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 The main one, though, I think it's funny. I think it's funny that somebody who actually, like, is trying to find more advanced races in the galaxy is a racist.

87
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 I find that bizarre. I find that very, very bizarre.

88
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Because what happens when the aliens start googling IQ by species and humans are the lowest on the alien scale,

89
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 and they're like, what, they didn't even have hyperdrive till we showed up. That was backward, but so that's weird in and of itself.

90
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 But really, alien UFO mythology, all that stuff, it's kind of broken down into two overarching myths.

91
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Either one, the aliens out there are preparing to go to war with us, humanity, and it's us versus them.

92
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 It's humans versus the evil alien empires. Reptilians and their workers and the grays and they're abducting us, and we are a global community.

93
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 Or there is a universal brotherhood out there of alien species that want us to join their brotherhood and elevate us psychically and spiritually.

94
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 And the powers that be, the Illuminati, Deep State, whatever you want to call them, are keeping us from contacting these aliens.

95
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 Both of those are completely incompatible with the statement Google IQ by race.

96
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 Both of those, what happens? Independent state did not have them all flying around.

97
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 And then who was the dude, not Steve Gutenberg, Jeff Goldblum. The end of that movie was not Jeff Goldblum making the virus and getting in the ship.

98
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 He's like, okay, we're going to fly the ship in, we're going to take care of this, and it's Will Smith getting in the ship too.

99
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 He's like, whoa, no, no, no. We got a white pilot. Where's the president? Can we get someone in here? Anyone?

100
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Because I googled him, I googled his IQ, guys, and all the scientists are like, it's the only one we got.

101
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 And he's like, oh, I hope you're one of the good ones.

102
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Shipped in completely incompatible with any idea, any overarching UFO myth.

103
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Now, obviously, if someone's just racist, I'm not, if some guy's just racist on the street corner, I'm like, what, how are we supposed to fight the aliens together?

104
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 Because he's just going to think I'm crazier than he is. But when someone is the head of a state chapter of a UFO investigation group and actively dislikes,

105
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 or I would go so far as to say hates black people, right?

106
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 He got triggered by this television show, and now he actually is like telling people that they're not like us.

107
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 It was basically the first part you can say whatever. Maybe the show is anti-white. I don't know anything about the show.

108
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 I've never watched the show, never watched the movie. I'm vaguely aware of the controversy surrounding it.

109
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 But by the end of that, it's basically it's us versus them is where that email or that Facebook post goes.

110
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Incompatible with any belief in aliens or UFOology.

111
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 It is so bizarre to me to think that someone can share both the belief in hope that humanity is, humanity is not alone in the universe.

112
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 There are other species out there either looking to help us achieve greatness or attack us and we have to unite together to fight them.

113
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 And at the same time, completely dismiss an entire ethnic group, an entire race of people.

114
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 I find that as bizarre as a story like Mormon Bigfoot, to be honest, that you could hold both beliefs at the same time and not see the irony in it.

115
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Humanity must unite except for those billion people.

116
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Humanity will ascend to the next spiritual level except for those guys.

117
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 No blacks allowed on the mothership. Which is basically kind of ironic since that's what...

118
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 Damn it, that joke fell apart. What's that guy's name? George Clinton! Dang it!

119
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 I'm keeping that one in. But anyways, George Clinton's mothership, parliament, funk, funkadelic.

120
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 My point is, I find the idea that someone could hold these two beliefs at the same time just as bizarre as so much of the other stuff that we cover.

121
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 Because to me it's completely incompatible. He still works there by the way.

122
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 And I'm not going to get into cancel culture or all that stuff, but they lost, so he got fired and then came back as a volunteer and it still does a bunch of the same stuff.

123
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 And they lost a ton of people. They go, "I do not want to work with an organization that supports this dude. That's repugnant beliefs.

124
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 I'm not going to support it." And that's where we're at right now.

125
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 And you have a guy who's looking up at the night sky for other races, but can't even consider to embrace his own species that's standing right next to him.

126
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Absolutely bizarre. Absolutely bizarre belief.

127
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story though.

128
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Next story, we're going to leave behind a creepy mind and delve into a creepy...

129
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 What rhymes with mind?

130
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 That's not what rhymes with mind. What rhymes with mind and is relevant to the story.

131
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 We're going to leave behind a creepy claspital and end up in a creepy hospital. A claspital is a slang term for a field in Pennsylvania.

132
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 But you didn't know that. You learned something today, right?

133
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 We're going to a hospital in... Let's see where is this at.

134
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Arkansas! It's actually in a place called Sears Sea Arkansas or Cirque Arkansas.

135
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Now I'm going to say if it is Sears Sea Arkansas, it's kind of creepy.

136
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Because Sears Sea was that woman who turned dudes into pigs back in the day.

137
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 That story... I know I'm talking about this all the time.

138
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 It terrifies me stories where people turn into stuff when they don't want to.

139
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Technically turning into stuff. I mean it's not like a boy turns into a man and he could be like, "But if I don't want to grow up, that doesn't scare me.

140
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 I don't want to grow up. I'm a Toys and R Us kid. That's songable. No!"

141
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Just let him stay a boy.

142
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 It's turning into other species or inanimate objects.

143
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 And I'm always wondering where I got that fear from.

144
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 I talked before about that Doctor Who episode that apparently I made up.

145
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 I remember it vividly but no one else remembers it about all the Doctor Who's got together.

146
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 This was like in the 80s.

147
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 All the Doctor Who's got together and fought some bad guy and he got turned into a statue but he was still alive.

148
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 That scared me.

149
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 Willow scared me when that witch turned everyone into a pig. That really terrified me.

150
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 The story of Sears Sea on the island of the Greek island. I think it was Jason and the Argonauts.

151
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Maybe in the past life I was Jason and I saw my buddies get turned into pigs.

152
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 But I don't know what childhood trauma I had.

153
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Maybe I'm not really a human. Maybe I used to be a puppy and I got magically transformed into a human.

154
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 I don't know. That is just as viable as any of those other ones.

155
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 But for whatever reason I hate it when people get turned in.

156
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 It has nothing to do with the story I'm about to tell.

157
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 By the way, just the fact that the city is named Sears Sea, Arkansas.

158
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 I should see if I can find stories about people turned into stuff.

159
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 I can stare Willow.

160
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 I can stare Willow but then I realize I don't live in fairy tales so that might actually be impossible.

161
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 I'll go to Buzzfeed. 10 people who turned into animals with photos.

162
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 So it's November 2006. We're in Sears Sea, Arkansas.

163
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 There's a young woman there named Amy Stamatis.

164
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 She's laying in a hospital bed.

165
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 Beep, beep, beep.

166
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 That's not a bus backing up. That's her little heart rate monitor.

167
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 Beep, and apparently needs to be tuned.

168
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Beep, beep.

169
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 And she's just sitting there kind of like, uhhhh.

170
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 Uhhhh.

171
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 She's not a zombie. She's not a zombie.

172
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 She's just not doing too well. She's paralyzed from the waist down.

173
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 And even though she can't move her legs, she keeps having these dark, intrusive thoughts.

174
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 She ended up in the hospital bed. Former nurse, by the way.

175
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 So it's possible that when she was like, "Oh, I know this room."

176
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Many a patient have been in this room. I've been in this room many times before.

177
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Or it could be a toilet for hospital than the one she worked at. I'm not for sure.

178
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 But former nurse now paralyzed from the waist down.

179
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 She was sitting on a window sill, right?

180
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 And she's just enjoying the sun, hoping it would wash out the dark, intrusive thoughts in her head.

181
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 And then all of a sudden she fell and hit the pavement and broke her back.

182
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Broke a bunch of ribs. And when they found her, her arms and her legs weren't broken.

183
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 And she didn't try to brace for impact.

184
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 Which almost seems impossible.

185
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 Like, I get it, people kill themselves. Unfortunately, they do it all the time.

186
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 But usually, even when they jump, they're like, "That was bad."

187
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 Like, usually the people who survived the suicide attempts for a while go, "Whew."

188
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 That wasn't fun. And then depending on other factors that are going on,

189
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 they either never do it again or they keep committing suicide.

190
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Or keep attempting to commit suicide until they die.

191
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Not even a natural reaction to put her arms out or to try to put her legs out.

192
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 She falls and smashes her back.

193
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 Now she says, "I didn't jump. I didn't jump."

194
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 'Cause they're loading her into the ambulance at the scene.

195
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 Something pushed me. I swear I didn't jump.

196
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 Now, I don't know why she turned into Clint Eastwood from Gran Torino after the accident.

197
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 But apparently, that is the case.

198
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 So now she's in the hospital and she's trying to make sense of what's happened in her life.

199
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 April 2006. So seven months earlier, Amy is a happy-go-lucky young nurse.

200
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 She's dancing around the hospital.

201
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 She didn't get a lot of work done. She's too busy dancing.

202
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 You know, the way that it works, they're like, "Amy, get back to work."

203
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 She's like, "I'm having a feeling. I'm making up a song so I don't get a copyright violation."

204
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 And she's dancing through the hospital, right?

205
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 She's doing a little shuffle. I need to have a dead rabbit dance.

206
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 So anyway, she's dancing. She's doing a little moonwalking through.

207
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 She's bumping into other nurses who are doing their job.

208
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 They're like, "Ah!" They get stuck with a bunch of needles.

209
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 They're carrying a tray full of fentanyl, injected fentanyl.

210
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 And she bumps into them. They're like, "Ugh!"

211
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 That would be actually a pretty funny movie or a scene, a funny scene in a movie.

212
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 If the whole movie was just her bumping into people.

213
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Nah. But I could watch a scene in a comedy. Farley Brothers hit me up.

214
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 I got hilarious jokes that involve opioids. Opioids.

215
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Anyways, so the point...

216
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 This is a really grim story, actually.

217
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 The point is, is that she's in the hospital. She's having the time of her life.

218
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 And they go, "Amy? Amy? Karma the frog apparently wears to the hospital. Amy? Amy Statmitis?

219
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 Go to the emergency room. We got a patient for you to move."

220
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 Because, you know, usually they call nurses over the loudspeakers.

221
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 So Amy goes down to the emergency room.

222
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 And there's a burn victim there. And they're like, "Can you put this guy in a room?"

223
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 "Can you take care of this guy? Put him in a room."

224
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 A hospital room may have to be specific.

225
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Last time she just wheeled him out across the way, left him in someone's apartment.

226
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 She's like, "Oh yeah, hospital room."

227
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 So she wheels him through the hospital.

228
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 She's dancing the whole time. The bed's rocking. She's surfing on the bed.

229
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 She gets to the room.

230
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Okay, so...

231
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 Here. She gets to the room, right?

232
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 So she gets to the room, she's taking care of him.

233
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 And then she's on the other side of the hospital.

234
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 She's like, "What?"

235
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 She kind of thinks, "What? How did I... wait, what? How did I get here?"

236
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 And she's kind of like looking around. It's not a wing of the hospital that she normally goes to.

237
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 It's definitely not the wing of the hospital she was just in.

238
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 She finds herself standing in the hospital.

239
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 And she starts to try to remember. She goes, "I remember leaving his room.

240
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 And then I just walked around. Like, just started making loops around the hospital, walking all over the hospital.

241
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 But why? I don't even remember doing that. Like, vaguely remember doing that.

242
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 And I must have done that because I'm here. But I just don't get it.

243
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 This is one of her quotes after this.

244
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 "After I took care of him, my mind went out the window. I was just blank."

245
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 This was actually her final day at the hospital. She could not go to work after this.

246
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 She could not concentrate at all.

247
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 She felt like her brain was actively rebelling against her.

248
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 She couldn't even do simple tasks. Talking about like brushing your teeth.

249
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 Like, it was basically like she went into the room with the burn victim, a normal person,

250
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 and came out someone who was suffering some form of mental disability.

251
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 A permanent brain fog had come over her.

252
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 She also was physically fit. She was a marathon runner. That was her hobby.

253
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 She loved seeing something 26.5 miles away and saying, "I'm gonna get there. Watch me go."

254
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Now she can barely walk. Now she can't because she's paralyzed.

255
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 But before she gets paralyzed, she was having a hard time moving in a straight line.

256
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 So she starts going to the hospital and they are running test after test after test.

257
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 And they're like, "Obviously something's wrong with you. But we don't know what it is."

258
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 So they say, "We're gonna give you this anti-psychotic medicine. We're gonna give you this medicine.

259
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 We're gonna give you that medicine." They're trying to figure out what it is.

260
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 They don't know if it's all in her head. They don't know if she has some sort of muscle disease.

261
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 But whatever it is, it's acting incredibly fast.

262
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 She says, "I feel like I'm having a nervous breakdown."

263
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 And the doctor's like, "Well, let's go that route."

264
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 So that's when they start giving her all of these medications to try to get her back to normal.

265
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 And nothing is working at all. And now she's hearing voices in her head.

266
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 And they won't go away.

267
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Now she's married, her loved ones are concerned, her friends are concerned.

268
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 She ends up going to a big party with her in-laws.

269
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 In the middle of the party, starts taking her clothes off.

270
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 People are like, "Amy, what are you doing? Why are you..."

271
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 I don't know if she was laughing like the Joker.

272
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 But she was definitely taking her clothes off. That was true.

273
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 And she was volatile. She would get angry at the drop of a hat.

274
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 She went back to visit some friends of the hospital and just started flipping out on them.

275
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Stuff like that.

276
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 And it kind of culminated in her husband taking her to Michigan to go to the Mayo Clinic.

277
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 And while she was there, she broke free from the doctors. She takes off running.

278
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 She goes up a giant parking garage, you know, like a parking structure.

279
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Gets to the eighth store and threatens to jump.

280
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 It was a point where the police had to show up and them and the husband had to talk her off of the ledge.

281
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 So it wasn't like she was just up there going, "I'm going to jump."

282
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 And the doctor's like, "Don't do it."

283
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 And she's like, "Yeah, I guess I won't."

284
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 It went on long enough that there was a police presence and they had to do all that stuff.

285
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 So you go, "Well, that's interesting."

286
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 Because in November 2006, he told me she fell out of a window.

287
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 She had already climbed to a height to threaten to kill herself.

288
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 But she didn't kill herself.

289
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 Or she didn't jump off the parking structure. That definitely would have killed her.

290
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 And two, she swore still that she did not jump out of that window. She got pushed.

291
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 So now we're standing. It's November. We're all caught up with the story.

292
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 It's November 2006.

293
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 We are standing in the hospital room of Amy. We're wearing our big old lab coats.

294
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 It's me and you. Got Moonman.

295
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 I think he's actually getting into the sharps cabinet and getting some needles.

296
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 And then Jen versus Infinity is there as well.

297
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 She's actually the supervising doctor. She's making sure I do my job right.

298
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 And I'm kind of nervous. I keep looking at her.

299
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 But anyways, and then I'm like, "Moonman, dude, that's fentanyl. Don't inject that."

300
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 I had a friend who did that. I had a friend who used to break into sharp containers and...

301
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 [shushing]

302
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 There's doing drugs and then there's doing half used drugs from other people who are dying.

303
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 Like...

304
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Blah.

305
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 Anyways, I love her. She's a really good friend of mine.

306
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 But talk about Risky, dude.

307
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 Anyways, so the point is...

308
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 You guys are all looking at me as I'm taking notes.

309
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 Moonman's putting the sharps container back down.

310
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 He's like, "That is kind of disgusting."

311
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 And I was like, "It is, isn't it?"

312
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 And Jen's just kind of shaking her head.

313
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 The fact that I repeal that as I'm a doctor.

314
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 Anyways, the point is, is that we are in her room and I go...

315
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 So I'm sure you guys are all thinking that this is some sort of medical story.

316
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 I think you guys are thinking that this is something involving medicine.

317
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 But it's not.

318
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 Watch this.

319
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 And I point to the door and right when I point to the door, a couple people walk in.

320
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 And you're like, "Whoa, it's almost like he knew what was coming. It's almost like he read an article on this."

321
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 Cindy Lawson walks in with a church group.

322
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 Amy, Amy's church group. This isn't just some random roaming church group like the Warriors.

323
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 They just move from hospital to hospital looking for converts.

324
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Amy's church group, they actually invited Cindy Lawson to show up.

325
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 And she walks into the room and she looks at Amy and she sees surrounding this young broken woman,

326
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 paralyzed from the waist down, demons crawling around her.

327
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 And now we see them too.

328
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 [Amy moans]

329
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Moving around.

330
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 And Cindy Lawson is an exorcist for the Pentecostal church.

331
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 And she walks up to Amy and she begins to question who's in there.

332
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 She basically goes right into exorcism mode.

333
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 And she starts to use the name of Jesus to drive the demons out of her.

334
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 Drive the demons out of Amy.

335
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 And Amy said she started to feel almost an immediate kind of relief that Jesus was now in this room with her.

336
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 And they continued to do this exorcism.

337
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 It wasn't a full on like your baby's rotten hell exorcism stuff spinning around, everyone's having to hold her down.

338
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 It was basically almost seemed like an informal like, "Hi, my name's Cindy. Demons leave Jesus's here."

339
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 And the demons are like, "Oh, they just started running out. Very, very weak-willed demons."

340
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 Which are good. The best kind of demons you want are the ones that will run away right away.

341
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 But Amy says that it worked.

342
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 Amy says they'd been treating her for all of this stuff for so long

343
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 and they thought that she had this super rare neurological disease.

344
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 But once she had that little exorcism, when Cindy Lawson came into her life,

345
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 she actually felt the voices go away and the intrusive thoughts leave.

346
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 And now she says she's healthy both mentally and spiritually. Physically.

347
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 Still not doing that great, 'cause you know, can't move from the waist down.

348
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 But there's two interesting things to this.

349
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 One, there's that old thing of how many people have mental illnesses that could really be demonic possession

350
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 or to flip that how many demonic possession stories in the past were actually legitimate mental illnesses

351
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 that people must stick for demons.

352
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 The second thing, and really the creepiest thing about the story,

353
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 whatever happened to the burned man?

354
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 Like, I mean, I think the suggestion is that she wasn't involved in the process

355
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 she wasn't like, worshiping the dark forces, she wasn't like,

356
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 "Oh yeah, on all my breaks I played Charlie Charlie."

357
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 She seemed to be fairly normal in society.

358
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 And then a man who was burned up shows up at the hospital,

359
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 she takes care of them, and then this nightmare begins.

360
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Where's the burned dude?

361
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 You know, I don't know, 250 episodes ago,

362
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 I did an episode about solar plexus clown gliders,

363
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 or the belief that there are demonic entities that can move from body to body,

364
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 that can actually suck out your will to live.

365
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 A parasite, an interdimensional parasite.

366
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 And I talked about an experience that I may have had with one of those things.

367
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 Now, I'm not saying that's what she suffered from.

368
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 It seems like what she suffered from was far darker,

369
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 but it still does seem like some sort of parasite.

370
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 How did this guy get burned? Who was he? Where was he from?

371
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 Was he also some happy-go-lucky guy just moving about life, doing his thing?

372
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 And then something got attached to him, and then one day he woke up on the other side of town,

373
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 and he's like, "How did I get here? What am I doing here?"

374
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 And then the thoughts began, the voices got louder,

375
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 and then he had an accident, burning his body up, landing him in the hospital.

376
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 And at that point, whatever urged him to do those things, or to be put into those situations,

377
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 found a new victim, a young married nurse full of joy and life,

378
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 and took over her existence.

379
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 Maybe the exorcism didn't drive it away.

380
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 Maybe it just wanted to leave anyways its target was taken out.

381
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 It had done what it wanted to. It destroyed another life.

382
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 So if you're ever sick or injured, you need to go to the hospital.

383
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 Make sure you don't go to one in Searsie, Arkansas.

384
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 Because somewhere in that city is a hospital, and somewhere in that hospital is a room.

385
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 And in that room is a malevolent force, just waiting to take over your body and destroy it.

386
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 It feeds on human life, it feeds on human pain, and it's looking for its next meal.

387
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
