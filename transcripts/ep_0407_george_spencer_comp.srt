1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
 A man wants to protest fox hunting.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,000
 You won't believe what he does next.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,700
 You like these new click-baity intros?

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,300
 A man walks into a police station

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,100
 reporting that his iPad has been stolen

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,700
 and you won't believe what's on his iPad.

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,300
 Actually, I'm kind of enjoying this.

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,700
 And then we travel back to 1600s America

9
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,700
 when people feared witches

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,000
 and the devil was around every tree.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,100
 In an environment like that,

12
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:33,400
 it should be no shock that a man was accused of the ultimate crime

13
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,400
 because of a disfigured pig today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:44,900
 [Music]

15
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,900
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

16
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,900
 I'm having a great day.

18
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,300
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

19
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,100
 We got a lot of stuff to cover.

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,800
 Let's see if we can get all three stories done.

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,500
 Let's go ahead and jump right into this.

22
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:04,300
 Let's go ahead and hop on over to Jolly Old England, UK, the United Kingdom.

23
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,100
 There we're going to meet a dude named Mark McGowan.

24
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,700
 Okay, so basically this segment is more just the list.

25
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,900
 Now, my British listeners are there already like,

26
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,400
 "Oh, not this guy, not Mark McGowan."

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,500
 So Mark McGowan, a.k.a. Chunky Mark,

28
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,400
 he goes by that name.

29
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,600
 That's not something that bullies called him in high school or elementary school or today.

30
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,900
 He goes by Chunky Mark.

31
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,700
 He also now goes by like Taxi Cab Artist.

32
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,500
 Taxi Cab Artist because now he drives a Taxi Cab around UK.

33
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,200
 He shoots YouTube videos, all this stuff.

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,700
 None of that stuff is really important.

35
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,800
 What I found out about this guy was this list.

36
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,600
 He's a performance artist, which is basically I'm an artist,

37
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,000
 but I can't do anything.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 So I just come up with wacky things to do.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,900
 Now, I've seen tons of performance art in my time.

40
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,100
 I've seen just dismal things and I've seen stuff that I didn't think

41
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,900
 the human body was possible to do.

42
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,700
 I'm not going to go into detail what that is,

43
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,900
 but let's look at what Chunky Mark has done.

44
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,900
 So first off, this came out of my new news folder.

45
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:14,900
 I have a folder of much articles from 2004 for a podcast I did back then,

46
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,100
 but I never covered it and I still go through it from time to time.

47
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,900
 In 2004, he had this big groundbreaking performance artist thing

48
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,500
 because there was a bunch of protests about Fox hunting.

49
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,500
 People wanted it.

50
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,900
 A lot of, he says a million people were protesting for a Fox hunting.

51
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,000
 A million people were protesting against Fox hunting,

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,500
 but I live in a housing estate.

53
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,500
 There's a bunch of crack addicts and nobody protests or marches for them.

54
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:45,700
 So to bring attention to the plight of the crack addicts that he lives next to,

55
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,400
 he ate a Fox.

56
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,100
 He eats a Fox, right?

57
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,200
 And he ate a dead Fox.

58
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,000
 He's not chasing it down the street.

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,200
 Ah, ripping its guts out.

60
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,900
 So he eats this Fox and he said, "It's delicious,"

61
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,500
 but he almost threw up a couple of times.

62
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,300
 People were like, "How many meals are delicious yet also make you want to throw up?"

63
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,900
 And he goes, "No, no, no, no, no.

64
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,500
 I was totally finding the Fox,

65
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,500
 but I was surrounded by people who kept going, "Ugh, ugh, ugh."

66
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,500
 I don't know.

67
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,200
 Like, I've never desired to eat a Fox,

68
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,300
 but I want to be grossed out if someone else did.

69
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,700
 I want to be grossed out if I saw someone else eat a cat either.

70
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,100
 I don't know what that...

71
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,100
 I mean, would you?

72
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,200
 Like, I think I'm more grossed out when people eat like squid

73
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,000
 or like someone tried to eat a jellyfish,

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,800
 like put a big straw in and trying to suck it all up,

75
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,300
 get that sweet, sweet jelly out of there.

76
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,900
 That's more gross to me than someone eating a Fox.

77
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,900
 I don't walk around a Japanese sushi restaurant going, "Ugh, ugh, ugh."

78
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,000
 And then I'm like, "I'll take two orders of that sushi, please.

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,200
 Ugh."

80
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,300
 So he does that.

81
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,800
 Now, he also, also in this same article,

82
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,300
 before we get into the list of great stuff he did,

83
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,900
 he ate a swan.

84
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,700
 What you figure, swans are basically just beautiful chickens, right?

85
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,400
 It's the same thing.

86
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,200
 Well, apparently, in the United Kingdom,

87
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,300
 only the queen is allowed to eat a swan.

88
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,800
 Now, I wasn't able to verify whether or not that's an actual law,

89
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,100
 but he ate a swan because to, you know, because,

90
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,000
 "Oh, if only the queen can eat one, then I want to eat one, too."

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,300
 And apparently, there is a bunch of like, just,

92
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,200
 "Oi, oy, oy, cops standing around him as he's eating this one."

93
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,600
 Deciding whether or not to arrest him.

94
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,400
 I believe he did it.

95
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,200
 I just don't know if it's really against the law.

96
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,900
 So he, but, okay, you're like, "Wait a second.

97
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,400
 His name's Chunky Mark.

98
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,900
 He boasts things you've told me about.

99
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,400
 He just eats stuff."

100
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,800
 Is that, "You're just going to tell us about a bunch of eating challenges?"

101
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
 No, no, no, no, no.

102
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,300
 Because that would be boring.

103
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,700
 This guy's done some crazy stuff.

104
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,000
 Let's look at this stuff.

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,300
 In 2002, he had a thing called "Beat the Queen" 2002.

106
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,800
 In case you forgot what year it was, you just go to his exhibit.

107
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,700
 He dressed up as the Queen of England and asked people to punch him in the face.

108
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,900
 Which people complied?

109
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,700
 People beat him up.

110
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,600
 People beat him up.

111
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,000
 That is this guy's level of performance art.

112
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,800
 You're thinking, "I could do that."

113
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,400
 You could.

114
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,200
 You could dress up as a woman and ask people to punch you in the face.

115
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,600
 But, so that's not super imaginative, right?

116
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,000
 Let's rate it on the scale of eating a swan.

117
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,900
 It's not as cool as eating a swan.

118
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,700
 In 2002, he had a thing called "Roll Over."

119
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:14,400
 He wanted to bring attention to the plight of road cleaners during Christmas time.

120
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,400
 That's a very specific, that's a very specific protest to do.

121
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:18,900
 What?

122
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,000
 Look at that guy driving down the road in that road cleaner.

123
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,700
 No one said, "Thanks to him today.

124
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,100
 I'm going to do this."

125
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:30,900
 He put on cleaning gloves and then he rolled down the street singing,

126
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,800
 "We wish you a Merry Christmas.

127
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
 We wish you a Merry Christmas."

128
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,600
 He's rolling down the street for four miles.

129
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,300
 Basically, okay, I'm going to start giving him credit for at least.

130
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,400
 That's above a swan eating.

131
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,500
 That's also like you're driving to work.

132
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,800
 You're like, "We wish you a Merry Christmas."

133
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,500
 I love that to show solidarity with the cleaners.

134
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,700
 He just wears gloves.

135
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,900
 The universal sign of being a cleaner.

136
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,500
 Anyways, he does that.

137
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,300
 Now, you're like, "How can you top that?

138
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,800
 Oh, we're not even getting started."

139
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,600
 Or you're thinking, "Jason, this is super boring.

140
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,000
 I'm going to fast forward through the segment."

141
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,500
 Hey, either or.

142
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,900
 In 2003, it was kind of the same thing.

143
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,000
 He did a thing called monkey nuts.

144
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,300
 Monkey nuts, 2003.

145
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,300
 It's not what you think.

146
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,700
 He's not putting a bib on and being like, "I know what I'm going to eat today."

147
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,300
 No, what he does is he-- a monkey nut is apparently a real nut.

148
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,600
 And he wanted to protest against student loans.

149
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,800
 Not giving-- he's like, "Banks should not loan money to students.

150
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,400
 People should be able to afford their own education."

151
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,200
 It was about like student loan debt and all that stuff.

152
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,100
 He wasn't protesting student loans as a theory.

153
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:40,000
 He put a monkey nut on the ground and from Goldsmith University to Ten Downing Street,

154
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,700
 which is five miles, he rolled the nut down the street just using his nose.

155
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,500
 Now, of course, I'm thinking, "Did he bring his sleeping bag?"

156
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:54,300
 No, what happened was he would only go so far and then he would mark the area and go home

157
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,800
 and watch the telly and eat some bingers and mash.

158
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,000
 The next day, he'd come out, he'd put it back there and he'd keep rolling it.

159
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,300
 You're thinking that's kind of a cheat.

160
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,800
 Well, he has to be able to eat, consume calories to use the bathroom.

161
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,800
 That actually comes up later, but he's doing this.

162
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,200
 It takes him 12 days.

163
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,600
 He goes three-fourth of a mile each day, which he was rolling way faster than that.

164
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,400
 But I guess it's easier to roll your old body than just rolling it.

165
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,300
 By the time he gets to Ten Downing Street, it's been such a spectacle.

166
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,700
 The police are actually cheering for him.

167
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,900
 Come on, you can do it!

168
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,500
 You can do it!

169
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,700
 Chunky Mark.

170
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,600
 Chunky Mark.

171
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,100
 A little teardrops come from his eyes.

172
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,800
 So what did I pick that nickname?

173
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,900
 Chunky Mark.

174
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,000
 Chunky Mark.

175
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,500
 And they gave him tea when he got there.

176
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,900
 Proper British.

177
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,000
 In 2003, there was this Italian food critic who said English food was gross.

178
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,600
 Blech!

179
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,600
 You've already protested, you know, street cleaners, no one's saying thank you to them.

180
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,400
 You've protested student loans, you don't want them anymore.

181
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,300
 Only the rich should be able to go to school.

182
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,000
 So some Italian guy says English food sucks.

183
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 He decides to turn himself into an English breakfast.

184
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,300
 I can't say the word, so just deal with it for the next two minutes.

185
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,200
 Tries to turn himself into an English breakfast.

186
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,400
 So at that point of thinking, is this his last one?

187
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,700
 Does he go to the slaughterhouse and get turned into sausage?

188
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,600
 No.

189
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,700
 Which would have been cool, but not so cool, because then that would have been the end of his career.

190
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:15,500
 He gets a bathtub of baked beans, puts a necklace of sausage around his neck,

191
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,900
 sticks chips up his nose, which everyone else in the world calls French fries,

192
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,500
 and sits there for 12 days and just keeps peeing in it.

193
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,000
 Now that wasn't part of the performance art.

194
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,500
 Part of the performance art wasn't, "Mmm, English food is so good, you can pee in it."

195
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,200
 "It's so delicious, you Canadian."

196
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,900
 Even when it's full of human urine, he just didn't think that far ahead,

197
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,200
 because for 12 days, he'd sit there and he would just pee.

198
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,400
 I believe when he had to go number two, he got out of the baked beans,

199
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,300
 but there's no proof.

200
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,100
 And really, would you... ugh.

201
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,900
 Now I'm making the wretches' noises.

202
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,600
 We're not done.

203
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,900
 We're almost done, though.

204
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,200
 2000... these I think were his two best ones,

205
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,300
 and this was pretty much the end of his career.

206
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,700
 Because everything I felt was a buildup to this.

207
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,000
 I know I ditched the swan rating system.

208
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,700
 Everything was a buildup to these two ones.

209
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,400
 These ones are amazing.

210
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,000
 First off, 2005.

211
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,200
 "On the Road to a Miracle."

212
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,900
 2005.

213
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,700
 It's the name of this art project.

214
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,800
 He knows this drug addict, because, you know, he lives next to a bunch of them.

215
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,800
 Eating a fox didn't relieve all of the...

216
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,200
 all of the addicts in his apartment building,

217
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,100
 but he was just trying to bring attention to them, but he does know one addict.

218
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,700
 And the addict, not an addict,

219
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,100
 he doesn't know a storage unit over a house.

220
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,100
 He's like, "Look at... no, why won't anyone put stuff in this attic?"

221
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,800
 And everyone's like, "What? Stupid."

222
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,700
 He's like, "No, no, no, I mean, why won't anyone put this ADDICT into recovery?"

223
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,000
 They're like, "Oh, okay, that makes sense."

224
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,400
 So, this drug user, as I'll call him, can't get into rehab.

225
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,400
 So, "On the Road to a Miracle, what happened is..."

226
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,500
 This is the drug at... the dang it!

227
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,200
 The drug user lays on the ground.

228
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,400
 Lays on the road, right?

229
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,800
 He's a lot of road stuff here.

230
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,600
 I guess this is good for publicity.

231
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,100
 They're doing it out in a field, no one's gonna know about it.

232
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,900
 This one gets done out in a field all the time, and nobody knows about it.

233
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,700
 Drug user is on the ground, and Chunky Mark walks up

234
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,200
 and kicks the drug addict, and then the drug addict gets up and walks a couple feet

235
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,500
 and then gets back down on the ground.

236
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,100
 And Chunky Mark walks up, kicks the drug addict, drug user,

237
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,400
 walks a couple steps, lays down.

238
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,900
 They do that for seven miles.

239
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,300
 So, it's monkey nuts.

240
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,900
 When instead of a monkey nut, it's a horribly addicted man

241
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,900
 who has nothing to live for, rather than getting kicked down the street.

242
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,300
 And they do it for seven miles.

243
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:33,300
 It took him ten days to go seven miles, 'cause they only moved when he got kicked.

244
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,700
 And I'm assuming it's the same thing as the monkey nut.

245
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,000
 He ate some bangers and mashed and watched the telly.

246
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,600
 The drug addict may have just been so laying there, he could have been like,

247
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,100
 "Hey, I'm gonna mark this," and the guy's like, "No, no, no.

248
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,800
 I'm good here. I'm just gonna sleep."

249
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,400
 Also, you think about it.

250
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,700
 Was he doing drugs when he was getting kicked for ten days?

251
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,000
 Wouldn't that be rehab?

252
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,800
 Like, if you're kicking a dude and he's like, "No, no, no.

253
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,200
 I'm not gonna get him. I'm taking a hit on my meth pipe."

254
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,100
 He kicks him and he swallows the meth.

255
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,300
 He's like, "Ahh."

256
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,900
 Yeah, going ten days without doing drugs isn't that kind of the beginning of rehab.

257
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,500
 Anyways, this one had a happy ending, though.

258
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,600
 Not that he swallowed meth piping, became super meth, man.

259
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,500
 It's the fact that he did get into rehab.

260
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,700
 He kicked him all the way into rehab.

261
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,400
 Now, there's no...

262
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,700
 We don't know if he continued to be in rehab.

263
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,800
 He may have gone into rehab and got off whatever drug it was on

264
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,700
 and then had to go to the ER for severe bruising and they're like,

265
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,600
 "Oh, here's some oxy-coatant. Do you want some?"

266
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,000
 And he's like, "Mmm. I'll try. I'll try."

267
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,400
 Look at the little taste of that opioid.

268
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,300
 We don't know.

269
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:42,000
 But kicking someone for seven miles, he probably did at least need an aspirin for that.

270
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,900
 Finally, 2005, where this is Brighton Rocks.

271
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,400
 Because here's the thing with being a performer.

272
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:52,600
 If you're a painter, you don't paint a sunset and go, "Oof. How am I ever going to top that?"

273
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,200
 I got it. Two suns.

274
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,400
 I'm going to draw two suns coming over an English field.

275
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,500
 If you're a sculpture, not if you're a statue.

276
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,700
 If someone made you in your Ascension statue.

277
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:10,700
 If you're a sculptor and you make this guy, this giant guy with no clothes on holding a spear,

278
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,200
 you go, "Well, that's weird."

279
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,900
 But also, you don't go, "Hmm. How am I going to top that?

280
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,400
 I need to make it even bigger."

281
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,400
 The art is different.

282
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:24,700
 You may be wanting to test little techniques and stuff like that.

283
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,600
 But if you-- Monalisa, guy drew Monal--

284
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,800
 Who drew Monalisa?

285
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,900
 Leonardo eventually draws Monalisa, right?

286
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,400
 And then he doesn't go, "Hmm. You know what? I'm going to draw Monalisa like riding a unicorn."

287
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,000
 That's the painting.

288
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,400
 You don't top yourself.

289
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,600
 Performance art.

290
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,600
 Once he eats a corgi, then he can't be like,

291
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,900
 "I'm going to protest something by like putting an ice cube on my eyeball for three days."

292
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,800
 That'll show them.

293
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,400
 See, he's already kicked drug users, became breakfast.

294
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,900
 He did some other stuff that I already forgot.

295
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,600
 I looked back.

296
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,100
 Oh, he pushed the monkey nut.

297
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,600
 I might have said that already.

298
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,300
 Anyways, so how are you going to do that?

299
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,300
 He does this thing.

300
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,400
 So, again, and also the thing with being performance art.

301
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,500
 If you're just a painter, you're Thomas Concageur, like,

302
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,000
 "Oh, great. Another garden. Oh, great. Another village. Oh, great."

303
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 You're just going to keep painting the same thing over again.

304
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,300
 You know, "Oh, Monalisa, I think I'll draw another chick next time or invent."

305
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,800
 Leonardo DiCaprio earlier.

306
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,600
 Leonardo DiVinci is a bit of a different one,

307
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,700
 because he did all sorts of stuff, but who's some other dude?

308
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,300
 Some other painter that you know of.

309
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,200
 He does the same thing, right?

310
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,100
 Or she.

311
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,800
 Let's not be sexist.

312
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,000
 But performance artists, not only do you have to keep coming up with new stuff,

313
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,400
 you also keep having to come up with new stuff to protest.

314
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:46,400
 You've already got a man into rehab, which is a noble goal.

315
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:52,300
 This one, people are taking, people are visiting the seaside of England

316
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:57,700
 and taking rocks home to put in their gardens.

317
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,000
 Chunky Mark's walking down the street and he's like, "Seize this beautiful garden."

318
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,600
 He's like, "That's sedimentary limestone.

319
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,600
 That only appears on this coast."

320
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,000
 No, no.

321
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,100
 Black Rock.

322
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,000
 Black Rock only comes from Black Rock Beach near the coast.

323
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,600
 No!

324
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,500
 Camera pans up.

325
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,000
 He's in the middle of the city.

326
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,500
 There's just beautifully-cultured gardens, or is it cultivated?

327
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,300
 Gardens everywhere.

328
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,200
 He's had enough.

329
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,100
 He should not be able to take rocks home from the beach.

330
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,600
 So that is this thing he's protesting.

331
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,400
 No, okay.

332
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,500
 There's a lot of ways to protest.

333
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:37,100
 What I would have done is like maybe taken all the rocks and built little statues

334
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,900
 or flooded their gardens with water and put a sign up and says, "Welcome to the beach."

335
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,000
 I mean, both of those are vandalism.

336
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,800
 Both of those are destruction of private property.

337
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,500
 It should show what type of artist I would be.

338
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,600
 Basically a supervillain performance artist.

339
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,600
 What he does is he gets 18 sticks of candy rock.

340
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,900
 So it's like sugar, little sugar rock.

341
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,300
 Tapes him around his face, around his head.

342
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,900
 So basically he's now the representation of a rock.

343
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,600
 Then he takes two.

344
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,000
 That's enough, right?

345
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,900
 Just walk down the street and go, "Don't take me from my house."

346
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,400
 You just walk up to people's gardens and go, "My children, my children,

347
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,400
 they should be at home on the beach with me."

348
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,400
 And just do that very loudly for seven miles.

349
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,000
 No.

350
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 He then takes two 12-pound rocks and attaches them to each ankle.

351
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 So 12-pound rock on one ankle, 12-pound rock on another ankle.

352
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,600
 His face is completely covered up in candy rock.

353
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,400
 He then has a plan.

354
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,400
 He wants to walk from where he's at now to the beach.

355
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,000
 It'll be a big protest how these rocks should be returned to the beach, right?

356
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,800
 But then he goes, "No, no, I'm not going to walk.

357
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,100
 I'm going to cartwheel.

358
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:59,700
 I'm going to do too much cartwheels for 60 miles from here to the beach."

359
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,200
 With two 12-pound rocks attached to each leg.

360
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,800
 His vision completely obscured.

361
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,400
 I imagine the flies and the bees are attacking him every day.

362
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,100
 He wakes up covered in ants.

363
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:15,400
 He makes it only four days of cartwheeling.

364
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:20,600
 This one, it was one of the few ones he quits because his chiropractor told him

365
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,600
 that he was going to have horrible injuries because of it.

366
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,700
 So that is the story of Chunky.

367
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:32,200
 That is the 20-minute long segment that I did not expect to be that long of Chunky Mark.

368
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,200
 But that's it.

369
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,200
 There's no way to edit it.

370
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,500
 It's just the way that it is.

371
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,400
 I'm sure it'll be like five minutes short, so maybe 15 minutes.

372
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,800
 But there you go.

373
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,400
 Let's save the iPad story for tomorrow.

374
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,600
 We definitely don't have time for that.

375
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,800
 So you sent too much time talking about Chunky Mark, but he's a weirdo.

376
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,400
 And I like weirdos and I like profiling weirdos on a story.

377
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,700
 Let's go ahead and go to 1600s Connecticut.

378
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,000
 We're hop on board the Carbner Copture.

379
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,800
 Chunky Mark is mid-cartwheel.

380
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,300
 And he's like, "Oh, my back, my back.

381
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,200
 Oh, hey guys, don't leave me.

382
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,100
 I've given you so much joy for this segment."

383
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,300
 We're like, "Yeah, whatever.

384
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,700
 We're protesting helping performance artists right now."

385
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,500
 So we fly away.

386
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,000
 He's like, "My back, my back."

387
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,300
 As we're flying away, we see a bunch of rocks, a bunch of rocks walking towards them.

388
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,200
 I don't know why they'd be medicine-ly walking towards them.

389
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,500
 They want their children back at home.

390
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,100
 But anyways, that's the end of that segment.

391
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:54,100
 T-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t

392
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,900
 Which we have a lot of trial transcripts for all of the witch trials.

393
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,100
 But this one's a bit different than an actual witch trial.

394
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,000
 This one is something more...

395
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,600
 Let's just get into it.

396
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,300
 George Spencer is not a pleasant human being.

397
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,300
 So let's take a look at this guy, George Spencer.

398
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:18,100
 And I'm going to say almost all the information I got is based on an article called "The Trial of George Spencer."

399
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,100
 It's written by Romeo Vitelli.

400
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,700
 So got to give credit where credits do.

401
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,000
 Thank you so much for writing this article.

402
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,400
 George Spencer is a trouble in town for two reasons.

403
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,500
 One, he's an out-and-out atheist.

404
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,600
 He only reads the Bible.

405
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,200
 You're supposed to read the Bible.

406
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
 It's the new world.

407
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,500
 Everyone's super pious when they come over.

408
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,300
 But he doesn't want anything to do with it.

409
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,800
 His employer has to make him read the Bible.

410
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,200
 You think your boss is bad.

411
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,200
 Has your boss ever made you sit down and read the Bible?

412
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,000
 What?

413
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,900
 It's your 50-minute break, but I better see you reading the story of Job.

414
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,000
 You're like, "Oh, man.

415
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,200
 Talk about eternal suffering. I'm eternal suffering having to stay in this break room."

416
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,400
 Would you say?

417
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,000
 Anyways, he'd mock the Lord openly.

418
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,300
 He's a jerk on top of being an atheist.

419
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,400
 So that's kind of strike two.

420
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,300
 Not saying that being an atheist is strike one, but in that community.

421
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,800
 Very, very religious, regimented community.

422
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,000
 He wouldn't read the Bible.

423
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,700
 His boss wouldn't make him read the Bible.

424
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,500
 And that's another thing.

425
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,800
 Multiple bosses could never keep a job.

426
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:21,800
 He'd be outright blasphemous towards the really only religion being practiced at that time in that area.

427
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:28,600
 He was a jerk overall and then probably his biggest crime in the time of witches and warlocks.

428
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,300
 Horribly ugly.

429
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,400
 Horribly ugly.

430
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,900
 He was just described as being kind of grody looking and he had like a dead eye.

431
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:42,000
 And on top of that, he had an ugly soul in him.

432
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 Right?

433
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,500
 So he's not doing anyone any favors.

434
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:50,900
 The only people he's doing favors to is himself and he would just work at a job and just mouth off.

435
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,500
 He was cussing all the time, being blasphemous.

436
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,200
 He'd get fired.

437
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,300
 He'd go get another job.

438
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,000
 You know, it's funny.

439
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,400
 I get because you would think that the town would just get tired of him and kick him out, but you would think there's not a lot of people over there.

440
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,700
 So you kind of need all the labor you can get.

441
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,100
 Like nowadays, I can go to a job and if I don't go, someone else will fill that job.

442
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:18,100
 But back then, when I say nowadays, I mean pre and post coronavirus right now, most of us don't have jobs.

443
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:27,600
 But as of, you know, pre or post where we're at right now, your job market was pretty, pretty rocking, right?

444
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,700
 But back then, if you only had like 500 people on the continent, you couldn't afford some guys being a jerk.

445
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,500
 You can't be like, you're fired.

446
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,700
 And then your blacksmith business just fails because you're like, no way.

447
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,000
 That guy made a mean joke about Jesus.

448
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,300
 So I'd rather my business fail.

449
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,300
 You didn't have that many people on the continent.

450
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:51,000
 So your unemployment, you had to employ people even if they wore jerks.

451
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,200
 But see, one day this dude who used to work on a farm, he used to work everywhere really.

452
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,500
 This story could have started anywhere.

453
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,000
 But he used to work at this farm and the farmer goes out and he's feeding his cows.

454
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,500
 [Cow moos]

455
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,900
 That cow apparently glued his mouth shut as he was eating too much peanut butter.

456
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,600
 Feeding the chickens.

457
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,300
 [Cow moos]

458
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,000
 And then he goes to feed the pigs.

459
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,700
 [Cow moos]

460
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,300
 And then he notices there's a baby piglet, a little baby running around.

461
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,900
 [Cow moos]

462
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:30,500
 He's like, oh my God, that piglet's disgusting look.

463
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,800
 [Cow moos]

464
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,200
 Starts making retching noises.

465
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,300
 [Cow moos]

466
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,300
 What's wrong with that piglet?

467
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:46,500
 Piglet is hideous and has one dead eye, a white eye just staring out at the farmer.

468
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,200
 [Cow moos]

469
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,800
 His voice changed now that the guy knows that this is an ugly little piggy.

470
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,000
 And he runs to the town and he goes, guys, guys, you gotta see this.

471
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,400
 There's not much going on in New Haven colony.

472
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,200
 There's no television, right?

473
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,900
 So this is like the big news of the day.

474
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,500
 Come on, everyone comes out to his farm.

475
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,800
 Look.

476
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:13,400
 And this little piglet not only has a dead eye like George Spencer,

477
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,800
 but the pig just kind of looks like George.

478
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:22,100
 The pig's face looks like George Spencer's face.

479
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,800
 Everyone's kind of looking at each other.

480
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,200
 They just don't want to look at the pig.

481
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,600
 They don't want to look at the pig.

482
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:32,700
 But I don't have a problem with this little ugly pig.

483
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,100
 We're now taking care of this pig.

484
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,900
 We're kind of feeding it.

485
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,700
 The rest of the townspeople are like, "Dude, George, we're in agreement, right?

486
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,200
 George banged the pig, right?

487
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,300
 Like, we're all in agreement with that."

488
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,800
 Everyone in town goes, "Yeah, yeah, we don't know much about biology.

489
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,200
 We don't even know what biology is because it's 1640s."

490
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,900
 But he used to work here and that pig looks like him

491
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,000
 and has the same dead eye.

492
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,700
 And as we all know, if someone suffers some sort of eye injury in their life,

493
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,700
 their kid will be born with a dead eye, right?

494
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,800
 That's the way it works, right?

495
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,200
 One hand to Joe and the guy with one hand is like, "Yes, all my children have been born with only one hand."

496
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,500
 So he gets arrested, right?

497
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,800
 And he's told, "You got to confess, George.

498
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,100
 Tell us you were banging this pig or things are only going to get worse."

499
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,500
 And you think about what can get worse?

500
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:23,300
 What can get worse than being accused of banging a pig, right?

501
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,000
 But he does.

502
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,300
 He's like, "That's bad enough.

503
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,900
 That's a horrible enough allegation."

504
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,400
 He confesses and then recants.

505
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,700
 He's told to confess again.

506
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:37,200
 And he goes, "Listen, I admit that I lied to people

507
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:43,000
 and I admit that I was blasphemous and I admit that I banged that pig.

508
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,800
 But I'm not gay.

509
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,200
 I'm not banging any dudes."

510
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,200
 Now, what's funny is I don't know if that's an allegation.

511
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,800
 I don't know if they said, "Listen, we know you banged this pig

512
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,400
 and we think you're out banging Indians and other dudes in town."

513
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,600
 Or, and he was just like, "Oh, no, no, I banged the pig, but I didn't do that."

514
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,200
 Or I like to imagine that he's sitting there and they go,

515
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,800
 "We think you've done gross stuff."

516
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,500
 And he's like, "I'll tell you this right now.

517
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,400
 I've lied. I've cheated. I've stolen and I banged that pig.

518
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,800
 But I've never done your brother in the butt."

519
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,300
 They're like, "Well, I didn't accuse you of bringing my brother in the butt."

520
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,000
 Okay, just so we know, I didn't do that.

521
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,700
 I didn't go out there into the wilds and bang a bunch in.

522
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,200
 What, where did you, why are you bringing that up?

523
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,200
 That's what I like to imagine.

524
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,700
 Just even a little more lighthearted.

525
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,500
 But anyways, he eventually denies everything.

526
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,600
 They put him on the stand and he goes, "Nope. I didn't bang the pig.

527
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,900
 I definitely didn't bang those Indian dudes over there."

528
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,100
 They're sitting in the back there like, "Oh, he doesn't rat us out."

529
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,100
 I definitely didn't bang those Indian dudes over there.

530
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,500
 I didn't bang that guy and that guy, but, and I didn't lie either.

531
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,000
 But I lied when I confessed.

532
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,300
 I'm telling the truth now. I didn't do any of this stuff.

533
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:55,400
 Now, back then you needed two witnesses for capital crime, because that's what this was.

534
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,300
 This wasn't 100 lashes and you're let out of the city.

535
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:02,200
 This was the death penalty and the pig had to get killed.

536
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,200
 I'm sorry. I know, I know.

537
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,900
 Hold that little piggy tight.

538
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,000
 The pig had to be killed because that's what it says in the Bible.

539
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,700
 If a man lays with an animal, kill the man, kill the animal, because they're both impure.

540
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,600
 So, you need two witnesses for that.

541
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,700
 But the thing is, is there aren't two witnesses.

542
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,300
 There's just George Spencer.

543
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:25,100
 But the judge goes, "Well, technically..."

544
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,200
 We can figure this out.

545
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,900
 His confession is witness number one.

546
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:36,100
 And his son, that little piglet over there, is witness number two.

547
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,600
 Guilty.

548
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,100
 Aw.

549
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,900
 Now, George Spencer on April 8th, 1642,

550
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:47,000
 he's hung or hanged, whichever it is, I don't care.

551
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 And the piglet was saved by us and nothing bad happened to the piglet.

552
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,100
 The end. It's now living in my apartment.

553
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,600
 That's why my apartment is so messy.

554
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,800
 I want you to meet my roommate, Earl the Piglet.

555
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,500
 Nothing bad. Don't look up.

556
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,900
 Don't go to the show notes.

557
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,800
 Don't click on the link. Nothing bad happened to Earl.

558
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,900
 But what's funny is that's not the end of this story.

559
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:15,200
 Now, you imagine people afterwards thought...

560
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,600
 He probably didn't bang that pig.

561
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:24,500
 Like, afterwards people must have changed their mind about what happened there.

562
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,800
 Because, yes, he had a little deformed pig.

563
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,000
 But then you go, "You know what's funny is I'm sure other people were thinking the whole time,

564
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,800
 "Oh, man, I've banged so many animals on this farm.

565
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,000
 "I hope I don't get arrested for this."

566
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,100
 People were probably banging a lot of animals back then.

567
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,200
 Again, there's only 500 people on the continent.

568
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,300
 There's no television.

569
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,100
 What else are you going to do?

570
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,300
 So I'm sure a lot of them are laid.

571
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,200
 The judge is like, "Whoa."

572
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,900
 Apparently the judge is Rodney Dangerfield.

573
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,300
 They get no respect when I'm banging the cows.

574
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:55,200
 So I'm sure there was probably a moratorium on everyone else banging animals

575
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,300
 for a while because they were afraid something's going to happen.

576
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,700
 The reason why I think there was a change of heart was five years later

577
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:05,300
 in the same colony, New Haven colony,

578
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:10,100
 there is a dude, no joke, named Thomas Hogg,

579
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,700
 who's charged with banging a pig.

580
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,700
 Because the pig, there's a piglet.

581
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,800
 Maybe they had a problem with deformed pigs in this area.

582
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,900
 Maybe there was some old native curse on the area.

583
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:24,500
 Every 10th generation, a pig will be born to look like a local person.

584
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,100
 Thomas Hogg, again, not a very well-liked person.

585
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:27,900
 A piglet is...

586
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,900
 How ugly do you have to be when people keep comparing you to pigs?

587
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:36,000
 Like, to the point of not like you're just like a big guy.

588
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,500
 That piglets actually look like you on a regular basis.

589
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,300
 How horribly deformed do you have to be?

590
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:46,000
 Anyways, Thomas Hogg gets accused of banging this pig.

591
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,300
 This one, they go, "Okay, remember five years ago when we hung that dude over that?

592
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,000
 We need a little more evidence."

593
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,200
 So they are pretty sure they know which pig Thomas Hogg actually had sex with.

594
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:03,000
 So they put all of the hogs, including Thomas Hogg, into a pen.

595
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,600
 And they go, "We want... There's no joke.

596
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,100
 This is actually something they used in trial.

597
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:13,500
 We want you to go up and we want you to start fondling all the female pigs."

598
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:18,200
 And when you get to the one that we know you banged, we want to see how it acts.

599
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,100
 Now, there's a thing called "Jerry by Your Peers."

600
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,700
 There's a thing called "Live Stream Beastiality Poor."

601
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,800
 Like, this is disgusting, right?

602
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,100
 I would not want to be on that Jerry, because you're like, sitting there and you're like,

603
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,200
 "Guys, can we just say this dude's in it?

604
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,000
 I don't want to watch this guy molest and pigs."

605
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,800
 They're like, "Wheels of Justice turn slowly, my friend.

606
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,400
 Wheels of Justice turn slowly."

607
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,700
 You're watching this guy, this deformed man walking around fondling pigs.

608
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,100
 When he gets to the... This is gross.

609
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,400
 So if you happen to be...

610
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,400
 [laughs]

611
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:54,100
 If you happen to be eating anything, this part's pretty gross, okay, guys?

612
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:58,100
 And I honestly can't work my mind around how this is even possible.

613
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,900
 I barely understand how human sexuality works.

614
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,300
 I have no understanding how pig sexuality works.

615
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:08,100
 He's walking around. He gets to the pig that gave birth to the deformed piglet.

616
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,700
 He gets to this pig.

617
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,700
 He does start molesting the pig.

618
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,700
 And then with the quote, "Workings of Lust," whatever that means,

619
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:20,000
 "The female pig, the effects were so extreme that,"

620
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 "she poured out seed before them."

621
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,800
 What in the... What does that mean?

622
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,800
 Like, I get, if you're saying seed with...

623
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,100
 Are they saying that the female pig just started coming everywhere?

624
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:40,200
 Is that really... Is this like a...

625
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,900
 Is that what that means?

626
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,800
 Is that what that... Because guys at that point,

627
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,100
 I don't care if the guy's guilty or innocent. I'm throwing up.

628
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,700
 First off, I'm never going to eat a hot dog again.

629
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,500
 Next day, your family's eating bacon.

630
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,900
 You're like, "Bleh! I don't want it!"

631
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,100
 Gross, dude!

632
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,000
 Mmm, this bacon's extra salty today.

633
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,700
 "Bleh!"

634
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,600
 Anyways... Anyways, so that...

635
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,900
 Now, the first dude, he just confessed and recanted and confessed and recanted,

636
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,800
 and then there was a gross pig and he was killed.

637
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,000
 This guy, he gets to... He molests a bunch of pigs.

638
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,900
 They don't have any reaction whatsoever.

639
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,500
 He gets to the pig that everyone thinks that he banged.

640
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,300
 And it's like, "Oink! Oink!"

641
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,100
 And then, sorry for that sound effect, guys.

642
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,700
 I really, really apologize for that.

643
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,600
 And then it exploded everywhere.

644
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,000
 He doesn't get murdered, which I'm fine with,

645
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,700
 because I don't think the death penalty should be there for a dude banging a pig.

646
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,900
 But...

647
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:40,500
 He gets only convicted of just kind of being a gross dude in general

648
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,500
 and public exposure, because that was another thing.

649
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,600
 This guy would walk around town... I should have said this earlier.

650
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,000
 This guy would walk around town exposing himself to women and children.

651
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,300
 So he was a pervert.

652
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,300
 He was a total pervert to begin with.

653
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,000
 So they charged him, but the bestiality charges were dropped,

654
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:02,200
 even though he made this female pig have an orgasm in the middle of the farm.

655
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,300
 So that is... That's the story of...

656
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:10,800
 A bunch of sicko weirdos in old-timey America.

657
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:16,900
 So that is... That's it! That's the story of justice in the 1600s.

658
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:23,800
 In a time when witchcraft and warlocks and Satan and old-toe-claw-hoof,

659
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,100
 old-split-hoof, that was his name, aka the devil,

660
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,500
 was thought to be walking all around America.

661
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,000
 You had people being convicted for banging animals.

662
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,900
 And the only evidence was gross-looking piglets and piggy mamas having orgasms.

663
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,300
 And there was gross... And we have... You guys needed that?

664
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,000
 You guys needed me to call it gross?

665
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,600
 And we have moved forward as a nation, as a society.

666
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,600
 So the next time you're sitting on a jury trial, you're bored,

667
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,500
 because it's like a civil trial, and some guy's arguing that someone else was using his garage,

668
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,500
 but you know, you're just kind of zoning out, just remember,

669
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,800
 things could be worse, things could be worse, because while you're sitting in that trial,

670
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:12,100
 bored out of your minds, sitting exactly where you were, theoretically, not physically,

671
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:18,100
 hundreds of years ago, a group of men watched a pig have an orgasm

672
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,500
 as a gross-looking dude molested it.

673
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:26,600
 Count your blessings, people. Count your blessings.

674
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,400
