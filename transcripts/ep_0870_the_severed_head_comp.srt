1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,560
 The world is full of stories involving cursed objects.

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:18,160
 Well recently, I came to possess what could possibly be a blessed object.

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:25,760
 And then we meet a young woman who lives every day of her life in fear.

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:33,240
 Her stepmother embodies all of the worst stereotypes of the fairy tale evil stepmother.

5
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:40,240
 She's brutal, she's insane, and she wields dark magic.

6
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,800
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:53,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,600
 I'm your host Jason Carbiner, I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,040
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,200
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun.

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,440
 Just so, just so, just for full disclosure, I'm recording this episode just minutes after

12
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,280
 I recorded yesterday's episode.

13
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,680
 And so if you didn't listen to yesterday's episode, there was a ghost in the recording

14
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,680
 studio.

15
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,680
 There was a ghost in the haunted closet.

16
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,680
 And the only reason I'm telling you that is because I'm still a little jumpy.

17
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,400
 I went for a little walk, but I'm still a little jumpy.

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,280
 So if this episode just abruptly ends, that's why.

19
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,420
 Because I wet my pants and I ran away.

20
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,240
 But someone who never runs away from a fight, walking in right now as a self-proclaimed dead

21
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,120
 rabbit grandmother monster, give it up for Bonnie.

22
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,640
 Yeah, Bonnie, come on in.

23
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,920
 Woo, yeah, come on in, give her high fives.

24
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,440
 Bonnie, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

25
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,920
 If you guys can't support the show financially, I totally understand just help spread the

26
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,240
 word about the rabbit radio.

27
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,480
 That really, really helps out a lot.

28
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,240
 And speaking of that, Bonnie's coming in with two of her buddies, Mark and Echo.

29
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,480
 They actually were recommending the show to her.

30
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,800
 So thank you so much, getting the word out really, really does help.

31
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:11,240
 So Bonnie is the captain this episode, but Mark and Echo, you can both be second in command.

32
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,520
 You can fight over who's wearing the cute little second in command outfit.

33
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,520
 It's a Donald Duck outfit.

34
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,320
 Bonnie, we're gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the dead rabbit dirgeable.

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,160
 We're leaving behind dead rabbit command.

36
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,080
 We are headed all the way out to my place.

37
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,200
 I guess we're just circling the dirgeable around dead rabbit radio.

38
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,520
 I know it's not the most spectacular journey, but I wanted to talk about this.

39
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:39,240
 So I want to be honest with you guys, there's a lot of stuff that I do and I've done that

40
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,560
 I don't talk about on this podcast and it's actually related to the podcast.

41
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,480
 I still am pretty active in paranormal investigations on the ground, paranormal investigations, not

42
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,280
 as much as I would like to be.

43
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,240
 And then there are other stories that have happened to me in the past.

44
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:58,160
 They're either just too bizarre to talk about or I don't really know how to classify them.

45
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,080
 So there's a lot of stuff that I've done and continue to do that I don't talk about on

46
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,040
 the show because I just don't really even know how to broach it.

47
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,720
 And so this is something that I've had in my possession for a couple of weeks and I've

48
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,400
 wanted to talk to you guys about it, but there's not a lot of information I can reveal about

49
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,400
 it.

50
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,480
 It puts me in a tight spot, but it's fascinating.

51
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,200
 Absolutely fascinating.

52
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:30,040
 I have come into possession of what I can only describe as a blessed object.

53
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,600
 It's a wood carving.

54
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,120
 It's a single block of wood.

55
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,120
 I'll take a photo of it.

56
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,760
 We'll use it for the image for this episode.

57
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:42,240
 It's a single block of wood that someone carved in the image of the pioneer church.

58
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,960
 That's a very famous, very old church in Portland, Oregon.

59
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,960
 Let me go grab it.

60
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,440
 I didn't want to bring it into the closet because this thing's crazy.

61
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,600
 Let me go get it real quick because I got to get you some more information on it.

62
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,200
 It is, let me sit down.

63
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,240
 I need to leave the door open for a little light.

64
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:05,640
 It is a wood carving of the pioneer church that was established in 1851 in Portland.

65
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,400
 It's really called the St. John's Episcopal Church.

66
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:17,080
 And this piece of art was made by Kent R. Smith in October of 1987.

67
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:26,080
 And due to ongoing investigations and due to people not wanting me to reveal a lot about

68
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,080
 this piece, I can't tell you where I got it.

69
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,200
 I can't tell you how I got it.

70
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:41,720
 And I can't even tell you about the miracle I witnessed with my own eyes in the vicinity

71
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,640
 of this.

72
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:52,400
 But this truly does seem like I'm going to have to take my word for it.

73
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,160
 And hopefully I've earned that trust from you.

74
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,520
 This is a blessed object.

75
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,880
 I watched this perform a miracle.

76
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,480
 And I don't know specifically what I am going to do with it.

77
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,640
 I am bringing it to the McMinemans UFO Festival May 14th.

78
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,760
 I will be there at a vendor booth.

79
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,000
 DeadRabber Radio will have a vendor booth.

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,680
 And we're going to have this object as well as some of the haunted objects I've collected

81
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,680
 over the years.

82
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,200
 The Veronica the Haunted doll will be there.

83
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,160
 And then I have some paintings that whether or not those are haunted or those claims are

84
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,160
 dubious.

85
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,120
 I've never been able to investigate those myself.

86
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
 But I'm bringing them.

87
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,360
 And you'll be able to touch these items.

88
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,720
 You just don't want to touch your haunted doll.

89
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,120
 Maybe I'll touch your painting though.

90
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,280
 But you'll be able to touch this.

91
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,160
 And I don't really know how to classify this.

92
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,560
 I watched this work a miracle.

93
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,360
 That's one of the things when you do on the ground paranormal investigations and even

94
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,040
 not on the ground in paranormal investigations.

95
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,800
 Again being as honest as I can be with you guys.

96
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,840
 I've covered stories and have been contacted by high ranking people.

97
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,520
 This story was a UFO story.

98
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:08,160
 And I was contacted by a highly established expert in the UFO community.

99
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,280
 To reveal more information about that story.

100
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,040
 And I actually turned that down.

101
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,960
 I actually turned that down.

102
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,200
 And again I'm not going to reveal who it was.

103
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,680
 But the reason why I turned it down.

104
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,320
 It was because they wanted to give me more information.

105
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,640
 And they said but this information is just for you.

106
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,600
 You can't share it with anybody.

107
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,840
 And I responded back to them.

108
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,320
 I said I appreciate the offer.

109
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:40,480
 But the research I do now is to share with other people.

110
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,560
 So I won't tell anyone who you are.

111
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,120
 Like I won't say your specific name that you contacted me.

112
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,440
 But that's the type of researcher I am now.

113
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,840
 Now I used to be a researcher where I would just find the information to find the information.

114
00:06:52,840 --> 00:07:01,720
 And I've met some very, very diverse group of people.

115
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,160
 I have contacted over the years.

116
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,520
 Remember I'm doing this podcast.

117
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,200
 This podcast has been around for four years.

118
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,200
 I really love it.

119
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,680
 I've been doing paranormal conspiracy research for 30 years.

120
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,680
 I'm 45.

121
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,680
 It's been more than that.

122
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,080
 I mean when I was 12 I was just reading books.

123
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,560
 That's all you had back then.

124
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,600
 But in my 20s I was doing interviews.

125
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
 I'm a journalist.

126
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:25,680
 That was where I get that was my that was my area of study in college was my journalism.

127
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,360
 So I would I would do interviews with people.

128
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,080
 That knowledge they were giving me again not to tell anyone but I was on a journey for

129
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,080
 knowledge.

130
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,760
 But I've been contacted by people in the UFO field.

131
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,160
 This one in particular and he wanted to give me some additional information but I couldn't

132
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,160
 tell anyone.

133
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:51,080
 And it's interesting as that was right is that offer was I said that's not the research

134
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,840
 I do right now I do research to share with people but you do run into that when you are

135
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,120
 a paranormal researcher and I know a lot of you guys just listen to the show for entertainment.

136
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:05,080
 And some of you want to be UFO paranormal researchers and I'll tell you this.

137
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,720
 Keep your mouth shut.

138
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:14,920
 When you talk to people and they say this is off the record no matter how juicy it is

139
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,960
 you do not share it.

140
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,200
 That is just a rule that you should have going into it.

141
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:30,800
 So when I was giving this piece and I saw its effects and all of that stuff I cannot

142
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,000
 and will not reveal that information.

143
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,720
 I also got to say this too one morning I woke up and I got an Eve this is awesome.

144
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,920
 I'll tell you this guy's name.

145
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:49,720
 I got an email I woke up one morning to an email from Lucas Haney Lucas Haney hopefully

146
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,160
 I'm pronouncing your name right hopefully I pronounce everyone's name right.

147
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,080
 Lucas Haney was the director of the movie Mope.

148
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,880
 I did a whole segment on that I did a dead rabbit recommends on that movie and then I

149
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,240
 did a whole segment on it and he emailed me and that was really dope a friend of his

150
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,840
 listens to the podcast and passed it on to him.

151
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,880
 So I get cool emails as well.

152
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,880
 That was awesome.

153
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,080
 When I looked at that email and I woke up I got I know this name from somewhere I'm

154
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:20,200
 familiar with his name and I still recommend Mope it's such a fantastic film.

155
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,120
 So I can reveal stuff like that but there are stories that I can't talk about and this

156
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,720
 is one of them.

157
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,360
 This object is blessed.

158
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,400
 I don't know how it works.

159
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,520
 I don't know when it works.

160
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,560
 I haven't I haven't been able to replicate anything.

161
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,120
 I will say this.

162
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:49,280
 I don't blame it for the ghost whatever I saw yesterday in my closet but things do seem

163
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:53,080
 to be weirder now that this is in my possession.

164
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,200
 I'm holding it right now.

165
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,480
 So yeah very very odd piece.

166
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,240
 It will be this isn't an advertisement.

167
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,160
 This isn't just an advertisement for the UFO Fest but it will be there.

168
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,680
 It's a fascinating piece of work of just artistry.

169
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:14,400
 You'll see it in the in the photo and then yes it it I've seen more evidence that this

170
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:21,520
 is a blessed object than I have seen my other objects being haunted including Veronica the

171
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,760
 doll I bought it on eBay as a haunted doll.

172
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:30,120
 No knock against you Veronica at all but I haven't none of the paranormal phenomenon

173
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:37,080
 that was supposed to be associated associated with Veronica's popped up but this is blessed

174
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,080
 in some way.

175
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,920
 I don't know how to access it.

176
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:46,440
 I don't know how it works or why it works and I think these objects are far more rare.

177
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,480
 I think these I mean you have people making fake haunted dolls and you have people making

178
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,400
 fake blessed stuff you know by the stone will give you good luck but in the natural world

179
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,360
 where this stuff actually may exist I think blessed objects are quite rare.

180
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,280
 But yeah I wanted to share that with you if I'm able to document anything now that it's

181
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:11,520
 in my possession now anything that I see or anything that is experienced with I can pass

182
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,080
 on to you.

183
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,640
 Fascinating relic could just be a block of wood but again I saw what could only only

184
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:27,560
 be described as a miracle that was performed when somebody held this but again I don't

185
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,720
 know how to access it I mean wouldn't it be amazing if this could you know heal people

186
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:38,400
 or but how do you get it to work.

187
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,160
 Anyways so that is here now I'm gonna take it out I'm taking it back out of the closet

188
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,760
 this closet is some sort of vortex it really is.

189
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:54,400
 I hope that story wasn't too anticlimactic for you I don't even know if you classified

190
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,360
 as a story it was I can't tell you this but I have it but we'll see what happens again

191
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,640
 a blessed object I really do believe they're quite rare.

192
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,600
 Bonnie go ahead and we're gonna jump out of the dead rabbit dirgeable it was just tethered

193
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,280
 it was tethered to dead rabbit command we weren't taking it anywhere Mark and Echo are

194
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,820
 still fighting over the Donald Duck outfit and I'm gonna toss you the keys to the carbonar

195
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:18,440
 cocktail we're leaving behind dead rabbit command and we're headed all the way out to

196
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:25,920
 an old house.

197
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,720
 I found this fascinating story posted online the other day and to do a little bit of setup

198
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:40,560
 the person who's telling the story is a grandchild this grandchild who has a mom and has a grandma

199
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,220
 and he says my grandma is one of the nicest women you could ever meet like she's this

200
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:51,340
 tiny little like four foot nine little old grandma that kind of dotes on you she's just

201
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,580
 type of woman anyone would want for their grandma you're looking at your grandma right

202
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:59,540
 now you're like oh you're five six loser I want a four foot nine grandma get out of here

203
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:03,380
 but you know just personality talking about physically right you're like oh I always had

204
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:09,500
 a tiny grandma I put her in my backpack like baby Yoda and he goes my grandma was always

205
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:17,120
 super nice and just very caring and my mom said the reason why grandma is so nice is

206
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:25,200
 she was raised by a literal evil stepmother and so this guy is writing this story he posted

207
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,040
 it online but he's telling it from the point of view of his grandmother and so we don't

208
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,920
 have a location this is all anonymous right but we're gonna call the grandmother Sarah

209
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,820
 and we're gonna call the stepmother Margaret we're going back in time here we don't have

210
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:47,220
 a time period don't have a location but Sarah is a young girl and she's being raised pretty

211
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:54,500
 much at this point by her stepmother Sarah's mom passed away and Sarah's dad his work required

212
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:01,140
 him to travel for weeks at a time so in this household it was often just the stepmother

213
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:08,360
 and Sarah this house seems to be in a relatively secluded location it's surrounded by a forest

214
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,800
 and there's a river about five miles away that's the second closest water source is five miles

215
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:21,080
 away this river the nearest water source is a well well in the backyard of the house but

216
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:27,800
 Sarah wasn't allowed to get water out of the well the stepmom was so just cruel she wouldn't

217
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,240
 let Sarah use the well she would tell Sarah that she'd have to walk down to the river

218
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,620
 and she would tell Sarah you can't drink any water that's a delicious delicious water

219
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:45,220
 you can't drink any of it and you can't spill a drop and I'll know if you spill a drop even

220
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:57,780
 just a drop I will know Sarah because the head will tell me the stepmother often used

221
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:04,840
 this as a ploy to get Sarah to cower in fear and to do whatever she wanted stepmother said

222
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:10,760
 that she had a severed head that she spoke to and the severed head knew everything and

223
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:17,080
 saw everything and with the knowledge the severed head gave the stepmother she would

224
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:25,600
 dish out cruel punishments to Sarah now if Sarah disobeyed she got beat by the stepmother

225
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,980
 if Sarah was bringing the water back and she took a drink or she spilled some she got beat

226
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:36,180
 by the stepmother because the head told her that she had spilled some water but Sarah quickly

227
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:41,760
 learned it didn't matter what she did even if she didn't spill a drop of water even if

228
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:48,980
 she did everything this cruel woman said she'd still get beat because she's a cruel stepmom

229
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:57,800
 right she's just a sadistic freak so it didn't matter what she did right but Sarah was also

230
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:03,900
 constantly on edge because for a child and to never lie for a child to never disobey for

231
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:09,920
 a child to do everything right but make a mistake right aligning and disobeying you do on purpose

232
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:16,640
 but just making a mistake and the head told me you did that Sarah would have to wonder

233
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:24,700
 how did my stepmother know so Sarah starts to buy into this idea that there's a severed

234
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:32,860
 head somewhere the stepmom is talking to but as Sarah gets older she starts to not believe

235
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:37,660
 the story right it sounds like poppycock sounds like something out of a fairy tale as Sarah

236
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:41,620
 gets older not only does she stop believing in the head so much but she also starts to

237
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:46,180
 become more assertive again that's something that kids do they're going to rebel against

238
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:51,360
 authority figures but the beatings never stopped it wasn't that she got more assertive and

239
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,480
 the stepmother got scared the beatings still continued but Sarah began sticking up for

240
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,600
 herself a little more and the stepmother was taking notice of this one day the stepmother

241
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:11,280
 says do you want to know how I got the severed head I was married before your father and

242
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:22,500
 one day these bandits came to our house my husband was sleeping they took him out first

243
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:30,740
 had a razor and a slittest throat while he was laying next to me I wake up and there

244
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:37,300
 they are these bandits trying to get our riches and take care of any problem that could present

245
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:41,760
 itself so they killed him and now they're going to kill me and they came at me with

246
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:52,800
 razors and the stepmother showed Sarah her arms the stepmother's arms had long scars

247
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:59,280
 in her flesh she says the bandits came to me and they sliced my arms open and they sliced

248
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:09,700
 at my legs but I got away I ran out into the night and got away the authorities never

249
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:20,900
 caught the bandits because in truth there were no bandits one night I took a razor to

250
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:29,400
 my own husband's neck and slit it open while he slept spilling warm blood all over our

251
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:36,320
 shared bed and then I took that same razor and sliced the cuts into my arms into my

252
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:42,600
 legs and you can see those cuts can't you Sarah you can see what I'm willing to do to

253
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:50,520
 get what I want I slit his throat I told people that the bandits had attacked us and they

254
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:59,060
 believed me and then when I was in the clear I dug up my husband's body and took off his

255
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:09,420
 head and that is the severed head I talked to that is the severed head that knows everything

256
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:19,140
 because it's watching you and if you're not careful I'll do the same thing to your father

257
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:28,880
 I'll slit his throat while he sleeps and cut off his head and use it as another dark instrument

258
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:40,360
 in fact maybe I'll take your head off too Sarah ran out of the house tears streaming

259
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:47,580
 down her face as her stepmother's laughter echoed throughout the house and Sarah took

260
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:54,660
 off and ran across the field and ran into the forest and she ran and she ran until she

261
00:19:54,660 --> 00:20:06,820
 collapsed and later there crying herself in panic in fear in hopelessness she had no escape

262
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:15,140
 from this woman and now she knew how truly evil her stepmother was Sarah laid against

263
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:28,500
 the tree in that forest and cried and cried and cried until she cried herself asleep

264
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:39,740
 Sarah woke up hours later forest was dark she had no idea what time it was but she knew

265
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:46,980
 she was going to get beat up for staying out too late and she comes up with this plan she

266
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:52,980
 goes maybe I can sneak into the house maybe I can get up into my room stepmother will

267
00:20:52,980 --> 00:21:02,540
 never even know that I was missing for a couple hours unless she talks to the head Sarah began

268
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:07,140
 to creep back through the forest and she's kind of making a big circle around so now

269
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:13,100
 she's coming up to the back of a house and she's moving through the the moonlit branches

270
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:19,500
 walking towards her house and if her plan does not go off well she's walking towards

271
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:28,780
 a beating and as she approaches the back of the house she sees someone standing next to

272
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:35,260
 the well the silhouette is obviously her stepmother she's standing back of the well but Sarah can't

273
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:39,340
 figure out why she would be there was she looking for her did the head tell her that

274
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:45,500
 she was going to be coming through the back of the forest trying to sneak in but as Sarah

275
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:55,580
 began to move slower and quieter through the tree line she hears her stepmother talking

276
00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:04,460
 and then she hears another voice answer she ducks down she's in the bushes now and she's

277
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:13,500
 watching the silhouette of her stepmother at the well talking and then a very deep very

278
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:25,260
 slow speaking male voice is answering and Sarah goes I don't really understand what

279
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:33,060
 my stepmom was asking she the questions didn't make any sense she was asking these questions

280
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:42,620
 that seemed just so bizarre and then she would hear this deep male voice respond she has to

281
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:52,300
 be talking to the head and that head knows I'm here I'm so close I can hear them and

282
00:22:52,300 --> 00:23:02,500
 while my stepmom couldn't see me I'm hidden the head knows everything Sarah's terrified

283
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:08,220
 she's waiting at any moment for the stepmom to turn around for her eyes to search through

284
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:16,700
 the darkness of the forest looking for Sarah but nothing happens Sarah just continues to

285
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:24,380
 hide and listens in on this conversation but curiosity starts to get the best of Sarah

286
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:34,820
 she's hearing this other voice I need to see the head I need to see it I need to know I

287
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:42,540
 need to know this thing is held my life in torment for so long I have to see what's going

288
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:53,540
 on so Sarah gets down on her belly begins crawling across the dirt trying to remain

289
00:23:53,540 --> 00:24:17,020
 unseen but trying to get closer trying to catch a glimpse someone is watching Sarah freezes

290
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:27,620
 the stepmother ducks down behind the well a few moments pass Sarah is perfectly still

291
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:32,700
 she sees her stepmother's head kind of pop up from behind the well and kind of scan the

292
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:46,740
 area looking for someone the stepmother doesn't see anybody and she hurries off into the house

293
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:53,860
 Sarah is laying perfectly still her fear now is that the stepmother in the house has a

294
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:59,380
 better vantage point of the field she can be hidden in any of those windows on this

295
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:08,980
 estate looking out watching for a movement Sarah is petrified but then Sarah has another

296
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:21,940
 thought I think she left the head behind Sarah waits there in the darkness too scared to

297
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:29,500
 move but she has to know she begins crawling out of the forest she's crawling across the

298
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:34,220
 field and she's inching ever so closer to this well afraid that her stepmother will

299
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:40,820
 spy her at any moment he come running out but no one leaves that house and Sarah is

300
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:49,580
 able to crawl all the way to the well and she sees a pile there pile of dead grass pile

301
00:25:49,580 --> 00:26:02,140
 of dead leaves she reaches her hand into this pile and she finds a handle slowly opens it

302
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:09,740
 there's a secret compartment right next to this well it's about two feet deep and inside

303
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:19,580
 of it is a wooden box has to be the head Sarah thinks has to be the head and even though

304
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:25,100
 she wanted to get a glimpse of it when she was in the trees now that she's next to it

305
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:34,020
 now that it's in her possession she does not want to open the box but she does look at

306
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:40,060
 the box lifted up it's heavy heavier than she would have thought it was she lifts the

307
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:47,940
 box up and she goes hello there's no response Sarah knows that she needs to get rid of this

308
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:59,540
 whatever's in this box probably but she's still in a quandary she's in an exposed field

309
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:06,620
 and she's carrying a black magic relic she's still just a kid if that stepmom comes running

310
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:11,340
 out of that house Sarah's gonna get beat down and if the mom comes out with a weapon Sarah

311
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:20,460
 will become a head in a box buried next to a well a soulless form trapped by sorcery

312
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:31,700
 a slave to an evil woman's demented wishes Sarah grabs this box and she starts crawling

313
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:42,020
 again she's dragging it across the soil dragging it back into the forest and once she is hidden

314
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:48,740
 by the dark shadows of the trees she begins to run through the forest carrying this box

315
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:54,460
 with her and she stuffs it into a hollow of a tree and there it'll have to wait she has

316
00:27:54,460 --> 00:28:04,660
 to get back home Sarah goes home and her stepmom is awake just sitting there the stepmom goes

317
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:13,620
 where have you been Sarah goes I was crying I was crying I ran out in the forest and I

318
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:19,980
 cried to myself to sleep and the stepmother just told her go to your room and as Sarah

319
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:27,500
 is walking to her room she realizes that this is uncharacteristic for her stepmother generally

320
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:33,740
 she'd get beat up she's not missing it but generally she would get beat up or at the

321
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:38,900
 very least the stepmother would have said I'm going to talk to that head and if he tells

322
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:46,100
 me you're lying you're gonna get beat up it was either always physical violence or threats

323
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:53,740
 of physical violence but this night the stepmother just told her to go to bed the next day passes

324
00:28:53,740 --> 00:29:03,540
 uneventfully but when the sun sets and the moon rises when night has fallen on this estate

325
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:09,620
 Sarah sneaks back out of the house this time she's prepared she's standing in front of

326
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:16,900
 that hollowed out tree and that wooden box is still sitting there but still she can't

327
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:29,660
 bring herself to open the box instead she destroys it she sets the tree on fire and watches the

328
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:41,700
 flames devour its branches watches the fire destroy the box and she stood there and watched

329
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:51,580
 until the flames died out until the box was destroyed the next morning she woke up her

330
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:59,620
 stepmother was still in bed it's unusual so Sarah went into the stepmother's bedroom

331
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:09,620
 and there the stepmother laid she was sick she was frail she seemed broken and as Sarah

332
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:17,380
 was walking towards the stepmother's bed she gets a good look at her face she said it looked

333
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:23,420
 like her face had been warped she said it seemed like her mouth was on one side of her

334
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:29,940
 face not the front side that's where everyone's mouth is it's like she's laying down and her

335
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:35,420
 face is like just warped and her lips look like they've been moved across her face now

336
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:39,300
 obviously nowadays that looks like a stroke right that's what I'm thinking when I'm reading

337
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:43,860
 this is the stepmother had a stroke and maybe she did maybe she didn't have a stroke we don't

338
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:48,180
 know the medical reasons for this but after that morning the stepmother never recovered

339
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:58,300
 to her full health she was always frail after that she was always weak and Sarah said at

340
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:04,100
 that point the brute cutting and Sarah said at that point the beatings pretty much stopped

341
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:08,780
 Sarah said she never opened the box and she never knew for sure that there was a head

342
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:14,660
 there she said when she went back to the location at a later time she saw no bones there there's

343
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:22,220
 no sign of a human debris so even she in her own mind knows what a skeptic would say you

344
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:26,260
 never looked in there there might have never been a head in there could have just been

345
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:30,540
 some boogeyman that she made up that's a logical answer right I know that story sounds like

346
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:36,300
 a fairy tale that'd be the logical answer and she said you're right I never did look

347
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:43,580
 in the box I had two opportunities to and I couldn't bring myself to opening it I didn't

348
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:53,500
 with my own eyes see there was a head in that box but I know what I heard at the well she

349
00:31:53,500 --> 00:32:01,500
 wasn't alone out there a terrifying story of gothic horror right I mean obviously this

350
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:06,340
 could be fiction someone could have written this and it's all made up it's presented as

351
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:11,660
 a true story but the world of the paranormal this stuff tracks I'm have this blessed object

352
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:16,820
 in my house and this would be the opposite this would be a cursed object an object created

353
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:24,580
 for murder to spread mayhem like you literally can't get more of a cursed object than that

354
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:35,980
 this man's soul cut this man's essence trapped in this dried up severed head forced to tell

355
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:43,820
 this evil woman the sins of a young girl just a terrifying story really does harken

356
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:51,580
 back to the days of old pagan magic but the thing about old pagan magic is that you sure

357
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:56,340
 you can kill everyone who practiced it back then and you can destroy all of their sacred

358
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:00,860
 sites you can wipe them from the history books but if you killed every mathematician on the

359
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:09,100
 planet and burned every math book the math still exists and eventually someone will

360
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:14,020
 rediscover it just like it was discovered in the first place someone will rediscover

361
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:22,220
 it and just how the old magic and the old ways were wiped out as advancing religions

362
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:30,420
 moved into areas and just completely annihilated anyone who practiced these old ways the magic

363
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:39,300
 is still there the old ways still exist we just don't know about them you can wipe out

364
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:48,940
 the worshiper but you can't wipe out the mechanics of the spell casting now it's possible that

365
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:54,580
 this was just a ploy it's possible that the stepmother weaved this story all these years

366
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:59,820
 to just keep Sarah under her thumb it's possible even that the stepmother was more crazy than

367
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:05,940
 we think she was and she was doing both voices that's not completely unheard of either but

368
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:13,060
 then how would she know all of the ways that Sarah had done bad things had lied had made

369
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:20,340
 mistakes how would she have known that this story is just another reminder that in the

370
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:27,420
 world of the paranormal there are fates worse than death in the real world there's some

371
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:35,420
 pretty grizzly ways to die but you die and that's it but in the world of the paranormal

372
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:44,380
 you could live your life a good man and then one night wake up choking on your own blood

373
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:51,660
 because your wife slit through your throat with your own razor and as the world fades

374
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:59,900
 the black and then that white tunnel appears in the distance of this void you find yourself

375
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:08,060
 moving on to the afterlife but your journey towards the next step in reality is interrupted

376
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:17,980
 by the sounds of your wife's voice chanting unknown words the next thing you know that

377
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:28,100
 white light disappears and now you're just lost in the void a robust man turned into

378
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:37,380
 a head in a box an earthly prison of wood and dirt and dead leaves is what separates

379
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:51,500
 this man from entering paradise black magic kept him alive and a brave young girl freed

380
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:59,700
 him the severed head never directly talked to Sarah but if it could say anything to her

381
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:26,860
 I think it would say thank you.

382
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:51,980
 Thank you.

383
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,560
 (upbeat music)
