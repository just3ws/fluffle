1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
 the luckiest murder suspect ever.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,000
 And then we travel to Iraq when the second Iraq war starts.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,600
 Divisions of troops are moving through the desert to secure Haditha Dam.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:19,300
 Some people believe they were there to make sure that Sinom's forces did not destroy the dam,

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,400
 causing an ecological disaster.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,000
 While other people believe they were there to secure the dam,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,600
 so the four horsemen of the apocalypse would not rise from their prison.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,600
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:40,100
 [Music]

10
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,100
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,100
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,600
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,100
 Hope you guys are looking forward to Black Friday.

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,800
 If you're in America, buying some of that sweet, sweet stuff.

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:01:01,400
 They're selling flat screen television sets for $198, 58-inch flat screened for $198.

16
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,400
 And I'm like, "Whoa!" at Walmart.

17
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,400
 I'm like, "Whoa!" That's amazing.

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,100
 And then I realize I have nowhere in my place to put a 58-inch television.

19
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,600
 My television's 19 inches.

20
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,600
 Has nothing to do with anything we're about to talk about.

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,200
 But this does, this does have something we have to talk about.

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,900
 Ten episodes left until I take the week-long season break.

23
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,500
 So we got ten episodes left of season seven-two.

24
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,300
 We're still looking at doing the Thanksgiving streaming special.

25
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:36,200
 But there's two things that I have to figure out before I commit to doing anything more than like a half hour.

26
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,200
 I need to figure out some technical things.

27
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,700
 I need to figure out how to make the mic sound better.

28
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:46,600
 And I need to figure out how what I'm watching on screen you guys can hear the sound too.

29
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,600
 If I can't figure those two things out, I will do a live stream, but it's gonna be much, much shorter than I'm planning.

30
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,800
 If I can figure those things out, so if you guys know anything about that stuff, go ahead and email me.

31
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,800
 I'm using LogiCapture software for the stream.

32
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,800
 And I have different mics that I can fiddle around with.

33
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,900
 But if you guys know any way to get the noise canceling going on a live stream,

34
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,600
 because I think the mic quality just sucks so badly, I don't even want to put it out there.

35
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,200
 Or the technical side of getting what I watch on the screen for you guys to hear it as well.

36
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,500
 Hit me up, DeadRabbitRadio@gmail.com.

37
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,500
 I'm open to all those suggestions.

38
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,500
 So, here we go though.

39
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,000
 Let's talk about the episode.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Let's stop pitching stuff for Walmart.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,500
 Or trying to get free technical help from Geek Squad at Best Buy.

42
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,000
 I'm just gonna pitch everyone today.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,500
 Good guys.

44
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,500
 You guys remember good guys?

45
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,500
 I used to work for Circuit City back in the day.

46
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
 Oh, dude.

47
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,000
 You know, this might be considered a real life conspiracy theory.

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,500
 When I worked at Circuit City in Sacramento, there was, we were right next to a bus stop.

49
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,500
 And not only were we right next to a bus stop,

50
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,500
 but we were right next to a nexus bus stop.

51
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,500
 One of the main bus stops in Citrus Heights.

52
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,500
 And every so often, there was an incident at Circuit City.

53
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,500
 Now, of course, we had the standard shoplifting and stuff like that.

54
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,500
 But every so often, a guy would go into the minstrelstroom.

55
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,500
 This guy would sneak in like a little pink panther thief,

56
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,500
 and he would poop all over the handicapped stall.

57
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,500
 He'd go in there and he would just smear his feces all over the walls.

58
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,500
 And sneak out.

59
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,500
 He did this successfully for like a year and a half, two years.

60
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,500
 We could never catch the guy.

61
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,500
 He was called the mad, I'ma call him the mad pooper,

62
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,500
 because this is a more family-appropriate podcast,

63
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,500
 even though the subject matter doesn't always bear it out language-wise, though.

64
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,500
 The mad pooper, he would take poops his own, preferably,

65
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,500
 not preferably, I'm assuming, is that a word?

66
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,500
 Whatever.

67
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,500
 I'm assuming it was his own poop.

68
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,500
 I'm assuming he didn't get other homeless people's poop.

69
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,500
 He didn't gather it all.

70
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,500
 He's like, "Put it in the bag, guys.

71
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,500
 I'm going to Circuit City."

72
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,500
 Walking around with a big nap sack full of this.

73
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,500
 But anyways, he would smear it all over, and you would know,

74
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,500
 because you would walk in as someone who worked there or as a shopper,

75
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:05,500
 and you'd open the door and you would be hit with the overwhelming smell of warm human feces.

76
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,500
 "Ugh, ugh, you come out.

77
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,500
 You're like, he struck again.

78
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,500
 He struck again a guy that we employed a guy there.

79
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,500
 Just swing a bell.

80
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,500
 Dung-dung.

81
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,500
 Dung-dung.

82
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,500
 Everyone would start shutting the doors.

83
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,500
 Old women would be taking their kids to the electronics department.

84
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,500
 They're like, "Stay here.

85
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,500
 He might still be in the store.

86
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,500
 He's back.

87
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,500
 Dung-dung."

88
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,500
 But anyways, people, I thought it was hilarious, by the way.

89
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,500
 I thought this whole thing was so funny.

90
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,500
 Other people there got super, super mad about all this stuff.

91
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,500
 And then one day, a dude was walking into the bathroom.

92
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,500
 This big, we had this big guy who worked at Circuit City.

93
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
 He's like, "It was fate.

94
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,500
 This day he was fated to have a bowel movement at this particular time.

95
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,500
 He's sitting there.

96
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,500
 He's doing his job selling televisions.

97
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,500
 Ugh, God, God's own finger came down and slightly jostled his intestines.

98
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,500
 He's like, "Oh, I gotta go to the bathroom all of a sudden."

99
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
 And God's like, "Do my work, son."

100
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,500
 So he makes his way perfectly timed all the way through the Circuit City sales floor.

101
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,500
 Circuit City's not there, unfortunately.

102
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,500
 Otherwise, you can go on this adventure yourself.

103
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,500
 You could relive this adventure.

104
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,500
 He walks in.

105
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,500
 Now, as he's turning the corner to go into the men's restroom, the door is opening up.

106
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,500
 And there's a homeless guy coming out.

107
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,500
 And he smells the smell of the poop.

108
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,500
 And the homeless guy is kind of like looking to the ground, like acting like,

109
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,500
 "Oh, I didn't make that smell.

110
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,500
 That's not me."

111
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,500
 But obviously, if you were in there and you saw an employee,

112
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,500
 the first thing you would say was, "Oh, dude, someone pooped all over there."

113
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,500
 And this was the first time that you had a guy walking out of the restroom

114
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,500
 and the smell of--this was fresh poop.

115
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,500
 This was like 30-second old straight from human body poop.

116
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:54,500
 And against all legal-- against all legal things that somebody can do and corporate policy,

117
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:59,500
 the Circuit City employee grabbed the homeless person, grabbed him by the collar,

118
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,500
 and goes, "It's been you! It's been you!"

119
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,500
 Grabbed him by the collar, starts shaking him, drags him through the store,

120
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,500
 and he does admit to security that he's been the mad pooper for two years.

121
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,500
 And he was banned from the store.

122
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,500
 Now, that was the--we didn't even have an idea of what he could possibly have looked like

123
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:23,500
 until that moment when God tickled my co-workers' bowel movement muscles, whatever those are called.

124
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,500
 I think they're just called the stomach and the intestines.

125
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,500
 And so that was the day--that was the end of the mad pooper.

126
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,500
 His homeless reign of terror had ended at Circuit City.

127
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:40,500
 However, I assume--probably very correctly assume--that we simply moved the problem somewhere else.

128
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,500
 So while the town crier was ringing the bell in joy this time and little kids were coming out,

129
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,500
 we're handing out lollipops to kids at Circuit City.

130
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,500
 Fireworks are going off in the store.

131
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,500
 [imitates explosion]

132
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,500
 Somewhere off in the darkness in some seers and he cabs stall across town.

133
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:02,500
 This homeless person--ahhh--homeless person vision, mad pooper vision, everything's brown,

134
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,500
 everything's brown and dripping, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, moving through the store on all floors, ah-ah-ah,

135
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:13,500
 camouflaging in with everything, and he's slowly crawling into the men's restroom to find their handicapped stall.

136
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,500
 I'm sure that guy is still out there pooping--pooping on inappropriate stuff.

137
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,500
 That is the story of the mad pooper.

138
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,500
 That is not a story I plan to tell, but it's true crime, possibly paranormal,

139
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,500
 because how could he have gone away with it for so long if he wasn't aided by demons and a conspiracy?

140
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,500
 Because he pooped?

141
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,500
 Anyways, let's go ahead and move on with our actual first story here.

142
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,500
 And luckily this one's pretty short, so I'm going to be able to not edit out that poop story.

143
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,500
 But it's also a segment from New News.

144
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,500
 It's been a while since we've done New News.

145
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:53,500
 A long time New News, if you're a new listener, is a file of articles that I found that I took back in 2005.

146
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:59,500
 Back in 2004, doing all this research before a podcast I was doing back then, which was kind of the same podcast,

147
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,500
 but it was more political and current events, and weird current events.

148
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,500
 And now I totally eschew all the political stuff, now it's just like, "pernormal."

149
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,500
 So I have all these crazy articles that are back from that time period.

150
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:18,500
 This one involves the luckiest criminal suspect, murder suspect, ever!

151
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,500
 The years 2003, when Los Angeles, the streets are bumpin'.

152
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,500
 That's probably a little too hardcore.

153
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,500
 Let's see, 2003, what would be the rap music back then?

154
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,500
 [singing]

155
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,500
 So, yeah, I didn't know that song came out in 1994, but it's classic.

156
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,500
 They're still listening to it in 2003.

157
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,500
 Oh, it would have been like, up in the club, up in the club, type like Missy Elliott garbage.

158
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,500
 So, that, someone's listening to Missy Elliott driving through LA.

159
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,500
 And that's not a sad part of the story.

160
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,500
 It should be, I can't stand Missy Elliott, but anyways, there's a drive-by.

161
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,500
 The point, not about what people were listening to, there's a drive-by.

162
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:05,500
 And then sirens, people are crying, and a 16-year-old Martha Puebla gets shot in the street and dies.

163
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,500
 Tragic, tragic story.

164
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,500
 Had to tell all those jokes about music in the beginning, because I knew it was gonna get grim.

165
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:17,500
 Now, one of the suspects, really the main suspect at the time, was a guy named Juan Catalan.

166
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,500
 Juan Catalan.

167
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,500
 And so, he gets dragged down, he gets dragged down to the police station.

168
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
 And they go, "We know that you were part of the drive-by."

169
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,500
 And he's like, "No, I wasn't. I wasn't even in the neighborhood."

170
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
 And the cops are like, "Ah, we've heard this one before."

171
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,500
 So, this goes on for a while.

172
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,500
 "Yes, you were, no you weren't. Yes, you were, no you weren't."

173
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:38,500
 And he's saying, "Not only was I not in the area, but I have proof."

174
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:44,500
 "I took my daughter to go to a Dodgers game. I'm a huge fan of baseball."

175
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,500
 "I took her to go see the Dodgers game."

176
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,500
 And they're like, "That's a lie."

177
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,500
 And your six-year-old daughter is not a good alibi witness.

178
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,500
 He's like, "Well, look at here, I have tickets."

179
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
 "I have tickets for me and my daughter."

180
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,500
 We went to this game, and the cops look at the tickets and they go,

181
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,500
 "Listen, we believe you're involved in organized crime."

182
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:04,500
 So, the fact that you were able to get fake tickets, or somehow get tickets, that's not a shock.

183
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:11,500
 You were part of this murder, and Juan fights this, fights this, fights this, gets arrested.

184
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,500
 They say, "No, you're guilty."

185
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,500
 "We gotta do the trial thing, 'cause this is America."

186
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,500
 "But we're going to arrest you, we're gonna throw you in jail."

187
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
 He goes, "I'll take a polygraph."

188
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,500
 "I will take a polygraph."

189
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,500
 They go, "No."

190
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,500
 "We know it's you, dude. We know it's you."

191
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,500
 And so, while they're preparing for trial, his lawyer finds out,

192
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:36,500
 that curb your enthusiasm, that show with Larry David was being filmed at Dodger Stadium that day.

193
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,500
 And so, the lawyer starts watching the episode, and he's like, "Oh, he's not here."

194
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,500
 That would have been easy.

195
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,500
 If I just watched the episode and saw my client sitting in the stands,

196
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,500
 he then goes to Larry David, the lawyer goes to Larry David and says,

197
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,500
 "Listen, my client's a huge fan of your show."

198
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,500
 I don't necessarily believe that part of the story.

199
00:10:53,500 --> 00:11:01,500
 The client says, "Wan Catalan apparently is a huge fan of curb your enthusiasm before all of this happened."

200
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,500
 I don't believe that for a second, because nobody's a huge fan of curb your enthusiasm.

201
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,500
 That show, I can't stand.

202
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
 I don't like distant stuff a lot.

203
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,500
 I know I went off on my jazz rant the other day, but I don't like distant stuff a lot,

204
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,500
 but I can't stand that show.

205
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,500
 However, 'cause it's not funny, however, Cheryl Hines, his wife, is smoking hot.

206
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
 So I will give it a pass.

207
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,500
 I understand why people watch that show, it's 'cause she's hot,

208
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,500
 but everything else about that show stinks.

209
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,500
 So, I don't believe anyone's a fan of that show.

210
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:38,500
 So, here come all the emails now, but apparently he's a fan of the show,

211
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,500
 and the lawyer goes to Larry David and goes,

212
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,500
 "Hey, yeah, you know your show, that amazing show you put on?"

213
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,500
 Larry's like, "Yeah."

214
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
 He's like, "My client is a huge fan of your show, Larry,

215
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:53,500
 but my client's on trial for murder," and he was at the Dodger Stadium the day you were filming that episode.

216
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,500
 You don't happen to have any, like, B-roll extra footage from when you were filming that.

217
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,500
 Larry David goes, "Let's find out."

218
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:08,500
 So Larry David, his editor, and the lawyer all go down to the editing bay for curb your enthusiasm.

219
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,500
 And I'm sure they got into some wacky hijinks along the way,

220
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,500
 and they play that stupid musical cue, and he's like looking at the camera.

221
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,500
 The lawyer's like, "Dude, come on, you're wasting time. There's not even a camera. Why are you looking there?"

222
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,500
 Larry David's like, "Huh?"

223
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
 [singing]

224
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,500
 There's just...ugh.

225
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,500
 Anyway, that's the show.

226
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,500
 If you watch that show and you're a fan of that show...

227
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,500
 Okay, I probably shouldn't have knocked you if you're a fan of that show and you're listening to this one.

228
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,500
 That show is tailor-made for people too lazy to change the channel.

229
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,500
 Like, every...and I've watched a lot of curbing your enthusiasm,

230
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,500
 because I'm too lazy to change the channel.

231
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:48,500
 So many times I'd be watching like, some show like at 11pm on Fox 40 when I was in Sacramento,

232
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,500
 and I'd be like, "Uhhh..."

233
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,500
 And then I'd hear that musical cue come on and I'd just lay on the couch,

234
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:53,500
 and it'd done da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

235
00:12:53,500 --> 00:13:04,500
 and I'd just be like, "Well, at least I'm gonna look at an attractive woman every five minutes. I can bear this, but I never laughed ever at an episode!"

236
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,500
 Anyways, that's nothing to do with this story.

237
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,500
 Larry David is sitting in the editing bay.

238
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,500
 They're looking through all of this footage, because they shot a bunch of coverage.

239
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:19,500
 They just shot scenes of crowds that they could edit in if they needed it for the episode.

240
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:27,500
 And lo and behold, in one of these shots, they see Juan Catalan and his six-year-old daughter just chilling.

241
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,500
 And the lawyer goes, "Okay."

242
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,500
 Because they knew exactly when this episode was filmed.

243
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:38,500
 There was no debate over when the episode was filmed, what time, what day.

244
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,500
 The police never dispute that. The police disputed that he was not at that game.

245
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,500
 And now they out of...uhm...uhm...

246
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:53,500
 They have footage. So not only is he lucky, because they happen to be filming an episode of a television show that day,

247
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,500
 they happen to catch him and his daughter.

248
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,500
 Because it's not like the point was, "Hey, get a picture of every single person in the crowd, Larry!"

249
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,500
 It'll be hilarious for the blooper reel.

250
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:08,500
 Like, they're just doing panning shots to get crowd reactions, and out of those crowd reactions, one of them,

251
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:14,500
 he didn't get up to get a hot dog at that time, he was sitting there next to his daughter.

252
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:21,500
 He ends up, Juan, the charges get dropped, he ends up suing the city for $320,000.

253
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:27,500
 And winning, I believe. I think he actually won that lawsuit for being wrongfully accused.

254
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:32,500
 In 2008, though, the man who actually ordered the hit was arrested.

255
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,500
 So this happened in 2003, it took five years for them to actually find the guy who ordered the hit.

256
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,500
 But they went for the quick one, they go, "Hey Juan, that's you."

257
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:45,500
 Like, no it wasn't. And then the cops ended up making a big mistake, so...

258
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:51,500
 [Humming]

259
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,500
 And the cops just stood there staring at the camera for 10 minutes, burglars are running by.

260
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,500
 So yeah, luckiest murder suspect ever.

261
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:07,500
 However, however, he is a little unlucky now, because he did, he had to meet Larry David.

262
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,500
 Larry David really wanted to meet this guy.

263
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,500
 So, pick your poison, life in prison, or having a photo of you with Larry.

264
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,500
 I'm sure Larry David is a lovely person, I just don't like his show.

265
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
 Let's go ahead and move on with our last story.

266
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,500
 Now our last story got chopped out of the Friday episode.

267
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:31,500
 And our last story is actually a conclusion to our story about the Giant of Kandahar.

268
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:38,500
 Because when I was reaching it, the Giant of Kandahar was the supposed biblical giant who lived in Afghanistan,

269
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:45,500
 who's been alive since the days of Noah, but was dumb enough to get shot in the face multiple times.

270
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,500
 Like that, when I was editing that, I think I kind of buried the lead.

271
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:55,500
 That's the reason why that story is stupid, is the fact that this guy is supposed to be descended from angels.

272
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:06,500
 He's supposed to be over 6,000 years old, survived this whole time, and runs out of a cave with a stick against 20 US operatives and gets shot in the face and dies.

273
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,500
 When, if he's in Afghanistan, like I said, he would have been thrown his spear at Russian Helis.

274
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:16,500
 They're coming around on their little skate shoes.

275
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,500
 Helicopters, what are they called? What's short for a helicopter? Copter, I guess. I have one.

276
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:26,500
 I don't know why I blanked on that. Helis, they're coming across the landscape.

277
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:34,500
 He's been fighting Russians, he's been fighting Taliban, he's been fighting Pashtuns, he's been fighting Tusk and Sand people.

278
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,500
 He's been fighting people for 6,000 years, yet he doesn't know what a gun is.

279
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:43,500
 He doesn't know anything about numerical superiority. It's just a stupid story.

280
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,500
 But anyways, it was an interesting story, but it doesn't make sense.

281
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,500
 This guy would have either killed all of them or went into hiding.

282
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:55,500
 That's the thing, Bigfoot doesn't run out to a group of hunters and his brain's blowing out.

283
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:01,500
 And then they go, "Oh yeah, and then we buried the body." There are stories like that, but they're made up.

284
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:07,500
 Like the Bigfoot Human War of 1855, I think it was, and the Patterson-Gimlin Massacre.

285
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:16,500
 I've covered both of those. Both of those stories are stupid because, again, they're interesting stories, but they don't make sense anthropologically and throw more follow, whatever.

286
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:28,500
 They don't make sense from a evolutionary state if creatures evolved enough to be hidden from humanity for thousands or tens of thousands of years.

287
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,500
 It has been hidden from humanity. It's not going to walk into a 7-Eleven.

288
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,500
 It's not going to walk into the middle of a room and get its brains blown out.

289
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,500
 So anyways, that's my final say on the Giant of Kandahar.

290
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,500
 Interesting story, but stupid key detail.

291
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:49,500
 If I was making it up, they would have hunted him in the cave, he would have fought him one by one, and then they would have killed him in the end.

292
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:55,500
 Or caused a collapse, and then that way you don't know if the gorilla man or the giant is still out there.

293
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,500
 In the sequel, he would have been a gorilla man, the gorilla man of Kandahar.

294
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:06,500
 Anyways, so when I was researching that along the same lines, a lot of the same websites were like, "Yes, the Giant of Kandahar is real."

295
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,500
 And you got to remember Haditha Dam, Haditha Dam.

296
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,500
 And I'm like, "What is Haditha Dam?" I don't know what it is. I'm going to assume it's a dam in the Middle East.

297
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,500
 And I was right. So let's go ahead and hop on our carpenter, Healy.

298
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:24,500
 No, today we're just going to wear Healys. We're going to put on shoes with little wheels on the bottom of it if you don't know what Healy is.

299
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:30,500
 And we're going to weeeeee go all the way across. We're going to get a barge to go from America.

300
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,500
 We're just going to do circles on the barge. Weeeeee.

301
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,500
 You have to make that noise the whole time and we're sailing all the way to Iraq.

302
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:42,500
 The year is 2003, so it's perfect. We just left Larry David's editing bay.

303
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:49,500
 We're going across the river, not the river, we're going across the ocean, much bigger, has more salt.

304
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,500
 We end up in Iraq the year 2003.

305
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:59,500
 Now, in Iraq we have Haditha, which is a city in the Al Anbar province in Iraq.

306
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:06,500
 And in the Euphrates there is a dam at Haditha called Haditha Dam.

307
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:11,500
 So we're in the Euphrates River with this giant dam. It's one of the largest in the world.

308
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,500
 And right now Iraq War II is started.

309
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:22,500
 We really should have brought the carpenter copter, but now we're just kind of skating across a desert landscape.

310
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:28,500
 [Sounds of rocket shooting]

311
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,500
 Flying across the landscape. We're out skating them. So we're fine.

312
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,500
 And US troops are moving towards Haditha Dam. Come on boys, let's go!

313
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,500
 Let's get this object. Iraq is like, "No way! This is ours!"

314
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,500
 [Sounds of rocket shooting]

315
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,500
 Bullets going back and forth.

316
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,500
 Hope you enjoy this soundscape production.

317
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,500
 Dead Rava Radio. Bombs. People. No!

318
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,500
 Apparently he got blown off the dam.

319
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,500
 [Sounds of rocket shooting]

320
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,500
 Splash. He'll be back in the sequel. So, because we didn't actually see him die.

321
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,500
 The military, the US military, have to be specific because there's two militaries right now.

322
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:13,500
 The US military secures the dam on April 1st, 2003.

323
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:21,500
 The war started March 20th, 2003. So one of their first objectives, they're like, "You go into Baghdad."

324
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,500
 I actually think they probably took this before they got into Baghdad.

325
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:30,500
 But, I mean, we're 11 days into the war and they're like, "We've got to secure this dam."

326
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:36,500
 Because they were afraid Sonoma's going to detonate like bombs. Apparently he had some Bugs Bunny contraption.

327
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:43,500
 Each layer had TNT that actually said TNT on it and Uday was sitting there with a plunger getting ready to blow the dam up.

328
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:49,500
 And then the Joes, the G.I. Joes showed up and they're like, "No! They're coming! The US military!"

329
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,500
 And they fought. It had this big laser gun about them.

330
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
 They were afraid that the dam was going to be destroyed.

331
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,500
 It would have caused an ecological catastrophe with the water going everywhere.

332
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:02,500
 And it secured one-third of the country's electricity, this dam.

333
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,500
 Now, we take over the dam. Should be the end of it, right?

334
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:13,500
 That's done. But, we started to see, later, some stuff pop up, some rumors about this dam.

335
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,500
 And for this, we're going to the year 2015.

336
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,500
 So now, 12 years into the future, on Reddit.

337
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,500
 So, take this with a grain of salt.

338
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,500
 On the No Sleep Forum.

339
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,500
 So, take it with an even greater grain of salt.

340
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:37,500
 Listed by a man with the Reddit account, throw away 10062005.

341
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:44,500
 So, this isn't even someone's main account on a board dedicated, for the most part, to fiction.

342
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:50,500
 On a website dedicated to write something to get the most upvotes.

343
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,500
 I.e., pander to people.

344
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,500
 So, this really is buried under layer upon layer.

345
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,500
 So, that's where we're at right now.

346
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:05,500
 This guy writes this post about military, some ghost.

347
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:13,500
 This guy, throw away, says, "As in the military, there was this body laying up against this gun."

348
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,500
 And then, I walked down the hallway and came back and the body was not laying against the gun.

349
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,500
 It was like, sitting in the corner of the room.

350
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,500
 Dun, dun, dun. I don't care.

351
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,500
 I mean, yeah, sure, that might be paranormal.

352
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,500
 There'll be all sorts of stuff. First off, the guy might not have been dead,

353
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,500
 but he could just be like, faking. He could still be there and he's like, "Are they gunna?"

354
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,500
 "Are they gunna?"

355
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:39,500
 And then, some guy with the username, "Monster Truck Nar" leaves this story in comment to throw away his account.

356
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,500
 The spookiest story came in 2004 in the Haditha Dam.

357
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:48,500
 Our convoys would stop at the base of the dam, and then we had to hike up 13 flights,

358
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:55,500
 dun, dun, dun, 13 flights of stairs to reach our birthing areas, which I'm sure is a military term,

359
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,500
 and not a place where our men and women pushed babies out of their bodies.

360
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,500
 They're like, "Ugh, new generation of soldiers is born!"

361
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:08,500
 Birthing areas. I had to carry an MK-19 Mod 3, assuming that's some sort of rifle,

362
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:13,500
 up these stairs. I know there's military people pulling their hair out right now.

363
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,500
 This is what happens when a civilian reads what you guys write.

364
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:22,500
 Up these stairs each day after we drop supplies at our ASP bases. These guys are GI Joes!

365
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:28,500
 There's no such thing in real life. Nothing is named ASP in the military unless you,

366
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:35,500
 Cobra Commander, is your real commander. It was completely pitch black and you could hear a woman crying very loudly.

367
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:40,500
 Woohoohoohoo! I mean, that's terrifying. I wouldn't want to hear that.

368
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,500
 I wouldn't want to hear that on a bright sunny day.

369
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,500
 I can't remember how many times I ran up these stairs with night vision goggles on,

370
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,500
 terrified that the woman ghost is going to eat me.

371
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,500
 Hmm, wouldn't have a problem with that.

372
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,500
 I brought many- I added that last part, he didn't.

373
00:23:54,500 --> 00:24:00,500
 I brought many people with me to confirm, and everyone knew the ghost of the Haditha Dam before I took them there.

374
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,500
 That sound still terrifies me to this day.

375
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:08,500
 And then, throw away the guy who started this whole thing, jumps back in.

376
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:14,500
 I have a- This is what his comment was. I have a couple buddies that were in Ramadi 2004-2005 with the National Guard,

377
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:18,500
 and I swear to Effing God they told me the same story about the dam.

378
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:24,500
 No one liked going out there. I think it was like a once every three weeks rotation with Marines and other army units.

379
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:30,500
 So, people are saying that the dam was haunted. There was something wrong with the dam.

380
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:36,500
 Apparently there was a prison built into the dam, and I don't think that was Saddam's thing. I think that was our thing.

381
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,500
 I think the US military all of a sudden had a bunch of troops, and they're like, "where should we put them?"

382
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:44,500
 And they're like, "well, we do own an asset that's full of concrete and steel."

383
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:49,500
 So, we can put them in there. So apparently there was a prison operating there at some point.

384
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:55,500
 But from these ghost stories- and it's really weird because a lot of people talk about the ghost of Haditha Dam,

385
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:00,500
 and I couldn't find anything really other than this Reddit post on NoSleep,

386
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:05,500
 which again makes me really really suspicious that any of this is true at all.

387
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:11,500
 But these other websites that are talking about the giant of Kandahar are referencing the haunting of Haditha Dam.

388
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:11,500
 And the prisoners would be in there and you'd hear, "Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

389
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:19,500
 And the prisoners would be in there and you'd hear ghostly noises, and the prisoners were losing their minds.

390
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:26,500
 The prison guards were losing their minds. Apparently you had this woman trying to eat dudes, which again, that is a fate I'm willing to suffer.

391
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:31,500
 I think the other day I talked about some hot ghost girl coming to my apartment. It didn't happen either.

392
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,500
 Like I said, I was talking about a Zana, I think it was, and I said, "if she comes over I'll let you know."

393
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:41,500
 Now, it did make some incredibly beautiful women this weekend, though. Went to an 80s, 90s dance party.

394
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:47,500
 But anyways, no ghost girl came over. No real girl came over this weekend either. Just spoiler alert on that one.

395
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:54,500
 But all these stories were coming out about this ghost girl floating around and these ghost tormenting these prisoners.

396
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,500
 So the idea of Haditha Dam being haunted was already kind of floating around.

397
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:04,500
 But what does that have to do with the giant of Kandahar? What does that have to do with the Euphrates?

398
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:10,500
 Well, the people who believe in the giant of Kandahar believe that Haditha Dam is actually cursed.

399
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:16,500
 And the souls, the people, the prisoners go, "no, no, get the ghosts away from me."

400
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,500
 And the guards being afraid to walk through there without their night vision goggles on.

401
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,500
 Great use of tax dollars, by the way, guys. I have to pay for those batteries.

402
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:31,500
 I'm sorry you're afraid a ghost might get you. You guys do know that it's not your equipment. That is the taxpayers' equipment.

403
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:41,500
 But other than that, we thank you for your service. We have the story that this dam is built on top of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

404
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:46,500
 If you don't know who the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are, they pretty much are exactly what they sound like.

405
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:53,500
 They're in the biblical tradition at the end of the world. These Four Horse Dudes, they're not horse dudes.

406
00:26:53,500 --> 00:27:00,500
 They're people who ride horses, they're going to pop up. There's what is it? Death, pestilence, war, and famine.

407
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:06,500
 And they're going to... Basically, some people think they're a literal thing, like the people who believe that they're buried underneath a dam.

408
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:11,500
 Other people believe they are symbols for these huge catastrophes that are coming.

409
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,500
 Some people believe they don't exist at all. It's Christian mythology.

410
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:22,500
 But anyways, the idea is that these Four Horsemen, the Bible makes it sound like they're legit people.

411
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:27,500
 Not legit people, like you should loan them money and they'll pay you back like they're actual figures.

412
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:32,500
 But the Book of Revelation is really where they're mentioned, and it's full of metaphors, so you don't really know.

413
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:39,500
 But anyways, so these guys, when they come out of the ocean, or the river, now we're in the river, Lesalt,

414
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:47,500
 when they come out of the river, they're going to start wrecking havoc. This is from Revelation chapter 9, 13 through 16.

415
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:53,500
 And the sixth angel sound... So the angels come down and they start going, "Broom, boom!" with their big old horns,

416
00:27:53,500 --> 00:28:01,500
 that's what's causing the end of the world. And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar, which is before God.

417
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:09,500
 Saying to the sixth angel, which had the trumpet, "Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates."

418
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:20,500
 And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men.

419
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:26,500
 And the number of the army of the horsemen were 200,000 thousand, and I heard the number of them.

420
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:32,500
 So that's where we start to get this idea that they're trapped somewhere in the Euphrates.

421
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:38,500
 So you go, "Okay, my question when I saw that is I go, 'So has the dam been there for 10,000 years?'

422
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:45,500
 Like, the dam's relatively new. What were the four horsemen doing before they built the dam? If that is a prison, what were they doing before that?"

423
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:52,500
 There's no answer to that, because I don't think... it doesn't make sense, obviously. Like, if the four horsemen are under the Euphrates,

424
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,500
 let's assume that this part of the story is a literal translation of something.

425
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:02,500
 Why would they let you build a dam on top of them for one they have the power to slay one third of humanity?

426
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:09,500
 They're not going to be like, "Hey, death? Death. Did you not look out the window for the past 80 years?"

427
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,500
 And they're like, "What? They're like, 'The built a dam on top of us!'"

428
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:17,500
 And it's like, "Ugh, I'm so sorry!" Obviously, if they were down there, they wouldn't let a dam be built on top of them.

429
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,500
 A hydroelectric dam at that. So that doesn't make sense.

430
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:29,500
 Secondly, if angels are blowing their trumpets, I don't necessarily think a dam's going to stop them from breaking out of the earth.

431
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,500
 But the idea is that this dam is somehow keeping them prisoner.

432
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:44,500
 And the US forces needed to get there quickly to secure the dam so a bunch of monsters and demons and 200,000 troops wouldn't come pouring out.

433
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:51,500
 As badass and metal Album cover that idea is, it just doesn't make sense because the dam is a recent construction.

434
00:29:51,500 --> 00:30:01,500
 However, let's put a flip on this. Let's take off our debunking hats and put on our I Heart Haditha Dam Curse Stories hats

435
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:10,500
 because the Bible also talks about the sixth angel, same dude showing up, and he pours out his vial onto the Great River Euphrates and it dries up.

436
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:20,500
 Now Euphrates is the river. Well, the Euphrates and the Tigris are the rivers that provides life for the whole region.

437
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:26,500
 The term Mesopotamia is in reference to the water that those rivers give.

438
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:32,500
 It means like Great Basin or something like that. Without these rivers, there would be no Middle East.

439
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:37,500
 So these rivers drying up would be a massive catastrophe.

440
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:43,500
 Since 2008, the rivers have been drying up.

441
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,500
 It's destroying Iraqi farmland.

442
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:52,500
 And farmers are like, "I gotta move. There's just not enough water for us."

443
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:59,500
 And that's weird. You could go climate change. You know, that's icebergs melting or not melting or however it works.

444
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:06,500
 I don't know. I don't look into climate change at all. One way or the other. Icebergs are not melting or melting or something.

445
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:11,500
 It's not raining enough, which is probably more logical. But that's just not it.

446
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:21,500
 The area is being invaded with an influx of snakes. Snakes are everywhere around the dried Euphrates River now.

447
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,500
 So that is reminding a lot of people of the Bible.

448
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:29,500
 Lucifer the Satan is like a snake. He's a snake-like figure at the beginning.

449
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,500
 And at the end, he's referenced as the Great Snake of Old.

450
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:40,500
 It's kind of like a callback to his days of Genesis. It's kind of a nostalgic cue for fans of the OT.

451
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,500
 So you got that weird thing going on. But let's wrap it up with this.

452
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:51,500
 Let's say that the four horsemen are actually trapped under Haditha Dam.

453
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:58,500
 And that's why the US military was so bent on taking over Iraq.

454
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,500
 Had nothing to do with 9/11. But they knew that there was something.

455
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:10,500
 They recently discovered that there was something dark and old underneath a dam in Iraq.

456
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:14,500
 And that's why they invaded the country. And you go, "Jason, that's for postures."

457
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:19,500
 Well, hold on. You didn't let me finish unless you stopped the podcast and then technically you did.

458
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,500
 US troops invade Iraq on March 20th.

459
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:32,500
 Ten days later, they take over Haditha Dam. They secure it. They protect it. They are there to stay.

460
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:40,500
 One month later, May 1st, after the dam has been completely secured, checked from top to bottom.

461
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:46,500
 American flag put on top of it. It is 100% an American asset.

462
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:54,500
 George W. Bush lands on an aircraft carrier. And as he delivers a speech about the victories in Iraq,

463
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:58,500
 there's a huge banner behind him that says, "Mission accomplished."

464
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:04,500
 Now, while that banner was flying, there were still US servicemen engaging in firefights across the country of Iraq,

465
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:13,500
 dying and getting wounded during this war. And the President got a lot of criticism for having that banner behind him while all that was going on.

466
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:19,500
 And he's come back later and said, "Yeah, I probably shouldn't have that banner up. That banner was unrelated."

467
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:25,500
 But what if that banner wasn't a signal of the end of all hostilities in Iraq?

468
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:30,500
 What if the banner wasn't signifying the end of that battleship's run?

469
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:34,500
 They just thought, gotten done with its tour of duty, they threw out mission accomplished.

470
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,500
 It was just a weird accident that the President happened to be given a speech that day.

471
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:44,500
 What if that banner was a message to all of those in the know?

472
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:52,500
 The mission had been accomplished. They had taken control of the dam that sat on top of the apocalypse.

473
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:56,500
 They had averted the end of the world for now.

474
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:05,500
 And George W. Bush was also letting the powers that be know that because they now controlled how the world would end,

475
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:10,500
 they could also trigger it at any time. Mission accomplished.

476
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,500
 We hold the doomsday button for the planet.

477
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:20,500
 And no one will ever know the truth until it's too late.

478
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:25,500
