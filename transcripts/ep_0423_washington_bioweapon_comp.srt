1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 A new era in space exploration began on Tuesday.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,160
 An extraterrestrial visits a man's house and wants to do way more than phone home.

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,120
 And then we travel to Washington.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,480
 The year is 1994.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,320
 And when a mysterious substance begins to rain from the sky, people don't know what to make

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,840
 of it.

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,360
 But soon enough, the entire town becomes ill.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:34,360
 The day on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,400
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,520
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,520
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,040
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,320
 I didn't have a great day yesterday, honestly.

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,360
 I had a really bad anxiety attack, which is to be kind of given, right?

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,680
 The circumstances were in, but yeah, I thought my heart was flipping out and all this stuff.

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,680
 I actually called 911.

17
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,440
 It was so funny because I know you're like, "This is hilarious, Jason."

18
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,040
 Our friend is having to call 911.

19
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,440
 I'm sitting there.

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,400
 I think my heart's not beating in rhythm and then my pulse is skyrocketing and I'm totally

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,240
 freaking out and I'm calling 911.

22
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,480
 I feel like my heart's in AFib.

23
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,960
 And I'm walking around and packing a bag.

24
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,800
 I'm packing like an overnight bag for the hospital.

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,040
 I'm trying to find my phone charger.

26
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,040
 I'm talking 911.

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,040
 She's like, "Are you sitting down?"

28
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,040
 I was like, "Oh, no, no, no, no."

29
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,880
 I'm like walking around.

30
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,840
 She's like, "You may want to sit down."

31
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,240
 And then I get, the ambulance shows up and I'm standing on the street corner waving to

32
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,240
 the ambulance.

33
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,920
 The ambulance guy pops out and he's like, "Are you the guy?"

34
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,280
 I was like, "Yeah, yeah, the heart guy?

35
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,400
 Yeah, yeah, that's me, Jason."

36
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,600
 And he's like, "Okay."

37
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,520
 So I crawl into the ambulance, just like walking.

38
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,160
 They're assuming the worst, right?

39
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,480
 Get into the ambulance.

40
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,880
 And because we have the coronavirus thing on, they don't take me to the hospital.

41
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,920
 They drive around the corner and they do everything in the ambulance.

42
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,200
 And it was funny because no one had masks on.

43
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,520
 Actually, I felt like in that ambulance was probably the cleanest place in the city.

44
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,320
 We only have three cases in the entire county up here right now.

45
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,600
 But anyways, I'm in there and they ran all the diagnostics.

46
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,440
 They're looking at everything and they go, "You're fine."

47
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,840
 Like he says, "Legally, you know, go to the hospital, get all the tests done."

48
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,040
 But I think you're good, dude.

49
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,960
 I think you're good and they showed me everything and we talked about it.

50
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,720
 And then to show how much faith they had and how healthy I was, they just, they didn't

51
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,720
 even drive me up to my apartment, right?

52
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,360
 They dropped me off at the bottom of the hill.

53
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,200
 Like I hooked up to all this stuff.

54
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,200
 Oh, my pulse was like 105.

55
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,080
 It was just an anxiety attack.

56
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,360
 It was just an anxiety attack.

57
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,080
 Because you know, everyone's under a lot of stress.

58
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,800
 But anyways, they were so little concerned about my health that they just dropped me off

59
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,660
 at the bottom of a hill and I had to walk up the hill to get to my house because Hood

60
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,400
 River is nothing but hills.

61
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,600
 But yeah, so that was my day.

62
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,880
 And the reason why I'm sharing that story with you is because we got it, we're taking

63
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,320
 care of ourselves physically by doing the social distancing, but we got to make sure

64
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,080
 we're taking care of ourselves mentally as well.

65
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,400
 And even as much as we're doing that, like I've really been good about keeping myself

66
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,440
 entertained with the podcast and I'm watching more movies than I normally do, watching a

67
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,240
 ton of Wizards Away really place.

68
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,040
 I'm blowing through my Disney Channel, my Disney Plus subscription, watching all the

69
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,840
 shows I loved back in the day.

70
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,560
 But we got to keep our mind right.

71
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,800
 So I'm sharing my experience with you because I know I'm not the only one doing it.

72
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,160
 I know I'm not the only one.

73
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:33,840
 I would say there was probably 100,000 other people across the world who had an anxiety

74
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,640
 attack yesterday.

75
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,640
 So you're not alone.

76
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,140
 I'm having them.

77
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,140
 I'm not depressed.

78
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,240
 I told a friend of mine, Sabine, she's concerned.

79
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,120
 I go, listen, I'm not depressed.

80
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,160
 I can be anxious and I can have anxiety attacks.

81
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,440
 Worry about me when I start to get depressed, which isn't going to happen.

82
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,240
 I'm very optimistic about this whole thing.

83
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,160
 I think it's going to blow over the world's economy.

84
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,760
 It's going to recover all this stuff.

85
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,440
 I'm looking at the end result, but you're not alone.

86
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,000
 If you're feeling anxious, if you're feeling scared, I get it.

87
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,120
 It's going to come and we're going to feel sad and we're going to feel scared, but we

88
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,240
 just have to move past it.

89
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,440
 So I mean, we just, you have friends out there and you're not alone.

90
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,520
 Okay guys, everyone's going through this.

91
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,080
 So let's go ahead and give it, I wanted to, I think that's important.

92
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,440
 I know that took up a bit of time, but I think it's important because you guys are probably

93
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,000
 feeling it too and just reaching out to you guys and I'm okay.

94
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 I'm okay.

95
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 My heart's totally fine.

96
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,760
 I had all those tests done last year.

97
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,920
 I'm totally fine.

98
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,680
 It was just, I was having an anxiety attack, you know, in stressful times.

99
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,480
 Let's give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreons here.

100
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,600
 Let's give a shout out to Kaden S, everyone.

101
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,920
 Nice round of applause for Kaden S. Thank you so much for supporting the show.

102
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,120
 Really, really helps a lot.

103
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,960
 We'll be getting the keys to the carpenter copter in just a second.

104
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,240
 We also want to talk about the Dead Rabbit Movie Club.

105
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:59,800
 This is a long preamble, but so I recommended the baby yesterday and if you've ever seen

106
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,640
 the baby, you can understand where that sigh was coming from.

107
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,440
 I had not watched it before.

108
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,440
 Okay.

109
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:14,920
 I don't want to take any blame for the baby, which was anyways, Friday night, 7pm Pacific

110
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,920
 Standard Time.

111
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,960
 We're going to do a live stream on YouTube talking about these movies.

112
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,760
 If you want to join us, totally awesome.

113
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,000
 We watched how all these movies are available on shutter.com.

114
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,800
 Promo code shut in, SHUTIN, if you want 30 days free.

115
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,360
 I do not get sponsored by them.

116
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,560
 We watched Housewife.

117
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,860
 We watched Sorority Babes and the Slimeball Bolarama.

118
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,320
 We watched The Baby.

119
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,920
 Tonight, again, I've never seen this movie before.

120
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,200
 I know absolutely nothing about it, except it has good reviews on here and the cover

121
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,480
 looks pretty weird.

122
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,560
 It's called Necrotronic.

123
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
 Necrotronic.

124
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,000
 I have no idea what it's about.

125
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,760
 It can't be any weirder than The Baby.

126
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,760
 So we're just going with it.

127
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,280
 Let's go ahead of though and get started with our episode today.

128
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,520
 So, Caden, fire up that carbonar copter.

129
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,960
 We are flying out to the Pentagon.

130
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,960
 Where's that?

131
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,360
 Washington, DC, Virginia, somewhere around there.

132
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,360
 It doesn't matter.

133
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,200
 We're flying now.

134
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
 We're going to land.

135
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,120
 We're flying right in the middle of the Pentagon.

136
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,040
 There's a little open area.

137
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,920
 We're going to land right there and everyone's saluting us.

138
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,920
 I'm making that noise as we're getting off the helicopters.

139
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,920
 We're walking down the hallway.

140
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,320
 You're like, "Jason, shut up.

141
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:35,800
 I'm like, "No, this is military music."

142
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,600
 And then the President of the United States, Donald Trump, salutes us.

143
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,120
 "Come, listeners of Dead Rabbit Radio," he says.

144
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,200
 This is my Donald Trump impression.

145
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,760
 I know it's really good, isn't it?

146
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:53,360
 I'm glad you guys have come because I have ooge news for you.

147
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,360
 You like that?

148
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,320
 Ooge news.

149
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,520
 He pulls out a little slideshow thing.

150
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,400
 I don't know what he pulls it out of his pocket.

151
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
 We're in a room.

152
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,760
 There's a projector and he pulls down the little screen and he goes, "Ladies and gentlemen,

153
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,640
 I present to you Project 2030."

154
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,400
 And then it's just a picture of Mars.

155
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,600
 Project 2030.

156
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,880
 This is what happened on Tuesday.

157
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,000
 Project 2030 is actually a name I made up.

158
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:29,080
 That's not what it's technically called, but on Tuesday, April 7th, 2020, Donald Trump

159
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,440
 said, "Space is up for grabs.

160
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,480
 First come, first serve."

161
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:42,040
 I guess there used to be an international treaty, but none of the major players signed

162
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,040
 it.

163
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
 We didn't sign it.

164
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,040
 France didn't sign it.

165
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
 USSR didn't sign it.

166
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
 Russia.

167
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,760
 Nobody signed it, but the UN was like, "Wouldn't it be great if space was like a global commons

168
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,400
 and anyone could do whatever they wanted?"

169
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,200
 There are Trumps like, "Nope, not anymore."

170
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,360
 And to be fair, other countries have been gearing up to do this.

171
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,640
 He was just the first person to say this.

172
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,160
 He's like, "Whoever smelt it, dealt it."

173
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,240
 When I mean smelt.

174
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:11,080
 I mean mine oars on the moon and smelt them into bars of iron, whatever's up there.

175
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,480
 And Bush wanted this too.

176
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,880
 George W. Bush wanted this too.

177
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,720
 He wanted to put a man on Mars, like in 2024.

178
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,880
 And obviously that's not going to happen, but Donald Trump goes, "We're going to have

179
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,840
 a man on the moon by 2024, and we're just not going to be jumping around in the dirt.

180
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,520
 We're going to be building a base so we can be to Mars by the year 2030."

181
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,600
 And they're coming out with all of these graphics of how they plan to mine water and hydrogen

182
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,000
 from the moon.

183
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,280
 And he's like, "Whoever smelt it, dealt it."

184
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:46,040
 Like, "Let's get up there, let's start making oars, and then we own that part of the moon."

185
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,720
 And then France is like, "Oh yeah, we, we, that sounds like a great idea.

186
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,720
 We dibs this crater."

187
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,000
 No, no, no, no, no.

188
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,440
 You got to be on there to do it.

189
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:01,200
 This is a total game changer, because basically at this point now, a world power has said,

190
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,840
 "Let's just, let everyone just get to the moon.

191
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,880
 If you can get to the moon, you can start mining it."

192
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,400
 It's the equivalent now of when countries used to get in boats and go to other countries

193
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,280
 and then get off the boat and be like, "We own this place where we've landed."

194
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,800
 For the past 40, 50 years, the idea has been it just belongs to everyone.

195
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,400
 Nope, not anymore.

196
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,520
 So that's pretty dope, right?

197
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,920
 Does this start a new space race?

198
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,600
 Does this jump, start technology?

199
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,040
 Does this answer all of our energy needs?

200
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,160
 Helium-3, it's extremely bountiful on the moon.

201
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,680
 They say one shuttle full of helium-3, one shuttle full, could power the entire United

202
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,920
 States for 10 years, or one year.

203
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,920
 It doesn't matter.

204
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,160
 That's still a long amount of time.

205
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,040
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next topic.

206
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,760
 We are leaving the Pentagon behind.

207
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,360
 And actually, this is kind of tricky because we're leaving the Pentagon behind.

208
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,120
 We're going to Russia.

209
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:03,240
 Don't say that out loud because we're going back to Russia during the Cold War.

210
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,960
 So we sneak out of the Pentagon.

211
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,600
 It's surprisingly easy.

212
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
 Really bad security there.

213
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,080
 I don't know if you know that, but it's terrible.

214
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,440
 We walk out.

215
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,440
 Security so lacks.

216
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,440
 We're walking out of there.

217
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,880
 I'm wearing Donald Trump's watch.

218
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,560
 You're wearing his jacket.

219
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,200
 We are shocked how much we can get away with.

220
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,240
 But we walk and we both have arm loads full of top secret documents.

221
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,480
 We're just throwing them in the streets.

222
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,320
 Top secret documents for everybody.

223
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,840
 We hop back in the Carbentercopter.

224
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:36,560
 Kaden fly us out to Ulynovsk, Russia.

225
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:44,640
 Now we're going from modern-day Pentagon to 1986 Ulanivsk, Russia.

226
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,880
 And we're going to land in this town.

227
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,280
 Let's assume it's like a suburb.

228
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,120
 I have no idea where this place is at, but it exists.

229
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,480
 We're going to land in this town and we hop out of the Carbentercopter.

230
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,720
 We're walking around.

231
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,080
 And there we meet a man.

232
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,160
 A nameless man.

233
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,160
 We don't have this guy's name, but we see this.

234
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
 This is pretty common.

235
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,160
 This is from that website.

236
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,520
 Think about it docs.com.

237
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:15,040
 They have towards the mid-80s a lot of UFO stories coming out of the Soviet Union.

238
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,560
 Information was finally starting to leak.

239
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,400
 So there's not a ton of detail, but this story is one of those listed.

240
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,400
 A bizarre alien encounter.

241
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,400
 There's a man there.

242
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,920
 Let's call him Peter.

243
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,920
 Peter.

244
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,400
 Or maybe just Peter.

245
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
 I don't know.

246
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
 They pronounce it over there.

247
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
 We'll just call him Peter.

248
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,400
 That hurts my throat less.

249
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,760
 Peter is getting ready for work.

250
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,440
 He works at a factory that makes other factories.

251
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,080
 He's really, really important to the economy of Soviet Union.

252
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,400
 There are little factories come out of a giant factory and then they get placed all over

253
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,400
 the eastern block country.

254
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,320
 So anyways, he's very, very important at his job.

255
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,320
 Peter's sitting there.

256
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,840
 He's drinking coffee.

257
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,040
 He's getting ready for work.

258
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:59,120
 And he hears a knock at his door and he's like, "Oh, that's weird.

259
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,840
 That's weird, right?"

260
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,860
 Usually people don't visit you in the morning.

261
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,840
 People normally visit you in the afternoon, right?

262
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,640
 So kind of sets him off.

263
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,240
 Plus he's like, "I don't have any friends.

264
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,240
 That's also weird.

265
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,240
 That's weird.

266
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,600
 I don't have any friends, which makes him a little sad."

267
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,760
 And it's in the middle of the morning.

268
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,760
 So he walks up.

269
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,880
 He's eating doughnut, drinking his coffee, getting his tie ready.

270
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,560
 He opens the door.

271
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,560
 What?

272
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:29,960
 And like his eyes, imagine this like a sitcom, his eyes are looking right at somebody's chest.

273
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,160
 And he's like, "Huh?"

274
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,800
 And then his eyes slowly go up, up, up, up.

275
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,800
 And then there's a seven foot man standing outside of his door.

276
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,680
 "Oh golly," he says.

277
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,040
 He spits coffee out, spits doughnut out.

278
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,040
 Totally.

279
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,760
 I guess seeing a seven foot man wouldn't be super shocking.

280
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,600
 I saw a minute bowl at a grocery store once when I was a little kid.

281
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
 I didn't even know who minute bowl was.

282
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,560
 He's a basketball player if you don't.

283
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,560
 But he was huge.

284
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,520
 I didn't spend food out everywhere.

285
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,360
 Anyway, seven foot tall dude.

286
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:11,840
 That, the seven foot tall dude is wearing a silver onesie cover all.

287
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:17,240
 And what's described in the notes as "large boots," that's kind of redundant.

288
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,560
 He's seven feet tall.

289
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,160
 Of course anything is going to be described as large.

290
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,520
 But that's quibbling, right?

291
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,320
 I think the main thing is he's seven feet tall.

292
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,840
 He's wearing a silvery shiny cover all.

293
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,720
 And he tells Peter, "I'm an alien."

294
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,160
 This is a good way to start a conversation, right?

295
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,160
 Just get it right out of the bat.

296
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
 I'm an alien.

297
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,720
 He's like, "Huh?"

298
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,960
 I'm an alien.

299
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,040
 And I'm hungry.

300
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,840
 I need food.

301
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:52,240
 I need what you earthlings call "nibbles and things to eat."

302
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,320
 He's like, "Well, we don't call them nibbles."

303
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,400
 But anyways, Peter doesn't know what to do, right?

304
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:02,160
 Seven foot tall man wearing what really would be described as a space suit, standing outside

305
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,840
 his door and he says, "I'm an alien.

306
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,840
 Give me food."

307
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,520
 He goes, "Oh, okay.

308
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,520
 Wait.

309
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,000
 Wait right here a second."

310
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,320
 Because what would you do, right?

311
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,120
 Like, you'd give the guy food.

312
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,400
 If he was a normal sized human and just wearing a silver shirt, you'd figure he was just like

313
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,960
 some drifter.

314
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,800
 But how many seven foot tall homeless people have you ever seen?

315
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,320
 First off, how many seven feet tall people have you ever seen?

316
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,880
 I saw a minute bull.

317
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,760
 But if I saw a seven foot tall hobo, I'd move away.

318
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,560
 If I ever moved, lived in a town and a seven foot tall homeless person showed up, I'd

319
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,040
 leave because there's no way that I'm going to survive.

320
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,360
 That guy's going to ask me for money.

321
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,480
 I'm going to say no.

322
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,280
 And then he's going to crunch me into a little ball and dribble me or maybe just eat me.

323
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,280
 I don't know.

324
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,760
 But anyways, so you don't assume tall people, seven feet tall people are homeless, right?

325
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,160
 That's a weird stereotype I've just created.

326
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,840
 Tall people aren't homeless.

327
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:00,040
 But anyways, Peter goes to get him food.

328
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,040
 So he does.

329
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,480
 He gets him old newspapers and forms a bag type of thing.

330
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,880
 Peter's a very inventive guy.

331
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,880
 I wouldn't have thought about that.

332
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,240
 I'd have just given him some cans of raviolis.

333
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,400
 He gets some old newspaper and makes it so it's like a bag or a basket and puts groceries

334
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,480
 in it and gives it to the alien.

335
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,680
 It says, "Here, I can give you these groceries."

336
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:24,040
 And the alien takes the groceries and his giant arms and goes, "Thank you.

337
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,040
 Thank you.

338
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,040
 Thank you."

339
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,120
 And the alien turns and walks away.

340
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,120
 Peter's like, "What?"

341
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,120
 Now, he didn't look.

342
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,200
 He's not being described as like a great alien.

343
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,200
 He's just a tall looking human.

344
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,240
 But I mean, like, he says he's an alien.

345
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,800
 He's dressed like an alien.

346
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,320
 He's not a human size.

347
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,360
 I mean, I know humans can get that big, but it's super rare, right?

348
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,960
 Anyways, so Peter goes to work.

349
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,640
 It's just an odd encounter.

350
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,760
 Maybe it was just some guy ripping him off, got some free cans of soup.

351
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,760
 Who knows?

352
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,880
 But Peter goes to work, right?

353
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,800
 This is in the book by Jacques Vallée, who's a very well-respected UFO researcher.

354
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,040
 This is not some story.

355
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,280
 This is not creepypasta I found on Reddit.

356
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,200
 This is super bizarre.

357
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,680
 That's just the intro.

358
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,600
 Jacques Vallée wrote this in his book, UFO Chronicles of the Soviet Union.

359
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
 It's a competium.

360
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,680
 It's a collection.

361
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,720
 The story's about UFOs in the Soviet Union.

362
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,080
 If you can believe that from the title.

363
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,360
 Peter's at work and his pressing buttons and factories are being built.

364
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,360
 Little steam sacks.

365
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,200
 Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

366
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,520
 Going down the conveyor belt and he's like, "Why do I have to listen to this song all

367
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,520
 the time?"

368
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,520
 Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

369
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,320
 That's the official work song.

370
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,120
 The royalty-free work song.

371
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,760
 He's sitting there and he has a sudden urge, "I gotta go home, dude."

372
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,960
 Something does not feel right.

373
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,960
 I have to go home.

374
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,840
 He's having an anxiety attack.

375
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,960
 I know exactly how he felt.

376
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,960
 I have to go home.

377
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,280
 He has this overriding fear.

378
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,400
 Something's going on in his house.

379
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,880
 So he tells his boss, "Hey, dude, I gotta go home."

380
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,920
 Like, "I had a really weird morning.

381
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,440
 I didn't tell you about that because I'm still processing it.

382
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,720
 But I definitely need to go home right now."

383
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,320
 And the boss is like, "Okay, that's kind of weird, but sure, go home."

384
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,440
 So Peter races home.

385
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,360
 He gets in his house.

386
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:23,280
 His entire kitchen is empty of all food.

387
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,480
 Something broke into his house while he was gone.

388
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,640
 In the short amount of time he was gone.

389
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,120
 They say he left to work home early.

390
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,000
 So he was probably at work less than three or four hours, right?

391
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,680
 After that, you're not really leaving early.

392
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,480
 I guess you're still leaving early, but you know what I mean.

393
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,960
 He gave a chawl, dude, a bunch of groceries for free.

394
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,760
 He goes to work, comes back.

395
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,320
 His entire kitchen is ransacked.

396
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,360
 Not a single grain of rice.

397
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,000
 Not an apple core.

398
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,240
 Nothing.

399
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,920
 All of his food is gone.

400
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,200
 So that's the end of the-- the end of the-- technically, that's the end of that story.

401
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:05,760
 And it's not-- what I like about this story is, one, it proves to me my distrust of aliens

402
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,640
 is totally sound because they're thieves.

403
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,640
 Not only do they abduct people and abduct cattle, but they also abduct your food.

404
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,920
 Secondly, we're talking about the Soviet Union in 1986.

405
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,440
 So it's not like this guy could just go to the grocery store.

406
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,680
 This is where the-- this is the culture that invented the term "bread lines."

407
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,680
 He's like, "Dang it!

408
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,080
 You know how many lines I have to stand in to get all those groceries again?

409
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,800
 I have to stand in the rice line, to stand in the milk line."

410
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,280
 It was nice enough he gave groceries away in the first place.

411
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,840
 But now this dude broke into his house and stole them.

412
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,240
 So there's two ways to look.

413
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,640
 It's possible that it was just a giant dude who was walking from house to house and trying

414
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,880
 to get free food.

415
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,760
 And he realized this guy had the best food on the block, in the Eastern block, and broke

416
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,000
 into his house and took it all.

417
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,480
 But it's more interesting to think this dude was actually a space alien.

418
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,160
 And although he had a craft that could fly across the cosmos, and a snazzy silver suit,

419
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:10,520
 and an inhuman height, he really just wanted to eat a bunch of food that day.

420
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,480
 Even if it meant he had to break into the house of a good Samaritan.

421
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,360
 I think this guy had a close encounter of the third mine.

422
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,760
 Because the alien took it and said it's mine.

423
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,760
 Get it?

424
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,120
 Anyways, let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

425
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,760
 I think that story's super bizarre.

426
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,800
 Why would an alien eat- Why would- We never really think of aliens needing food in the

427
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,800
 first place.

428
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:36,720
 Let alone breaking into people's houses to get food.

429
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,040
 That'd be so funny.

430
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,360
 You're getting abducted, you're like getting wrestled by four gray aliens.

431
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,840
 They're like bebop, boop, boop.

432
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,000
 They're wrestling in the ground.

433
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,080
 They're pulling out these giant metal blades.

434
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,160
 They're going to start inspecting, cutting you open, stuff like that.

435
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,600
 And then you see one go to your fridge.

436
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,400
 You're like, no, no, not my ham.

437
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,360
 I've been marinating that.

438
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,360
 No!

439
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:01,400
 And you're like, at least you know all the medical procedures they do on you.

440
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,320
 They're going to erase your mind.

441
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,640
 You'll wake up every once in a while in cold sweats and visions of aliens holding you down.

442
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,440
 But you won't really remember it, right?

443
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,640
 But you will remember trying.

444
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,200
 You're like, what happened to him?

445
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,200
 What happened to my milkshake?

446
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,080
 Where's my frosty I brought back from Wendy's?

447
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,080
 What?

448
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,080
 Where did that go?

449
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,080
 Huh?

450
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,480
 Like you'll remember stuff missing.

451
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,520
 You won't remember the implant they put behind your ear that beeps every time you go through

452
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,520
 the airport.

453
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,680
 And they go, well, I don't know.

454
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,440
 You won't remember all that horrible stuff.

455
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,600
 But you will remember the fact that your peanut M&Ms are gone.

456
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,600
 What?

457
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,600
 Where'd these go?

458
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,520
 Well, that would, I think that simply adds to the horror.

459
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,960
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next topic.

460
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,400
 Our next one's really weird.

461
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,120
 Let's hop in the Carbnercopter one last time.

462
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,920
 Caden, take us on out to Oakville, Washington.

463
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:51,360
 It's a little town, population 665.

464
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,960
 That's mind boggling to me.

465
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,600
 Hood River has a population of about 12,000.

466
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,640
 That's the smallest city I've ever lived in.

467
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,640
 I always lived in LA, lived in the Bay Area, lived in Sacramento.

468
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,080
 665 people.

469
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,080
 That's super tiny.

470
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,080
 Tiny little town.

471
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,920
 I think it would be fun to visit.

472
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,240
 Check out the little diner.

473
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,600
 I like going to diners when I travel.

474
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,400
 Little diners have their little burger menu and stuff like that.

475
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,240
 But anyways, I don't travel actually.

476
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,080
 I don't ever go anywhere I can't walk back from.

477
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,600
 I never travel more than 30 miles from where I live.

478
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,240
 But if I did travel, I would go to diners.

479
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,200
 I used to travel a lot more when I was younger.

480
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,480
 Anyways, Oakville, Washington, population 665.

481
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,440
 It's August 7th, 1994.

482
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,320
 So it's not that long ago, really.

483
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,680
 I had just graduated high school that summer, actually.

484
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,880
 So I mean, it's probably three years like Jason that's like over 20-some-odd years ago.

485
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,760
 What do you mean that's not a long time ago?

486
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,280
 I was just starting college.

487
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:50,440
 Actually, I took the fall semester off, but it doesn't mean anything.

488
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,440
 I didn't live here.

489
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,160
 I had nothing to do with this.

490
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,400
 Oakville, Washington.

491
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,960
 We are walking around this little town.

492
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,520
 And it's just a beautiful day, right?

493
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,640
 A little overcast, but the sun's out, dogs are barking, babies are walking on the sidewalk

494
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,600
 so I'm like, "Their hands are hot."

495
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,560
 We have to pick the babies up and put them on the lawn like they're worms trying to

496
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,120
 escape the rain.

497
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:22,680
 But right when we started talking about rain, it does start to rain a bit.

498
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:28,680
 And we're expecting for water to hit our-- that's how it works, right?

499
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,480
 You walk outside and you're like, "Hmm, I hear rain, but no water yet.

500
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,800
 It should be hitting my head right about."

501
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,000
 But rain doesn't hit our head.

502
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,360
 Instead, little things do, right?

503
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,360
 [MAKING NOISE]

504
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,760
 We're like, "What in the world?

505
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,760
 What?"

506
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,720
 Come on, man.

507
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,560
 Little tiny blobby things.

508
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,600
 About the size of a grain of rice.

509
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,200
 So they hit us and they just kind of stick and we have to like flick them.

510
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,280
 What the heck?

511
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,560
 What in tarnation is this man is wiping them off, taking the babies, we're putting them

512
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,560
 underneath the patio.

513
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,880
 Not underneath the patio, right?

514
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,880
 That's like underneath the house.

515
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,640
 We're putting them on people's porches.

516
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,640
 "Keep your babies out of the street!"

517
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,320
 We yell at each house as we're putting the babies in.

518
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,240
 And then we find shelter for ourselves.

519
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,240
 And after this little rainstorm of blob stops, everyone kind of comes out of their house.

520
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,240
 "What in the world was that?"

521
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,680
 Picking them up, squeezing them, throwing them at you and sticking them up your nose.

522
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,080
 You're like, "Ahh!"

523
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,000
 Flicking them at people.

524
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,640
 Everyone in town is wondering, "What in the world are these things?"

525
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,080
 And people are like showing them to each other.

526
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,080
 "Hey, did you see that?

527
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,080
 Look at that.

528
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,080
 Yeah, I saw that.

529
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,080
 It rained all over my place.

530
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,080
 Look at it.

531
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,080
 I got them everywhere."

532
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,320
 People are trying to figure out what they are.

533
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:50,280
 And then one day after it rains, there's a dead cat laying in the yard.

534
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,960
 Now that's not suspicious, right?

535
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,000
 I don't think this town, this town is all like, "Oakville, Washington, home of the

536
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,640
 immortal cats.

537
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,000
 Cats never die here."

538
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 That's what they're known for.

539
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,880
 I'm sure cats have died in Oakville before, but it was weird that this cat died.

540
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,880
 For whatever reason, people noticed this dead cat.

541
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,320
 It wasn't hit by a car, it was just like laying, laying in the grass.

542
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,320
 What?

543
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,320
 That's weird.

544
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,120
 We're home and the immortal cats, we haven't had a cat death here in 200 years.

545
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,120
 But they don't have time to really think about the cats because people start to get sick.

546
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
 Oh, oh.

547
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
 What?

548
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,840
 Oh my God, no, I got a fever.

549
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,840
 Ugh.

550
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,840
 People are throwing up.

551
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,440
 People are sweating.

552
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,840
 People have really, really bad flus, really bad flus.

553
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,480
 Some people take some a week or two to get over it.

554
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:50,320
 Some people, some more sensitive people, couple months, fatigue and nauseous.

555
00:24:50,320 --> 00:25:00,040
 Now while this illness is rippling through the town, it rains the blobs again and again

556
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,040
 and again.

557
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,400
 A total of six times.

558
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,520
 This is well documented in the newspapers at the time.

559
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,000
 1994, Oakville, Washington, it's not far enough back that you're just going off this

560
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 anecdotal evidence.

561
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,600
 This was reported in the newspaper.

562
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,440
 It was reported in the Observer, which is a Washington newspaper.

563
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,000
 It's been covered since then as well.

564
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,120
 They'll do like 20 years later.

565
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,680
 That was KXRO.com, a news website covered 20 years later.

566
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,880
 So this is an actual event.

567
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:33,240
 It rains six more times over a total of 20 square miles, which because the town is so

568
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,560
 small, it's pretty much getting the entire town.

569
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,040
 Now the question was, what are these things?

570
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:44,600
 Now some people thought, this usually what, we've covered mystery blobs from the sky

571
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,600
 before.

572
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,560
 The blobs themselves have happened.

573
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:53,200
 What makes this story interesting is the illnesses that came on top of it.

574
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,200
 That hasn't happened.

575
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,920
 We've had bloody chunks of meat fall in South America.

576
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:02,160
 We've had blobs fall in Middle America, like Kansas I think it was.

577
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,280
 We had out in the desert, it might have been Arizona or California where they would just

578
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:11,680
 find those giant piles of little orbeez, but they don't even know if they're orbeez.

579
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,800
 They almost look like fish eggs just sitting on the road by the desert.

580
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,840
 Fish have fallen from the sky, squids, all sorts of stuff.

581
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,920
 So that's normal.

582
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,560
 The illness is what makes it weird.

583
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,040
 Now they had all these theories.

584
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,040
 Everyone in town had a theory.

585
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,880
 One of the theories was airplanes flying overhead, flushing their toilets.

586
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:32,320
 And the airlines were like, we don't fly over your town and we're not flushing our toilets

587
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,480
 over your town either.

588
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,720
 So it wasn't us.

589
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,840
 Plus it wouldn't look like that.

590
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,240
 It come down as a big like grotial block.

591
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,760
 It wouldn't come down as like rice.

592
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,760
 And we definitely wouldn't do it six times, right?

593
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,680
 Like maybe we had one snafu and the plane was kind of flying.

594
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,960
 Be like, hey, wouldn't this be funny?

595
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,760
 Watch, I'm gonna take a dump.

596
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,760
 Right?

597
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,920
 And that's one thing.

598
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,160
 But six times that's pushing.

599
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:59,800
 The other theory was that earlier before this happened, the Air Force were doing practice

600
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:05,920
 bombing runs 10 to 20 miles off the coast and that the bombs were so explosive, they

601
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,480
 were blowing up jellyfish.

602
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:12,960
 And the jellyfish were flying up into the atmosphere, flying into a cloud for 10 to

603
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,760
 20 miles and then falling on people.

604
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,680
 And that's what a lot of locals believe.

605
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,680
 There's jellyfish guts.

606
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,920
 There's jellyfish guts that were going on.

607
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:25,880
 The military says we do do bombing runs out there, but we don't know.

608
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,520
 Like that it's possible, right?

609
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:32,800
 Because that's how you get fish raining because they get sucked up in a water spout, dropped

610
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,520
 somewhere else.

611
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,960
 The town wanted to do a jellyfish festival, right?

612
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,560
 Every town wants a claim to fame jet.

613
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,680
 They want to do a jellyfish festival where at the end of each festival they would, this

614
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,640
 is something you can only do in 1994.

615
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,760
 This was the America I grew up in.

616
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,920
 And damn, it was a good America.

617
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,920
 The end of the show, they would do this today.

618
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:59,040
 The end of the jellyfish festival in this town that was being plagued by jellyfish guts was

619
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:06,880
 they were going to take a cannon, an actual cannon and stuff it full of jellyfish and shoot

620
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,080
 jellyfish guts all over the town.

621
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,200
 That's dope.

622
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,680
 Town of the immortal cat, boo.

623
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,120
 Town of the annual jellyfish explosion.

624
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,120
 Yeah.

625
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,920
 I'd go more than 30 miles to visit that place.

626
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:25,960
 But what's interesting is we have now entering the story Washington Department of Health

627
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,880
 Microbiologists, Mike McDowell.

628
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,080
 That sounds like an actual like hero scientist's name, right?

629
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,920
 Mike McDowell, he's examining them.

630
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,840
 He's looking at them under his microscope and he's like, "I need another look at this.

631
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,600
 Give me a smaller microscope."

632
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,920
 So he puts it on a microscope and then puts another microscope to look at that microscope.

633
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,560
 It's like all microscopes all the way down.

634
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,400
 That's how professional this guy is.

635
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,480
 He's looking at him and he goes, "Well, I see there's two different types of organisms

636
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,120
 here.

637
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,120
 Just weird.

638
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,120
 Do-do."

639
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:04,800
 I don't know exactly why this would be making people sick, but he looks up from the microscope,

640
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:13,040
 looks directly into the camera and goes, "Whatever this is, it's man-made."

641
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:17,440
 He says the two organisms, one of them was pseudonomous, fluorescence, and the other

642
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,800
 one is intobacter clo-clo-k.

643
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,720
 It means absolutely nothing to me.

644
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,840
 Maybe if you're a nerd, you're like, "Clo-k?

645
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,840
 It's your black or clo-k?

646
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,200
 Oh my God, that's so amazing."

647
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,200
 Calm down, calm down.

648
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,080
 You can check it out in the show notes.

649
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,880
 I have no idea what that means, but he says that there's two different type of organisms

650
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,680
 in it and he goes, "It was man-made."

651
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,760
 Mike McDowell makes this discovery.

652
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,120
 He believes it's man-made.

653
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:48,280
 He's working on this at the time, and he gives this quote, he gives this quote regarding

654
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,000
 what's going on.

655
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,120
 This material, and I have no proof one way or the other, which is a good way to coach

656
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,120
 it, right?

657
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,440
 Which is a good way to kind of say, "I'm going to make this claim, it's going to sound weird.

658
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,440
 I can't prove it."

659
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,600
 I actually use that statement a lot, I can't prove it either way, but it's a good way to

660
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,840
 start this off because he's going to make a bizarre, a dangerous accusation.

661
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,840
 I'll give you back to the quote, "This material, and I have no proof one way or the other,

662
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:23,000
 was manufactured by someone for some purpose, and for some reason Oakville was chosen as

663
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,560
 the test site."

664
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,000
 That's a bold statement.

665
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:34,080
 This is some sort of biological weapon or test, and someone's doing this on purpose.

666
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,440
 It's a contained area with a small town, 665 people.

667
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,400
 Everybody wants to see what something can do, drop it off.

668
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:47,600
 No deaths except for one cat, but an entire town falls ill.

669
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,640
 You have people nowadays going, "Ah, the entire town didn't fall ill."

670
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,040
 It was just 20 people, it wasn't the whole town.

671
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,280
 Other people go, "What, that cat, he's still alive.

672
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,560
 That cat's right over there.

673
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,880
 That fake news."

674
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:04,280
 People debate, the event did happen and people got sick.

675
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,360
 Some people say, "Everyone got sick."

676
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,480
 Some people say only certain people got sick.

677
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,200
 Some people say the cat's dead.

678
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,120
 It's Schrodinger's jelly.

679
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:16,880
 You don't know what it is until you actually go there and get the jelly to fall on you.

680
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,720
 But let's go back to Mike McDowell to wrap this story up, because he makes this claim

681
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,080
 that this is man-made, someone's running a test.

682
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,640
 But he's not done with this test, right?

683
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:29,120
 Scientists just don't go, "Well, I looked at it once, da-da-da, I'm done.

684
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,680
 What, I did that equation yesterday.

685
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,600
 Oh, that's all the math I'm doing today."

686
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,080
 Like science marches forward.

687
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,280
 So he keeps looking into it.

688
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:42,400
 But one day he walks in with the office and we get this quote from Mike.

689
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,720
 "I came in and the material was not where it was supposed to be."

690
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,120
 Hey guys, did you see where I put my alien jelly/bio weapon?

691
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,120
 Did you guys see it?

692
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,120
 What?

693
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,480
 I could have sworn I left it right here next to my real jello.

694
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,760
 J-E-L-L-O.

695
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:04,280
 But now that I'm done eating my jelly, I swear to the slimy rice, hey guys, do you know where

696
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,280
 that went?

697
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,280
 Huh?

698
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,840
 Back to the actual quote.

699
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,840
 Quote.

700
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:18,280
 "I asked management what happened to it and the exact words were, 'Do not ask.'"

701
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:23,960
 So according to Mike McDowell, in the midst of trying to discover what this thing absolutely

702
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:29,120
 was, the sample disappeared and he was told to drop all investigation.

703
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,080
 It's a quaint story that's probably passed around quite often in the town of Oakville,

704
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,080
 Washington.

705
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,280
 But for the rest of the world, it's pretty obscure.

706
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:44,920
 I had never heard of this story before and I've looked at a lot of strange rain stories.

707
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,520
 Never ever heard of this one before.

708
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:54,480
 Is it a story of a mysterious rain and around the same time people got sick?

709
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,480
 Psychosomatic?

710
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,800
 They got in their heads, they thought it was hurting them.

711
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,740
 Just two unrelated events.

712
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,320
 Because there was a mysterious rain and a few people got sick and the story got blown

713
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,960
 out of proportion.

714
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,800
 To nowadays, people sit around and tell the stories about they knew that cat.

715
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,120
 It was their cat that died.

716
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,940
 Or was it as bad as people say?

717
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:26,040
 And it was a man-made bio-weapon test on American citizens.

718
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,360
 We'll never know the answer.

719
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,420
 Because if you have the power to unleash a weapon like that, you definitely have the

720
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,520
 power to cover it up.

721
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:41,040
 There may be some old resident of Oakville, Washington that has a little jar in their

722
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:48,480
 basement of little goo rice things that they kept and collected and just kind of filed

723
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,560
 it away sitting down there collecting dust.

724
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:56,120
 They've forgotten about it or they passed away and their descendants have forgotten

725
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,800
 about it.

726
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,800
 And while every other sample of that bio-weapon may be in a laboratory somewhere and scientists

727
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:06,820
 are still pouring over it, collating data, trying to decide whether or not the test was

728
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:13,220
 effective or not, that jar in Oakville, Washington is simply collecting dust.

729
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:19,820
 But all it takes is one clumsy kid goofing off in the basement to knock it over, crashes

730
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:24,500
 onto the basement floor, and the goo spills out.

731
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:30,300
 A bio-weapon that made people sick over 20 years ago, who knows what would happen if

732
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,580
 it was released now.

733
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:37,360
 Maybe it has a half-life, maybe it's completely inert, wouldn't harm anyone even if you ate

734
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,720
 it with a spoon.

735
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:45,440
 Or maybe whatever it was, those organisms, that was just the first stage.

736
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,160
 Scientists think they have all the samples.

737
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:59,440
 But really there's a bio-weapon ready to explode in a small town in Washington.

738
