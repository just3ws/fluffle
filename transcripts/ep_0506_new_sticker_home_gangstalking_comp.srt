1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,400
 Two women in a hotel room discover a bug that leads to something even more disgusting.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,640
 And then we take a look at the story of gang stalking, something we've covered a couple

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,520
 times on this show.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,400
 Sometimes you're stalked by total strangers.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,680
 Sometimes you're stalked by your neighbors.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:26,000
 But today we meet a man who was gang stalked by his own family, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:36,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,600
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,600
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,680
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,240
 The art for this episode, that is the Patreon supporter sticker that I've been sending out

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,800
 this whole time.

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,440
 Carpenter copter pilot.

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,720
 It's made to look like a military badge.

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,600
 And then at the bottom, I can't really pronounce it, I should be able to.

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,600
 It's Basque.

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,920
 It's Basque Ziminoke Ez Dira Existence.

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,920
 Something like that.

19
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,680
 It means monkeys do not exist at the bottom of this badge.

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,640
 I had wanted to do Latin because I was thinking like, you know, there are those military badges,

21
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,160
 but you cannot get a really good translation of monkeys don't exist in Latin.

22
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,040
 But Basque actually was able to capture it perfectly.

23
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,640
 So if you want a Patreon supporter sticker, you support the Patreon, we'll send them out.

24
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,600
 And for you existing, because I still have a ton of stickers to give out guys, for you

25
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,680
 existing Patreon people who have not sent me your address, send me your address, I'll

26
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,680
 send one out.

27
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,240
 I've sent them out all over the world.

28
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:41,200
 I've sent some out to the Russian Federation, Brazil, France, Canada, and a lot of places

29
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,400
 in the United States as well.

30
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,120
 So if you guys are supporter of the show, that's the sticker that we've been sending out.

31
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,360
 It's really cool.

32
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,840
 I have it on all my stuff and I'm getting pictures from people showing me where they

33
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,280
 put their stickers.

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,520
 So that is the sticker.

35
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,960
 That's what we've been talking about this whole time.

36
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,160
 If you want one of those, just support the Patreon.

37
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,520
 Speaking of which, let's give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreons, Tressa.

38
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,840
 Tressa, thank you so much for continuing to support the show.

39
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,640
 She's been supporting it for a long time.

40
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,520
 You're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

41
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,160
 If you can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

42
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,640
 Just help get the word out about the show.

43
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,640
 That really, really helps out a lot.

44
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,880
 Tressa, let's go ahead and get started here.

45
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,880
 We have a great, I think, combination of stories because we're going to take a look

46
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:27,920
 at stalking in general and we're going to look at a real story and then a story that

47
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,880
 sounds absolutely insane.

48
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
 But let's start off with our story.

49
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,400
 I think this is a good combination.

50
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,400
 Tressa, let's hop in at Jason Jalopy.

51
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,840
 We are leaving behind Oregon.

52
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,120
 We're headed out to Key West, Florida.

53
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,120
 I hope everyone brought their swim trunks and bikinis or whatever you wear.

54
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,920
 And we're out there, it's July 15th, 2020.

55
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:53,200
 Now two women are having a good time at the beach and they go, "We're done with that.

56
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
 That got boring.

57
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,200
 Beaches are boring."

58
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
 Really, beaches are pretty boring.

59
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,840
 And they realize that they had a little bit of self-awareness and they go, "This is lame."

60
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,480
 So they go back to their hotel room and at this point, they're getting undressed and we

61
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,760
 don't have the names of these girls.

62
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,520
 This is actually like in court documents.

63
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,320
 We don't have the names of these girls.

64
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,800
 I'm going to call them Allison.

65
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,200
 She's 24 and Mikaela.

66
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,040
 She's 27.

67
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,040
 Those are their real names.

68
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,240
 It's a total shot in the dark, but Allison and Mikaela come back from the beach.

69
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,920
 Mikaela goes, "I have tiny seashells in my vagina."

70
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,160
 That's an actual quote, by the way.

71
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,160
 It's not a joke.

72
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,160
 I didn't make that up.

73
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,240
 She goes, "I have tiny seashells in my vagina."

74
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,080
 And she goes to take a shower.

75
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,840
 Now Allison, the other girl in the hotel, is like, "Oh, that's kind of weird.

76
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,840
 She didn't have to say that so loud."

77
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,480
 Also, I don't think it's true.

78
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,760
 I don't think she has tiny seashells in her vagina.

79
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,960
 Unless it turns out that Mikaela is actually one of the old ones that I've been partying

80
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,720
 with Cthulhu this whole time.

81
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,000
 But while her friend is washing out cosmic horror, Allison decides to take a couple

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,080
 sexy pictures for her boyfriend.

83
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,800
 And while she's like, "Click, click, oh, this one's super sexy.

84
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,440
 Click, click, click."

85
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,960
 She sees a bug run across the floor behind her.

86
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,960
 She gasps.

87
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,760
 And then she goes back to taking pictures of herself.

88
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,760
 Click, click, click.

89
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,760
 She didn't think it was weird.

90
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,880
 She obviously thought it was weird because it seemed sizable and it definitely caught

91
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,880
 her attention.

92
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,600
 But she goes back to taking pictures.

93
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,480
 And at this point, Mikaela gets out of the showers.

94
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,360
 Her vagina is seashell free.

95
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:21,520
 She gets out of the shower and she immediately, I don't understand how Allison missed this,

96
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,440
 Mikaela jumps out of the shower and immediately goes, "Is that a camera?"

97
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:33,000
 And Allison turns around and the bug she had previously seen was actually like a foot-long

98
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,440
 cable with a little camera on the end of it.

99
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,120
 And when Mikaela screams out, "Is that a camera?"

100
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,160
 It zips underneath the door.

101
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,600
 Now, I should have set this up earlier.

102
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,080
 In hotel rooms, most of the time, they'll have a joining hotel room.

103
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,280
 So you have a hotel room, then you have a door connecting it to the hotel room next

104
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,560
 to it, which I always thought was weird, right?

105
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,960
 Because I don't want some lunatic.

106
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,880
 I don't want to get a hotel room and some lunatic next door has a key into my room.

107
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,600
 I've never understood that.

108
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,800
 I get it so you can open up the hotel and have a big party or if your kids are in one

109
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,160
 room and the parents are in another room, they can open it up.

110
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,600
 It's kind of like having a bigger hotel.

111
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,480
 I get that, but super crazy.

112
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,600
 So that hotel, it wasn't coming out from the hallway.

113
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,400
 It was the hotel room next to theirs.

114
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,480
 There's a cable that popped up into their room, had a little camera on the end of it.

115
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,160
 Allison clearly saw something, turned around and goes, "Oh, I guess it's just a bug."

116
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,320
 As there's like a beeping red light, beep, beep, beep.

117
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,560
 But maybe it zipped back under the door and then poked back out.

118
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,240
 I don't know, but when Mikaela came out of the shower, she goes, "Oh my God, is that

119
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,240
 a camera?"

120
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,520
 And it zipped back into the other room.

121
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,960
 And then they hear the door slam in the room next to them.

122
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,520
 So they call hotel security.

123
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,560
 Hotel security calls the police.

124
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,080
 And at this point, the police show up, knock on the hotel room next door, and then we

125
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,800
 meet a man named Robert Privet.

126
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
 He's 49 years old.

127
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
 This is not a business trip.

128
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,520
 He's a government contractor.

129
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,040
 He's doing nothing wrong.

130
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,040
 He tells the police.

131
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,960
 He goes, "Listen, I'll tell you exactly what happened here.

132
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,200
 I was sitting here in mind of my own business.

133
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,400
 And I heard someone in the next room said they had tiny seashells in their vagina.

134
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,560
 Now I've read a lot of H.B.

135
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,680
 Lovecraft in my time, officers.

136
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,640
 And I knew that meant that soon Cthulhu was going to arrive.

137
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,800
 So I just left.

138
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,640
 I was afraid of the cosmic insanity that would ensue if I caught a glimpse.

139
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,040
 Just the glimpse of the darkness.

140
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,080
 And the cops are like, "What?"

141
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,440
 The cops are like, "I guess."

142
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,520
 You may have heard her say that.

143
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,520
 That's fine.

144
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,920
 That's weird, but we don't believe that you just happened to get up and leave your room

145
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,920
 because of that.

146
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,040
 So can we search your room?

147
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,520
 And he goes, "No, you can't search my room."

148
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,720
 And they go, "Okay, well we're going to go get a search warrant."

149
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,000
 And then Robert goes, "Okay, you can search my room."

150
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,120
 And when they did, they found recording equipment.

151
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,720
 They found like the little camera on his phone.

152
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,360
 He had hid a hard drive and things like that.

153
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,400
 What had happened was he's been doing this.

154
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,280
 He admitted to doing this at least 10 times in the past year of recording women in their

155
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,280
 rooms.

156
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,760
 He said he was in his room and he did hear the woman proclaim, "I have tiny seashells

157
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,080
 in my vagina."

158
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,840
 The urge was so great that he had to see, right?

159
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,320
 He had to see what was going on.

160
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,600
 But he was being pervert.

161
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,600
 Apparently he'd been doing this, I should say, allegedly now because this is still ongoing.

162
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,960
 He did make this confession to the police, but he said he'd been doing this at least

163
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,280
 10 times a year before.

164
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,320
 What I thought was funny, so that's obviously sucks, right?

165
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,680
 Your privacy is invaded, little creepy cameras coming underneath.

166
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,920
 What I thought was so funny is there's basically when you read the police report, Allison goes,

167
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,440
 "Yeah, I was standing in the room."

168
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,320
 And Mikaela says that she had tiny seashells in her vagina.

169
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,120
 It went to take a shower and then tells her side of the story.

170
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,720
 When they talk to Robert, they go, "So what happened?"

171
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,240
 He goes, "Well, I was in my hotel room."

172
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,240
 "Yeah, I'm pervert."

173
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,760
 "Elegantly, I've done this before."

174
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,160
 But I was in my hotel room and I heard Mikaela go, "I have tiny seashells in my vagina."

175
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,360
 So I put the camera underneath the door because I figured I'm going to see something, right?

176
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,480
 The very least, a tiny seashell.

177
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,800
 When Mikaela's part of the police report, she's like, "I came into the room and I took

178
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
 a shower."

179
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,160
 She did not touch that.

180
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,640
 She left that part out.

181
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,640
 The other two people are like, "Oh yeah, no, that's like a key part of the story."

182
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,640
 And Mikaela's like, "What?

183
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,360
 What are you talking about?

184
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,360
 What?

185
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,800
 I never, I would never say that."

186
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,840
 As her eyes shift side to side, as a little mollusk on her shoulders, eyes are shifting

187
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,840
 side to side.

188
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,840
 It was so funny because in her police report, I was just minding my own business, reading

189
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,120
 a copy of Anne and Green Gables and decided to take a shower.

190
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,080
 Also, here's a little tidbit.

191
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,280
 I read this police report on Smoking Gun and they blocked out the people's names until

192
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,280
 the last page.

193
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,120
 The last page had these women's real last names.

194
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,320
 So Smoking Gun, you might want to fix that before you face the lawsuit.

195
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,440
 But that's a true case of stalking, right?

196
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,360
 Like it wasn't a systematic thing.

197
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,880
 Like when we think of stalking, it's, I think there's actually a legal definition of stalking

198
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,640
 is there has to be a sustained process of it.

199
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,840
 But it's still a crime obviously.

200
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,000
 You can't be sticking cameras underneath people's doors.

201
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,520
 Cthulhu appearing in this realm or not, still can do that.

202
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,480
 You might get a sympathetic jury if he did save the world, but he didn't save the world.

203
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,800
 He just wanted to look at some naked chicks.

204
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,440
 But I think it's interesting for the story we're going to go into because a lot of times

205
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,400
 people who are gang stalked say, "Well, this does happen."

206
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,560
 And they'll point to real life incidents of people being stalked by the government or

207
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,400
 by criminal organizations.

208
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:32,160
 Obviously there is a thing known as gang stalking and gangs do it.

209
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,760
 You owe someone money.

210
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,320
 You're going to have guys looking for you, right?

211
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,400
 If you commit a crime, you're going to have the government looking for you.

212
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,200
 Or if the government thinks you're up to no good or you're up to good, but the government

213
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,720
 wants to stop it, whatever layer you're on, that's not what's in debate about gang stalking.

214
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,960
 The question is whether you're being gang stalked, right?

215
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,080
 And the weird stuff that goes on.

216
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,560
 I got a YouTube comment the other day.

217
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,840
 It was a very interesting question.

218
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,800
 No one's ever asked me this before as far as doing this show.

219
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,560
 People have asked me about what conspiracies I believe in, but I got this comment from

220
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,880
 John F. Kennedy, 1963, November 22nd.

221
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:13,680
 And he asked, "If I had to give an estimate, how much of my conspiracy stories that I report

222
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,880
 on my channel do I believe are 100% real?"

223
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,760
 I thought that was an interesting question.

224
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,360
 No one's asked me that before as far as like total numbers go.

225
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,720
 And I answered, "Conspiracy theories?

226
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,720
 10%.

227
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,640
 And to be fair, let me elaborate on that."

228
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,640
 That was the answer I gave him.

229
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,640
 Let me elaborate on that.

230
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,840
 I personally pick out obscure and goofy and super weird conspiracy theories.

231
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:42,880
 If I covered stuff like Project Paperclip, MK Ultra, Project Mockingbird, if I covered

232
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,360
 stuff like that, it would be higher.

233
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,800
 I find those conspiracy theories, I think those conspiracy theories are true.

234
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,520
 I just think they're boring.

235
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,840
 That the CIA is manipulating the media to get a message across.

236
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,840
 Of course, yeah, 100%.

237
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
 100%.

238
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,280
 They would be dumb not to do that.

239
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,520
 It's not what you think of when you think of freedom of speech and stuff like that,

240
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,880
 but every government does it.

241
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,720
 I'm not saying it's necessarily a good thing, but I would be shocked if there was a government

242
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,040
 who just let the media do what they wanted.

243
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,800
 I think that's just a boring conspiracy theory.

244
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,400
 I'd much rather talk about monkeys don't exist, which is fun, which is a fun conspiracy theory

245
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,280
 or buildings are evil.

246
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,600
 I think that one's more fascinating.

247
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,280
 There's a lot of conspiracy theories, I believe.

248
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:31,680
 I just don't think they're super exciting to talk about or they're incredibly well-known.

249
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,680
 The Tuskegee experiments.

250
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,000
 This horrible thing.

251
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,120
 There's no debate that had happened.

252
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,320
 It's a horrible story, super well-known.

253
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,080
 I try to cover more obscure stuff.

254
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,680
 That stills it.

255
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,520
 That's why I'd say it's at 10% because I tend to cover conspiracy theories that are goofy

256
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,120
 or wacky or weird.

257
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,640
 But I also went on to talk to John.

258
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,840
 I said, as far as paranormal stuff, like UFOs, I'd say it's probably 60.

259
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,240
 And honestly, I'm going to make it higher.

260
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,000
 I'd probably say 70% of the ghost stories, UFO stories, stuff like that, I believe are

261
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,800
 actually real in some fashion or another.

262
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,040
 The cryptid stories, I don't really believe in.

263
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,760
 The headless flaming mule woman of Brazil, I don't actually think that exists.

264
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,680
 I think it's an interesting idea.

265
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,840
 And I like how it's constructed.

266
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,480
 To me, it's not always about believing in the story.

267
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,520
 I don't believe in Star Trek, but I could watch four or five hours of Star Trek a day.

268
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,240
 I could just watch Deep Space and I'm Voyager or whatever.

269
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,760
 I'd be totally fine, but I don't believe in it.

270
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,560
 I think the stories are entertaining and they tell us a little bit about ourselves and the

271
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,800
 human condition and stuff like that.

272
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,760
 I don't believe in Spider-Man.

273
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,960
 To me, it's not, you don't have to believe it to enjoy it.

274
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,920
 But I just thought that was an interesting question and I wanted to share those answers

275
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,920
 with you.

276
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:51,400
 The story is all stuff, the UFO, alien, ghosts, stuff like that, demons, I would say most

277
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,400
 of that stuff, the majority of that stuff.

278
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,280
 I either believe it's true or find highly plausible.

279
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,320
 Stories about people driving in the middle of nowhere, getting abducted by an alien,

280
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,160
 having some weird event.

281
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,480
 That happened on some sense.

282
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,360
 I don't think they're completely making it up.

283
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,080
 The conspiracy theories, I think a lot of times people are just making it up or they're

284
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,920
 just looking at the facts wrong.

285
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,360
 When kids are fighting off an alien invasion in Casablanca, I don't think a bunch of kids

286
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,320
 got together and made up that story.

287
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,720
 Something happened there.

288
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,800
 What it was, I don't know, was it an alien's ghost with mass hallucination?

289
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,800
 I don't know.

290
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,360
 But I actually believe something happened there on some level.

291
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,880
 Monkeys don't exist, which is one of my favorite conspiracy theories.

292
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,400
 And that's why I have it printed on that sticker.

293
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,520
 It's just a misrepresentation of basic facts.

294
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,280
 It's an observable thing that's being observed wrong.

295
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,040
 So I don't believe in that, but I love reporting on it and stuff like that.

296
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,800
 So that's the answer to that question.

297
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,320
 I just thought I'd share that with you.

298
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,440
 Because going into this next one here, it's the same thing.

299
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,000
 That first story two women were observed by a stranger.

300
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,640
 That was a real event.

301
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,560
 When we look at gangstalking, what they tend to do is they take real events and misinterpret

302
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,560
 them.

303
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,000
 I believe that people, I believe there are people who get gangstalked.

304
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,880
 I believe that there are people who someone's looking for, whether it's because they owe

305
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,080
 money or they're trying to be silenced or something like that.

306
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,800
 But you can tend to look at someone and go, "Oh, that person pissed off the wrong people."

307
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,300
 They're being silenced.

308
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,240
 That's not what we're talking about when we're talking about gangstalking.

309
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,140
 We're talking about incidents like this.

310
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:27,080
 This was actually sent to me by AZ via Gmail, so I appreciate that.

311
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,160
 Tressa, let's hop in that carbon helicopter.

312
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:34,040
 We are headed out to suburbia.

313
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:39,720
 We're flying over this average little suburb in the middle of an average state.

314
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,720
 We land.

315
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,520
 It's just the same house, the same yard.

316
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,520
 You know what?

317
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,520
 To me, honestly, that's dope.

318
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,320
 I'm totally fine with cookie gutter houses.

319
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,320
 I love them.

320
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,600
 But some people hate them.

321
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,600
 We're there though.

322
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
 We're there.

323
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,160
 AZ recently sent me the Reddit.

324
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,200
 He goes, "Hey, man, I heard you got a lot of subreddits.

325
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,080
 You thought you were talking about meth subreddits."

326
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,120
 There's a gangstalking subreddit.

327
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,120
 I was like, "Oh."

328
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,240
 He sent it to me like at one in the morning.

329
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,200
 I was like, "Check this one out."

330
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,200
 Thank you, AZ.

331
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,200
 Really appreciate it.

332
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,240
 It's one of the first things I stumbled across.

333
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,840
 I'm now a member of the gangstalking subreddit.

334
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,960
 But a lot of it is just news articles.

335
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:21,240
 See, a lot of it is, here's this article about this program that does this.

336
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,560
 Here's this news article about this guy who was caught spying on these people.

337
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,520
 So a lot of the subreddit is that.

338
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,960
 And then we get stories like this.

339
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,160
 We're walking around suburbia.

340
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,660
 Me, you, Tressa.

341
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,680
 We're going to meet a young man.

342
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,280
 Let's call, and I do not know his real name, so I'm going to take a shot in the dark.

343
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:42,800
 Let's call him Xyler, because if I get his name right, if I get his name right, then

344
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,320
 it definitely, he's going to totally confirm all this.

345
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,000
 So we'll call him Xyler.

346
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,720
 So Xyler is in an unfortunate circumstance, because most gangstalkers, they think that

347
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,840
 they're mailman stalking them, because you know, mailman comes here.

348
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,040
 I mean, it's so crazy.

349
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,840
 The mailman comes to your house once a day, right?

350
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,840
 They're stalking you.

351
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,000
 He thinks that the mailman's stalking them, bus driver, you know, get on the same bus.

352
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,560
 The bus happens to always know where you're at stalking you.

353
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,640
 But this guy, Xyler, is in an unfortunate predicament, because not only are his neighbors

354
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,400
 gangstalking him, his family is gangstalking him.

355
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:19,120
 Xyler waves to us in his front yard, and we're like, "Should we go in?"

356
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,120
 That's why we're here.

357
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,120
 We're part of the story.

358
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,640
 Xyler invites us into his house, and he goes, "Listen, guys, I know you guys don't believe

359
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,920
 in the whole gangstalking thing.

360
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,440
 I was actually listening to your podcast.

361
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,640
 Listen to your podcast as it was being recorded, my secret listening device."

362
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:38,080
 I didn't know this, but people being gangstalked actually gangstalk themselves.

363
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,560
 So I have listening devices in your house, Jason.

364
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,960
 But you got to understand, I know the truth.

365
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,040
 Here's one of his quotes from his Reddit post here.

366
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:51,280
 The only reason I think I'm being gangstalked is because they fear who I truly am.

367
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:56,080
 I know this is spiritual warfare, and he pauses.

368
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,120
 He pauses for dramatic effect.

369
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,600
 We all look at each other, we're like, "Uh-oh, where's this going?"

370
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,040
 And I am a multi-dimensional being incarnated into a third-dimensional vessel.

371
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,440
 We're like, "Aw, great."

372
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:15,240
 So again, we're already outside of the average IO, the bloods, $50,000.

373
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,440
 I think I'm being gangstalked.

374
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,440
 We'd be like, "Dude, not only are you being gangstalked, we're leaving.

375
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,440
 Good luck.

376
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,440
 We're out."

377
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,040
 This guy is Xyler here, is a multi-dimensional being.

378
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,360
 He knows that as a fact.

379
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,320
 He also, you shouldn't be any surprised to hear what we learn later on, smokes a lot

380
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,320
 of weed.

381
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,160
 I mean, I don't smoke any weed, so really any amount is a lot of weed, but he does smoke

382
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
 weed.

383
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,720
 And he says, "That's fine."

384
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,960
 He says that when he smokes it, it opens up his third eye a lot.

385
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,720
 So I mean, I don't know what type of cush you're smoking, but it's more than a few puffs

386
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,640
 before your third eye even wakes up.

387
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,560
 So that's why I will assume this guy smokes copious amounts of marijuana.

388
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,360
 Anyways, he's a multi-dimensional being.

389
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,000
 Probably does take him a lot to get high.

390
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,480
 So we're walking around this dude's house and he's like, "Listen, I'm being gangstalked

391
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,480
 by my family, like my brother, my mom, my dad, even my sister.

392
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,480
 They're all in on it.

393
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,640
 They're all in on it, which would suck, right?"

394
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,560
 Again, you owe $50,000 to the bloods, not good.

395
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,200
 Imagine you lived with them.

396
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,200
 They're in your house.

397
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,400
 You're like in the bathroom, they're like, "You have that money yet?"

398
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,080
 You're like, "Dude, I'm literally going to the bathroom right now.

399
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,920
 No, I do not have $50,000 in the bathroom.

400
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,760
 Okay, you better have it when you come out.

401
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,760
 I'm not gonna.

402
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,960
 I'm not gonna have it."

403
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,960
 Well, you better.

404
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,960
 The blood's walking away.

405
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,800
 You're like, "Dang it, I need to move and I need to pay them before they murder me."

406
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,800
 He first noticed this.

407
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,160
 As I first noticed, he was being gangstalked and he was mowing the lawn one day.

408
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,520
 He doesn't say how old he is, but he talks about moving out, living with his brother

409
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,360
 for a while and moving back in.

410
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:48,320
 So I'm thanking, again, I almost don't want to give off guesses because if I'm right, he'll

411
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,720
 be like, "Oh, they know."

412
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,040
 I'm assuming though he's in his 20s, which I think is vague enough.

413
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,000
 To move out, you'd still probably be like 16 minimum.

414
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,480
 So I'm guessing in his 20s or something like that, but he's mowing the lawn just so you

415
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,480
 can picture him.

416
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:08,320
 I didn't want you to picture Dennis the Menace, smoking tons of weed, little third eye appearing.

417
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,920
 He's an adult, I would assume.

418
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:14,760
 He's mowing the lawn and this is when he realized he was being gangstalked.

419
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,400
 This is as little as it takes.

420
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,600
 He's mowing the lawn and his neighbor is walking down the street.

421
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,880
 The neighbor looks right at him and touches the tip of his nose and kept walking.

422
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,880
 I don't know.

423
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,240
 I don't think he's still there to this very day.

424
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,200
 And some say on stormy nights, you can still see the neighbor with his finger on his nose.

425
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,880
 Sure eventually he walked away, but that is when he goes, "Whoa, I think I'm being gangstalked.

426
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,520
 Why else would someone touch the tip of their nose?"

427
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,960
 Which is so funny because imagine how many times you've walked down the street and you

428
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,720
 got caught in a spider web and you start waving your hands away.

429
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,960
 Are people watching that being like, "Well, there's one of my gangstalkers.

430
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,960
 There's a website.

431
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,200
 I'll have to pull it back up, but it's where you can report gangstalkers."

432
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
 It's insane.

433
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,840
 You can send a photo to the webmaster and then they post the photo online because they want

434
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,000
 to stalk the gangstalkers or not necessarily stalk them, but out them.

435
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,560
 I think it's called out a stalker or something like that.

436
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:15,720
 I'll put it in the show notes, but there may be a picture of you online.

437
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,560
 You may not know it, but you may actually be a gangstalker.

438
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,680
 You might be a gangstalker if you touch the tip of your nose.

439
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,000
 Jeff Fox word these new routine.

440
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,540
 He starts to see these patterns everywhere.

441
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:31,400
 These patterns are people touching their nose, a plane with their hair, fiddling with your

442
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,400
 pants.

443
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,640
 These are all things that everyone does, right?

444
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,080
 But apparently that is also a sign.

445
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,120
 He doesn't say anything about fighting spider webs, so that's good.

446
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,000
 He also notices the color codes.

447
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,240
 See a lot of times this will come up in gangstalking.

448
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,160
 I see black cars everywhere or I see white cars everywhere.

449
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,200
 Those two colors are generally associated with government cars.

450
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,360
 They're quite bland.

451
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,800
 His color code is burgundy.

452
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,360
 She sees a lot of burgundy.

453
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,360
 Black and white.

454
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,360
 Okay.

455
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,360
 Blue.

456
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,240
 How many colors are you going to get?

457
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,240
 Neon.

458
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,240
 Okay.

459
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,240
 A lime green.

460
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,240
 What?

461
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,760
 Bright pink and bright purple.

462
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,240
 So basically every color, right?

463
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,240
 Other than red.

464
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,480
 Well no burgundy.

465
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,600
 So basically every color.

466
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,720
 He's like, dude, you won't believe it.

467
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,040
 I cracked the code.

468
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:24,080
 If a carbon-based form is walking on the planet, so they're a part of the system, you're wearing

469
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,580
 any color.

470
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,400
 We basically just have to wear ultraviolet clothes.

471
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,160
 But see, so obviously he knows there's going to be skeptics, so he drops some proof for

472
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,160
 us.

473
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,600
 He says, listen to this guys, listen to this.

474
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,680
 He says once his brother, him and his brother are smoking weed.

475
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,320
 This is where he really talks about smoking weed.

476
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,160
 Him and his brother are smoking weed and his brother gets a phone call and his brother

477
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,960
 is on the phone for four or five minutes and he's sitting there and then his brother comes

478
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,120
 back into the room.

479
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,080
 He nudges us.

480
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,720
 He's like, you guys wanted proof.

481
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,360
 We're like, did you expect your brother to enter the infinite void?

482
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,200
 Like when he turned the corner, did you expect him not to exist anymore?

483
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,120
 Eventually he's going to return and Zeiler's like, no, no, no, no, no.

484
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:11,680
 He returned and when he walked back into the room, it was 1044.

485
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,280
 That's the angel number.

486
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,280
 Did you know that?

487
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,280
 We're like, what?

488
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,840
 You just can't drop the new rules.

489
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,440
 He's like, yes, I can.

490
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,280
 1044 is the angel number.

491
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,280
 Is that a real thing?

492
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,280
 I've never heard that before.

493
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:27,120
 1044 is the angel number and he says not only is 1044 the angel number, he sees that number

494
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,920
 on a daily basis.

495
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,920
 Look at each other.

496
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,680
 We're like, you technically should probably see it twice a day, right?

497
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,680
 That's not weird.

498
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,680
 That's not weird, but the pattern, see that pattern recognition.

499
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:42,960
 It's one of those things, people go, why is it whenever I look at the clock, it's 1111?

500
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,760
 Well, probably only looking at a clock twice a day, but technically it's not, but you

501
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,800
 don't remember the times when the pattern isn't there.

502
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,760
 You could go every time I look at the clock, 11 is somewhere in the number.

503
00:22:54,760 --> 00:23:00,000
 So 911 or 1110 or something like that, but it's because you don't recognize the times

504
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,240
 that you don't see.

505
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:06,160
 That is pretty common with a lot of these patterns and things like that.

506
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:10,280
 We only remember the stuff that sticks out, but that's not all.

507
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,280
 That's not all.

508
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,640
 His brother actually continues to torment him.

509
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,400
 He says that once his brother hid his phone, brother hid Zyler's phone in the back seat.

510
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,800
 And so when the car pulled up to the house, the brother jumps down and goes, hey, Zyler,

511
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,320
 don't forget your phones on the back seat.

512
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,520
 And when Zyler is looking for his phone, which is actually a pretty good printable, honestly,

513
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,360
 because it's really hard getting stuff out of back seats, he says, well, I know why he

514
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,360
 did it.

515
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:37,560
 But no, he could give my mother the signal so they could start the whole interaction.

516
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:42,760
 He then turns around and sees his mom scratching her belly, standard gangstalking tactic scratching

517
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,920
 her belly.

518
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:49,320
 There's this weird fight that starts over a ball where his brother goes, that's my ball.

519
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,840
 I mean, the last time I fought over a ball, I was four years old.

520
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,680
 The brother goes, that's my ball.

521
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,920
 And he goes, no, that's my ball.

522
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,720
 And this fight developed over this ball.

523
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,320
 And then he goes, my dad walked by.

524
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,760
 My dad walked by and he was scratching his belly.

525
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,880
 So his dad, that was it.

526
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,680
 He realized that the whole ball argument, the mom scratching her belly, dad walks by,

527
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,680
 scratches his belly.

528
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,760
 Doesn't think maybe the family has parasites.

529
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,360
 Doesn't think maybe he should go to the doctor and have his belly checked out.

530
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,960
 No, it was proof.

531
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,200
 And then said that his mom goes, your ball's downstairs.

532
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,560
 And she points.

533
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,560
 She just points at the basement door.

534
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,600
 He goes, she pointed for like 30 seconds.

535
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,440
 I had to walk past her pointing arm just to go upstairs.

536
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,880
 And as I'm walking upstairs, because I'm not dealing with no ball stuff no more, my sister

537
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:48,240
 walks out of the bathroom wearing red shake my head.

538
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,240
 This is actually what he puts.

539
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,960
 There's my little S-M-H in it.

540
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,480
 So with this whole, so you're like, okay, his family is fighting over a ball.

541
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,480
 What's the point of all this?

542
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:02,240
 Like why, if he's being gang stalked, why is his family fighting over balls and wearing

543
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,240
 red?

544
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:08,000
 Well, with this thing, so they call themselves TIs or targeted individuals.

545
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,480
 They believe that part of this whole gang stalking thing, it's not like when an organization

546
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,920
 is after you, they are trying to get something from you.

547
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,480
 A government organization will kill you or throw you in prison.

548
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,280
 A criminal organization will kill you or kidnap you.

549
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,160
 That's not what gang stalking is about.

550
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,920
 Gang stalking is about driving you crazy.

551
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:33,880
 So they create arguments, they heighten your mood to try to make you kill yourselves or

552
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,120
 injure others.

553
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,400
 That's really what the core is at gang stalking thing.

554
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:43,520
 And sure, you can find government agencies that have tried to like spike people's water

555
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,760
 supply to drive people crazy.

556
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,760
 Fair.

557
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,200
 That has happened.

558
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,720
 Gang stalking has tried to figure out ways to make people hallucinate and things like

559
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,220
 that.

560
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,920
 Those type of news articles you'll see on the gang stalking subreddit.

561
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:59,720
 Those are fairly well known at this point, at least if you follow conspiracy theories.

562
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,960
 But that's not what this is.

563
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,200
 It's not like the CAA is like, "hmm, how can we get this ISIS leader to give up?"

564
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,680
 Does anyone know where his family lives?

565
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,960
 We have this huge wardrobe of red clothes, maybe if they wear this and fight over a ball,

566
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,960
 he'll just kinda give up.

567
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,520
 They just kinda go crazy.

568
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,280
 You don't really see that, but that's this idea here.

569
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,520
 They're trying to be driven crazy with stimuli.

570
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,520
 They call it stimuli.

571
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,080
 So I'm walking down the street, I'm seeing all these people looking at me.

572
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,240
 I feel like I'm going crazy.

573
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,480
 I feel like someone's trying to make me hurt myself or others.

574
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,920
 And that's a big warning sign, right?

575
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,880
 That's a big warning sign.

576
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,520
 We all have been walking down the street and someone kinda pissed us off and we're like,

577
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,720
 "dude, I wish I could put your head right through that window."

578
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,280
 Or if you're Superman, right through that lead wall.

579
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,200
 But you just kinda brush it off.

580
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,680
 Now you may have a workplace bully or you don't like your boss and you feel that pressure

581
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,160
 rising, but then you're able to go home and kinda release that pressure.

582
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,920
 With someone who believes you're being gangstalked, there is no pressure relief valve.

583
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,880
 It's constant.

584
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,280
 Because it's not like you go out and your boss is harassing you and then you're just

585
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,920
 like, "ah, just fine, I'll get another job."

586
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,160
 Or "I'll just got a year or two left here and then I'll have enough experience to go

587
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,160
 somewhere else or whatever."

588
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,120
 This is everywhere and the tension is rising over and over again and you believe they are

589
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,960
 doing it to make you go crazy.

590
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,160
 And a lot of times in these statements by TIs, they will say, "I'm not gonna let them

591
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,560
 make me go crazy, I'm not gonna let them win."

592
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,640
 But it's ramping that up and that's what's troubling about it.

593
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,520
 That's what's really troubling about this.

594
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,840
 Is everyone who thinks they're gangstalked violent?

595
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,840
 No.

596
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,320
 Is everyone who thinks they're gangstalked prone to violence?

597
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,320
 No.

598
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,320
 Is that ratcheting?

599
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,240
 The sense of someone's trying to get me to lose control?

600
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,520
 At the very least, it can't be good for your blood pressure.

601
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:50,760
 I mean, at the very least, right, it can't be good for your own personal health.

602
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,360
 What happens is you have people like this individual who may be totally fine, right?

603
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,400
 It's possible this is a total lark.

604
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,240
 He's just making it up for the gangstalking subreddit.

605
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,400
 It's also possible that this person is going through a some...

606
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,480
 Let's be fair, it's possible that his family is trying to drive him insane too.

607
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,960
 If I'm going to give monkeys don't exist an equal shot, we can say like just for the sake

608
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,840
 of argument, it's possible this guy's being gangstalked.

609
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,160
 I don't believe so.

610
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,520
 I think this guy is smoking too much weed.

611
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,520
 I think he's self-medicating.

612
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,020
 It's the problem.

613
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:25,560
 I think that he believes, has this delusion of grandeur that he's a multi-dimensional being

614
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:29,600
 trapped in a 3D body, which is a delusion.

615
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,120
 And smoking weed's not helping that.

616
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:37,800
 And that's what's troubling about this whole thing, right?

617
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,940
 Is that it's one thing if you believe your neighborhood's checking in on you, you at

618
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,840
 least have that solitude of hiding in home.

619
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,400
 You may think there's cameras in there, you may not brag openly about having seashells

620
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,400
 in your vagina, but you have a little bit of solitude.

621
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,160
 He believes the place where he actually lives is infested with gangstalkers.

622
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,080
 I think that actually raises the stakes.

623
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:03,440
 If he believes he's this multi-dimensional entity, I would assume he thinks that his family

624
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,520
 isn't, that he's better than them.

625
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:12,720
 Like not just like I'm a better writer than my dad, like literally a more perfect organism

626
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,400
 than his biological family.

627
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,600
 That can be very dangerous.

628
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:23,880
 If you think your family actually works for an organization to drive you mad, even though

629
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,280
 you may keep saying I'm not going to fall for it, I'm not going to fall for it, I'm

630
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,120
 not going to go crazy.

631
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,160
 How long can you keep that up?

632
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,960
 Because gangstalking isn't something that goes away.

633
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,760
 Let me rephrase that.

634
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,640
 Gangstalking in this case is imaginary.

635
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,320
 The feeling of being gangstalking never goes away.

636
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:45,320
 The gangstalking, if you took someone who believed they were gangstalked and moved them

637
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:50,480
 to a location where there were no humans, I believe they would still find a way to feel

638
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,640
 they were being observed.

639
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,320
 Because it is a delusion.

640
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,480
 It is a delusion.

641
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,680
 And the person who's being hunted down by the organized crime gang, if they move them

642
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,720
 in a middle of nowhere, they're like, "Oh, this is paradise."

643
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,960
 But this isn't that.

644
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,920
 And that's where we see a lot of the people go, "You don't believe in gangstalking, look

645
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,920
 at this article."

646
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,440
 And we're like, "Yeah, that happened."

647
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,700
 But that guy wasn't a multi-dimensional entity.

648
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,960
 That guy owed the mob money.

649
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:24,480
 Now he's a multi-dimensional entity because his spirit has left his body, but then he

650
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,400
 owed money to the wrong people.

651
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,120
 And he got stalked and they caught him and it had an end date.

652
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:38,080
 This idea of the government or whatever organization picking people and stalking them for however

653
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,480
 long just to make them go crazy, it doesn't hold water.

654
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,920
 I personally think gangstalking is one of the most dangerous conspiracy theories out

655
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,920
 now.

656
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,120
 There's just too many people, too many people believe in it.

657
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,640
 And while there have been cases of violence linked to gangstalkers, it hasn't been super

658
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,640
 widespread, I think we'll see an uptick in it.

659
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,560
 I just think it makes you feel important and it's just growing in popularity.

660
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:07,160
 There's enough news articles and stuff that pops out that lends credence like this guy

661
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:11,080
 was stalked for six months by this gang and then he was killed.

662
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,880
 There's just enough, which was a guy who owed money to this gang.

663
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,200
 There's enough stuff to keep it going and it's based on violence.

664
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,800
 Gangstalking is about psychological violence trying to get me to commit physical violence

665
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,160
 and it's rooted in violence.

666
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:33,000
 So the end result of that is if they win, I go crazy and commit criminal acts.

667
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,480
 That's what makes this one dangerous because that is a possibility.

668
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,240
 The possibility is they don't break and they live to be 60 years old and they just die of

669
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,440
 high blood pressure, right?

670
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,120
 That's one possibility.

671
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:50,800
 Or the other one is in between the age of 20 and the age of 60, at one point they go,

672
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:55,080
 you know what, I give up, the bad guys win and they just blow everyone up.

673
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,360
 You don't see that in the true third movement.

674
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,400
 You don't see that in the flat earth movement.

675
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:04,840
 This one is either I maintain, because there's no way to defeat this faceless enemy, either

676
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:11,280
 I maintain my sanity that is trying to be destroyed every single day or I snap.

677
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:17,440
 That's not good odds for us people just walking down the street scratching our bellies, right?

678
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,240
 There's a mosquito on my arm, I slap it, uh oh.

679
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,160
 I've just outed myself as a gangstalker.

680
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:27,640
 I think the chance of violence with gangstalkers is much higher than any other conspiracy theory.

681
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:34,280
 And the fact that there is a subreddit about it doesn't shock me, but it worries me.

682
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,960
 It is an echo, it should exist, I mean I'm not trying to tell Reddit to take it down,

683
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:43,000
 but it's an echo chamber for people who feel isolated already, so they're communicating

684
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,200
 with other people who feel isolated, so it makes them feel like they're connected.

685
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,000
 But it's this delusion that is just so, so dangerous.

686
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 So dangerous.

687
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,160
 So, Xaylor, I hope, I mean we joked a bit today, I hope, personally I hope that it's

688
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,680
 a troll, like I understand gangstalkers are around stuff like that, but hopefully you're

689
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,640
 just like, yeah I just made it up, I just make fun of gangstalkers, that'd be the best thing,

690
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:12,040
 but if that's not the case, I hope that you're healthy and I hope that you get the help that

691
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:17,280
 you need, whether it's to stop self-medicating, whether it is to figure out another way to

692
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:21,360
 deal with some of the anger issues or whatever, or if you need to go see a therapist, I don't

693
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,760
 know, some people have issues with that, that's fine, whatever, but just, this isn't real

694
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,080
 dude, this isn't real, and I just hope you're healthy, whatever path you take to get to

695
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:36,040
 that health is what I would be great, and that everyone's fine because the alternative

696
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:42,920
 is not good for anyone involved, and it is a very, very dangerous and violent conspiracy

697
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:51,760
 theory that is based on maintaining your sanity every single day until either this imaginary

698
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,480
 organization is destroyed, which is impossible because it's imaginary, or you die of old

699
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,960
 age, and that's a long battle, it's a long, long battle, and honestly I don't think it's

700
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:09,440
 something that most people could keep up, that constant idea of being watched and not

701
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:16,520
 even have the safety of home to retreat to, very, very dangerous conspiracy theory, very,

702
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:23,800
 very dangerous conspiracy theory, and it gets more popular every single day.
