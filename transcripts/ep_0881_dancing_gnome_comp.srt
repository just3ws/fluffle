1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 While Congress is holding their first UFO conferences in half a century, even more bizarre conspiracies lurk through America's halls of power.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 A young babysitter is suddenly filled with terror when she senses something evil in the house.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 And then we meet a young man who has been plagued for 20 years with the reoccurring dream.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Is it simply a matter of his neurons firing while he sleeps and his brain is trying to make sense of the chaos, or is he the victim of an unfulfilled love spell today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day as well. We got a ton of stuff to cover. You guys heard the intro.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 A ton of stuff to cover. So let's go ahead and get started right away first off.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now is two longtime listeners of the show. Give it up for Mina and Murphy.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Woohoo! Yeah! Come on in guys, they're doing a little runway strut.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Mina and Murphy are actually two of the listeners who came to visit me at the McMinnemons UFO Fest in McMinnville, Oregon.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 It was really, really cool meeting you guys in person. I had a lot of fun. It was really, really awesome.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Mina and Murphy, you guys are going to be our captains, our pilots this episode.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 If you guys can't meet me in person, I totally understand. Just help spread the word about the show. That really, really helps out a lot.

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Now, Mina, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible. We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 We are flying all the way out to Washington, D.C.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 And we're so high up in the sky, and we're flying over the nation's capital, they scramble F-18s. Is that the plane we're using? They're scrambling F-22s after us.

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Roger, Roger, this is a plane flying towards you. I don't know the commands. This is my first day on the jump.

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 These jets are flying towards us because they think we are UFO. What's going on right now? This is something that's been all over the news.

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Congress is holding, it started on Tuesday. It's holding its first congressional hearing in 50 years, first public congressional hearing in 50 years about UFOs.

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 And listen, I was at the McMinniman's UFO Festival. The place was a buzz about this hearing, and just in the conspiracy sphere in general, and the UFO sphere, I've been researching this stuff all the time, right?

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 This has been popping up a lot. Oh, they're going to be holding these hearings. What is going to be revealed? Nothing is the answer to that? Absolutely nothing.

24
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 And that's kind of what I expected. I actually haven't really covered this a lot at all. This is old hat for me. I've been involved in the conspiracy theory UFO community for 30-some odd years at this point.

25
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 I knew nothing was going to come out about any of this stuff. People held out hope, and I get it, you want this information to be revealed.

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 But listen, here's the, I think there's a couple different things. I want to cover this briefly, because there's a ton of articles about this, but I wanted to cover this just briefly.

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 First off, I don't think we know what they are. I do not, out of all the conspiracy theories, that might be true. I think the least likely is that the, I think it's a cool one.

28
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Don't get me wrong, I think this is a really cool conspiracy theory. I think we've done episodes on it in the past. It's really cool, super evocative, that aliens have made contact with the world government, specifically America, or western powers, really.

29
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 And we have some sort of alliance with them. This is the way this conspiracy theory goes. In exchange for technology, we allow great aliens to abduct ex-amatic humans per year.

30
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Really cool, really cool conspiracy theory, as long as you're not one of the people being abducted. But I don't believe that's true. I don't believe that there's any evidence of that whatsoever.

31
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 I do believe that there are aliens out there, but I don't believe that there is a widespread alliance between western political powers and aliens. There's just nothing to prove that.

32
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 I don't believe, as much as I would like to, that aliens and humans have made this agreement. There's all sorts of different variations of this. One is that there are actually human personnel on alien starships, exploring the stars.

33
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 It's a really popular conspiracy theory. And that's a little more lighthearted than the fact that we're trading technology for human beings.

34
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 There's just nothing to back that up. I think that the sightings that we are seeing, the reason why there is not any disclosure from the US government, is because the answer is we don't know what they are.

35
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 And that's kind of what they've been talking about at the Congressional hearing, but they're not saying we don't know what they are and they're alien. They're saying we don't know what they are.

36
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 They may be the whole weather balloon thing, now they're even saying just regular Milar balloons that you can buy at the dollar store floating so high in the sky and out evading our fighter jets.

37
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 I mean, they come up with some really dumb excuses, but they're calling this new thing air clutter or sky clutter. There's so much stuff in the air that we literally don't know what it is, but we don't think it's extraterrestrial.

38
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 It was kind of the line that we're getting. It was interesting, I was reading over some of the articles about this, I'll put them in the show notes. They were saying that there has been an uptick in sightings.

39
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 They said that the original military database, the more recent one was 143 incidents and that was in a report issued last year.

40
00:05:48,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Now they're saying up to 400 incidents, so just in a year we're having more of these incidents being revealed to us at least, but they're saying we don't know what it is and I thought this was interesting.

41
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 They said that we have received no communication from these vehicles and we have not attempted to communicate with them either. When we're sending up our fighter jets, they're not like Roger Roger, why are you flying like that? Tell us who you are.

42
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 No, when the fighter jets encounter these things, they believe that they are unmanned. So here's a thing, you can reveal little pieces of information like that, but here's the thing, I don't think the US government knows what these things are.

43
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 And if they are alien, they would never reveal that. Imagine if you knew that your country was vulnerable to a highly technological opponent who can shut down your nuclear weapons and go wherever they wanted at any time and there's no way to catch them.

44
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 And we believe they're not of this world. The US government would never admit that. They would know government would because it makes them look helpless and it would be terrifying.

45
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Even if the think tanks, even if the people in the Pentagon, in these secret agencies believed that say 10% of these were from another world, they would never admit that because the truth is too terrifying.

46
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 So disclosure will not happen for that reason, because we don't know what they are and we will not admit that we have no defense against them.

47
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 The other reason why I don't think disclosure will happen, this is a nice first step, but I knew that nothing was going to come out of this, right?

48
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 I knew it wasn't going to be a senator walking in and throwing down a big book and then he opens it up and it's a holographic book and an alien drops out.

49
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Hey guys, I knew that wasn't going to happen, first off because that's ridiculous, but secondly, either they don't want to admit that they don't know what they are and they may be from another world, or two, the secret agencies that run this country would never let this information get out.

50
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 This was already just to admit that we've had 400 sightings of things we don't know. This took a ton of effort and you had secret agencies, the FBI, the NSA, the CIA, all of these other groups and those are the ones that we know of, right?

51
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 How many alphabet agencies are out there that we've never heard of? They were fighting against how much information to release because at the end of the day, their vested interest is in keeping secrets secret.

52
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 If we admit, as a country, if we admit that we don't know what these things are, we're basically admitting to our geopolitical enemies that we don't know what they are.

53
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 And let's say this happened, let's say on August 27th, 2020, there was an unidentified flying object over Nevada. It was caught on film and scrambled the fighter jet, they caught it with their instruments, their radar and things like that.

54
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 And then at this congressional hearing, you have someone say that is one of the unidentified sightings. We have instrumentation showing that it was there and we have video filmed from a bystander showing it was there, but we don't know what it was.

55
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 And China knew what it was. This was a piece of Chinese technology that was spying on America. If we admitted that this is one of the 400 things we have no idea what it is, then China knows that their technology is successful.

56
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 The secret agencies do not want this information out. Not necessarily because they're working with aliens, but because out of these 400 things that they go, we don't know what it is, if 10% of those are Chinese or Russian technology, then they know that they have the upper hand.

57
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 So both of those reasons are why I don't think disclosure will happen. If disclosure, if these UFOs, if these unidentified aerial phenomenon, whatever you want to classify them as, if they are alien, the United States government and really no government, whatever admit we don't know what they are and they can violate our airspace at any time, we haven't known what they were since the 1940s.

58
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 We'll never admit that.

59
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 And let's say it's not aliens, let's say it's human. It's really hard for the National Security Agency or the CIA to say, yeah, our airspace is being violated, we don't know what they are, and the enemies who are putting them up there, they know when they're flying these vehicles over the United States, if we keep going, we don't know what it is, we don't know what it is, we don't know what it is, then their technology is successful.

60
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 So it took a lot of fighting to get this list of these 400 items, a ton of it's redacted, and I can guarantee why it's redacted, because of the reasons of the geopolitical enemies. I think some of them are alien.

61
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 Some of these UFOs are alien. I think a great deal of them is probably Skyclutter, and then another chunk of them are from Russia or from China, or any other geopolitical foe we may have in the world.

62
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 So it's fascinating, I love the idea of disclosure, I don't think it's ever going to happen in the way that we want it to happen, or that there's going to be some sort of breakthrough case that'll prove it.

63
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Outside of one of these vehicles being shot down and retrieved, and I wouldn't even say that, shot down or crashed in a heavily populated public area will never really know the truth.

64
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 But again, I think most of them are Skyclutter. Some of them are enemies, vehicles, and some of them are from another world.

65
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 It's very interesting to look at, but I didn't really talk about it leading up to it. I kind of knew what it was going to happen.

66
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 And you're like, "Jason, maybe you should wait for the report to come out." So then you could obviously be right, because you know it was already out.

67
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 I knew it was going to play out like this. I would love to know more about this stuff, but I understand why the secret agencies don't tell us this stuff.

68
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 And speaking of that, Mina and Murphy, let's go ahead and take a closer look at some of the, I don't want to say dirty tactics or the tricks, but this is so interesting to me.

69
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Mina, go ahead and land this dead rabbit dirgeable in Washington, D.C. We're walking around. We're in Congress now, and we're going to go find the empty seat.

70
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 The empty seat in the House of Representatives that was once populated by a young man known as Madison Cawthorne.

71
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Now Madison Cawthorne, again, just a quick summary on this thing, we covered him on a previous episode. This was so fascinating.

72
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 This is such a fascinating story. A while back, Madison Cawthorne, he is a representative from North Carolina. He's a Republican representative.

73
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 A while back, like the past couple of weeks, he did an interview on a podcast. I'll put the full episode in the show notes, but just a quick summary.

74
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 He did an interview on a podcast where he told a story about being invited to orgies involving very rich and very old Congress people.

75
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 And he says, "These are people I looked up to throughout my career, and they're like, 'Hey, you want to come have this orgy with us?'"

76
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 And he's like, "Gross, no, it's super disgusting." I don't know if he actually said that. He's all, "Ew!"

77
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 And he said this on a podcast, and it caused a huge political storm. Now, it's so interesting, you can say all sorts of weird stuff when you are a politician.

78
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 And for the most part, how it happens is the opposing party skewers you, tries to get you out, and your political party goes, "Ah, nah, he's a good kid. He's a good kid."

79
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 And we believe that too, no matter how radical it is. It takes a lot to get kicked out of your own party.

80
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 But Madison Cothorn said, "These dudes wanted me to go bang a bunch of people with them, and I wasn't down with that."

81
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 It caused a huge firestorm in Washington, D.C. And he was being told, "Recant that. We want you to go on the record and say that that's not true."

82
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 It's the fact that you had other Congress people saying, "Oh, he came to me and told me it wasn't true, so I will tell you that he said it wasn't true."

83
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 And he would come out and be like, "No, it is true. Quit trying to put words in my mouth."

84
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Since then, you can do all sorts of political sins, right? But you can never turn against your own party, and you definitely can't reveal secrets.

85
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Since then, this is all the stuff that's happened to Madison Cothorn.

86
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 Shortly after making the allegation that powerful members of his own party were having orgies, there was a photograph of him released wearing women's lingerie.

87
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 And what's so interesting is I actually, I edited it out of that episode. I took it out, but I actually started to go into the whole idea that J. Edgar Hoover was a cross-dresser,

88
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 was a rumor that came out, and apparently there was a photo floating around D.C. back when J. Edgar Hoover, the guy who really created the FBI, made it what it is today,

89
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 that he was a cross-dresser because there was a photo of him in women's lingerie.

90
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 And the idea was that that was a blackmail photo. Like, it got reported in the media, long after he passed away, it got reported in the media, and it became a big joke.

91
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 But the idea was that this photo was taken as blackmail fuel. It's not like he actually was a cross-dresser.

92
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Someone made him, the head of the FBI, dress up in lingerie and took a photo of it, and said, "This is the way we're going to keep you in line."

93
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 And I took that part out of the episode. I edited it for time.

94
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 And then this photograph of Madison Cawthorne pops up, he's wearing women's lingerie, and it's a photo of him, and he's surrounded, he's flanked by these two young women, and he's wearing like a bra.

95
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 He's wearing like a bustier or whatever it is.

96
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 He released that photograph, and he didn't recant his story. He did not publicly come out and say that I made up the whole orgy thing.

97
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 I don't know how they got this. I don't know how they got this. They had the photo of him in women's lingerie.

98
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Apparently, it was like he was on a cruise or something like this. This was, again, I believe, before he was in the Congress.

99
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Then, he didn't recant his story. Then, they, somebody, I mean, we know who it was, right? It was his own party coming after him.

100
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 There was a video, and I watched the video, right? I know that this is real. It wasn't a deep fake. He admitted that this video was true, as distressing and weird as it is.

101
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Madison Cawthorne, there was a video of him completely naked, climbing on top of his male cousin, who's underneath some blankets, and apparently, you can, you can not show the kids out of the room for the next 30 seconds.

102
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Apparently, this video shows Madison Cawthorne fully naked. You see that. You see a head peek out from underneath a blanket, then Madison Cawthorne crawls up on top of this dude and rubs his genitals on his male cousin's face.

103
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 And you hear a woman laughing as she's videotaping this thing. Again, I believe that was before he was a member of the House of Representatives.

104
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 So you have this guy who originally was a rising star in the Republican Party, gets slammed with the lingerie photo, says, "Ah, whatever, you know, we're partyin', who cares?"

105
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Then they release the video footage of him naked climbing on top of his cousin, and Madison rubbing his genitals in his cousin's face. Bizarre stuff, right?

106
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 And now, he, as of tonight, I'm actually recording this episode on May 17th, he has lost his seat. He was defeated in the election, so he will not be returning to the House in the fall.

107
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Absolutely bizarre. Listen, I don't know anything about the guy's politics at all. I was vaguely aware of him before all of this, and then I saw this stuff pop up.

108
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 I don't, the voters of North Carolina, that's their district, they decide who to vote for, but you can't deny that the fact that he was saying this stuff, he had this interview on this podcast, the secret groups came after him.

109
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 You cannot deny that. This played a part in his getting kicked out of the House of Representatives.

110
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 Now, again, maybe they didn't like his politics in that district anymore, who knows. But this played a part as well. How big of a part? We don't know.

111
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 But I mean, I would assume it would be kind of hard to vote for this guy if you were against, if you were against having genitals rubbed on people's faces.

112
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 Madison Cawthorne will be a cautionary story for politicians for the next 50 years. Whenever a politician even thinks about stepping out of line, even thinks about it for a moment, the story of Madison Cawthorne fully documented throughout the media will be used as leverage against these people who are thinking about speaking out against their own party.

113
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 You can always speak out against the other party. That's part of the game, right? But he dared to go against his own party and he dared to reveal secrets.

114
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 I have no doubt that these old dudes are having orgies. I have no doubt in my mind that every so often they get all the interns together and they take maybe not all of them, maybe not the nerdy ones, but I'm sure that this happens.

115
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 It's not shocking to me and anyone who's followed politics at all, politicians are gross. And you know why politicians are gross? Because people are gross. People do gross stuff and politicians are people.

116
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 And I'm not even judging them if they want to have orgies, right? It's not like the biggest thing that I hate is hypocrisy. If these guys were anti-orgie, they're trying to make orgies illegal.

117
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Orgies for me, but not for thee, then it would be a problem. But if Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell want to rub wrinkles against each other, what do I care?

118
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 But he revealed the secret and he got ran out and this will be a cautionary tale. This is the new version of the J. Ed Gehoover lingerie photo.

119
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 If you step out of line, we will, we have the dirt. See, they have this dirt on him this whole time. Crazy story. When you go against the machine, the machine grinds your bones to dust.

120
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 Again, I don't know anything about this guy's politics. He could be super radical, he could be a Mitt Romney Republican. I have no idea what spectrum he was on because that doesn't really interest me.

121
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 What interests me is the blackmail engine that really powers the world. Fascinating.

122
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Fascinating to look at that. Normally we don't see this. Normally the person backs down right away or they don't mention it on a podcast that goes out.

123
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 They may mention it to a colleague and someone goes, "Dude, you gotta keep your mouth shut. Don't tell anyone what you just told me. Keep your mouth shut because it will come down to you."

124
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 He said it on a podcast that got distributed. We saw him not back down from these allegations and they buried him bit by bit until now he is unemployed.

125
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Bizarre story. Mina and Murphy. Why am I on this episode? Why am I on the episode that the CIA is definitely going to investigate everyone involved in?

126
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Mina and Murphy, the new producers of Dead Rabbit Radio, get them officers, not me.

127
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 Mina, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We're leaving behind Washington, D.C. We're headed all the way out.

128
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 Tawawa Tosa, Wisconsin. The year is 1974 and it's night time. The moon is out, stars twinkling in the sky.

129
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 And inside a house is a young woman. We don't have her name. We're going to call her Michelle.

130
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 She's in this house, she's babysitting. This is the easy part of babysitting, right? The baby's asleep, so she's just sitting in the living room.

131
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 It's 1974. She's watching television, probably watching some WKRP in Cincinnati. I didn't actually say that in my notes.

132
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 But one can hope that was a funny show. She's sitting there and then all of a sudden she feels a cold chill envelop her body.

133
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 This startles her. She didn't expect to have this sensation. Most people don't when they're inside a closed house.

134
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 And then she becomes overwhelmed with a fear she had not felt just a moment ago.

135
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 She's sitting there watching Lonnie Anderson fight off the haircut. And she's sitting there watching Lonnie Anderson fight off the advances of her male coworkers.

136
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 She's fearful. She's not fearful because Lonnie Anderson might not be able to stop the DJ from kissing her in this episode.

137
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 She's fearful because, well actually she doesn't know why. She doesn't know why. Maybe it's because of WKRP in Cincinnati.

138
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 She feels this sudden urge to check on the baby. This fear overtakes her and she's like, "I got to check on the baby."

139
00:22:39,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 So she walks through the house and heads towards the nursery. When she opens the nursery room door, eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

140
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 Containing the baby she was sent there to watch. And then she sees some motion next to the crib.

141
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 In a corner of the room there was a little man. Michelle looked at this figure and she said he looked to be about the height of a two year old.

142
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 And he was wearing what she described as "old world clothing." So he had knee length britches, little suspenders, a vest, and a loose fitting shirt.

143
00:23:47,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 She can make out all of these details. She's standing there staring at this odd fellow and he's dancing in the corner of the room.

144
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Dancing to a song only he can hear. But through the pale glow of the night light, she clearly sees this small man dancing in the corner.

145
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Near the crib. Michelle walks towards the crib. Her eyes transfixed on this stranger.

146
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 She said he seemed to have long, unkempt hair. He just looked dirty in general.

147
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 Had a wild beard and a mustache. And he's just dancing away in the corner of the room.

148
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 Michelle kept her eyes focused on this dude. And she reached into the crib and slowly pulled out the baby.

149
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 And as she walked out of the room she walked out backwards. Not daring for a single moment to look away from the dancing man.

150
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 I was talking to a friend of mine today and I said, she's a mom, and I go, "What would you do if you walked into your daughter's bedroom and there was a tiny man dancing in the corner?"

151
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 And she responded, "Oh, I would be absolutely terrified if there was a stranger in my daughter's room." That would be your worst nightmare as a parent.

152
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 You go in and check on your kid and there's somebody in there that's not supposed to be in there. You don't know who this dude is.

153
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 And I said, "Yeah, but what if he was dancing? Would it matter if he was doing a really slow, creepy Twin Peaks dance?

154
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 Or like if he was doing a jig? Is one creepier than the other?" And she said, "It wouldn't matter whether or not it was a slow dance, a slow sensual dance.

155
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 He's doing the one man lumbada. Or if he was doing gungum style, it wouldn't matter. He's a stranger in my daughter's bedroom.

156
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 I'd be furious and terrified at the same time. And I go, "But what if, like, would it matter if he was doing like an old-fashioned jig?

157
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 Or if he was doing that dance from the Allie McBeal baby?"

158
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 She's like, "I think you're really fixated on what he's dancing. What type of music he's dancing to. It doesn't matter.

159
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 The fact that there's a stranger in a child's room is what's terrifying. Not the dance, Jason. Don't focus on the dance."

160
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 But I disagree. I disagree with that mother on how terrifying it would be to have a dancing stranger in your room.

161
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 And here's why. This is why the story is so spooky. It actually came from, I got it from ThinkAboutAdox.com.

162
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 They got it from a book I'm currently reading called Dark Zones by Sharon Jarvis.

163
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 It's a collection of just weird stories, a collection of nothing but stories about people dancing.

164
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 Listen, here's what's creepy about this. Sure, a total stranger being in a room with a baby. Yeah, that's unsettling.

165
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 But if he was dancing, it's ten times worse. I know people are like, "What are you talking about? Here we go."

166
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 If a goblin does goblin-esque things, let's say that you're walking through the woods, and you're apparently on your way to a gingerbread house,

167
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 and a goblin jumped out, and the goblin had a little spear and a little loincloth made of leather, and he's poking you in the butt and he's trying to get your gold.

168
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 You'd be like, "That's what a goblin does as you're running through this path being chased by this goblin."

169
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 If a goblin does something that's goblin-related, it's not as spooky, right?

170
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 But if that goblin jumped out of the woods and just stood there perfectly still, and just stared at you,

171
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 they didn't do anything. Okay, this is a bad example, because it's still a monster in the middle of the woods.

172
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 Let's forget that part. I'm not going to edit out because I'm too lazy.

173
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 Imagine- Okay, here's a perfect example. If you go to a circus, and you see a clown at the circus,

174
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 and he's dancing, and he's juggling, and he's falling on his butt, and he's crawling in and out of a tiny car,

175
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 you're like, "This is super boring." I don't know why anyone likes clowns. You're like, "Boo! This is boring.

176
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 "Saw yourself in half or something. Get squished by an elephant."

177
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 But if that exact same clown, if you came after yelling at him to get squished by an elephant,

178
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 if you drove home and you walked into your house and that clown was standing in your garage as your car's pulling in,

179
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 and he's standing there, it's terrifying. Why is it terrifying? Because you don't expect to see a clown in your garage,

180
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 unless you have a tiny car, and then you're like, "Oh, I forgot. I carpool with clowns every day.

181
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 "50 clowns pour out of your car." When things do stop, we're going to have time to get to the love story one.

182
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 I'm sorry, we're already- I'm just getting started on this. We'll get to the love story one tomorrow.

183
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 If something does something that it's related to, so you're in a bank and there's a bank robbery,

184
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 and that guy comes in with a gun and goes, "Everyone get down, get down." These are all bad and imposing.

185
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 That's terrifying no matter what. What I'm saying is, if I walked in- let me go back to the original example.

186
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 Obviously, I'm not like, "Oh, that bank robbery wasn't so scary because it happened in a church.

187
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 "You're still like on your hands and knees as they're taking the tithes money.

188
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 "You're like, "Uh, God's going to make me pay more." If you walked in- tell me, tell me I'm not off, right?

189
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 I imagine this when I was reading the story. I walk into a dark room, and if I saw a gnome,

190
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 or just saw a man wearing old-fashioned clothes, a little tiny man wearing old-fashioned clothes,

191
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 in the corner of the room, and he wasn't doing anything. I'm not saying that it wouldn't be spooky, right?

192
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 It would still be scary, but if he was dancing, you'd like Jason to know.

193
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 Just end the episode because you're not going to win us over. You guys have to admit,

194
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 if you walked into a room and there was a tiny little guy just standing there,

195
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 at night, when you go to bed, when you shut the light off, right? When that bulb goes, "Beef!"

196
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 You have that last second of light. You see a tiny man standing in the corner of your room,

197
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 the "Yes, that is scary." On a scarrow scale, that would be three scarrow lanterns.

198
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 But imagine if you woke up in the middle of the night, and you saw a tiny man-

199
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 It doesn't even really matter what size he is. He's a normal-sized human.

200
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 If you saw a man dancing in the corner of the room, that's way scarier.

201
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 That's way scarier. I think it depends on the dance.

202
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Again, if he was doing gungom style, or if he was doing river dance or something like that,

203
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 he's flossing in the corner. Probably not super scary.

204
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 But imagine if he was just swaying back and forth, and his arms are kind of going over his head.

205
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 His body is just moving in some sort of weird rhythm. He's really getting into it.

206
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 He's sweating. He has a baby pacifier in his mouth and glowsticks.

207
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 That's what woke you up.

208
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 Was the green and yellow glowsticks? I think that it's something creepy about that.

209
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 I think that it's creepier. I really do think it's creepier.

210
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 I guess my point is it's creepy when goblins and little-known people, like a dude with a gray alien,

211
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 was dancing on a spaceship. You've been abducted. You have a three-foot probe shoved up your butthole.

212
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 You're like, "What? This is only four?"

213
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 This is only four scarol lanterns on the scarometer. It's not that bad.

214
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 The aliens start dancing. You're like, "Ah! No, now it's even more terrifying."

215
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 I guess... Listen, I think that it's scarier.

216
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 I think that it's scarier to see a little man dancing in the corner, or a regular-sized man,

217
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 or a gray alien, or a demon was dancing. I guess it would depend on the dance, too, right?

218
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 But it's creepy. It's creepier than just standing there.

219
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Now, I will say this. I originally had more planned to do.

220
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 I had a whole other segment. I was going to give Mina and Murphy a chance to fly the Carbenter Copter.

221
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 We're going to save that for tomorrow. You guys will be back for our Friday episode,

222
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 flying around in the Carbenter Copter, because I want everyone to have a chance in that vehicle.

223
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 I'm just going to wrap this episode up by saying, "So tonight, when you go to bed,

224
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 when you're crawling into bed and you are closing your eyes, think of your worst nightmare.

225
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 Think of the worst thing that you could ever imagine happening.

226
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 Now, not something super depressing you're losing my loved ones.

227
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 Nothing like that. Think of the worst boogieman you could possibly think of.

228
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 Maybe that is the actual boogieman.

229
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 Maybe that's Mr. Boogity from the classic 1980s Disney movie.

230
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 Maybe that is just your boss.

231
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 Who's also Mr. Boogity? You work for a monster in the closet.

232
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 Imagine the person or thing you're the most scared of that doesn't involve any sort of deep-seated trauma.

233
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 Now, before you go to bed, imagine that thing dancing in the dark, right?

234
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 You're not in my club. You did it as the boogieman after a date.

235
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 You're like, "Oh, my greatest fear turned out to be the best romance for me."

236
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000

237
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 For me, I think a zombie would probably be, you know, like if I looked at... I guess that's just a stupid thriller video.

238
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 Okay, never mind.

239
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 That was scary, though, wasn't it? Wasn't that thriller video super spooky?

240
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 Imagine if the zombies were just walking through the neighborhood as Michael Jackson was singing.

241
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 It was... okay, whatever.

242
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 Mina, you're gonna be back for tomorrow's episode so we can get you in the Garment of Cofftor.

 I hope you guys do my experiment tonight, but do not think that Michael Jackson, classic thriller,

244
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 think of the worst thing you can think of but make a dance in, then you tell me how terrifying your night was.
