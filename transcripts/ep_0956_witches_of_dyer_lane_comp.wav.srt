1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Nobody likes a cheater, and if you've been watching the news lately, there's been a lot of them lately.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 From the world of poker to competitive fishing, it seems like every day there's a new scandal involving cheating.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 But when it comes to the world of the paranormal, we are forced to ask ourselves the question,

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 "Is using magic or the law of attraction its own kind of cheating?"

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Very, very interesting topic, and then we travel to Dyer Lane,

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 a haunted road that I've personally been to and done on the ground ghost investigations at.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 But nothing could have ever prepared me to face down the witches that still haunt this road.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 [Music]

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day, I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 I hope you guys have some awesome plans for the weekend.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 We got a lot of stuff to cover, so first off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command is one of our legacy patreons.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Everyone get on your feet and give it up for Amber. Woohoo! Yeah, Amber's walking on into Dead Rabbit Command.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 That sounded a little lecturous, sound like we were a cat calling her.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Amber's walking on in. Amber, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's totally fine, I totally get it.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Just help spread the word about the show that really, really, really helps out a lot.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Now Amber, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Let's go ahead and climb up the highest point in Dead Rabbit Command, grab on to Amber's ankles,

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 she's going to fly us all the way out to a video game competition place.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 I don't know if that's in arenas or something.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Online competitive video games.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 It's a bunch of people sitting shoulder to shoulder on their computers.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 But it apparently, people are saying it's a real sport.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 It's a real sport because, like, you compete, you just open the tone of my voice.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 "Listen, I love video games, I don't consider online competitive video games."

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 It's something, I don't know if I would call it a sport.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 But who cares really? Who cares what I think?

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 If you're unsubscribing to the podcast, I'm like, "Oh, no, no, no, I agree with you."

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 If you think it is.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Listen, I love video games. I love Roger Ebert.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 And when Roger Ebert was like, "Video games aren't art," I was like, "Okay, that's cool. I love Roger Ebert."

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 And I love video games, and I really don't care what his viewpoint is regarding the steps I'm making.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 I'm wiping tears away. I'm like, "Oh, Roger Ebert."

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 You know what I mean? Like, who cares? Who cares what this one do?

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 And who cares if it's art or not?

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Like, that doesn't change the fact that I like playing Minecraft, whether or not it's artistic or anything like that.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 So the fact that I'm not a huge fan of the competitive video game, I think it's awesome, right?

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 They're playing the games, but I've never understood this huge push to get it recognized as a real sport.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 They're like, "Dude, we're on ESPN." I was like, "Yeah, so is like Shuffleboard and stuff."

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 But there was recently this post online by this guy known as Stop Lurkers.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 I say recently, this is actually about four months ago, he posted this thing and really his thesis statement was,

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 "All professional first-person shooter gamers and streamers are cheating."

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 They're all cheating.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 And it's super fascinating because we have a whole thing of cheating going on right now in the media.

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 We have a young woman who's being accused of cheating at poker.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 I'll put all these links in the show notes.

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 We have those guys who recently got caught putting weight since they're like competitive fish people.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 They're not like who can swim the farthest to Atlantis. They're catching fish. They're fishermen. That's the term.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 And they were way, I guess the way it works is you catch a bunch of fish and you throw it in a milk crate

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 and they weigh it and whoever has the fattest fish wins.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Well, these two knuckleheads were, these guys actually got caught.

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 The young woman playing poker and the young man who, we did an episode on him where he supposedly had anal beads

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 that were sending him very, very pleasurable coded messages to let him know how to play chess.

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 The fish guys were caught dead to rights. They actually, a video of them slicing these guys' fish open and pulling out these huge lead weights.

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 So we know for a fact they were cheating.

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 And then just as I was getting ready to record this, just like a couple of minutes ago, I came across an article by,

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 oh, okay, to be fair, this is a Daily Star, which is a tabloid rag from Britain, but,

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 "Cheating Scandal Rocks Irish Dancing."

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 So apparently there was this big Irish dancing competition, still not a sport, still not a sport.

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 And calling it a competition all you want.

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 But anyways, they're saying like the people running the competition, to be fair, I skimmed this article, right?

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Like this was literally minutes before I was going to start recording this.

65
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 It turns out, possibly, allegedly, that this group, they were, the judges were banging the hot dancers.

66
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Not the ugly ones, not the ugly ones, they were like, "You're gonna have to be based on merit alone."

67
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Let's see how good of a dancer you are.

68
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 This is an allegation, so I will put the episode, I will put the article in the show notes,

69
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 but I won't say the name of the competition, but anyways, you have it all over the place.

70
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Again, this is totally a legend and it's in the Daily Star.

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 So it doesn't come out of any shock, right?

72
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 We have the fishing people on all the seven, so it shouldn't come,

73
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 that there's any shock that they'd be doing this in competitive video gaming as well.

74
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 And this guy, stop lurkers, he says, "Listen," he goes, he's obviously not gonna out himself,

75
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 but he said he is in the top 2000, I've never been able to pronounce his game right, Valorant?

76
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Valorant or Valorant? It's one of the two.

77
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 He's a top 2000 player in this game and he goes, "I don't use hacks. I personally don't use hacks,

78
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 but I understand how the hacks are being used at this level."

79
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 And he actually is able to get, he basically does a one-man undercover investigation.

80
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 He is able to get a hack for Valorant that, even though they use this thing called Vanguard, right,

81
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 that is supposedly supposed to detect cheats, he goes, "I got an aimbot and it's been completely undetectable.

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 I've been using it for two weeks and no one's ever been able to prove that I've been using it."

83
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 And it's interesting because he goes, "These, at a professional level, is what he's saying."

84
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 He goes, "When you're talking about competitive pros and when you're talking about people who are streaming

85
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 and they're streaming, they're the best of the best, right?"

86
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 He goes, "It's super easy for them to get these undetectable hacks."

87
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 He goes, "If I can do it, and I'm only in the top 2000, then who's to say the top 100 players aren't doing it,

88
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 or even the top 10, because you need to keep that rank?"

89
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 And he starts to say, he goes, "Listen, when you go to the competitive place, when you get into a competitive gaming,

90
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 they can check for hacks, but what you did, I didn't know any of this stuff,

91
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 you can install the hacks, apparently, on your mouse dongle,

92
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 on your little wireless mouse hub thing, you put your little USB, and you're basically, you can have the hacks in that,

93
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 so your computer will be clean."

94
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 I know what you mean, but that's not even how it works, but he's saying like, there are way, there are,

95
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 let's put it this way, there are workarounds, so they wouldn't be detectable on the computer themselves.

96
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 You would actually have them installed in the wireless mouse USB thingamajigger,

97
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 and you can have that aimbot.

98
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 And he goes, "Listen, because one person would do it, everyone would do it."

99
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 He goes, "These people are pulling off million dollar moves all day long, and it just wouldn't work that way."

100
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 And the common defense, right, when someone says something about a streamer or a competitive player that you love,

101
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 you go, "Well, they're so good, they don't have to cheat."

102
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 They wouldn't have to cheat, because they worked their way up, and I've watched them play for years and years,

103
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 and they wouldn't have to cheat.

104
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 There's a really cool YouTube channel by this guy named Carl Jopes,

105
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 and really all he does is expose cheaters.

106
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 He also does some cool speedrun stuff, where he analyzes speedruns,

107
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 but he's been making kind of a career lately of exposing cheaters,

108
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 and he did this big video about Dream, the Minecraft guy who got exposed for cheat,

109
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 or, you know, he got alleged that he had cheated, and then it kind of turns out that he did.

110
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 He kind of confessed to it, it took a while, but he kind of confessed to it, he said it was an accident.

111
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 He accidentally cheated, but Carl Jopes go, "The common defense is this guy's so good, he wouldn't have to cheat."

112
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 He goes, "No, that's not the way it works."

113
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 He goes, "You get so good, the pressure gets so much for you to be the best that you do cheat."

114
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Because you can't be the best and then have just like a run of bad luck,

115
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 or you just have all these streams that are just not doing those million dollar plays.

116
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 So the pressure, it's more like, I'm putting words in, Carl Jopes didn't actually say this,

117
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 but it's more likely you'll cheat at a certain level.

118
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 You may cheat in the beginning, and that's kind of the thing, they go,

119
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 the people who just buy the hacks, the people who get these really low budget hacks,

120
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 or these free hacks, they get caught right away.

121
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 So you get a bunch of scrubs that get caught right away.

122
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Then you have the middle of the pack players that are playing legit.

123
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 But as you get better and better and the competition gets higher and higher and higher,

124
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 and you start to go, how did he pull that shot off?

125
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 How did he get that shot?

126
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 And at this point, you're like a pro amateur, right?

127
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 I think that's actually a porn term.

128
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 I don't think pro-am is a real gaming term, but anyways,

129
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 you get to the point where somebody can approach you and say, "Hey, I can get you the right hack."

130
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Like that guy's hacking, all the people you're playing against is running these super subtle aimbots.

131
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 And for $5,000, you can have access to that too.

132
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Very, very fascinating expose, and again, it's one guy's investigation.

133
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 Is it true?

134
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Is it sour grapes?

135
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 We don't know.

136
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 He hasn't identified himself, we just don't know.

137
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 But it's interesting, and I don't want to spend this whole time just talking about the science of cheating,

138
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 but I wanted to add this detail in as well before we go to the next part, where what is cheating

139
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 is messing with the metaphysical order of things, cheating, which I think is very fascinating, but...

140
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 There's been a recent, again, this is not an allegation, this has been proven,

141
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 and it hasn't fully hit the world of podcasting yet.

142
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 It turns out there was a big expose, I'll put it in the show notes here.

143
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 What it turns out is some of the biggest podcasts have been...

144
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 This is cheating, this is full on cheating, some of the biggest podcasts out there,

145
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 some of the big podcast networks have been taking episodes,

146
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 and this is hundreds of thousands of downloads, hundreds of thousands of episodes have been downloaded this way.

147
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 What they're doing is they're working with mobile gaming apps, those games on your phone,

148
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 that are a thing like, hey, if you want to earn more diamonds or you want to earn more energy, watch this ad.

149
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 What they've been doing, and this is more than just a few podcasts, this is going to really impact the whole industry,

150
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 they've been embedding episodes into those mobile games.

151
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 So you click on it and it'll play 30 seconds of a podcast while you're waiting,

152
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 there's usually that time you have to watch so much of the ad before you get your reward,

153
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 but what happens is the entire episode of the podcast gets downloaded, gets played out,

154
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 even if you only listen to the 30 seconds and then click X to get your rewards,

155
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 they've been doing this hundreds of thousands of downloads at the very least to inflate their numbers for advertisers.

156
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 And people are going, whoa, so you told us you were getting 10 million downloads on your podcast network,

157
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 but how many of those were on the ad? How many of those were this gaming ad thing?

158
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 And the company so far had said, well, listen, we played the first 30 seconds, maybe they sat and stopped playing their game

159
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 and listened to the podcast for a full hour. We don't know. We don't know, they may have.

160
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 That's cheating. That's totally cheating the system, right? You're giving them 30 seconds of an hour-long podcast.

161
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 You're counting it as a whole hour of play so you go to your advertisers and say,

162
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 we get 10 million downloads a month spread across all these different podcasts.

163
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 But they don't- that's cheating. And cheating, the thing that always irritates people about cheating,

164
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 whether you're a podcaster like myself or a fisherman or a video game, is that most people play by the rules.

165
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 Because I would have never even thought about doing that, even if I had the money and the access to that app,

166
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 I never would have done anything like that. Because listen, I've had the opportunity.

167
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 There's a lot of paranormal YouTubers specifically, I mean all YouTubers have done this.

168
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 I shouldn't say all, but a lot of YouTubers have done this.

169
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 But there have- well, I should say there have been allegations about paranormal YouTubers who buy subscribers

170
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 and buy views on their episodes, on their YouTube episodes.

171
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 Because I've come across that just specifically in the paranormal YouTube world.

172
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 And I have access to all this- I don't want to use that stuff. I don't want to use that stuff where you're basically inflating it

173
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 to the point that then YouTube, the algorithm goes, oh, 10,000 people like this episode?

174
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 We're going to push it to another 30,000 people. I don't want to do that.

175
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Right, I don't want to cheat like that. I don't want to buy plays on Spotify or plays on YouTube,

176
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 even though I know my competitors do.

177
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 And I think most people who are playing video games, even if they know their competitors are using AIMBOTS,

178
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 they don't want to use AIMBOTS. Obviously, the temptation's there.

179
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 You know, we have pro football players who are tempted to cheat and some fall prey to it, right?

180
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Some people actually fall prey to it.

181
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 What I find interesting is I can easily put myself in that ivory tower and say,

182
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 "I'm not going to buy views on YouTube," even though I have the cash to do it.

183
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 And I have the access. I know the websites to go to. I know the people to contact. I don't want to do that.

184
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 But yet, it's very interesting because I was thinking about this.

185
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 I would not stick lead weights in a fish.

186
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 I would not stick anal beads up my butthole to win chess. I would not buy YouTube views or buy podcast subscribers,

187
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 even though that would definitely help the channel.

188
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 However, I've stated multiple times on this show that I use the law of attraction to boost my show.

189
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 Right? I have spent decades researching.

190
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 I don't talk a lot about magic on this show.

191
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 I've made comments about, "Oh, you know, I used to kind of dabble in stuff in college,"

192
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 and "I believe that magic's real," and stuff like that.

193
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 But I don't talk about it a lot on this podcast, right?

194
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Because to be honest, the reason why I don't is it sounds completely insane.

195
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 Even the stuff that I talk about, even my personal experiences, if I'm like,

196
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 "And then with my wizard's hat that I named Esmeralda," I went on a whimsical event,

197
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 "I'll talk about why." That's not true. I never had a wizard's hat named Esmeralda.

198
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 But there's a certain point where you go, "Okay, now you're saying something that's totally insane."

199
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 That episode I did a long time ago about the angel visiting me on my birthday?

200
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 That took a long time. That took a long time to tell on the podcast,

201
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 because this story is clearly insane.

202
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 This story is the ramblings of a madman.

203
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 And then the story about the time I went to hell, right?

204
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 I mean, again, I think that was like 6,700, 800 episodes into the podcast,

205
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 into this very personal relationship that I have.

206
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 I'm telling you these stories, and even then I was like,

207
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 "Uh, probably, I don't know if I'm-- I didn't know if I was ever going to tell that story, right?"

208
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 The Lost Summer. I've never told that story.

209
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 Nobody-- I've never told the Lost Summer story to anybody.

210
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 I made a vague reference. I think it was at the end of the angel episode.

211
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 And for a while, people were emailing me going, "Hey, when are you going to tell the Lost Summer?"

212
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 I don't think I'll ever tell the Lost Summer story. It's just so weird.

213
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 And it's funny, I feel like I'm building it up, because it's--

214
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 When you step back, it's one of those stories that doesn't have an ending, right?

215
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 There was no big climax in the end.

216
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 It was just this period of time in my life that was so weird,

217
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 and so on the edge of what is real and what isn't.

218
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 That's not a story I feel super comfortable talking about.

219
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 I've never told anyone about Lost Summer, the Lost Summer.

220
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 I think when I first moved up to Oregon, I made one or two vague references to close friends of mine, and that was it.

221
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 But I'm saying all that stuff because I studied magic,

222
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 and I looked into all of these like--

223
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 It's so funny because I think of the law of attraction as kind of separate from magic,

224
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 but it's pretty much the same thing.

225
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Even when you're looking at low magic, which is witchcraft, versus high magic, which is ritual magic, right?

226
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 I wasn't really aware of the law of attraction in that state, right?

227
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Knowing the law of attraction, the secret, and stuff like that.

228
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 It's basically the same thing. It basically is your intent on the universe,

229
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 your warping reality to your view of it.

230
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 And so I've studied the law of attraction a lot recently, like in the past 10 years,

231
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 and then before that I was really looking into the mechanics of ritual magic,

232
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 and how low magic works, and how all of this stuff does,

233
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 and I had my adventures with my Hobbit and Dwarf friends.

234
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 We'll leave it at that, but I--

235
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Is that cheating?

236
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Is that cheating for me?

237
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 Is that like a metaphysical aim bot?

238
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Because basically, on the one hand, there's no skill--

239
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 Well, I don't want to say there's no skill involved, but--

240
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 Like, is it cheating? Because what happens is, yes,

241
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 I'm going up against people who buy YouTube views and YouTube subscribers,

242
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 and I'm going up against people who are part of these podcast networks

243
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 that are downloading episodes when no one's there to listen to them.

244
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 That's my competition, right?

245
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 And I could go, "They're cheating!"

246
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 And then over here, I'm reshaping reality!

247
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 And at the end of the day, I'm not playing on the level playing field either, am I?

248
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 If somebody started a podcast at the same time that I did--

249
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 And a lot of them have shut down, it's funny, it's just kind of like a college class,

250
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 like the class of 2018, a lot of the podcasts that popped up around the same time mine has,

251
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 they've shut down.

252
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Imagine if one of those other podcasts--

253
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 Because everyone's competing for listeners, right?

254
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Imagine if one of these other podcasts out there,

255
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 we're both doing not the exact same topic,

256
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 but we're both putting out episodes on a regular basis,

257
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 we're trying to put out quality episodes,

258
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 we're getting the word out about our show,

259
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 we're doing online marketing,

260
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 and then I'm hovering three feet above my bed with a summoning orb.

261
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 Like, am I playing by the rules?

262
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 The whole idea of the law of attraction of metaphysical magic manipulation,

263
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 the 3Ms, is you are not playing by the rules,

264
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 you're actually reshaping the rules, you're making the rules fit you.

265
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 So is that cheating?

266
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 Am I cheating by using those tools that I've accessed?

267
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 And I think the answer to that, because it's me,

268
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 I don't want to think I'm a cheater,

269
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 I could say I'm not, but I think anyone else who had like a understanding of the law of attraction,

270
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 they may go, "Well, maybe, right? Maybe, you might be cheating."

271
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 And then I blink a matter of existence, it's like you don't exist anymore,

272
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 you don't exist in my reality, they're fading away.

273
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 I don't know like where does the line draw, because those are skills and knowledge that I've learned.

274
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 I would compare it to someone who's just gotten really, really good at video games.

275
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 But to somebody else, they go, "No, no, what you're doing is actually like,

276
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 you're breaking the law's reality dude, that other guy's just downloaded a program,

277
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 that makes his mouse, his little reticle, move quicker on the screen."

278
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 You're shifting reality, I think there's a clear difference.

279
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 I find it fascinating, there is a big debate, I don't even think it's a debate,

280
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 I don't think I've ever met anyone who disagrees with the statement,

281
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 but in the magic community, in the community of magic users,

282
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 there, it's pretty much solid agreement, using love spells on people is akin to raping them.

283
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 Because they, you are casting a spell on them for them to fall in love with you,

284
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 and if you have sex with them, you've raped them.

285
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 I've never met anyone who goes, "Well, you know, it depends."

286
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Because it doesn't, you're putting, you're shifting things within their psyche,

287
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 within the environment around them, you're actually warping reality.

288
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 And you're creating this scenario, and you're changing the way that their brain thinks,

289
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 you're putting a spell on them.

290
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 But if you have sex with them, it's rape. So if that is true, then if I'm using,

291
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 I don't use magic to promote the podcast, just so we're totally clear.

292
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 I'm not casting spells to, I realize that I probably have to clear it up.

293
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 I'm not casting spells to promote the podcast, that's not true.

294
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 But I do use the law of attraction, I've been very clear on that,

295
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 I use the law of attraction on this podcast.

296
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 I try to create these pathways where people can discover it.

297
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 I don't make people like it. I mean, if you're like, "I was wondering why,

298
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 I was wondering why he still lives in this podcast, even though I hate it."

299
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 I just try to create a reality where people can access it.

300
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 Where people stumble across it, people put in a Google search,

301
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 and one of my episodes comes up, or one of you guys,

302
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 one of my zombies, one of my mind-controlled zombies, and I was just joking.

303
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 You know what I mean? The show gets recommended to them.

304
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 I try to create this reality in my mind, like I visualize people going,

305
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 "Man, I sure am bored, I wonder if there's a Daily Paranormal Podcast I can listen to."

306
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 And they say it out loud in the library, and someone turns around and goes,

307
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 "Well, it sucks, I know, the perfect show. Dead Rabbit Radio, The Daily Paranormal Podcast."

308
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 It's like, you know, law of attraction, right? You have to visualize these things happening.

309
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 I feel like it's worked, right? This show is really big, and I appreciate you guys.

310
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Despite my sorcery on the other end, it still requires people to go,

311
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 "Oh, I like this show, and to tune in."

312
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 Let's be clear, before I end this segment, I'm not using magic to promote the show,

313
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 and I'm not mind-controlling you. I can promise you that.

314
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 But the idea, going back, like, by using the law of attraction, am I cheating?

315
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 Is that any different than buying views on YouTube?

316
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 I personally think it is, but I could understand why someone who doesn't,

317
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 who believes in the law of attraction but doesn't know how to implement it,

318
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 I could totally see them being like, "You definitely have a leg up."

319
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 You definitely have a leg up. Considering I hover three feet above my bed,

320
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 as I'm visualizing the success of this podcast, I have both legs up.

321
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 But no, it's an interesting topic, and this cheating stuff,

322
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 I think we're almost going to see a huge reckoning,

323
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 because we're just getting these cheating articles over and over and over again,

324
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 which is good. I like to see cheaters exposed.

325
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 But if using magic is cheating, then, I don't know, maybe don't expose me.

326
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 Maybe just kind of like, move on to the next guy.

327
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Move on to the guys who are paying for views. Why are you picking on me?

328
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 I'm just the gentle wizard.

329
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Amber, let's go ahead and tushy the keys of the carbonic copter,

330
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 where you're leaving behind this video game conference.

331
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 Fly us all the way out to...

332
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Dyer Lane.

333
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 It's funny, you might have noticed this episode's kind of slapped us.

334
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 This episode's kind of put together pretty quickly.

335
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 I actually love both of these stories, but my original episode I was going to do

336
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 just had so many dead kids.

337
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 And I didn't plan it that way. I didn't set out to have a bunch of dead children in one episode,

338
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 but it happens, right?

339
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 I had a story about a father holding his bleeding daughter in the middle of winter.

340
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 Terrible story. I mean, it was actually a cool story, but it's a terrible event.

341
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 And I had a story about an entire school just exploding one day.

342
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 It just blew up.

343
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 It's an interesting story. It's true. It's tragic.

344
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 And I remember I was getting ready to record it and I go, "Bro, it's Friday."

345
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 And this is Friday's episode.

346
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 No one's going to have another episode until Monday.

347
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 I usually try to put, if you guys haven't figured out,

348
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 I usually try to put my true crime in the middle of the week.

349
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 So I don't totally bum you out.

350
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 I do talk about ghosts all the time and people have to die to be a ghost.

351
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 But I was like, "That's too many dead kids for one day."

352
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 Even an ancient sorcerer, as myself, knows that there's too many dead kids for one day.

353
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 So I decided, you know what?

354
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 Let's go back to Dire Lane.

355
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Let's go back to the place.

356
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 I don't want to say where it all started,

357
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 but I've definitely done on the ground ghost investigations at Dire Lane.

358
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 Dire Lane, I'll put the other episodes in the show notes,

359
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 but Dire Lane is a road in Elverda,

360
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 which is an unincorporated part of Sacramento.

361
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 It's over by Watt Avenue in the area of Antelope.

362
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 You're shaking your head.

363
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 You're like, "Jason, I don't know where it's at.

364
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 I live in the middle of India.

365
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Even if you gave me directions, I couldn't find it."

366
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 Well, I'll put show notes in.

367
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 You can look at them on Google Earth.

368
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 I won't give you specific street directions.

369
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 But it is this road.

370
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 It's so interesting because it's a road in the middle of nowhere,

371
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 but it's connected to one of the busiest roads in Sacramento.

372
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 The second you turn left onto Dire Lane off of Watt Avenue,

373
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 I could be getting a little goofy right here,

374
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 but it's like you're all of a sudden driving through the middle of Idaho.

375
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 And it's spooky house after spooky house and long stretches of open field.

376
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 This is the place where I found a pair of burnt pants

377
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 and my friends thought I got possessed by a murder victim.

378
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 I'll put that episode in the show notes.

379
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 A lot of fun memories at Dire Lane.

380
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 And I've always been fascinated because back when I was out doing ghost hunts

381
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 in this area, the internet was around,

382
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 but it was nowhere near what it is today.

383
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Like I was doing this stuff back in like in 98, 99.

384
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 Maybe to the early 2000s.

385
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 So I mean like the internet was there.

386
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 We could go and we could download photos of Sarah Michelle Geller

387
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 and you'd actually watch each line go da-da-da-da-da-da.

388
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 Not to print them out, not to print them out just to download them.

389
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 It took a while.

390
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 So this whole idea of people putting like spooky stories online

391
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 or people like cataloging ghost investigations,

392
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 that didn't exist back then.

393
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 But now I can actually look and go, "Wow, Dire Lane had a huge reputation in the area."

394
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 And to this day, people are still investigating it.

395
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 People are still going out there.

396
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 And let's take a look at this story right here.

397
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 This is one that I hadn't heard until fairly recently.

398
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 This is the story of the witches of Dire Lane.

399
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 Sometimes it's referred to as Dire Lane.

400
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 That's what we always call it.

401
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 Let's go back to the year 1932.

402
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 [singing]

403
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 I actually was about to do a pretend witch incantation,

404
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 but I forgot I'm in a haunted closet

405
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 and I'd probably rather not summon some dark beast behind me.

406
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 It's 1932 or now, Verda.

407
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 There's a coven of witches that start meeting out there.

408
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 And trust me, if you want to have a coven of anything,

409
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 this is the best place to have it.

410
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 When I was hanging out,

411
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 the reputation was it was where all the clans hung out.

412
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 Like, not the Scottish dudes.

413
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 The Ku Klux Klan went there to hang out.

414
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 And I mean, it is a place --

415
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 I'm not recommending TripAdvisor for the KKK to show up out there,

416
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 but if you were going to have a covert meeting of anybody,

417
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 you could do it out here because it's like easy road access,

418
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 and then you're gone.

419
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Like, you could totally disappear back there.

420
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 So a coven of witches meeting back there in 1932,

421
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 I could totally see that happening.

422
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 There were six of them,

423
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 and they would meet here on a regular basis,

424
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 and they were doing this for about two years.

425
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 So this had become a home to them.

426
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 Not like there was like a little witches hut

427
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 with like, you know, thatched roofs and stuff like that.

428
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 They probably lived in regular houses.

429
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 But then they came out here to practice their skills,

430
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 to work on their Wiccan workshop magic.

431
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 But by the year 1934,

432
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 rumors had started to spread about what was going on out here.

433
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 And a group of boys decided to follow them out to Dyer Lake.

434
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 Because not only would it be the perfect place to do what you wanted

435
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 without anyone seeing you, like a group of witches,

436
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 it would also be the perfect place to go out there

437
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 and do what you wanted to without anyone seeing you,

438
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 like a group of criminals.

439
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 So these four boys, they go out there,

440
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 and they attack the witches.

441
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 Now, not as exciting as that sentence was.

442
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 There was no wand magic.

443
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 They didn't get on their brooms and fly away.

444
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 Unfortunately, when true crime and the paranormal collide,

445
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 true crime tends to win.

446
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 That's just, no matter what we think of the world,

447
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 of the metaphysical, magical world around us,

448
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 when four boys track these women down,

449
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 they assault the women.

450
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 They assault two of the women, they drag one of the ground.

451
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 The other four take off running.

452
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 Because they know that there's an immediate threat

453
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 of what's going on in this area.

454
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 What happens is the four witches, they actually leave the scene.

455
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 The two witches left behind are both murdered.

456
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 By this group of guys.

457
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 One is strangled, and the other one is able to get up

458
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 and starts running away, running for her life at this point,

459
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 because she just saw one of her friends get killed in front of her.

460
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 And one of these dudes picks up a rock and throws it,

461
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 hits her in the back of the head, and kills her as well.

462
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 And then a chain of events happens where you would think

463
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 that maybe there was some level of magic,

464
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 or at least what we would think of as a curse,

465
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 laid on these young men.

466
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 Again, we don't have the ages for these guys.

467
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 What I keep saying boys, it's not like they're ten years old.

468
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 We're assuming like late teens, early twenties, and things like that.

469
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 But anyways, one of them is hit by a truck.

470
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 About three weeks later, he's ran over.

471
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 Four months later, another guy's visiting LA.

472
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 He gets mugged.

473
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 A curse that's just visiting LA.

474
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 He's down in Los Angeles, he gets mugged,

475
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 stabbed in the stomach, and bleats the death in the middle of the street.

476
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 At a later date, one of the other young men

477
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 was swimming in the Sacramento River.

478
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 He drowned.

479
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 And then finally, I mean like,

480
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 if you had a picture of your choice out of these four,

481
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 hit by a truck, stabbed to death, bleeding out in the middle of LA,

482
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 drowning in the river.

483
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Or this fourth one, he was kind of enjoyable.

484
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 He was skiing.

485
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 That's kind of fun.

486
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 He was skiing down a hill, he slammed into a tree, and bashed his head open.

487
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 But I mean, if you're gonna go out, go out fast, go out hard, right?

488
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 That's what I always say.

489
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 Don't just flail in water if you find yourself about to drown.

490
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 Look for a waterfall to go off of.

491
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 So these four young men are dead.

492
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 So you would think, okay, two witches murdered,

493
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 four men killed by spirits from beyond in revenge.

494
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 You figure, you know, the ledger is, while not completely balanced out,

495
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 because these guys were perpetrators and the victims were victims.

496
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 You know, they didn't ask for any of this.

497
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 You think everything would kind of settle down,

498
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 but in 1946, we're back on Dyer Lane.

499
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 Out in Dyer Lane in 1946, there was a farmer known as John Wilkins,

500
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 and he was out farming his land, driving his tractor.

501
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 He was making those noises, the tractor was perfectly shut off,

502
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 he just liked to sit in his tractor and go,

503
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 he sees out in the middle of field two sexy ghosts, sees these two women just kind of going,

504
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 come here, Johnny boy, come here, look at us, look how sexy and translucent we are.

505
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 Woo.

506
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 He jumps off his tractor, he starts walking over to them

507
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 and he's like staring at these two seductive women

508
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 and the tractor mysteriously starts by itself and runs them over, crushes them, kills them on the spot.

509
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 What's interesting about that story is, I mean, all things interesting, right?

510
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 We have killer witches and stuff like that.

511
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 What's interesting about that story is how,

512
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 what were the witnesses to that event?

513
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 I mean, we have one witness, but he got killed by a tractor.

514
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 Like, how did they know he saw sexy ghosts?

515
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 If I got re- let's put me in this scenario.

516
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 If I was sitting on a tractor and I saw some sexy ghosts,

517
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 yes, I would get off the tractor and I would walk towards the ghost, that's true.

518
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 But if the tractor then came to life, it didn't come to life,

519
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 it just started up and ran me over and then my son came up and go,

520
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 "Pa, Pa, what happened?

521
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 My last words aren't gonna be, well, son, I saw some sexy ghosts

522
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 and I had to get in front of this tractor."

523
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 You know what I mean?

524
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 Like, how would they know that part of, how would anyone know that part of the story?

525
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 Obviously, there would have been, no witness would have been able to see that.

526
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 At the very least, they'd see a guy get off a tractor, walk in front of it,

527
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 and then the tractor malfunctioned and run him over.

528
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 How would they know he saw sexy ghosts?

529
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 Well, there's pretty much only one way you could know that

530
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 and that would be if you contacted his spirit using a Ouija board

531
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 or spirit box or a medium or something like that.

532
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 And that is where we're gonna end this episode and take a look at a group

533
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 called Halo Paranormal Investigations.

534
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 This is a group that, listen, man, I love local paranormal groups, right?

535
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 It's dope.

536
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 I mean, these guys are really just really cool and it's so funny.

537
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 Here's an update on a couple episodes last week

538
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 and I think even one this week I was talking about a group called Enam Paranormal

539
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 that seemed to go defunct and I said, you know, it sucks

540
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 because a lot of times these paranormal groups do a bunch of investigations

541
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 and they break up or they can't pay their hosting fees

542
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 and their website goes down and everything like that.

543
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 I ended up contacting the head of Enam Paranormal to ask what was going on

544
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 and sure enough, they couldn't pay their hosting fees.

545
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 Their website went down.

546
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 Well, it's back up.

547
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 They were able to get a couple bucks scrounged together

548
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 and get their website back up and so that's cool.

549
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 I'll put another link in the show notes to their website,

550
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 but again, it's just like local on-the-ground ghost investigations, right?

551
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 I used to do that stuff.

552
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 It's a lot of fun.

553
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 And here we have this group called Halo Paranormal Investigations

554
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 and they're the ones who are reporting this whole story about the witches of Dire Lane.

555
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 And it's so funny because the guy who set it up is a guy named Paul Dale Roberts

556
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 who proclaims himself as the Disco King of Sacramento.

557
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 And I almost feel like it's a whole other episode to go into this guy's life story.

558
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 He went from being, according to him, right?

559
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 He went from training members of Delta Force.

560
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 Okay, like, he went from that.

561
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 Then he ended up infiltrating an underground drug ring in Germany

562
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 into completely the undercover.

563
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 He had to learn Disco to eventually, in 1979, he became the Disco King of Sacramento.

564
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 I didn't know there was such a title. I mean, I guess it's self-proclaimed,

565
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 but I was looking into that and I go, "Oh, okay."

566
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 What is so funny?

567
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 I didn't know what was more unbelievable, the fact that he trained the 101st Airborne,

568
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 82nd Airborne, and the Army Special Forces, or that he was the Disco King.

569
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 Apparently he--and I did fact-check this.

570
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 I could have fact-checked whether or not Sexy Witches killed this man.

571
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 But he's in the Guinness Book of World Records for the longest Disco dancing.

572
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 205 hours straight.

573
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 I don't know what--fascinating character.

574
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 We might look more into him because his life story just seems completely bizarre.

575
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 But the reason why I wanted to talk about the Witches of Dyer Lane is for a couple reasons.

576
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 One, I didn't want to talk about dead kids.

577
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 I didn't want to talk about a couple murdered women. It's not like that's much better.

578
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 I didn't want to talk about a bunch of kids.

579
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 That'll be next week.

580
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 It's not like I'm never going to do that episode.

581
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 I just didn't want to do it on a Friday. It'll pop up on Tuesday, Wednesday, and next week.

582
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 It's coming.

583
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 But I also--when I was reading about this group, I thought, "You know what?

584
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 It's Halloween."

585
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 And I know that a lot of you guys--because I get your guys' emails, right?

586
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 I talk to you guys on the Discord. I talk to you guys through the YouTube conference when those were still around.

587
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 I know a lot of you guys--sometimes you get lonely. Sometimes I get lonely.

588
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 Right. Sometimes I get lonely. Sometimes you get lonely because I get these emails.

589
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 My heart, you know, obviously feels for you because I know that feeling.

590
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 I want to propose something.

591
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 I know we're in the middle of the 90 days to a better you challenge, and I hope that's going great for you.

592
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 It's going great for me. I'll give you an update on that, but--

593
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 Why don't you start a local ghost hunting group?

594
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 I'm telling--I've talked about this so many times on this show, guys, and I'm telling you, it won't backfire.

595
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 I can say at least that. I know that sometimes things can seem that you are alone, right?

596
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,000
 That you don't have a lot of friends out there, or you have friends, but everyone's just too busy to get together and all this stuff.

597
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 Why don't you start a local ghost hunting group?

598
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 Put an ad out on my Craigslist or put a couple flyers up. Listen, you will have a blast.

599
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 I really think you would have so much fun if you started a local ghost hunting group.

600
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 And I would have a bunch of more stuff to talk about on this podcast.

601
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 I have no ulterior motive, but I think--because a lot of these ghost hunting groups, like in Amparenormal and Halo Paranormal Investigations,

602
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 they're always posting these photos of them. It's an outdoorsy thing, right? You go outside, there's a couple people.

603
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 A lot of these groups aren't organic. They're not an existing group of friends who start doing this.

604
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 They meet each other, and they become friends.

605
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:44,000
 So if you're not currently doing the 90 days to a better you challenge, if you're currently not really doing much,

606
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 and you regret that, like, I enjoy not doing anything. This podcast takes up the bulk of my time.

607
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 I get one night off a week. I don't have to do anything. I don't read anything at all.

608
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 I get one night off a week, but if you want to do something, if you're looking for something to do,

609
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 if you feel like, you know what, I'm just bored and I'm lonely, I'm telling you guys, start a paranormal group.

610
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 It will be so much fun. You'll meet like-minded people, you'll go on adventures, you might get killed by a bunch of witches, right?

611
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 You might be, let's be honest, you might get killed by a bunch of witches, you might go into an haunted house, and a demon rips your guts out.

612
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 That might be happening, but I think you'd have so much fun.

613
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 I know I had a lot of fun doing ghost hunting when I was younger. Just think about it.

614
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 That's really- I wanted to talk about this story one because I thought it was kind of creepy.

615
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 It's a location that I'm personally familiar with. We have these witches that may still be out there, right?

616
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
 See if you're currently driving a tractor, listen to this podcast. Be careful.

617
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 But also I wanted to do- I just think that'd be so cool. I really do. I was thinking about that today when I was like,

618
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 "What can I do instead of dead kids?" And I go, "That- I would love- I mean, think about it.

619
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 What happens with this podcast? Where this podcast goes? Who knows?"

620
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 But if I could give birth to a hundred ghost hunting organizations around the world, and maybe they're only around for a couple months,

621
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 maybe they're around for a couple years, that would be awesome. What a great legacy that would be.

622
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 And I think it would be a lot of fun for you guys as well. Just print up a flyer.

623
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 See where that adventure takes you. At the very least, you know, maybe you sit around with your buddies, your new buddies, right?

624
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 These people you met with this like-minded interest and sit around at a pub or something like that.

625
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 And talk about spooky stories. Talk about stuff.

626
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:44,000
 But at the most, you guys may go on a ghost hunting adventure, driving around your area, breaking in on houses,

627
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 breaking in on houses, climbing over cemetery fences, being chased by security.

628
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 Yeah, maybe not that far. Maybe not that far in your first adventure.

629
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 But think about it. Really think about it. When I was thinking about what to do for this show, I go,

630
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 "I would like to have my Friday episode be encouraging."

631
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 Not a dead child in sight. I want it to be encouraging. Really think about starting your own paranormal group in your area.

632
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 Sure, you may not be the so-proclaimed Disco King of Sacramento, but...

633
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 I have no follow-up. That's a pretty good title, right? That's a better title than I am.

634
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 I just think it'd be fun. I think it'd be fun. And maybe you'll think about it.

635
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 You don't have to start it tomorrow, but during this spookiest month of the year, think about it.

636
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 Think about starting a paranormal group. It would make me super proud if, like a year or two from now,

637
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 I start getting emails from these little groups all over the world saying,

638
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,000
 "Hey, you really inspired me." That story you did about those women who were assaulted.

639
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
 "What's my fortuitous? You really inspired me to become a ghost hunter."

640
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 I think that would be awesome. That would really, really make all of this worth it.

641
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
 It really would.
