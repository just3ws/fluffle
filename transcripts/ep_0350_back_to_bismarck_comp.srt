1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,440
 For the end of season 7, just one story.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,200
 And it might seem an odd departure from the normal episode.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,120
 Because it's also a follow-up episode.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,280
 And now we go back to Bismarck one last time.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:24,080
 To meet a man who was murdered in a mysterious way.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,040
 Was he killed because he knew too much?

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,320
 What is his connection to the other victims?

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,960
 And is this cult still out there?

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,960
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:47,760
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 I'm having a great day.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,600
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,400
 This is the last episode of season 7.

15
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,160
 I'm going to take a week-long break after this, but we're going to have some best of

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,920
 episodes next week.

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,400
 With short introductions from me explaining why I picked that particular episode.

18
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,280
 Also the art for this episode is a bit different.

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,280
 This is some fan art.

20
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,320
 TVPVTU made this art for me quite a long time ago.

21
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,480
 This is one of the flyers we have available for you to download at deadrabbit.com.

22
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,640
 Post them up around your town, college, coffee shops, wherever.

23
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,480
 Hope to get the word out about the show.

24
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,400
 I also want to give a shout out to Stuart Meatball who recently got banned from Facebook

25
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:39,400
 for 72 hours for promoting this show so zealously that they gave him a 72 hour ban.

26
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,040
 We respect the fallen.

27
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,480
 Stuart, really really appreciate you getting the word out.

28
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:51,200
 And actually it shows where our download numbers are increasing rapidly.

29
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
 Rapidly rapidly rapidly.

30
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,120
 So everyone who's out there getting the word out really really appreciate it.

31
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,400
 We also actually have a new Patreon as well.

32
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,400
 New Patreon.

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,720
 I wanted to go ahead and also this name is not safe for work.

34
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,800
 So if you're listening to this you can turn it down.

35
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,520
 Turn it down a little bit.

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,520
 There you go.

37
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,520
 Is that a good volume?

38
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,680
 Thank you so much for supporting the Patreon.

39
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,520
 Meat Hammer McDickfist.

40
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,040
 Thank you Mr. Meat Hammer.

41
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,400
 Really really appreciate it.

42
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
 Any support will do.

43
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,440
 And if you can't support the Patreon you can definitely put up flyers or spam Facebook

44
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,940
 like Stuart or anywhere in between just helping get the word out about the show is totally

45
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,100
 totally awesome.

46
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,760
 Let's go ahead though and move on to our first story.

47
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,400
 Now yesterday I'm going to give a real brief overview but this is actually the first time

48
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,240
 I've ever done this on the history of the show.

49
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,840
 I would actually recommend listening to yesterday's episode if you haven't heard it already to

50
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,280
 really appreciate this first story.

51
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,280
 And I've never done that.

52
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,920
 I always plan the podcast to be pretty self-contained.

53
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:03,520
 But yesterday on episode 349 we talked about a string of missing people in Bismarck.

54
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,080
 We had Roy Hagel.

55
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,840
 He went missing in 1989 in Death Valley.

56
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,840
 He was headed.

57
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,200
 From Bismarck, North Dakota.

58
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,520
 And he was headed back to Bismarck, North Dakota.

59
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,680
 We talked about Michelle Joulson.

60
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,720
 She disappeared in 1994, five years after Roy Hagel.

61
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,200
 She disappeared in Bismarck.

62
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,640
 And then we talked about Sandra Jacobson and her son, John Jacobson, five-year-old son,

63
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,000
 John Jacobson, also disappeared in Bismarck.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,840
 They were driving from center North Dakota where she lived to Bismarck, North Dakota.

65
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,040
 She called the police in Bismarck saying that she witnessed a satanic ritual and she didn't

66
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,160
 trust the police in center.

67
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,720
 So she was calling the police in Bismarck, which is 40 miles away from center.

68
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,360
 Her mother lived in Bismarck.

69
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,760
 And then she gets to her mother's house.

70
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,600
 Her mother could tell there was something mentally wrong with her and she had a history

71
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,520
 of mental issues, was the terminology used.

72
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,240
 Her and her son disappeared that night.

73
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,280
 That was in 1996.

74
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,280
 Never to be seen again.

75
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,600
 None of these people have ever been seen again.

76
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:14,880
 The one clue that was uniform between them other than the fact that they all were related

77
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,880
 to Bismarck.

78
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,040
 They all lived in Bismarck at one point or another.

79
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,640
 One, two of them lived in Bismarck at the time.

80
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,960
 Sandra Jacobson had just recently moved away to center.

81
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,320
 But she was living in Bismarck and died or disappeared in Bismarck that night.

82
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,840
 The other clue that was all connected was the biggest piece of evidence investigators had

83
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,560
 was a car left at a scene.

84
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,400
 Roy Hagel, his car was in the desert.

85
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,200
 Keys and wallet on the driver's side seat.

86
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,360
 Michelle Joulson, her car was found.

87
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,360
 No keys, no wallet.

88
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,720
 It was completely empty except for a half eaten gas station sandwich.

89
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,200
 Sandra Jacobson and John Jacobson, their car was found at a beach near a pretty wild

90
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,200
 river.

91
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,960
 Keys and the ignition purse on the seat.

92
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,200
 So there are some coincidences there most likely, right?

93
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,880
 But let's take a look at one more case.

94
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,240
 And there's two things that make this really, really creepy.

95
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,840
 When I was researching this story, when I was researching this story, and I talked about

96
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,120
 this on last night's episode as well.

97
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,880
 I said, originally I was just going to do a story on Sandra Jacobson and her son John

98
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,880
 Jacobson.

99
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:32,800
 A creepy story about a mom possibly running away with her son, possibly committing suicide

100
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,840
 with her son, possibly actually having run afoul of saint worshipers and after reporting

101
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,160
 it to the police went missing.

102
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,040
 Because she called them that night.

103
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,560
 She called them that night, the night she went missing.

104
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,640
 The police.

105
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:50,240
 But as I was researching the story of Sandra Jacobson, I was on a forum called Tapatalk.

106
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,240
 And there is a special part of this forum called Porch Light, which is dedicated to unsolved

107
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,680
 mysteries people have seen missing things like that.

108
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,520
 Leaving the porch light on for this person to come home.

109
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,640
 That was the first time I saw that the Sandra Jacobson story could be related.

110
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,280
 That was actually the first time I ever heard of Roy Hagel or Michelle Juleson was reading

111
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,280
 that article.

112
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,200
 And I was like, there's a lot of similarities.

113
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,440
 Someone wrote an article saying, these cases have gone 20 years without being solved.

114
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,200
 They're the three longest unsolved cases in Bismarck, North Dakota.

115
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,600
 And I was like, okay, this is interesting.

116
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,080
 This is the first time I've come across this info.

117
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,360
 So the story built out from there originally was just a short story to start off an episode

118
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,520
 about a creepy disappearance.

119
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,840
 And I go, maybe there's more to this.

120
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,800
 The way I have my research notes set up, it's a little complicated.

121
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,920
 But while I was getting my bookmark folders and everything, an article kept popping up

122
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:46,040
 that had no natural relationship to any of those other three disappearances.

123
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,600
 But I kept going, why is it in this folder?

124
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,600
 Why is it here?

125
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:57,040
 And I read it over and I go, why is it here?

126
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,680
 Now I was skimming it.

127
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,440
 That'll become apparent in a second.

128
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,520
 And so when I was prepping last night's story, I left it out because for about a week, I

129
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,120
 was kind of putting stuff together on this one, maybe about three days on yesterday's

130
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,400
 episode.

131
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,760
 And then today, after my Brazilian Jiu Jitsu lesson, and actually that's worked out really

132
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,320
 good for the show because now Tuesday, Thursdays, I do Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

133
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,640
 I get totally amped up.

134
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,560
 We have a striking class right after it.

135
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,760
 We do some Mu Tai striking for about a half hour.

136
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,800
 And then I go and sit in a coffee shop for three hours and just do research for the show.

137
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,000
 It's really benefited the stories that I think I've been able to bring.

138
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,040
 And it's benefited the layers of research I've been able to do.

139
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,440
 Another great thing from the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu class, I recommend you guys getting involved

140
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,320
 in some sort of physical activity.

141
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,600
 You'll find it's very, very beneficial.

142
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:53,600
 But today I was looking, today I was looking through my notes and that article came back

143
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
 up.

144
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
 I was cleaning up bookmarks.

145
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,920
 You're like, Jason, what article?

146
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,000
 What article are you talking about?

147
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,880
 Bismarck, North Dakota.

148
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,640
 November 16th, 1996.

149
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,600
 Sandra Jacobson and John Jacobson go missing.

150
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,080
 October 2nd, 2005.

151
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,760
 She's a Bismarck man known as Laverne Nastrum.

152
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,800
 Now, he's found in Tuttle, North Dakota.

153
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:23,320
 And that's about, I believe, if I remember correctly, about an hour away.

154
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,320
 A rancher is out checking his fence line, which sounds like a totally tedious job.

155
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,320
 And I'm sure it is.

156
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,040
 I bet being a rancher is one of the most boring jobs.

157
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,360
 It would be a job that you'd really have to love your work.

158
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,280
 Being outside, playing with your dog, raising babe the pig, deciphering Charlotte's meaning

159
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,360
 in her webs, all of those things.

160
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,080
 But this particular day is super boring.

161
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,720
 He was just checking the fence line.

162
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,200
 And he sees a car resting against his fence.

163
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,040
 I'm dagnabbit!

164
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,160
 Them damn hippies and them, they're automobiles?

165
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,160
 What'd they do?

166
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,280
 And as he's walking out to see what's going on, because this is just shitting against the

167
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,520
 fence, he sees a body in the grass.

168
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,040
 And he's like, definitely hippies.

169
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,680
 This guy must be taking a nap.

170
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,280
 And he can tell just where he's at.

171
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,280
 The dude's dead.

172
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,360
 Calls the authorities.

173
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,120
 The police come out.

174
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,480
 And they identify him as Laverne Nastrom.

175
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,720
 They're looking at this scene and they go, okay.

176
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,240
 Here we have this guy, dead on the ground.

177
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,040
 Obviously hit by a car.

178
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,560
 Head damage.

179
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,560
 Tire track.

180
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,400
 A comic old tire track on his back.

181
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,000
 His stomach's flat.

182
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,600
 He's killed by this car.

183
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,360
 This car that is 75 feet away and resting against this fence.

184
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,000
 Now these things happen.

185
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,160
 People get ran over by their own cars.

186
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,200
 I wouldn't say a lot, but it does happen.

187
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,640
 I remember once, I didn't get run over by my car.

188
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,240
 Obviously I didn't die, but I remember once it was Christmas day.

189
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,320
 I was trying to get to my grandma's house and my car broke down.

190
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,240
 And I got out and I was like, no one would help me.

191
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,040
 And I was dressed up in like my Christmas best.

192
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,440
 I had a nice shirt on, tie and all that stuff.

193
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,920
 There's all, and no pants, no shoes, nothing.

194
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,240
 Totally naked, but I had a shirt and tie on.

195
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,400
 My car is, I'm maybe two blocks from my grandma's house.

196
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,400
 My car dies.

197
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,440
 Now I've lived in this area for the past couple years.

198
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,200
 I visited it every summer.

199
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,320
 I knew this area like the back of my hand.

200
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,000
 So I go, I'm in the middle of a major intersection.

201
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,960
 This was Hazel and Greenback, if you know the area in Citrus Heights.

202
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,880
 Orangevale, technically at that point.

203
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,760
 I go, well, I'm going to have to push my own car.

204
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,240
 Because no one's stopping for me.

205
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,760
 Everyone's a big old jerk today.

206
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,760
 Christmas.

207
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,200
 Thanks a lot.

208
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,480
 So I get out and I start pushing my car and I'm pushing it basically by the steering

209
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,480
 wheel.

210
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,800
 Yes, I am an incredibly strong human being.

211
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,000
 And I'm pushing it and I start to turn it and I'm like, because I'm at a turn section

212
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 and I'm turning the car.

213
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:58,560
 And then I noticed something that the car is moving faster than I'm pushing it.

214
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:04,560
 And then it dawns on me that even though I had lived in this area for the past four

215
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,200
 or five years and visited this area every summer and every Christmas, there is a pretty

216
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,040
 big hill on the corner of Greenback and Hazel.

217
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,760
 And I had never really realized it before.

218
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,760
 And so the car starts moving faster than I'm pushing it.

219
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,320
 Then the car begins to move faster than I can move.

220
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,160
 And I had to make a split decision.

221
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:32,320
 I could jump into the car, hit the brakes and stop the car in its tracks or just let

222
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,320
 it go.

223
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,480
 And by the time I was realizing what I could do, my arms are already getting hyper extended.

224
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,600
 The car was moving far faster than me.

225
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
 So I just let it go.

226
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,960
 There's an old 88 Datsun.

227
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,360
 Took my hands off the wheel and stood there.

228
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,320
 And I watched it go down this hill and I remember there was this realization because I'm thinking

229
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,560
 the road in front of it was completely empty.

230
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,400
 And then on the other side was incoming traffic.

231
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,440
 It's a four lane road.

232
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,560
 And I'm watching this car go down this hill and I'm thinking, please keep going right.

233
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,560
 Please stay to the right.

234
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,560
 Please stay to the right.

235
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,840
 And it does and it hits this giant metal pole in a parking lot and comes through a complete

236
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,840
 stop.

237
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,600
 And the second it hits the pole, probably about 50 feet away to my left, I hear someone go

238
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,000
 yee-haw.

239
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,120
 Because it was a hick town.

240
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,560
 It still is a hick town, by the way.

241
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,760
 And I remember just being like, now again, I was in much better shape.

242
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,600
 I think I was like 22, 23.

243
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,160
 So I ran to my grandma's house.

244
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,680
 I was in really, really good shape when I was in college.

245
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,680
 Much stronger as well.

246
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,880
 I get to my grandma's house and say, I just crashed my car.

247
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,600
 And then for the rest of the life of that car, it had a comically shaped.

248
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,880
 It looked like Bugs Bunny hit it with a mallet.

249
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,920
 There was a straight up perfect U in the front of the car where it hit that pole so hard

250
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,600
 it just dug a hole in it.

251
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,480
 Now I'm telling you that story because people can easily get killed by their own cars.

252
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,880
 If I had tried jumping into the car, I could have fallen underneath it.

253
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,760
 Or I could have not hit the brakes in time or the car still could have hit something

254
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,360
 and I would have been stuck in the car and not been able to control it.

255
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,760
 So I just let it go.

256
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,560
 But they also had that young actor.

257
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,320
 This is probably more apt story because this actually was more like what we're talking

258
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
 about.

259
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,000
 There was a dude in, he was the guy in the new Star Trek movie.

260
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,840
 He was Chekov and he was in that movie Green Room.

261
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,200
 He got killed by his own car.

262
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,280
 Young actor.

263
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,280
 The brakes were faulty on it and the car was actually in the middle of a recall and he

264
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,760
 was like closing his gate of his private driveway.

265
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,000
 The car rolled down the hill and pinned him against the gate killed him.

266
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,720
 So these things do happen.

267
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:52,120
 So when the cops come out and they see this dude dead, his car 75 feet away, they immediately

268
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,800
 think, maybe he was working on his car, maybe the car broke down and like a jack went out

269
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,640
 or something like that and it rolled over him.

270
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:07,260
 Those explanations are quickly dismissed because they go to the car and the transmission

271
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,360
 of the car is set to park.

272
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,560
 Now no car is going to be so faulty that you put it in park and then it's going to roll

273
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,560
 75 feet.

274
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:21,080
 I mean, I guess if you had no transmission, if it was just a cardboard box with a pee

275
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,320
 painted on it and you put it in that, that could happen.

276
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,000
 But the police saw this and they go, he wasn't alone.

277
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,960
 There's no way this could have happened.

278
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,240
 And of course, you know, they obviously test the car and they go, yeah, this transmission

279
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,080
 works.

280
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:43,400
 What must have happened was he got hit by a car, his own car.

281
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:51,720
 And then someone put the car in park after it rested against the fence.

282
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:57,720
 So what looked like an accident in the beginning, they immediately go, this is a homicide.

283
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,280
 This guy was murdered.

284
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,240
 Sheriff Doug Howard starts investigating this.

285
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,080
 This was an interesting quote I found from one of the only articles detailing this.

286
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,120
 Sheriff Doug Howard says, we're considering this as a homicide.

287
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,520
 And here's a quote from the actual, like there's a passage from the actual article.

288
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,440
 We're considering this a homicide, the sheriff said.

289
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:22,240
 When asked why, he responded, good question.

290
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:28,520
 And that's an interesting way to answer that because it could be he's saying, yeah, it

291
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,200
 is a good question why he was murdered.

292
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:35,080
 It could also be a thing like it is a good question why we're investigating this as a

293
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:40,440
 homicide is this a homicide, but it's very, it's a very mysterious or can be something

294
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,940
 even else.

295
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:47,080
 It's a very mysterious answer, but he does pursue it as a homicide investigation.

296
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:53,240
 This guy found in this field ran over by his own car that was then put into park.

297
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,920
 They go, there had to be someone else out here with him.

298
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,440
 The farmer didn't do it.

299
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,080
 They investigate, they interview 50 people.

300
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,400
 And again, it's funny because it seems like it should have just been written.

301
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:08,120
 I think a lot of police departments would have just written it off as an accident.

302
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,040
 And then the transmission must have been faulty.

303
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,720
 These things happen so on and so forth.

304
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,280
 They investigate 50 people over the course of years.

305
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,200
 They end up giving a couple of people polygraphs.

306
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,240
 They start traveling to other parts of the state trying to figure out what happened with

307
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,240
 this guy.

308
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:27,280
 As of now, there's a $5,000 reward still for any evidence leading to the capture of whoever

309
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,280
 killed him.

310
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,160
 It's still being investigated as a homicide.

311
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:37,280
 This is the only unsolved homicide in Kidder County, which is where the city of Tuttle

312
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,280
 is.

313
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,680
 And it was on a maintenance road that's very, very rarely traveled.

314
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,160
 It's basically farmland.

315
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,520
 Now they're going to look at a couple of different things.

316
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,720
 One, who was Laverne Nastrum?

317
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,960
 He was a criminal.

318
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,560
 He was currently being investigated for meth possession or he'd recently been charged

319
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,280
 with meth possession.

320
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:03,600
 He also, and this is where we start to get into connections for yesterday's episode,

321
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,520
 he also was known for breaking into and he'd been charged multiple times for this.

322
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,400
 I think he was actually found guilty and on probation for breaking into abandoned farms

323
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,840
 in Kidder County.

324
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:22,320
 So you have a guy who's breaking into old farms looking for anything he can sell, make

325
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,400
 a little money, buy a little meth.

326
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:31,800
 So when we're talking about a Colt Act, and Kidder County and where Center is, Center

327
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,320
 and Tuttle are also about an hour away.

328
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,840
 There's basically a triangle between Bismarck, Tuttle and Center.

329
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:46,440
 So the idea of someone breaking into abandoned farms in the Tuttle area, we could extrapolate

330
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,680
 that he also, those are the ones he was caught for, he may have actually been breaking into

331
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:58,280
 farms near Center, North Dakota, where a woman says that she saw some Colt activity, a ritual.

332
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:04,760
 Could it be possible that Laverne broke into a farm, saw something creepy, saw something

333
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:12,640
 he wasn't supposed to see, was chased to Tuttle and then killed with his own car?

334
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,360
 Is it possible through his meth dealings?

335
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,780
 He got into something.

336
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:23,040
 We see a lot of connections between methamphetamine use and Satan worshiping.

337
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,640
 And just so I'm more clear here too, when I'm talking about Satan worshipers, I'm not

338
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,200
 talking about like Church of Satan or Temple of Set, like legitimate organized religions

339
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,280
 that believe that the human self is greater than any sort of outside force, they reject

340
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,000
 God, Satan is just a marketing gimmick or an image that they use to kind of like push

341
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,080
 people's buttons, really it's about worshiping the self and hedonism.

342
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,240
 I'm not talking about that type of legitimate religion.

343
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:54,480
 I'm talking about what basically like child sacrifice, human sacrifice, Colt activity

344
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,260
 that's based around worshiping some sort of dark God.

345
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:01,220
 I'm not talking about like Anton Leves, just so we're clear on that, because I've been

346
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,180
 using the term Satan worshiping a lot over the past few days.

347
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,420
 I wanted to make that distinction.

348
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,340
 I've made that distinction in the past, but I wanted to make it again.

349
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:17,180
 So you have this guy who, but saying that we do see a lot of cross contamination.

350
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:25,160
 Between people who do meth and people who believe in really dark things and people who worship

351
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:30,120
 really dark things because the meth is rotting their brain really.

352
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:36,080
 And so we have this guy, no one meth user, no one person who's breaking into abandoned

353
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,080
 farms.

354
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:44,560
 He may have come across some secret ritual, he may have been part of a secret ritual.

355
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:49,460
 He's connected to the three other incidents that I just recently went over and went over

356
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,740
 yesterday by a key fact.

357
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:59,460
 Again we have the car as the key piece of evidence.

358
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,620
 He's in the ignition, an empty car.

359
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:09,740
 All four of these cases, we have a car as a key piece of evidence.

360
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,900
 And you go, Jason, that's a bit of a stretch.

361
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:18,800
 This guy was in total, he was from Bismarck, but he was in total at the time.

362
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,880
 Yes, a car ran him over.

363
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,920
 That someone else was probably there because somebody would have had to put it in part.

364
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,400
 The car worked normally when the police tested it.

365
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:34,600
 So yes, you have four cases where a car is a key piece of evidence.

366
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,640
 But that's still a bit of a stretch.

367
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:44,380
 Sandra Jacobson and her son John disappeared in 1996.

368
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:48,660
 But Sandra Jacobson had two children.

369
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:56,100
 John Jacobson and Spencer Nastrum, Laverne's son.

370
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,180
 Laverne and Sharon Jacobson were married.

371
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:03,420
 They divorced three months before she disappeared.

372
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,860
 They lived in Bismarck together.

373
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:10,440
 She leaves him to go to center, North Dakota.

374
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,720
 And then while driving back to Bismarck, she calls the police and says she saw a satanic

375
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,160
 ritual.

376
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,680
 She goes missing that night.

377
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:28,920
 What would you do if your ex-wife and the mother of your son went missing?

378
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,240
 Now of course, someone can make a joke about ex-wives and stuff like that.

379
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,920
 The fact that she made the call saying that there was a satanic ritual in center North

380
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:42,500
 Dakota, that was common news at the time and made the story very evocative.

381
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:49,740
 Is it possible that Laverne began investigating the disappearance of his ex-wife and the mother

382
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,060
 of his son?

383
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:57,900
 Is it possible he was involved in her disappearance in the first place?

384
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:05,040
 You'll never know because all the answers to those questions died in a field in Tuttle,

385
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,040
 North Dakota.

386
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:18,880
 Five victims, four empty cars, one city and long stretches of nothingness between these

387
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:29,860
 towns that may hold even more clues than a satanic cult is operating in North Dakota.

388
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:38,780
 What's interesting too about this whole thing, so let me go back to how I discovered this

389
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,980
 connection.

390
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:48,060
 Like I said, I had this bookmark about Laverne Nastrum in my folder and I thought why is

391
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,120
 it with these and I was skimming it.

392
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:59,960
 When I was rereading today, I saw clearly that this guy was from Bismarck and I thought

393
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,640
 why didn't I pick up on that?

394
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,200
 That's not the supernatural part, this is me skimming stuff.

395
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:09,160
 But I read the Laverne article and it never mentioned once that his ex-wife had gone missing

396
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,720
 with a young boy years earlier.

397
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,720
 Not once.

398
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,400
 That's weird.

399
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,780
 And then I started thinking how did I know to save this article?

400
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:24,980
 I had come across the Reddit post a while back that was talking about Sandra Jacobson

401
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:30,540
 and John Jacobson and in it it said, "Sandra Jacobson's older son is still alive but oddly

402
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,180
 enough his father was murdered years later."

403
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,860
 No name of the father?

404
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:41,820
 I had to search the name of the son, Spencer Nastrum, found that article about the father,

405
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,560
 bookmarked it, forgot the correlation.

406
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,000
 But see when I was trying to connect it to when I was like there has to be a reason why

407
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,400
 this was saved in the same area as the Sandra Jacobson stuff.

408
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,760
 If you typed in Sandra Jacobson, Laverne Nastrum, nothing pops up on the first page.

409
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,040
 You figure it should be BAM, but nothing pops up on the first page.

410
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,800
 You'll get something on the second page halfway down.

411
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,320
 A website called Tapatalk, the porch light forum.

412
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:15,380
 So again, the way I found out about the three missing people being connected in the first

413
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:21,020
 place, the porch light forum sent me to an article written in 2008.

414
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:29,140
 2008, after the murder of Laverne and that article didn't even connect them.

415
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,900
 Most of these articles are dead links.

416
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,700
 When you read this thing on the porch light forum, you'll click a link, it'll take you

417
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,740
 to a page that doesn't exist anymore.

418
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,060
 This news is purged out of the system.

419
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,960
 Now that sounds like a conspiracy theory, obviously.

420
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,840
 Someone's going in hacking the net.

421
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,840
 But these are newspapers, and a lot of times newspapers, especially back in the day, they

422
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,600
 would purge out old articles.

423
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,520
 You're not getting a lot of hits, what's the point of having the article up there?

424
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,040
 They have copies of it.

425
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,600
 As of now, really the only places that you can find a connection between Laverne Nastrum,

426
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:09,940
 Sandra Jacobson, is a Reddit thread, the porch light forum, and this podcast.

427
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:16,100
 Even though every article about Laverne should talk about Sandra, because both cases are

428
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,620
 so bizarre.

429
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:21,420
 Why aren't other people making these connections?

430
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,340
 Why is it just ordinary people online?

431
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:29,960
 The fact that the connections aren't being made makes me think one of two things.

432
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,240
 There really is no connection other than the fact that his ex-wife disappeared a couple

433
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:38,040
 years before in a mysterious way, and the other two missing cases have nothing to do

434
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,400
 with each other, everything.

435
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,800
 The only thing that's in common is that victims are from the same city, and they all involve

436
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,520
 cars in some way.

437
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:53,640
 Or that the cases are connected and someone's actively covering up the connections.

438
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,580
 I'll be honest, I hate doing episodes like this.

439
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,580
 Absolutely despise them.

440
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:04,020
 And it's funny because I hate them even more before I go on break.

441
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:09,800
 And the reason why I hate them is every show often I do a story where I think this is true.

442
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,880
 And not in the sense, like I've done stories where I've had experiences with supernatural

443
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,060
 creatures and stuff like that, and I know that's true.

444
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:19,340
 And I've done stories where I believe that the story is true in a sense, but it's like

445
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,100
 some gobble and jump through someone's window.

446
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,100
 And I'm not worried about a gobble and jump through-

447
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,100
 Oh!

448
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,520
 No, I'm just joking, did I get you?

449
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,280
 I can do stuff like that on the season finale.

450
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:33,440
 I'm not worried about a gobble and jump through my window, but when I do an episode that

451
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,880
 is about like a government conspiracy, or a cult conspiracy, and then I'm like, "See

452
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,400
 you guys in a week?"

453
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,280
 It always makes me nervous.

454
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,720
 Now I'm in Oregon.

455
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,160
 This stories take place in North Dakota.

456
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,940
 It's 14 years later after this guy gets ran over by his car.

457
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:57,660
 It's most likely a string of coincidences.

458
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,740
 So I should sleep safely at night.

459
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:04,740
 But I do walk a lot.

460
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,020
 And there's three things I worry about when I'm walking.

461
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:14,380
 Rabbit dogs, rabbit homeless people, and cars.

462
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:20,840
 So if something happens to me this week on vacation, if I don't come back to do the podcast,

463
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:28,440
 if I am knocked down or killed in a mysterious hit and run, if the plates of the car show

464
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:36,220
 that it came from North Dakota, avenge me, dear listener.

465
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,220
 Avenge me.

466
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,720
 That's not gonna happen.

467
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,600
 I'll be back next week.
