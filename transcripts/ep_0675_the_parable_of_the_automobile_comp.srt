1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
 When a young woman is deep asleep, she hears a voice in her head say "Defend yourself!"

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,440
 Just in time to find two invaders breaking into her room.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:16,460
 Then we meet a man who's traveling through Utah and saw a strange otherworldly sight.

4
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:24,920
 Or did he? And then insanity week continues. As we travel to a small town in the middle of America,

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,440
 prepare yourself to examine

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,280
 the parable of the automobile. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:44,120
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,000
 I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too. Buckle up.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,360
 This is another weird one. First off, riding into Dead Rabbit Command on the back of a gilded gopher.

10
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:57,200
 It's our newest Patreon supporter, Jizz Leopard. Everyone give a round of applause to Jizz Leopard.

11
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,320
 He's really that poor gopher. I just imagine a giant leopard on the back of this little gopher being like "Ahh!

12
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,960
 Jizz Leopard, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode. Please don't eat the gopher."

13
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,200
 That's too late. You guys can't support the Patreon if you don't eat gopher's. That's fine too.

14
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,360
 Just help spread the word about the show really really helps out a lot. We got a ton of stuff to cover.

15
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,520
 So Jizz Leopard, I'm gonna toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

16
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,120
 We are headed out to Houston, Texas.

17
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,360
 *Pfft*

18
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,080
 Jason Jalopy is an old-timey car driving us all the way out. It's April 5th, 1993.

19
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:40,160
 We're in Houston, Texas and there's this young woman she's sleeping in bed. We don't have her name. We'll call her Makayla.

20
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:46,480
 In the middle of her dream, she hears a voice yell out "Defend yourself!"

21
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,960
 And she wakes up to an empty bedroom.

22
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,480
 So she doesn't really... Maybe it's just her head. I mean, that's usually where dreams are, but maybe she was just imagining it.

23
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:03,040
 She wakes up. She's in this room by herself for just a moment. And then walking through the walls.

24
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,920
 Just phasing right through. She sees two gray aliens.

25
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,720
 She's panicking obviously. And one of them begins to approach her, is getting closer and closer to her.

26
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,240
 And she remembers. She's thinking "What am I supposed to do? What am I supposed to do when someone attacks me?"

27
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,160
 "Defend yourself!" She remembers that. That was it. That's the reason I had the dream.

28
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,040
 She reaches out and she grabs this gray alien's head.

29
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:36,560
 And she grabs on to its big black eyeball. And then she pulls.

30
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:47,120
 It turns out, and I've heard this before in alien encounters, it turns out that the giant black eyes

31
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,480
 on the gray aliens are hard plastic.

32
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,680
 Or some sort of biofilm that is not their actual eye. It's the equivalent to

33
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,520
 if an astronaut went to another planet, like the documentary Planet 51 starring the rock.

34
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,960
 If an astronaut went to another planet, they would think or

35
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:10,080
 they'd think we were a cyclops. We had a giant head and then one big visor.

36
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,400
 And if you lift the visor up, you would see Joanne "The Rock" Johnson. But otherwise, it would just look like a cyclops.

37
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:22,480
 That this is some sort of protective coating. She grabs on and she pulls it away.

38
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,040
 And this mucus begins to cover her hands.

39
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,800
 Whatever was either the adhesive here or was some sort of organic liquid,

40
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,200
 similar to blood, like "Come on, we can stuff that can be attached to you."

41
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,880
 And be attached fairly permanent, but it's still not part of your makeup.

42
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:48,160
 But she rips this off of it. She rips the eyeball off. Doesn't rip the eyeball out.

43
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,840
 Doesn't poke it in. It would be the equivalent of taking someone's sunglasses off.

44
00:03:51,840 --> 00:04:00,480
 But a bunch of mucus is shooting out. After she peels this eye visor off, the gray aliens retreat.

45
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,920
 I found that story on ThinkAbout@Docs.com. They got it from Trisha McCannon.

46
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,040
 She wrote it for the International UFO Library Magazine, June, July issue 1994.

47
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,560
 It's a very, very brief story. The reason why I wanted to cover it was,

48
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,920
 one, and gray alien gets beat up. I like that.

49
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:27,280
 Two, I think it fits in with "Insanity Week" because we see these visions of these gray aliens

50
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,680
 all the time in literature, movies, things like that.

51
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,840
 And we're, at least at a certain point, we can be comforted by the lore.

52
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,680
 It's not so comforting when they're trying to drill a hole in your brain.

53
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,120
 But if you see a gray alien, you know what a gray alien is.

54
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,160
 You see a ghost, you know what a ghost is. But when you see things that are

55
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,160
 outside the realm of possibility, it's even more disturbing.

56
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,680
 Like the episode I did that, to this day, I get emails about.

57
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,880
 To this day, I get emails about how disturbing this episode was.

58
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,120
 I'm not going to give away the punchline. Those of you who listen to it will remember

59
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,880
 it was the one about the two kids in Mexico who came home one day

60
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,200
 and went into their kitchen and they saw something that drove them mad.

61
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,360
 And you gotta listen to that episode to really get the gimmick.

62
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,840
 Don't give it away. Don't give it away in the comments, but it just doesn't make sense.

63
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,760
 It would drive you mad to see something like that.

64
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,720
 And that episode was like episode 200, 300, something like that.

65
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,920
 I get emails to this day, in YouTube comments to this day,

66
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,080
 about how disturbing people found that episode.

67
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,560
 And so when you look at a gray alien and you know the big giant head,

68
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,160
 you know the big black eyes, but what happens? What's under that?

69
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:48,880
 If that's not really their eyeball, if that is the equivalent of a pair of sunglasses or a protective visor,

70
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,440
 what do they really look like?

71
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,120
 What if the whole, and I've heard this before, the whole gray skin

72
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,920
 is an astronaut suit. That's why a lot of people say it feels like plastic.

73
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:10,800
 It feels rough when you touch a gray alien, but it's actually a super tight space travel suit.

74
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
 So what are they?

75
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,240
 Like, could you imagine peeling one of those eyes off and looking and seeing

76
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:25,360
 something truly alien? Something you had never imagined was possible.

77
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:33,200
 Something that evolved on another planet. You're looking at its real eyeball staring back at you.

78
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,680
 All the TV shows, all the video games, all the cartoons, action figures, everything,

79
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,200
 prepared you for a gray alien encounter. But when you peel that back,

80
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:52,000
 you see something that no one else on earth has seen, or at least survived to tell the tale.

81
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,040
 Just a leopard, let's go ahead and hop in the dead rabbit, Durgible.

82
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,800
 We're going to leave behind Houston, Texas. Have a good night, but Kayla, she can't sleep.

83
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,160
 I'm okay, but she can't sleep. She's like, no, I think she'll come back. Oh, don't worry,

84
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,240
 they'll come back. They will come back this time with reinforcements, but we won't be here.

85
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,560
 Just leopard, we're leaving behind Houston, Texas. We are headed out to a remote part of Utah.

86
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:23,120
 We don't know exactly where the story takes place. A remote part of Utah is what, 98% of the state

87
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,480
 takes place somewhere in Utah. I also want to give a shout out to Jim Jam. Jim Jam is the one who

88
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,400
 recommended this story. I don't know if I've announced this on the show yet. It's been up and

89
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,560
 running for a couple of weeks. We actually have a Discord for the Patreon supporters that we've

90
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,680
 been doing. If you are a Patreon supporter, you can listen to me record an episode live every

91
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,400
 Sunday morning, which has been a lot of fun. It's been a lot of fun and allows me to kind of test

92
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,360
 out material. And sometimes I'll ask you guys questions, how does this story work? So if you're

93
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,280
 a Patreon supporter, that is a really cool thing to check out. If you've been thinking about joining

94
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,520
 the Patreon, now is a great time to do it. We do have this Discord setup. It's really cool.

95
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:06,480
 So Jim Jam sent this over to me. Very, very brief story. But again, it's the implications of it

96
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:12,560
 that I think are interesting. We're in Utah. We're at a gas station. A little turgible is

97
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,480
 landing on the roof of a gas station. Everyone's like, "Look, Martha, it's one of them floating

98
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:22,960
 machines." We jump out to get some Wetchum-a-Cullet bars and some Sprite Zero. And we see a commotion

99
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:31,520
 in the parking lot of this gas station. This was posted by Monkey897. And they were telling this

100
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,400
 story. They were driving through remote part of Utah late at night. They stopped at the gas station.

101
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,280
 And there's 10 people in the parking lot. They're just standing there in a circle,

102
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:48,320
 swaying back and forth. They're not making any noise. They're not chanting. They're just

103
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:58,800
 swaying as one movement standing in a circle. In each of their hands, they're holding a glowing

104
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:05,120
 white orb swaying back and forth in the middle of this parking lot standing in a circle.

105
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:14,080
 That's it. That's the whole story. Monkey gets back in his car. They drive away. Apparently,

106
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,200
 this happened at night in a remote part of Utah. That's all we get. This was posted on the Utah

107
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:26,080
 subreddit. And I actually reached out to Monkey. And I was like, "Hey, is there any other information

108
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,880
 available?" It never got back to me. Other people were like, "Whoa, dude, do you know where that was

109
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:37,040
 at?" And he was like, "I don't know. Remember?" No detail whatsoever with this story. None. And then

110
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,200
 he just goes on. I looked at other Reddit posts. He's posting. He's just a normal person. He's not

111
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:47,280
 in a bunch of weird subreddits. He's not a member of the MEPH subreddit. He's not a member of all

112
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,440
 of these UFO crawler sightings subreddit stuff like that. And the reason why I wanted to cover

113
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,520
 this story, I was hoping for more information, obviously, to either suss out whether or not

114
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,760
 this was a lark. And he's like, "Oh yeah, and then the next day, like, 10 of them showed up at my door

115
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,760
 and they had an 11th sphere and they, ah, okay. And now I know you're making it up. Or you're in

116
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,640
 great danger. One of the two. You're either totally making it up or you're about to be absorbed

117
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:17,920
 into a cult. Either or. I can't help you either way. But no, nothing. And I started thinking about it

118
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,360
 and it actually stuck with me because I think about it. I read all. I read constantly. That's all I do

119
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,920
 for this show. I'm reading paranormal ghost stories, conspiracy stuff. It's not an exaggeration.

120
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:37,120
 And so that's why my vacations are so valuable to me. And so when a story sticks in my head,

121
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,240
 that's meaningful. Because I just go through stuff. Sometimes I'll read two, three paragraphs,

122
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,800
 dismiss it. It's just not interesting. Sometimes I'll read whole articles and

123
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:53,600
 decide not to cover them, whatever. This story stuck with me for weeks. I thought, "Oh, that's such an

124
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,080
 interesting story." And here's why. One, the visual is interesting, right? Just on a basic

125
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:05,120
 story level. It's an interesting story. I love paranormal stuff that is on, in society, but

126
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,440
 on the outskirts of society. The hidden war, the masquerade. As a vampire, the masquerade players

127
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,760
 know very well. It's this idea that right next to our reality, there is a shadow reality,

128
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,160
 something else going on. So I like that urban magic type of thing. This is happening in a fairly

129
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,120
 open, spot-to-remote part of Utah, but it is in a parking lot of like a Circle K, 7-Eleven,

130
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:34,160
 whatever it is. You have that element. But then secondly, it's funny to think that we as paranormal

131
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:41,040
 people, right? We are half ghosts, half skeleton. We as paranormal people, people who investigate

132
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,880
 this stuff, if we were driving through an area in the middle of nowhere and we saw something like

133
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,160
 this, we'd be like, "Oh dude, probably take notes. We would be the ones who'd get killed by the cold."

134
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,600
 But you take notes, I'm not advising you to do this, but you would observe and report is what

135
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:02,640
 I'm saying, right? You would remember where you were at, the very least. This is what we do. This

136
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:08,320
 is what, this is our hobby. And the world of the paranormal, the world of the weird, doesn't care.

137
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:16,080
 It really doesn't. It's so interesting because ghost sightings can happen in front of the believer

138
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:21,600
 and the non-believer. UFO abductions can happen to the people who love UFOs and have watched all

139
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,120
 the UFO documentaries to someone who doesn't believe in them at all. The paranormal world

140
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,280
 doesn't care. It's very, very fascinating the way that works. And that's what happened here.

141
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:39,120
 This guy just didn't care. He stumbled across some weird cult that may have been summoning the dark

142
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:46,000
 god of Kanuna and he just wanted his big gulp. It could have been a weird wacky religion that's

143
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 looking for new members. It could have been a lark and they were trying to get people interested

144
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 in it and they're starting, "Who knows? Who knows?" But we would have, we would have at least figured

145
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,520
 out where we were. And so I love this. I actually love this story. The fact that we don't have a ton

146
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,600
 of information about it and the fact that he was so plosive about it and just posted it on

147
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:12,880
 this Utah subreddit. It wasn't even like, the truth is here are some x-oriented subreddit or even

148
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,160
 the x-board or anything like that. It was Utah. But I find it interesting. I find it fascinating,

149
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,280
 man. He just kind of went on with his life and every so often he might remember this story. He

150
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:28,560
 might be like, "Oh, you know, remember that the giant Chloe norms are invading Earth and great

151
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,960
 Lord Kanarnar is taking over the United Nations, absorbing the souls of our leaders?" He's like,

152
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,960
 "You know what? This reminds me of that time I could have stopped the invasion of all reality."

153
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:42,000
 But every so often he might remember this story and think about it or he may never. Again,

154
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,440
 like this story stuck with me. I might have thought about this story more over the past two

155
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:52,880
 or three weeks than he has. Interesting. That's, that's, that, that to me is very, very interesting.

156
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,320
 The reality and the unreality living next to each other and people who aren't interested in at all

157
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,040
 bumping into it. A lot of times I'll see people who are like, "I love ghosts. I believe in ghosts,

158
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,960
 but I've never seen a ghost. How can I see a ghost?" And they're frustrated because they want proof.

159
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,360
 Some guy who doesn't believe in ghosts will have this totally intricate story about how he was in

160
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:18,320
 a cabin one day. This old spectral minor was hanging on the window, "Let me in. Who's got my big toe?"

161
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,280
 And you're like, "You still don't believe in ghosts? No, I might have just been an optical

162
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:26,720
 illusion." I mean, the fact that he did rip off my big toe might be more than an optical illusion,

163
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,000
 but I still don't believe in ghosts. I think that's just a fascinating thing.

164
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,240
 Gislepper, are you ready? Gis gives a little nod of his head.

165
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,520
 Gilded Gopher, are you back alive? Gilded Gopher does a little bow. Gislepper, not

166
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:45,760
 Natasha the keys to the carpenter copter. We are leaving behind Utah and we are headed out to

167
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:56,640
 a small town in the middle of America. We're in a small town in America. Let's call it

168
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:02,560
 Pleasantville. It's a small town. You've lived here all your life. You've actually been very,

169
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:10,480
 very successful in life. You're the town judge. So people come to you, "Judge, judge, what should I

170
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,680
 do?" You're like, "I'm not a life counselor." But they're like, "No, no, like should I arrest that guy

171
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,120
 the cop that cop is walking up to you?" Should I arrest that guy? The guy's shooting at

172
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,560
 a bunch of people? Yeah, you should do that. You help people with their problems.

173
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,160
 People come to you, you know, chicken thieves and you have to decide their

174
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:33,600
 fate. And you're very well respected judge. But there's been a bit of a controversy lately.

175
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:41,360
 You're starting to hear people complain about these new-fangled machines called automobiles.

176
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,400
 Now this is a small town. And for as long as you can remember, the horse and buggy was good enough

177
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:53,280
 for the people of Pleasantville. But these automobiles are coming into town and you've

178
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,920
 heard about them. You've never actually been in one. But you've heard about them. They're loud,

179
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:06,720
 roaring machines, fancy pieces of steel fused together for a smooth ride down any country road.

180
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,040
 But see, there's a few local residents of Pleasantville who think that the cars are menaces,

181
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,520
 thinks that they should be completely banned. Those cars are driving through town, they're

182
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:23,360
 scaring the chickens. Why did you know the other day Billy Bob got drunk, got behind the wheel of his

183
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:30,640
 automobile and smashed over Miss Henrietta's chicken coop? And you go, "Hmm, that is troubling."

184
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:35,760
 Because you've heard that there have been four cases of automobile accidents

185
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:42,080
 in the small town of Pleasantville recently. Now all four of those incidents were tied to

186
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:48,960
 reckless driving. All four of these people were driving over the speed limit, driving in crazy

187
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:56,000
 ways, and two of them were drunk. But these people in town want you to get rid of the automobile.

188
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,720
 It is a very loud mob of people shouting at you to get rid of them.

189
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:13,440
 In town there is a small automobile club that has 45 members. And they're pretty open about their

190
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:18,880
 ownership of their cars. They love them. They really love the cars, they love the convenience,

191
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:25,200
 they love the power, the speed, they love the way they look. But you have all these people

192
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:31,360
 complaining in town and you have these 45 people who love their cars. And you have these four accidents.

193
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:41,440
 Henrietta's chicken coop got smashed. Things could get worse. So you decide to ban automobiles

194
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:48,000
 in Pleasantville. And of course the mob is happy. You've made them very, very content.

195
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,440
 But the 45 owners of vehicles say that's not fair. Like, sure, listen, we actually have a code of

196
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,520
 conduct here at the automobile club. We don't speed. We don't drink and drive. We follow laws,

197
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:07,120
 not just county laws, not just city laws. But we've made up laws for ourselves to regulate

198
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:14,480
 our behavior in these automobiles. And you say, listen, I got four accidents already with these

199
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,360
 automobiles. They're too unpredictable. Who knows what damage will come from them?

200
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:26,960
 The leader of the automobile club goes, well, think about this. What if we had our own roads

201
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:33,040
 to drive on? What if we had our own private roads that we drove on? We could drive them around our

202
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,960
 own property. You wouldn't even have to worry about them. If you're worried about people causing

203
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,400
 accidents, we wouldn't even be on the roads. We wouldn't make horses more skittish. People

204
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:49,120
 wouldn't be jumping out of the way. Just let us drive on our own property. You say no. The people

205
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:57,280
 have spoken. The majority of town have spoken. You are not allowed to operate your motor vehicle

206
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,800
 in the city of Pleasantville. The leader of the automobile club says, I understand,

207
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:11,120
 but it's going to be hard to regulate this. We own these vehicles. And we've used these vehicles

208
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,760
 to help people before. You may not know that. But when Mrs. Margaret, her wagon broke down,

209
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,040
 got stuck in the mud, I personally used my automobile to help get her wagon out of the mud.

210
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,440
 I've also given people rides in town when they don't have a horse and buggy. And you say, listen,

211
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:33,040
 I've already made my decision. Automobiles are illegal in this town. The leader of the automobile

212
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:40,080
 club looks at you and he goes, there might be more people in this town who own cars than you know.

213
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:50,960
 One day, Mr. Jones is walking out to his barn. Mr. Jones is a member of the now banned

214
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:57,360
 automobile club. And his beautiful machine has been sitting inside of a barn for the past few months.

215
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:05,520
 Every day he goes out to wash it, to maintain it, to just kind of look at it. He misses driving his

216
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:14,560
 automobile, but the law won't allow it. At that time, his nephew, Tom visits. Hey, uncle, Tom says as

217
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:20,400
 he walks onto the farm. Mr. Jones turns around and goes, oh, my favorite nephew, Tommy, you're here

218
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,480
 to hang out with me for a while. You betcha. I'm going to help you with chores and all sorts of

219
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:30,400
 stuff. My voice changed to be more like a child. And Tommy is helping out Mr. Jones doing a bunch of

220
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:38,640
 chores. But at one point, Tommy goes into the barn and he sees this automobile. It's not covered up

221
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,000
 by a tarp or anything because Mr. Jones had been working on it that morning. Tommy, his eyes,

222
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,920
 what is this? Is this one of those automobiles I've heard so much about?

223
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:55,280
 It is Tommy. Can I get a ride in it? This would be so amazing. It'd be the bees knees.

224
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,840
 Mr. Jones goes, I'd love to give you a ride in this machine, but automobiles are illegal.

225
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,480
 It would not be right for me to give you a ride in this car.

226
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:16,240
 Aw, shucks, Tommy says. But what if we just drove around on your property? No one would know.

227
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,360
 Mr. Jones thanks about it for a while and he goes, well, I have wanted to use my car for a while.

228
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,760
 It's just been sitting here too. You would love to ride in the car, obviously. You betcha.

229
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:34,560
 Yeah, sure, Tommy, get in. Let's go for a ride, but only on my property, on my legally owned property.

230
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,640
 But this second Mr. Jones starts up that car.

231
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:52,080
 Mrs. McCaggardy in a farm not too far away. Here's the vehicle. What? The busybody says.

232
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:59,840
 I bet you it's one of them automobiles again. And sure enough, she goes out and she sees this

233
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:05,920
 devilish man driving in his pristine automobile. Tommy with a bright smile on his face.

234
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:13,680
 Driving around the farm. That's enough to get Mr. Jones arrested.

235
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:22,080
 When the authorities show up to arrest Mr. Jones, Tom is trying to intervene. No, no, no, no, no,

236
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,680
 you don't understand. My voice gets deeper when the police show up and he didn't break any laws.

237
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,920
 We didn't leave the property and the officer goes, it doesn't matter. The law is no automobile

238
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:37,520
 operation at all in this city. And Tommy goes, but I was the one who wanted to ride in the automobile.

239
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:44,560
 The officer said, it doesn't matter. He's the adult. It was his decision to drive the automobile.

240
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:51,920
 He's in trouble. Aw, shucks, Tommy says. And then they go, Tommy, we need to get you

241
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,240
 back home. And they put him on the back of a horse to ride back to his house as you would

242
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:02,800
 normally travel in this town. And the horse bucks Tommy off. He falls to the ground and gets a black

243
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:10,560
 eye. The horse said that was the horse he thought it was Tommy. Twist ending. Tommy now has this big

244
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:16,000
 black shiner, but he is eventually taken home. And when his parents ask, what happened? How'd

245
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,400
 you get this black guy? He goes, well, I was at the farm with Uncle Jones. And I was driving around

246
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:26,000
 his automobile. And before he can tell the whole truth, his parents go, you got injured in an

247
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:34,720
 automobile. I knew I should have been worried about Uncle Jones. So this goes to trial. There's a huge

248
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,440
 trial in town. Everyone's there, of course, you have the people who support the automobile club,

249
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:45,280
 but they're undercover. They don't want anyone to know they're on Mr. Jones' side. And then you

250
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:52,560
 have the brain mob of people who warned everyone about how dangerous automobiles were in the first

251
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:58,720
 place. And they bring Tommy up on the stand. They ask him about what happened. And he says,

252
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,560
 it was my idea to get in the vehicle. My voice is even deeper now. It gets deep in different parts

253
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:10,000
 of the law process. It was my idea to be in the car. I saw the car. I wanted to get in it. And

254
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:18,080
 the prosecutor goes, well, Mr. Jones showed you the car. No, he didn't. I walked into the barn and

255
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:25,280
 it was there. Yes. But by leaving the car uncovered, he knew you would be fascinated by it. He knew you

256
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:33,440
 would want to be in the car. You see, it wasn't your decision at all. Tom thinks about it for a

257
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:41,360
 second. He goes, yeah, yeah, I guess if I hadn't seen the car, I wouldn't have. See, he led you

258
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:48,800
 on to want to be in the automobile in the first place. It was him. He's a monster. And all of the

259
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:54,560
 people in the crowd who hate automobiles nodded, nodded along to this. Tommy starts to think,

260
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:03,600
 maybe, maybe he did lead me on. Now remember, you're the judge of town and you're sitting,

261
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,480
 you're the judge for this trial. I didn't say that. Did you think you're in the audience? No,

262
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,240
 you're actually the judge of this trial and you're sitting there and you are hearing this,

263
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,640
 but you also see what just happened. This prosecutor, this very clever county prosecutor

264
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:24,080
 that you've seen in hundreds of cases just got that boy to admit that he might have been tricked

265
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,480
 into getting into the automobile and you do you register that you know that's interesting.

266
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,960
 Like, does the boy really regret it? Or did the boy really want to write on that automobile of his

267
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:42,800
 own volition? This trial continues, but it's not looking good for Mr. Jones. The fact of the matter

268
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:49,760
 is he did break the law. He was using a vehicle. He was driving an automobile. But his defense

269
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,640
 lawyer isn't shabby either. And as the defense lawyer gets up and says, listen, here's the facts

270
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:03,600
 of the matter. We have 45 automobiles in town and we've had four accidents, five if you want to

271
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:10,240
 include Tommy getting his black eye, but that was from a horse after the car. If we want to talk about

272
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:16,320
 accidents directly related to cars, we only have those four and those are people who are driving

273
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:22,800
 irresponsibly. Two of them are drunk. When we look at the amount of horses in town, we've had

274
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:28,240
 far more accidents involving horses than we have ever had with cars.

275
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:34,080
 Now, obviously the argument is there's more horses than cars. So of course there's more

276
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:39,680
 accidents, but the defense lawyer goes, listen, there are more horses. Correct. But there are so

277
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,560
 many horse accidents. People falling off. Look at Tommy here, got a black eye. People falling off

278
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:50,960
 horses. Horses going skittish, whole wagons being dragged off into the dirt. Horses biting people.

279
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,920
 That's apparently that. I don't know if horses are around biting people, but horses robbing banks.

280
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:02,560
 You have all of these incidents with horses. And yes, a car ran over Mrs. McTagarty's barn.

281
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:08,800
 But it just could have easily been a wild horse or a horse drawn carriage with a careless driver

282
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:16,880
 who we also have people who drive carriages drunk. The henhouse is going to be smashed by either

283
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:24,880
 vehicle. It doesn't matter what the vehicle is. A horse and carriage out of control can do as much

284
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,800
 damage as an automobile going out of control. They can both kill, they can both maim, they can both

285
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:40,640
 destroy property, your honor. So why are automobiles illegal and horses and buggies not? And you're

286
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:49,840
 sitting there as this judge and you look at the crowd, the numerous crowd, the majority of people

287
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:59,120
 who have spoken over and over and over again. Automobiles are dangerous. The people who use

288
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:07,200
 automobiles are dangerous. They should be banned in Pleasantville. Statistics be damned. Facts are

289
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:14,240
 not relevant. We do not like automobiles. Four accidents are four accidents too much.

290
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:22,720
 Then you look over at the people who you know or have a suspicion. They are members of the

291
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:30,640
 automobile club. You think of the statistics, you think of the emotional damage, you think of the

292
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:39,120
 case in front of you right now with Tom and Mr. Jones. The audience awaits your verdict.

293
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:51,840
 This is what's known as the parable of the automobile. It was written by a anonymous author

294
00:28:51,840 --> 00:29:02,240
 named Encephalon back in the year 2000. It was published on a website.

295
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:09,760
 No one is the North American man of association, aka Nambla.

296
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:17,840
 Welcome to insanity week because this is a level of insanity. That's clever.

297
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:25,600
 If I present the same story to you with what they want, the North American man boy love

298
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:33,600
 association. I'm not putting this in the show notes either. I found this because I was covering

299
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:39,120
 a story about this insane politician who had all these really, really wet... he actually

300
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,840
 was tried running for office in Virginia or Washington DC. I'll put his stuff in the show

301
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,080
 notes. I'm not going to cover the whole story. It's too gross, but he was grosser than this.

302
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:54,240
 Groser than what we're about to discuss. He was running for political office and he said in his

303
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:00,480
 statement of whatever the politician, their platform, he said in his platform, "The parable

304
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:07,440
 of the automobile must be tested by democracy." I go, "What's that?" Then I spent an afternoon.

305
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,280
 I condensed. That's a very, very, very long story. I condensed it and made it a flow a little bit

306
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:19,200
 better. I kept the core of it. This politician was eventually arrested trying to get a 12-year-old

307
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,720
 girl on a plane flight from California to DC and she was wearing a wig or he was wearing a

308
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,600
 wager. They were both wearing wigs. Now he's in prison for 20 years, which is where he belongs.

309
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,160
 But on his political platform, he just had all this craziness and he had this thing about the

310
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:39,280
 parable of the automobile must be tested by democracy. I go, "I gotta see what this is. I gotta go down

311
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:46,800
 this rabbit hole." Let's break down what they're saying because now that you know, for those of

312
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:52,160
 you who stuck around here, why is Jason just telling this old-timey story, the automobile club

313
00:30:52,160 --> 00:31:02,320
 of 45 members in this small town, 45 dudes. If you live in a big city, there probably are at least

314
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,680
 45 active pedophiles. But if you lived in Pleasantville, if you lived in some tiny little town and

315
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:15,760
 there's 45 of them, so anyways, in this small town of the turn of the century, there's 45 boy

316
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:21,840
 lovers. Except so, they're not getting monetized on YouTube. There's 45 boy lovers and that's

317
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,560
 where the automobile club represents. And all these people the whole time who were complaining about

318
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:32,080
 how much damage they caused and how they're horrible, they were us. They were normal people

319
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,720
 going, "Dude, you can't be doing that. What are you doing with those kids?" And they go, "No, no, no,

320
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:43,120
 those four people you arrested, they were breaking our rules." See, those were rogue child molesters.

321
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:51,200
 Those were the bad ones. See, we do it with love. That's why you put love in our name.

322
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,160
 Disgusting. I don't know how much I want to break down this story, but

323
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:02,720
 that's their logic. That's the insanity of this. And I could see someone, a member of Nambla,

324
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,480
 reading this and being like, "Oh yeah, man, this is exactly, this is right. Like, we get treated

325
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,640
 like we're ostracized if you look at the facts." But the facts don't make, first off, no one's ever

326
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:17,920
 used a child to pull a buggy, to pull a carriage out of a ditch. That doesn't make any sense at all.

327
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:23,600
 Right? None of that stuff makes sense too. The comparison to, you can get just as injured on

328
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:30,640
 a horse as you can in a car. No, right? Because one of them, the horse, represents traditional,

329
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:39,120
 consensual sex between adults. And whether it's like one adult or it's polygamy or group or whatever,

330
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,920
 it doesn't matter. They're consenting adults. You can have a whole wagon drain. Doesn't matter.

331
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:48,960
 And if a couple people get injured in that, that would suck for them, obviously. I'll probably do

332
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,720
 an episode on it. But that's the horse and buggy. Whether or not they're smashing over Mrs. McCartney's

333
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:03,120
 in-house, it's consensual adults. You're just gross, dude. You can't compare that. And technically,

334
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,440
 hopefully, no one's getting injured. And one shouldn't exist. The automobile club

335
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:14,400
 should not exist in this comparison. The horses, you know, hopefully be safe about it. Don't put

336
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:19,680
 a bit in your mouth and try carrying five passengers on your back. I think you'll be fine sexually.

337
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,520
 But this is their comparison. It's more people get more people statistically, if you want to

338
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:31,200
 look at raw numbers, I guess, more, I actually know this doesn't make sense. More people get

339
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:37,360
 injured during consensual sex than it does with nambla dudes. And even if I was having consensual

340
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,400
 sex with someone and I stubbed my toe or she accidentally, I don't know, bit my dick or something

341
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:48,960
 like that, that's way better than anything these sickos are doing. Right? So anyways, that doesn't

342
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:55,360
 make sense. Using your boy to pull a buggy out of a ditch doesn't make sense. When you think about

343
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,200
 it as the parable of the automobile and the boy coming over and seeing the car and being like,

344
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,840
 "I want to ride in the car," you do go, well, yeah, of course, like, who wouldn't want to ride in a car

345
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:09,600
 when they're brand new. But if you have to make that, if you make that in the real world, what

346
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:14,000
 they're really talking about is, I don't want to go into detail, but somebody coming over and seeing

347
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:20,480
 and act, either a pornographic magazine video or something like that and going, "Oh, I want to do

348
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:28,160
 that too." That's what that is a connection to. And so the character was saying that I wanted to do it.

349
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:33,760
 And they're saying, "No, he showed you material that made you want to do it." Did you guys know

350
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,920
 there's a Spider-Man comic along those lines? It's technically canon. I think it's actually

351
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:43,360
 really important comic book. It turns out Peter Parker was molested as a young boy,

352
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,880
 because of something like that. And that happens. It happens to a lot of boys. It happens to a

353
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:55,520
 lot of girls. It happens to a lot of boys. And I think with boys, we dismiss it. We don't talk

354
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,800
 about it. So it's more hidden, but it happens to everyone, not everyone statistically, but it

355
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,000
 happens to a lot of people. It's not something that you need to be ashamed about. It is something

356
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,960
 that you talk to people you feel comfortable with. But yeah, that happened to Peter Parker.

357
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,280
 That happened to Peter Parker. He came over to some guy's house and the guy showed him some

358
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:19,040
 magazines. And then Peter Parker got molested. And I know like people have joked about it in

359
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,120
 the past. I think that's really important. I think that's really important because there are a lot

360
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,880
 of young people, not just young men, but a lot of young people who could read that comic book and

361
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:32,800
 go, "Oh, like it's not that it's not a big deal, but it's something that you can get through.

362
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:40,240
 Something you can get through and get past and thrive." But anyway, so that was that corollary

363
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:46,720
 there. This story doesn't have any crazy, fantastic ending. It doesn't have any horror

364
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,760
 ending or anything. I can't make up anything creepier than what we just read. So we're just

365
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:58,480
 going to end it like this. Sometimes the worst insanity is the insanity that hides itself as

366
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:06,720
 sanity. They make a good narrative when you don't know what they're arguing. And I think that happens

367
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:12,880
 a lot. I think a lot of times we hear a story and it sounds good and we nod our heads. We start

368
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:20,080
 agreeing with it and we don't know what the end game is. Could be something simple. Could be a

369
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:28,880
 politician trying to get your vote. Or it could be something nefarious, disgusting, unnatural.

370
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:38,560
 This story is right about one thing though. You don't know how many members are in the automobile

371
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,920
 club. And that's the scariest part of all.
