1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,200
 A bizarre audio clip floating around the internet may give us a clue behind the phenomenon

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,680
 known as "Missing 411."

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:15,480
 And then we travel to Vietnam to meet a young woman about to buy a refrigerator.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,680
 As she pulls the money out of her wallet and hands it over to the cashier, little does

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:26,160
 anyone know that they have just stepped foot into the world of the damned, today on Dead

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,160
 Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:38,280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,440
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,280
 Hope you guys are having a great day too, like not after yesterday's episode dude.

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,480
 That was pretty rough, yeah.

11
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,360
 Yeah, it was pretty bad.

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,840
 But someone who is never bad but always good walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now

13
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,400
 is one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,400
 Everyone give it up for Shawn.

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,400
 Woohoo!

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,960
 Yeah, come on in buddy.

17
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,560
 Come on in Shawn, into Dead Rabbit Command.

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,240
 Shawn, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

19
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,080
 If you guys can't support the show financially through the Patreon or whatever, that's fine.

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,080
 It really is.

21
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,880
 Just help spread the word about the podcast.

22
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,360
 That really, really, really helps out a lot.

23
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,360
 Shawn, we got a lot of stuff to cover today so I'm gonna go ahead and toss you a little

24
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,440
 engineers cap and a shovel.

25
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,920
 We're gonna hop on board the Carpenter Caboose.

26
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,440
 We're gonna take this train all the way out to Pakistan.

27
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:27,440
 Choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-choo-

28
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:49,360
 We're looking for the tree.

29
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,440
 We're specifically looking for the tree on Margala Hill Trail 5.

30
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,960
 The dude's like, "You saw that video didn't you?"

31
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,880
 And I was like, "Yeah, that's why we're here.

32
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,880
 We're walking through the city of Islamabad.

33
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,360
 We're on the opposite side of the train parked right at the entrance of the city.

34
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,360
 It's three hours later.

35
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,480
 We finally find this walking trail.

36
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,000
 Just trees and nature, dirt and stuff like that, a couple birds.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Kind of boring.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 But we're not here to see all that dumb stuff.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,160
 We're here to keep walking and then you hear...

40
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,160
 What?

41
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,160
 What?

42
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,160
 Did you hear that?

43
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,920
 Where'd that come from?

44
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,360
 Come this way guys, closer, closer.

45
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,160
 We're gonna continue to walk through the woods and we hear...

46
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,160
 What?

47
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,160
 Isn't that crazy?

48
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,160
 Really, Chase?

49
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,160
 Just tell the story.

50
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,320
 Just tell the story.

51
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,320
 Tell that you found a one minute long video.

52
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,320
 You found some TikTok.

53
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,960
 I just got to the chase, bro.

54
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,800
 So anyways, I found this one minute long video on TikTok.

55
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
 What it is...

56
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,920
 This is Trippy.

57
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,920
 There's an actor.

58
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,920
 There's a Pakistani actor named Ahmed Ali Akbar.

59
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,520
 He's an actor and they were currently shooting a movie in this area and during a break in

60
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:06,680
 filming he was walking through Margala Hill Trail 5 and he heard that sound.

61
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,680
 Let me play the audio in full for you right here.

62
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:24,560
 Ahmed is walking through this area.

63
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:44,800
 Ahmed is walking through this area and he starts hearing that sound.

64
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,080
 That sound.

65
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,120
 And he identifies it as coming out of a tree.

66
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,920
 And he said this tree was about a foot and a half in diameter and had a hole, a perfect

67
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,320
 hole about the size of a coin.

68
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,440
 And he videotaped this.

69
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,440
 You can clearly see this.

70
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,040
 I'll put it in the show notes, obviously.

71
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,720
 But so that sound is coming out of the hole in the tree.

72
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,920
 And he's videotaping it and he...

73
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,520
 Listen, obviously people are gonna think it's fake and he goes, "It's not fake."

74
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,760
 Now anyone who fakes stuff, they're gonna say it's not fake, too.

75
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,400
 But let's assume that this is real, right?

76
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,480
 It could obviously be a total forgery.

77
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,480
 Someone can be like, "You know what?

78
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,480
 I'm a famous actor but you know what?

79
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,200
 I like to do my breaks.

80
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
 Fool people!"

81
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,280
 Well I guess actors do professionally get fake delight of people.

82
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,480
 So maybe it is this hobby.

83
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,760
 But anyway, so he came across this tree and it's making this noise.

84
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,120
 He says it's totally authentic.

85
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,960
 This kind of went viral, right?

86
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,720
 Imagine a brat bit.

87
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,280
 I was like, "Hey guys, you won't believe it.

88
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,360
 I was walking around the Hollywood Hills and I found a chupacabra!

89
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,400
 Here's a video of this guy running through the bushes.

90
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,880
 Even if it really wasn't the chupacabra, you just saw like a tail.

91
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,880
 People would still be talking about it.

92
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,920
 I mean even if it was just like some stupid orb he picked up on camera, people would be

93
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,080
 like, "Brat bit believes in ghosts."

94
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,080
 It'd be a big thing.

95
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,240
 So this went viral over in Pakistan and you had people come out and be like, "That's

96
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,240
 fake."

97
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,840
 You had people come out and say, "Whoa, that's super spooky."

98
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,040
 And then you had other people come out.

99
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,400
 There was an actress named Anushi Ashraf.

100
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,840
 She responded to this and she goes, "There's actually a scientific reason behind this.

101
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,040
 When trees are super dehydrated, they scream."

102
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,320
 Did you know that?

103
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,120
 Did you know that was a thing?

104
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,080
 Well, here's the issue with that.

105
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,680
 Yes, they do do that.

106
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,680
 You're like, "They clearly don't.

107
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,680
 I've never heard that in my life.

108
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,680
 Hold on."

109
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,360
 So I looked it up.

110
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:52,960
 And according to the Smithsonian, they have a, on their website, smithsonianmag.com,

111
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,040
 they have an article, "Trees make noise and some of those sounds are cries for help."

112
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:04,040
 But if you look closer in the article, they say the trees do scream, but it's an ultrasonic

113
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,800
 scream, which humans cannot hear.

114
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,320
 So now we're back to square one.

115
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,720
 The debunking didn't work.

116
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,960
 So what is this?

117
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,960
 What is this?

118
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,200
 It's, the most likely explanation is some sort of natural phenomenon, but moisture

119
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,440
 escaping from the tree?

120
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,160
 Who knows?

121
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,640
 I think, I'm not going to say necessarily like a, it sounds like a baby, right?

122
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,400
 I'm not saying like a baby's soul is trapped in a tree or anything.

123
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,920
 I wouldn't say anything that outlandish, but it could be something paranormal, definitely.

124
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,840
 It's interesting as the video is taken during the day, which also lends at this very, oh,

125
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,600
 I'm sure it's something normal vibe.

126
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,840
 It's not in the middle of a spooky forest during the witch's hour.

127
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,960
 It's like a, it's a coffee break from shooting.

128
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,640
 It's like probably two, three in the afternoon.

129
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,480
 So it could be something natural.

130
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,720
 It could be something paranormal, but I think either way, it's not something they can easily

131
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,720
 identify.

132
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,440
 It's something that they go, oh, here's the answer.

133
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,680
 And then people moved on, but they didn't read the article themselves that they were

134
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,360
 posting where it says that it's an ultrasonic sound.

135
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,640
 They just need microphones to check it out.

136
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:21,760
 So I'm wondering if this is a super rare phenomenon that does happen and it's either dismissed

137
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:27,640
 or it's never even really witnessed in the first place, unless you're walking through

138
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:34,440
 the forest and you hear that sound, which does sound like somebody in distress, a child,

139
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:40,000
 a baby, and you went to investigate it.

140
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,720
 And you got lost.

141
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,680
 Fall off the ravine, move too far off the trail.

142
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,320
 You're never able to get back on it.

143
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,600
 You're just kind of wandering around the wilderness until your supplies run out, which, you know,

144
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,680
 you're just hiking.

145
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,600
 You didn't think you were going to go on this big excursion, but if you were hiking on a

146
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:04,240
 trail and you heard that sound and you thought it was a baby in trouble, you may break off

147
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,440
 the trail to go find it, the source of that sound.

148
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,760
 And then you get there and you're like, oh, just a tree.

149
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,320
 Oh no, where am I?

150
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
 Where am I?

151
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,320
 And you're lost.

152
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,800
 And you just had, you know, some trail nuts on you and a bit of water because you didn't

153
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,960
 plan on being out there for four days, braving the elements.

154
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,560
 I'm wondering if something like this, we, it's interesting because in the paranormal

155
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,560
 world, we come across the sound of babies crying a lot, like crybaby bridges or children crying

156
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,680
 in the darkness or strange voices from the forest and people being lured out there.

157
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:41,120
 And then when you look at stuff like missing 411, we don't know how they disappear or why

158
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,400
 they disappear, but it could be something natural like this that's drawing you off the

159
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,400
 trail.

160
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,160
 If I was walking, if I was hiking in the middle of nowhere and I heard that sound, I would

161
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,880
 keep hiking.

162
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,080
 I would be like, sorry, baby, I'll get to where there's some cell phone service.

163
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,320
 I'll tie a little string on this tree, tree so I can find my way back.

164
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,200
 I'm not walking through that bramble for a possible baby.

165
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,000
 If it was a real baby, if it was a baby going, no, it's really me and I can see your shirt,

166
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,160
 you're wearing a black shirt and white shoes.

167
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,400
 I'd be like, okay, that's obviously a baby.

168
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,320
 Like, no, Jason, that's even more suspicious.

169
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,160
 And a baby can talk and it can describe your clothing.

170
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,720
 If I heard what sounded like it could be a baby, I wouldn't say that.

171
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,880
 I mean, if it was in front of me, I'd pick it up.

172
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:37,800
 But if it was like, I couldn't see it like somewhere in the bushes I heard it.

173
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,920
 I'd be like, that might not be a baby.

174
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,200
 Like I can't clearly see what's making that noise.

175
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,560
 So I'm going to keep on walking.

176
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,240
 If I could see that it was a baby, I wouldn't be like, I'm closing my eyes.

177
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,240
 I'm like, what?

178
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,240
 What's making that noise?

179
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,240
 I'm all stepping over the baby.

180
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,680
 He's grabbing my pant leg.

181
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,800
 Obviously if I saw the baby, I would rescue the baby.

182
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,860
 But if I was walking and I heard a baby noise and I couldn't see the baby, I'm not going

183
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,240
 to get off the trail to go save the baby.

184
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,360
 So this noise, I mean, that makes me smart, right?

185
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,440
 I'm never going to disappear in the middle of the woods.

186
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,080
 A bunch of babies may die.

187
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:18,320
 I may be responsible for the deaths of many lost children, but I won't get lost in the

188
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,320
 woods.

189
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,280
 But I think if you were hiking and you heard that sound, you may leave the trail.

190
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,640
 Never to be seen again or simply to not be seen for a while, right?

191
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,300
 You just die and they find your bleach bones out in the woods somewhere.

192
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,140
 And I'm standing over your bones.

193
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,780
 I'm like, you got fooled by that screaming.

194
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,100
 There's a bunch of baby bones around him.

195
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,660
 I'm like, I'm going to ignore those.

196
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,740
 It must have been the trees that tricked you.

197
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,740
 And I walk away.

198
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,700
 Yeah, who knows, right?

199
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:51,180
 The thing with the missing 4011 phenomenon, it's always like, what is causing them to

200
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,740
 disappear?

201
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,140
 And it could, you know, some people say it's like the government wearing these invisible

202
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,440
 predator type suits.

203
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,320
 Some people say it's Bigfoot.

204
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,320
 Some people say it's interdimensional.

205
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,320
 And those could all be possible.

206
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,400
 But it could also be we could have people leaving the trail because they hear something

207
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,400
 like that.

208
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,620
 I think that would draw people off the trail.

209
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,040
 And they're never seen again or they're never seen alive again.

210
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,840
 We talked about on a recent episode, the world of the paranormal is told in the survivors'

211
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,500
 stories.

212
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,720
 The blue encounter of these entities or this phenomenon who don't make it, we never hear

213
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,440
 their story.

214
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,440
 We only know the stories of the times people get abducted by aliens and brought back.

215
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:40,200
 Or the people who interact with some sort of monster, some sort of cryptid, some sort

216
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,240
 of void, and come back.

217
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,960
 So who knows what else is out there that we have no idea that's out there.

218
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,800
 Let's go ahead and switch gears.

219
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,660
 Sean, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the carpenter copter.

220
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,480
 We are going to leave behind this forest.

221
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,360
 Make sure any babies you brought with you for that first segment.

222
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,640
 Make sure you still have them because I'm not responsible for them.

223
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:13,880
 Let's hop on aboard the carpenter copter Sean Flyas all the way out to Vietnam.

224
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,920
 We're in the city of Hai Phong.

225
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,920
 The year is 2009.

226
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,760
 We're walking around this mall.

227
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,260
 It's called the Big C Hai Phong Mall.

228
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:30,660
 Let's head on down to the Big C is what they say in Vietnam.

229
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,660
 Let's go.

230
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:35,540
 So we're walking around with our shopping bags and we're looking at shirts and buying

231
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,540
 pineapples and everything like that.

232
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,500
 And a pretty girl walks in.

233
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:46,900
 This pretty girl, pretty young girl walks into the mall and she walks up to a clerk

234
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,300
 and says, "I want to buy a refrigerator.

235
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,100
 Can you show me what you have?"

236
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,100
 And he's like, "Yeah, sure.

237
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,100
 Come this way."

238
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,560
 And they're looking and he's like, "This one keeps food cold."

239
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,840
 And she's like, "What about that one?"

240
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,840
 And he goes, "That one does it too.

241
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,840
 They're both fridges."

242
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:06,480
 Well, eventually she decides on which fridge she wants to buy and she goes up to the cash

243
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,160
 register and they said, "This is insane.

244
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,160
 This is so insane.

245
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,080
 This actually isn't the weirdest part of the story."

246
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,600
 It gets weirder.

247
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,440
 It costs 3 million Vietnam Dong.

248
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,640
 That's the name of their currency.

249
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,380
 The Vietnam Dong.

250
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,260
 3 million Dong.

251
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,940
 That's $130 in US money.

252
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,100
 That's always so weird to me.

253
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,900
 How do you carry that much money around?

254
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,900
 You carrying briefcase?

255
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,900
 You have this huge briefcase.

256
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,620
 You're like, "Let's go to McDonald's, kids."

257
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,620
 Get the forklift.

258
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:45,460
 I'm sure they have a bill that's 1 billion Dong and you're buying coffee with it.

259
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,460
 It's just weird.

260
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,660
 I would just change my money.

261
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:52,560
 I would say Vietnam Dong, we're not going to call 3 million 3 million anymore.

262
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,760
 We'll call it 7.

263
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,280
 It would just make more sense.

264
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:02,480
 But anyways, so this woman walks in with this giant crate of Vietnam Dong.

265
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,680
 She's like, "Hope you can count to 3.

266
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:10,360
 I hope you can sit here and count these $1 Dongs 3 million times."

267
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,520
 So anyways, they bring it in.

268
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:16,000
 It's only $130 for a fridge, which actually is pretty cheap.

269
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,380
 And the young woman says, "Can you deliver it to my house?"

270
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,860
 And they're like, "Of course."

271
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,740
 So they're writing out a receipt.

272
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,740
 She doesn't cut.

273
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,340
 They're writing out the receipt, the address and everything like that.

274
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:32,620
 Give it to the young woman and she leaves.

275
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:40,100
 Well shortly after that, a delivery man from the Big C Mall comes up in his delivery truck,

276
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:45,140
 gets out of the car, goes to the address, "Ding dong."

277
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:50,620
 At the door stands an old woman, not like super old, not like 90s, nothing like that.

278
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:55,740
 But you know, like she's middle-aged.

279
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,280
 Delivery driver walks up to her and says, "Hey, I got this fridge delivery.

280
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,140
 I got this fridge delivery.

281
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,780
 And where do you want me to put it?"

282
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:07,020
 I'm assuming the kitchen, but like, "You want to do this now?"

283
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,000
 Or the woman goes, "I didn't order a fridge.

284
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,320
 I mean, I need one.

285
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,040
 It'd be nice, but I didn't order one.

286
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,200
 There must be some sort of mistake."

287
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,420
 And the delivery driver goes, "Oh, no, no, no.

288
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,920
 It's actually already been paid for."

289
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,480
 Here, look at the receipt.

290
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,500
 And he hands the receipt, the delivery receipt, over to the middle-aged woman and she looks

291
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,020
 at it and she immediately bursts into tears.

292
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,260
 She begins sobbing.

293
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,980
 Delivery driver's like, "Dude, what's the matter?"

294
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:34,340
 And she goes, "I don't know how this is possible because I see that this was just purchased

295
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:40,040
 like a couple of days ago, but this is my daughter's name on this receipt.

296
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,900
 My daughter's been dead for months.

297
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:51,660
 And before my daughter died, the day before she died, she told me, "Ma, you know what?

298
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,140
 I'm going to buy you a new refrigerator."

299
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:59,580
 Those were her famous last words we had on her tombstone.

300
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,740
 She died in a car accident a couple of months ago.

301
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,180
 How is this possible?

302
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,180
 How is this possible?

303
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:09,220
 And the mother's just sobbing and she's perplexed and she's like questioning delivery driver

304
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,680
 and trying to figure everything out.

305
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,280
 And delivery driver is freaking out about this.

306
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:19,960
 Like the mom obviously, I mean this is either the cruelest slash best joke in the world.

307
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,920
 Like yeah, sure, you're impersonating her dead daughter, but you get a free fridge.

308
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,840
 That's pretty good.

309
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,840
 That's going on.

310
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,960
 But the delivery driver's just like, "Oh my God, is there a ghost?

311
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,920
 I don't have anything to do with ghosts."

312
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:38,760
 He got this job because it was the least ghost job possible.

313
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,180
 If I'm in a delivery van, they can't catch up to me.

314
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,180
 He freaks out.

315
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,180
 He actually leaves.

316
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,180
 He doesn't leave the fridge there.

317
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:50,060
 That's not on the van, but he runs, he gets in his van, he drives back to the mall, tells

318
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,780
 his boss, "Guys, you guys aren't going to leave this.

319
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:58,260
 Remember that fridge that you wanted me to deliver like 20 minutes ago?"

320
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,260
 Well, a ghost bought it.

321
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,500
 A ghost bought it in the bus.

322
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,820
 Like what are you talking about?

323
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,140
 He goes, "I don't even know.

324
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,460
 I don't even know how to explain this."

325
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:14,480
 A ghost bought it because the name on the receipt is of a girl who died months ago.

326
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,800
 And the day before she died, she told her mom, "I want to buy you a new fridge."

327
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,040
 And the boss is like, "Dude, I'm way too busy.

328
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,200
 I'm running an entire mall right now.

329
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:28,480
 I'm way too busy to figure this out."

330
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,360
 But the boss goes to the clerk.

331
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,000
 It goes to the girl who rang up the transaction.

332
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,620
 She goes, "Hey listen, Bob, back in delivery, is flipping out saying that a ghost bought

333
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,460
 a fridge the other day and when he went to deliver it, the mom said the girl had been

334
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,540
 dead for a couple months.

335
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,740
 Do you remember selling a fridge recently?"

336
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,580
 She says, "Yeah, this young woman came in.

337
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,080
 She bought the fridge.

338
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,580
 It's three million dong."

339
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,740
 She's like, "Wow, that's a lot."

340
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,580
 But you do remember selling it.

341
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,940
 Oh yeah, I totally remember it.

342
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,820
 She came into the store and the boss is like, "Okay.

343
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,520
 Well let's go and see what we can pull up."

344
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:10,800
 And they go and they watch the CCTV footage, the security cam footage.

345
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,160
 There's no trace of the girl in the mall.

346
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,000
 But that's not even the weirdest part.

347
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,480
 Because the boss then goes, "Well listen, she bought it, even though we don't have it

348
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,160
 on video.

349
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,160
 She bought it.

350
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,040
 She gave us money for it.

351
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,780
 And we have a fridge sitting in our delivery truck.

352
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,300
 Let's go to the money counter."

353
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,300
 I'm assuming that's some sort of like cash office where they're putting their deposits.

354
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,340
 Because I don't know if this story, I know in America when you buy something, it takes

355
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,980
 days for it to get delivered.

356
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,700
 I don't know if it's more efficient in Vietnam.

357
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,260
 But this story, it's very popular in Vietnam.

358
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:51,140
 I don't know if it all took place in a single afternoon or over a day or two in America.

359
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,340
 It would take like three weeks to finally get your fridge delivered.

360
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,720
 Anyways, the boss goes, "Let's go count the money."

361
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,000
 Obviously, she gave you $3 million, right?

362
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,120
 And the clerk's like, "Yeah, I mean she might not show it.

363
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,120
 She might be invisible to cameras."

364
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,600
 But she didn't give me money.

365
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,880
 So they go and they go to count the money.

366
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:19,640
 And as they're counting it, they find $3 million, but it's what's known as ghost money.

367
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:28,020
 Ghost money in the Vietnamese folk religion tradition is when somebody dies, you have

368
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:35,980
 this fake money that you burn to send with them in the afterlife.

369
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:45,140
 And there's exactly $3 million in Vietnamese dong in the money counter that is singed ghost

370
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,500
 money.

371
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:52,880
 Money that must have been made as an offering at the young woman's funeral.

372
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,600
 The same moment that they realized they registered $3 million in ghost money in it.

373
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:06,920
 In the delivery bay, the refrigerator she purchased burst into flames.

374
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,640
 It's an interesting ghost story.

375
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:15,040
 This is a very, very popular tale in Vietnam.

376
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,540
 You have no names associated with it.

377
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:23,340
 So there's a lot of debate over how real the story is.

378
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:27,500
 The skeptics obviously go, first off they just go, "Ghost don't exist or even waste

379
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,380
 my time talking about ghosts."

380
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:34,060
 The skeptics, the ones who do want to engage in conversation, they'll say, "Here's the

381
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:38,660
 thing, we don't have the names of anybody so we can't verify any of this story.

382
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:44,460
 We don't have the name of the clerk, the mother, the delivery driver or the boss.

383
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:52,120
 And any one of those could verify somehow these events happened in one way or the other."

384
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,120
 My push, that's true.

385
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,080
 And we do encounter that a lot, especially in ghost stories and in paranormal stories

386
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,280
 where people don't feel comfortable giving their names.

387
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,660
 So that is true.

388
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:06,320
 My counterbalance to that is we do have a date, a city in a specific location, the Big

389
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,520
 Sea High Fong Mall.

390
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,840
 And we cover stories all the time that I'm like, "I have no idea where this story took

391
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,840
 place."

392
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,880
 Anywhere in the world.

393
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,160
 So that's nice that we have those details.

394
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:29,660
 You have to wonder, let's assume the story is true because I do think it definitely seems

395
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:34,260
 to have the qualities of both like an urban legend, like a Phantom Hitchhiker type story.

396
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:38,140
 But those stories in America, you pick up a pretty young hitchhiker, she's in the back

397
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:43,660
 seat of your car and when you get to her house, she's gone and she left like a wet jacket

398
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,640
 in your back seat.

399
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:52,800
 This story involves the exchanging of currency, involves shopping for a while, and then having

400
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,520
 a fridge delivered to your mom because you said you were going to get her a fridge and

401
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,520
 then the fridge exploding.

402
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:04,720
 You have all these other dramatic elements going on other than just a wet sweater.

403
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,640
 I don't know if this story is true exactly, but it's definitely a fascinating one.

404
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:15,540
 This ghost is doing things that ghosts normally don't do.

405
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:19,100
 Shopping malls for one, like obviously she was walking around, she was interacting with

406
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,820
 multiple people for this to even take place.

407
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:29,700
 But what's interesting is we recently have that video footage and I was going to cover

408
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,420
 it, I didn't get around to it because it just became so popular.

409
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:37,420
 There's a lot of stuff I don't cover not because it's not awesome, but because you

410
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,600
 can read about it everywhere and I was like, "Oh yeah, everyone else is already read about

411
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,600
 that."

412
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,160
 Let me pull up the city real quick.

413
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,800
 I didn't plan on doing this, but as I was telling the story, it reminded me of this.

414
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,800
 I'll put it in the show notes.

415
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:56,280
 In Argentina, recently there was that security guard who he's sitting at his desk and it's

416
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:02,600
 like late at night, the front door's open and he gets up and he is interacting with

417
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,600
 somebody who is not there.

418
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:11,260
 He's talking to him for a bit and then goes back to check something and then he moves

419
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:17,380
 something so she can walk by and then he goes and sits back down and continues with his

420
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:23,540
 day or night, continues with his shift.

421
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:28,960
 And it went around the internet as a man interacting with a ghost.

422
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,380
 What happens is that through a series of events, the guard finds out that the woman he saw walk

423
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:40,000
 in that night had died a few hours earlier.

424
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,920
 He says that this elderly woman came in and said, "I forgot something in my room."

425
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,880
 And he goes, "Oh yeah, sure, go ahead ma'am.

426
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,080
 Let me move this out of your way."

427
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,960
 He writes it down in the log and she goes into the hospital, but then as this was being investigated,

428
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,760
 he finds out she'd been dead a couple of hours before that.

429
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,960
 Now the video went around and then you immediately began seeing the debunking and then it stopped

430
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,840
 and the debunking is weird.

431
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,420
 One of the ones was, obviously people are saying he's just making it up.

432
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,500
 He was putting on a little show.

433
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,340
 You know how security guards do it three in the morning, put on his show for no one?

434
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:19,540
 They said that the front doors were broken so they kept opening and closing and so this

435
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,220
 man, the security guard, and this is all on video.

436
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,900
 You can watch it yourself, open the show notes.

437
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:28,300
 If you guys haven't seen it yourselves, it was everywhere.

438
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,940
 The officials of the hospital go, "Listen, he was making it up.

439
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,760
 What happened was the door was broken so it was opening and closing so many times at a

440
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:43,360
 certain point he decided to get up and pantomime somebody coming in who wasn't really there."

441
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,680
 That's what officials of the hospital are saying.

442
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,280
 That's not what he's saying.

443
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,000
 That's what officials of the hospital are saying.

444
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,320
 So it's such a bizarre story in and of itself.

445
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,200
 I probably should have done a full segway on it.

446
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,040
 But that just happened earlier this year.

447
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,660
 I mean, this is what I imagine it would have been like.

448
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,980
 They say that they watched the CCTV cameras.

449
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:09,100
 They said there was no trace of the girl, but I'm wondering if there's video footage

450
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:15,300
 of the clerk pantomining the transaction and that's why they said, "Well, let's go check

451
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,300
 the money."

452
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:20,020
 Because obviously it looks like you're taking money from someone, but there's clearly no

453
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,340
 one standing there.

454
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:25,940
 So then they would go back to check the money.

455
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,820
 And I'm wondering if that happened.

456
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:35,120
 Now what's interesting too is the reason why this video from Buenas Aires, from this hospital

457
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,200
 in Buenas Aires, the reason why it made the rounds is because it got out.

458
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,460
 It went viral, right?

459
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:44,120
 Someone videotaped the videotape and sent it out.

460
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:48,720
 This ghost story about the young woman coming in to buy the fridge for her mom, the reason

461
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,980
 why that became popular was because, again, if the story is true, the mother said, "Hey,

462
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,680
 this isn't mine.

463
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,420
 I didn't order one and oh my god, that's my daughter's name on that receipt."

464
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:04,900
 I wonder how many times ghosts do interact with people on a daily basis because here's

465
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:09,340
 the thing, if nobody ever questioned the security guard, he would just say, "Yeah, some lady

466
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,340
 came in."

467
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,340
 He wouldn't even mention it to anybody.

468
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:15,580
 It wouldn't be until it was brought to his attention and be like, "Hey, why did we see

469
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,180
 on video you talking to nobody?"

470
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,180
 And he's like, "What?"

471
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,180
 "No, I was talking to someone.

472
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,180
 What time?"

473
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,180
 "Yeah, I wrote it down in the logbook.

474
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,180
 She was in room 915, right?"

475
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:25,620
 And they're like, "Yeah, she was dead already, dude."

476
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:31,520
 You may be at your work, you may be walking through the mall or out in public, and you

477
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,940
 may have a full interaction with a ghost and you don't know it.

478
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,200
 You have no idea what's going on.

479
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,240
 Now, obviously, if it was your grandpa, if you're sitting there drinking a smoothie and

480
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,560
 your grandpa shows up, it was like, "I got one more last thing to tell you, Jimmy."

481
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,520
 You're like, "Grandpa, you've been dead for 20 years.

482
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,760
 You know that's a ghost."

483
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,760
 But if it was a ghost of someone you didn't know and you're at work and someone shows

484
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:56,580
 up and they're like, "Hey, do you have a slim gym so I can get into my car?"

485
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:00,860
 I locked my keys in my car and you're like, "Sorry, ma'am, we don't have slim gyms here."

486
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:04,100
 She's like, "Okay."

487
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,140
 Would you ever know you interacted with a ghost?

488
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,660
 You're the only person sitting there.

489
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,700
 Apparently, you weren't going to gas station.

490
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,700
 You're like, "What?"

491
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,700
 "I didn't know that."

492
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,700
 You weren't going to gas station.

493
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,220
 Someone comes in and asks you for a slim gym.

494
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,580
 If you don't know what slim gym you're like, "What?

495
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,420
 You're not feeding this poor lady?"

496
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:23,120
 Slim gym is a tool you use to pop open car locks.

497
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,120
 Slim gyms.

498
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,400
 I don't even know if that's a term anymore.

499
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,880
 They're pretty illegal to carry unless you work at a auto shop.

500
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,280
 But we used to use them.

501
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,280
 You get a slim gym.

502
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:39,360
 So you imagine that that could happen.

503
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,680
 And what happened was 40 years ago, that young woman locked her keys in her car and she couldn't

504
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:48,400
 get in and some madman buried a hatchet in her neck.

505
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,400
 You don't know.

506
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,980
 I mean, obviously, now you're super paranoid.

507
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,980
 Never someone's talk to you.

508
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,420
 You're like, "Okay, wait.

509
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,740
 Before we continue this conversation, are you a soul of the damned?"

510
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,740
 What?

511
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,740
 And they go, "Yes."

512
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,740
 And they disappear in a puff of smoke.

513
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,740
 You're like, "Ugh."

514
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,220
 It's the third time this day.

515
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,980
 I wonder how often it happens.

516
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:13,620
 Again, we had checks and balances with the Argentina story and with the Vietnam story.

517
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:17,220
 But it's possible that people are interacting with ghosts all the time and they don't know

518
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,220
 it.

519
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:23,840
 But this Vietnam story I love because you have this idea of the ghost spending money,

520
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,520
 spirit money, which is a huge thing in Vietnamese culture.

521
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,520
 You burn it.

522
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,520
 It's not just at the funeral.

523
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,520
 That's a big part of it.

524
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,920
 But it's at the funeral.

525
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:44,120
 It's on the annual memorial of the funeral and the first and the 15th of every month.

526
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,820
 You buy this fake money and you burn it.

527
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:57,100
 And the idea is that you are using it to pay off the debt of the dead or to use it to bribe

528
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:01,340
 the God of the dead to bring you back to life.

529
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,340
 Super interesting ritual.

530
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,700
 I actually have a follow-up story about that.

531
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,700
 I want to save.

532
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,700
 We're running out of time here.

533
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,700
 But it's a fascinating story.

534
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,260
 Can it ghost interact with us?

535
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,140
 That's always the big question.

536
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,520
 How much power do they have on earth?

537
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:18,920
 We have people just walking around houses and you go, "Yeah, I just have a weird feeling

538
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,080
 here when I go in a certain room.

539
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,080
 It's cold."

540
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,080
 And I'm not discounting those.

541
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,280
 I'm not discounting those experiences.

542
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,280
 But I'm just talking about different power levels of ghosts.

543
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,520
 You can be in a house and you go, "No, no, it totally haunted.

544
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,400
 I've never seen anything."

545
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,560
 But trust me, you feel it.

546
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:41,560
 And then you have other ghosts that can appear as just the head floating down the hallway.

547
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,220
 That was a particularly terrifying story.

548
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,220
 Put it in the show notes.

549
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,940
 We also have full body apparitions.

550
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,900
 We have ghosts that can throw things around.

551
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,540
 You see how we have this power level growing?

552
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,540
 But it's super rare.

553
00:29:52,540 --> 00:30:00,220
 I mean, this might be a one-off case where a ghost walks into a mall carrying currency,

554
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:04,420
 which doesn't look all burned up when she hands it to the cashier.

555
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:08,220
 This is a reality warping spirit.

556
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,220
 Fascinating story.

557
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,480
 But there's any truth to it.

558
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:17,120
 This would be one of the most powerful ghosts that we've come across.

559
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,120
 It's very rare.

560
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:22,640
 I know it's popular in movies, but it's very rare that ghosts kill people.

561
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,040
 And this would be even more rare.

562
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:32,040
 A ghost that can exchange currency for goods.

563
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:36,400
 And what really cued them off was the mom saying my daughter's been dead and the refrigerator

564
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,800
 bursting into flames.

565
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:44,800
 If that didn't happen, if those things didn't happen, if she just came in and bought some

566
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:52,360
 watermelons and carried them out and she de-manifest the watermelons, she goes *blows*

567
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:56,260
 No one's gonna watch surveillance footage to see why that woman threw the water.

568
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,980
 They just see some watermelons laying on the ground and some guy would walk out and be

569
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:04,020
 like, "Ah, I need to sweep them up, mop them up, and go about his day."

570
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,060
 On the one hand, this is incredibly rare.

571
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,500
 I've never come across a story like it before.

572
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:15,720
 But on the other hand, this might be fairly common.

573
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,800
 This might happen more often than not.

574
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:22,080
 We just don't have a chain of events where we can look back and go that was a ghost.

575
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,240
 Ghosts could be interacting with us on a daily basis, and they just seem like everyone else

576
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,800
 around us.

577
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,280
 We can't even tell.

578
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,480
 And there's no reason for us to tell that that guy who's standing in front of us to

579
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,160
 get coffee, who gets his coffee and turns around and walks out of the coffee shop, you're

580
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,580
 gonna be like, "I wonder if that guy was dead."

581
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:43,980
 You would have no reason to think anything about that.

582
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,980
 But he was dead.

583
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,540
 He died four years ago.

584
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:51,060
 But he was able to come in and get a hot cup of coffee and walk out.

585
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:54,060
 Just leaves, you never see him again.

586
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:59,060
 Okay, guys, I gotta be honest.

587
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:04,340
 I gotta be honest with you, I'm having a really hard time with indians lately.

588
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,700
 Like I can't even come up with a good spooky indie.

589
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,720
 There was a golden age of indians for Dead Rabbit Radio.

590
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,760
 There was a time where after I got done doing an episode, I was like, "Oh man, that ending

591
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,760
 was dope."

592
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,760
 That was like a little short story.

593
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,760
 Nowadays, it's just a dude walking in coffee.

594
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,760
 That's it.

595
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,760
 That's all I got.

596
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,760
 Oh, Dead Rabbit Radio.

597
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,760
 I gotta figure something out about these indians.

598
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,760
 DeadRabbitRadio@gmail.com is gonna be our email address.

599
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,440
 You can also use it at facebook.com/DeadRabbitRadio.

600
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,440
 Big talk is @DeadRabbitRadio.

601
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,060
 DeadRabbitRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

602
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,460
 You don't have to listen to it every day.

603
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,460
 I'm glad you listened to it today.

604
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,460
 Have a great one.

605
00:32:46,460 --> 00:33:15,460
 Bye.

606
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:25,460
 Bye.

607
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:26,460
 Bye.

608
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:29,040
 (upbeat music)
