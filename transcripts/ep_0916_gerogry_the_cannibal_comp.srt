1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,640
 Which one would you choose? To see a ghost or to not see a ghost but know that it

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:15,160
 sees you? And then we traveled to Coffee County, Tennessee to take a look at the

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:22,280
 story of a local weirdo. Everyone in town knew this guy was nuts but they had no

4
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:29,160
 idea how deeply his dark desires went until the police arrested him for

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,160
 cannibalism. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:44,400
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host

7
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,600
 Jason Carpenter or I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,000
 We got a lot of stuff to cover so we're gonna go ahead and get started right away.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,880
 First off let's give a shout out to one of our Christmas livestream

10
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,920
 contributors. Christmas, I know what's happened six months ago. I got a big list

11
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,960
 I'm trying to get through all of this but there's no rush because all these

12
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,260
 people are awesome right now walking into Dead Rabbit Command is Creole

13
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,760
 Cosmopolitan. Yeah come on give you a big round of applause as you're walking in.

14
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,520
 Sweating, still this heatwave going on. Sorry we'll kick off the AC in Dead

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,520
 Rabbit Command. If you guys can't support the Patreon I totally understand. Just

16
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,400
 help spread the word about the show. That really really helps out a lot. Creole

17
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,240
 Cosmopolitan. Let's go ahead and toss you the bunny bicycle. I like this new

18
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,000
 thing. It's very eco-friendly. It's a good workout. Creole Cosmopolitan.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,560
 Let's give you the bunny bicycle and we're gonna sit on the handlebars. We're

20
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,800
 gonna sit on the handlebars. We'll sit in the little basket. Got a baseball card

21
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:45,360
 stuck in the spokes. Pedal us all the way out to Tempe, Arizona in this heatwave.

22
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,960
 Pedaling us on out. I need to come up with a better sound effect. It's always just

23
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,440
 the sound of someone panting. Tempe, Arizona. We're going back in time. We're

24
00:01:53,440 --> 00:02:00,120
 in the early 1900s and back then on 24th West Fifth Street and Mill Avenue was

25
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,960
 the Mountain Bell Phone Company. This building still exists today. You don't

26
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,480
 have to have a time machine to enjoy this story. 24th West Fifth Street and Mill

27
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,400
 Avenue was the Mountain Bell Phone Company. It was a two-story building and

28
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,040
 phone company, right? So back then like phones were just invented. It would be

29
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,200
 like working at Google nowadays. You're like, "Whoa dude this is so awesome. This

30
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,360
 is brand new technology." You're plugging stuff in and listening in on people's

31
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,480
 phone calls like you're the operator from He-Ha and I'm sure it was more

32
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,320
 professional than the He-Ha lady. But the reason why we're at this building is

33
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,400
 because the story goes this is how this legend starts. Do we know this young

34
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,800
 woman's name or any of the details? No. But back in the 1900s when it was Mountain

35
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,600
 Bell Phone Company a young woman reportedly killed herself. She took her

36
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,800
 life on the second floor of this building near one of the restrooms. Now

37
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,880
 fast forward, fast forward over time it stops being the Mountain Bell Phone

38
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:07,000
 Company. The building changes hands and it becomes a retail shop called Trail. Now

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,720
 when it's this retail store called Trail, now we're in the modern days. We're no

40
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,040
 longer in like sepia-toned cowboy hats and He-Ha operators. People have cell

41
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,640
 phones and people drive cars and stuff like that. We're in modern times. There's

42
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:25,240
 a retail store called Trail and they only use the first story of the building.

43
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,240
 They had no use for the second floor but you know you're not gonna just be like

44
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,760
 "I'll never go up there guys, knock it down." People reported hearing someone

45
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:40,640
 walking around upstairs on this abandoned second floor. You'd hear

46
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,520
 footsteps. Now there was still a staircase leading up there and sometimes

47
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,140
 people would go up there. I'm assuming you I'm surprised they didn't use it for

48
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,360
 some sort of storage area and they may have put some stuff up there because

49
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,520
 people did go up there from time to time to get stuff but it doesn't say that

50
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,380
 they're up there every day or didn't say how often people are going up there but

51
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,920
 you'd hear footsteps coming from up there. At times you knew there should be

52
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,400
 nobody up there. Then people would go up there occasionally and they would see

53
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:17,520
 her ghost. They would see her ghost kind of wandering up and down the stairs

54
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,780
 which is terrifying right because this is old building it's not like you can take

55
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:27,740
 the elevator. I don't know how many staircases they have. Probably one and

56
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,980
 you're walking up the stairs. Imagine that's so creepy. Imagine walking up

57
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,140
 the stairs and getting a box or something like that and then as you're

58
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:41,140
 walking down you see a ghost walking up the stairs. Where are you gonna go?

59
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:46,860
 You can run around in the second story but that's where she's going. You're

60
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,120
 trapped. You can't go down the stairs because there's a ghost there. I consider

61
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,280
 myself fairly brave when it comes to paranormal. You're the biggest

62
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,880
 scaredy cat. Monday you said you were afraid to turn into a tree. Well that's

63
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,560
 because that's spooky but if I was walking down a hole what would I do if I was

64
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,240
 walking down a hallway because I've seen shadow people and demonically

65
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,560
 possessed people and all that stuff. If I was walking down a hallway and I saw

66
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,400
 okay that's why I would turn around. I would probably observe it for a while and

67
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,760
 then I'd get out of there. I don't think I would try walking past the ghost. Maybe

68
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,500
 if it's a sexy ghost I might like walk up to it and start hitting it up. Hey what's

69
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,580
 up? Where are you going? But even in those cases I probably would run away

70
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:31,100
 because it's super spooky. It's a ghost. It's spooky. So full body apparition.

71
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,140
 Walking up the stairs. You're trying to walk down the stairs. You are now trying

72
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,300
 to figure out a way. You're looking for a fire escape to get out and then imagine

73
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,540
 if someone sent you to go upstairs and you open the door and you saw her at the

74
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:45,020
 top of the stairs walking. I'd be like dude I will go get whatever you want up

75
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,120
 there but we're gonna have to wait a while because I'm pretty sure I just saw

76
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,640
 a ghost at the top of the stairs. She might turn me into a tree. This happened

77
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,720
 a few times over the course that Trails was a retail store. Trails is no longer

78
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:03,000
 there. Now it's a restaurant called Sunbar Tempe. You'd have this staircase

79
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,440
 and you would be walking up the stairs or walking down the stairs and you'd see

80
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,160
 you're also walking stairs but there were also times that's creepy enough

81
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,120
 right because that's affecting you. This is where I get to would you rather

82
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,940
 see a ghost or know a ghost is watching you. A couple times people were upstairs

83
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,860
 getting stuff doing whatever they needed to do there and when they were coming

84
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:25,740
 back down the stairs they saw the ghost of this woman is standing at the bottom

85
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:34,060
 of the stairs staring at the door that leads into the first floor. Just staring

86
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:40,860
 at it. And this happened so many times and this was reported so many times they

87
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:46,680
 just boarded up the door leading to the second floor and then completely covered

88
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,000
 it up. Apparently it was just a wall at a certain point because you would have...

89
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,800
 that's terrifying to me. Like as I'm recording this you know I have all these

90
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:02,200
 doors around me. I'm recording this and imagine that there's a ghost in my

91
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,480
 bedroom staring at me but I can't see it. Like what is really creepy or if I turn

92
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,500
 in my bedroom door is open and I can see a ghost standing there. It's a sexy ghost

93
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,820
 and I'll be there in a second honey. Or to know that it's trying to get to me but

94
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,460
 it can't. It's just like waiting and watching. Imagine if behind a closed door

95
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:26,540
 near you there's a ghost. I can hear your voices you're talking and it's waiting

96
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:31,660
 to get to you. Like it's observing you. And this this was so unsettling

97
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,460
 before you know the ghost is walking up and downstairs they're like "Larry you

98
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,840
 still got to go there and get the new stock. Got to go up there and get those

99
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,360
 boxes." But when the ghost is just staring at the door downstairs like

100
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,120
 plotting or planning or waiting who knows who... see that's the thing you don't

101
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:54,920
 know they boarded it up. Now I did go... I didn't actually visit it in person but I

102
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,320
 did look up Sunbar Tempe online. I like went to Google Earth to kind of take a

103
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,160
 look at it. It doesn't look like it has a second story anymore. It actually looks

104
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,820
 like it's a one-story building but that's the same address. So I mean this

105
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:10,580
 building was built in the 1900s and now it's like a hip dining spot in

106
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:15,180
 Tempe Arizona. I don't think they wanted to have a big rectangular building that's

107
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,260
 the color beige. So they may have actually eventually torn it down but one

108
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,220
 thing we've learned over the course of this show is that just because you tear

109
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:27,100
 down a location doesn't mean the ghost goes away. There's tons of reports of

110
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:31,860
 mansions being burned down. We've done stories where a second floor of a

111
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,280
 building it was like a college. I think it was the third floor of a dormitory was

112
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,160
 knocked down and people can still hear the ghosts but it's like 10 feet in the

113
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:45,560
 air like above the roof of the sea. If you're on the roof you can hear the

114
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:51,680
 voices coming from above you somewhere. Just because the phenomenon... just because

115
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,440
 the building is destroyed doesn't mean the phenomenon is gone. However I did not

116
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,700
 see any online ghost reports about Sunbar Tempe. But if you're in the Tempe

117
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,480
 area we got listeners all over the world and I'm always so grateful for that. You

118
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,000
 guys are amazing. And if you do happen to be in the Tempe area go to... this was a

119
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,200
 stealth ad. This whole thing was leading up to Sunbar Tempe, the hippinist

120
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:18,360
 hoppinist place in Tempe Arizona. If you want to be like me dead rabbit hop on

121
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,240
 over to Sunbar Tempe and order the new drink. Order the possessed

122
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,920
 the goblet. It's all smoky and stuff. You'll drink it and it's so strong you'll

123
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,020
 wish you were dead. Sunbar Tempe in Tempe Arizona. I've never been there. Their

124
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,180
 food makes suck. I don't know. Maybe it's the best place to go but anyways go there

125
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:42,780
 and see if there's ghosts. That's what I do when I go to places. I go "hey is this

126
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:47,380
 place haunted?" I do it all the time. And people with me are like "oh my god" because

127
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:51,740
 they know I'm gonna bring it up and people are constantly like "yeah there's a

128
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,660
 Thai house restaurant called Thai house here in Hood River haunted. There's like

129
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:01,580
 a little girl upstairs because it used to be a house. Then they turned into a

130
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,120
 restaurant. Andrew's Pizza downtown. I have a bunch of friends who worked there

131
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,760
 haunted. They named the ghost Tabatha. Used to be a dance studio which we know

132
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:16,520
 again in the world of paranormal. Very very common. Very very common to have

133
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:21,440
 theaters and dance studios and places of the arts to be haunted. I actually want

134
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,040
 to start doing some on the ground ghost hunting with my friend Molly in town

135
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,220
 again. It's been years since I've done on the town ghost hunting but that should be

136
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:34,060
 fun. We'll talk more about that when I'm actually doing that but yeah. I ask when

137
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,300
 places are haunted "hey is this place haunted?" So yeah I do that. I mean even if I

138
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,700
 don't know anyone who works there like as they're bringing me my check. Like "hey is

139
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,580
 this place haunted?" It doesn't hurt to ask. They've already served you your

140
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,860
 food. They can't spit in it. But yeah so if you happen to be in the tempe area

141
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,580
 check out Sunbar Tempe and ask "hey is this place haunted?" and then your waitress

142
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,640
 is like "no of course not" and then you tip her and then she walks away. She walks up

143
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,680
 a set of invisible stairs and then your real waitress shows up. She's like "uh

144
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,360
 where's my money?" and you're like "nooo!" Sunbar Tempe the only place where a ghost

145
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,080
 will steal your tips. Creole Cosmopolitan let's go ahead and toss you the keys to

146
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,160
 the carboner copter. We're leaving behind Sunbar Tempe. We have full bellies from

147
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,880
 their delicious meal be it breakfast lunch or dinner. Sunbar Tempe the only

148
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,460
 restaurant you should ever go to. Fly us out of here. We're headed all the way out

149
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:31,780
 to Coffee County Tennessee. Don't actually go there for breakfast. I don't know when

150
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:35,360
 the place is open. You're like "what Jason told me you guys served breakfast?"

151
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,780
 Breakfast. Breakfast. They're like "what are all of these people coming here all of a sudden?"

152
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,620
 I traveled from around the world. I'm from El Salvador just to eat some

153
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:48,980
 staking eggs. We're headed out to Coffee County Tennessee. We're headed back to the

154
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:58,480
 year 2014. It's June 6th 2014 and there's a liquor store in town and waiting for a

155
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:05,600
 ride is Lisa Marie Heiter. She's 36 years old and she's a mother of six. Her

156
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,200
 life has not been easy. Things have been really hard. She struggled with alcoholism

157
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,600
 for a long time. That is not only a debilitating mental strain but a

158
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,940
 debilitating physical strain. She's having all of these emotional problems

159
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:26,580
 and alcohol problems and like what often happens in the world of alcoholics is

160
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,780
 that the family loves you and they will always love you but at a certain point

161
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:35,860
 they got to back off. They got to say "listen I love you and I'll always be here

162
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,740
 for you but I won't be here for you. This is just too much of a strain on us."

163
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:45,420
 That's what's kind of going on in her life. She's married to a man named Charles

164
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:51,120
 and she'd been married to him for six years and in this time period June 6

165
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,600
 2014 he's like "I can't do this anymore. I can't be a part of an

166
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:05,440
 alcoholic's life." To make things worse she worked at a liquor store which I

167
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:12,200
 just I mean that just sounds like the worst combination and recently she had

168
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:20,420
 been told by her doctors that she had ovarian cancer. So she has ovarian cancer.

169
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:24,100
 She has six kids to take care of. She's recently gotten divorced.

170
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:30,460
 I've married that last for six years and she refuses treatment. She tells the

171
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,020
 doctors "I don't want to do any of the chemo. I don't want to do any other

172
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:37,940
 treatment." The doctors say "listen you got six months to live like that's our

173
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:42,360
 estimate." Sometimes they're wrong right? Sometimes they're wrong. It's not like

174
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,040
 they actually can see a expiration date on you. It's kind of a guess. Some people

175
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,320
 live way past that. In her case though the doctors do say "you have six months to

176
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,800
 live if you're gonna refuse treatment and you know they understand why people

177
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:59,320
 don't do the treatment because it can be very taxing on the body." She's making

178
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,880
 her peace with this right? Even though her and Charles are divorced

179
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,660
 Charles said "you know I still helped her out." Because he loved her right? They

180
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,780
 still loved each other but they just couldn't be together. Charles couldn't

181
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:16,540
 do it anymore and you I understand that. I think most of us can understand it.

182
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:24,060
 Well on June 6th 2014 Lisa called up Charles and says "hey I need to ride home.

183
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,580
 I'm at the liquor store. I need to ride home." And Charles is actually in another

184
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:32,420
 state. I'm doing a job but I'll be there around 4 30. She's calling pretty early

185
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:36,520
 in like the mid morning. He goes "it's about a five-hour trip. I'll be there by

186
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:41,680
 4 30 p.m." And she goes "yeah sure okay you know I can wait. You can come pick me up."

187
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:47,520
 Well later that afternoon Charles calls her cell phone and it goes straight to

188
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,240
 voicemail. Is the phone turned off? Did she shut her off or something?

189
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,720
 Again when you're dealing with someone who suffers from alcoholism they can be

190
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,760
 a little erratic. But she's not at the liquor store. She's not there to be

191
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,660
 picked up. And again maybe she walked. Maybe someone else gave her a ride. I

192
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:12,020
 don't know. And the fact that Charles was a couple hours away. The fact that he

193
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:19,580
 couldn't get there until 4 30 p.m. that day haunts him to this day. He said quote

194
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:25,580
 "I still blame myself because I didn't go get her. But I was down in Huntsville,

195
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:30,180
 Huntsville, Alabama. I was down in Huntsville unloading my truck and I wish

196
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:35,160
 I could have been there a little bit faster. Usually I rescue her every time

197
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:43,560
 something goes wrong." Let's take a look at another resident of Coffee County,

198
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:49,480
 Tennessee. A man everyone knew in town is a big old weirdo. This wasn't one of

199
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,280
 those "oh he was a nice quiet guy and never suspected it." This is one of those

200
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:59,040
 "oh yeah that that makes sense. This seems like the type of guy who would do

201
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,580
 something like this. This man's name is Gregory Hale. Back in 2014 he's 37 years

202
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:09,340
 old. He's living with his parents. His parents had they were both retired. They

203
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:14,740
 owned this house and Gregory Hale lived with him. Had a girlfriend, had a kid, and

204
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:24,700
 had very very bizarre hobbies. To put it lightly. He worked at a local meat plant.

205
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,140
 A local meat packing plant. So he's like sitting there and there's like meat

206
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:32,000
 coming down a conveyor belt and he's like stamping it and wrapping it up and

207
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,040
 touching it rubbing it all over his skin and they're like "Gregrie you're supposed

208
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,560
 to be in this part. You're in human resources. Why are you in the

209
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:46,160
 meat assembly line?" He worked at this meat packing plant and everyone there

210
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,680
 knew he was a total freak. Everyone there thought this guy was a weirdo. He

211
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,320
 would smuggle just from the way that he talked. Just from the way that he looked.

212
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,120
 He's one of those guys that has a large collection of knives. He would take

213
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,700
 Facebook photos of him like dressed in all black with a red tie and a bone

214
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:07,300
 sword and then he had the same outfit. He's like wearing like new balance shoes

215
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:13,580
 and black jeans and a black shirt and then a slipknot mask and he's holding

216
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:18,100
 this bone sword. He's standing in front of like a garage. Like not a cool spooky

217
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:23,380
 garage from Dead by Daylight. Like your grandma's garage. Like the garage on a

218
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:29,200
 house. Just like a normal tract house. He's lame right? He did all this stuff. He

219
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:35,640
 would post stuff on Facebook saying "I like to hug the people I hate so I know

220
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:41,960
 how big to dig the hole in my backyard." You know what's so funny is that I've seen

221
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,760
 stuff like that a hundred times from a hundred try-hards right? People are trying

222
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:51,000
 to be like all goth and edgy and stuff like that. I will say this guy does turn

223
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,900
 out to be the real deal. Even though I'm kind of rolling my eyes at whoa look how

224
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:59,880
 edgy that is man. He actually does. The reason we're talking about an archery

225
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:06,180
 crime podcast is because he does walk the walk. He posts jokes like "If you ate a

226
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:11,860
 vegetarian would they taste..." This is actually kind of funny. I've been trying to read it without laughing.

227
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:17,100
 He goes "If you ate a vegetarian would they taste like soy? Like soy meat? Like

228
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:22,320
 impossible burgers?" Okay that's kind of funny right? I would have given that a

229
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,240
 little thumbs up or laughing emoji but he would talk about stuff like that. He'd

230
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,380
 post pictures of Richard Ramirez the night stalker with captions that said

231
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:37,440
 "Wish I could have met you." And the biggest crime there is that he spelt you.

232
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,080
 It's just the letter you right? I don't think Richard Ramirez was into emoji

233
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,960
 talk. But anyways wish I could have met you. He talked a lot about Richard Ramirez

234
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:52,180
 the night stalker serial killer back in the 70s. California late 70s. He would

235
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:57,140
 often get caught stealing from the meatpacking plant. Now you could imagine

236
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,540
 some people are like "Oh dude I really need to eat today. I'm gonna take home

237
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:05,460
 this pound of prime rib." You probably get fired for that. He was stealing bones

238
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:11,220
 and eyeballs. And I'm sure that the manager was kind of like "Well it's not

239
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,260
 like we're gonna use those anyways. That's Oscar Meyer plant down the road.

240
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:18,580
 That's how they make their hot dogs." But here what am I gonna do with an animal

241
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:24,280
 bone or an eyeball? So sure if this guy wants to take home a bag of eyeballs each

242
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,680
 day I mean it's weird right? They knew it was weird but I don't think they're

243
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:32,360
 really punishing him. But he does get fired eventually. The manager does get

244
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:38,920
 tired of this dude's antics but not for stealing animal waste. Not for posting

245
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:44,080
 bizarre stuff on Facebook. Not for worshiping Richard Ramirez. Worse!

246
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,940
 Everyone knew about all that stuff and he's still gonna get fired. One day this

247
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,060
 is a fireable offense. And maybe in America you could have probably, well this

248
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,940
 wasn't America. He probably could have had a civil rights lawsuit over this for

249
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:03,220
 the First Amendment. One day the boss walked in to work and there is Gregory

250
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:10,620
 Hale with animal guts performing a satanic ceremony at work. And the boss

251
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:16,760
 is like nope I'm done. If he still wants to take this lawsuit I'm willing to fight

252
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:21,760
 that battle. I'm not gonna allow you to try to summon the Dark Lord at work

253
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,960
 using all this blood and animal guts that happen to be laying around. You're

254
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:32,640
 fired. You are no longer working here. Now you can imagine like this must have been

255
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,720
 his dream job right? This dude loves serial killing and he's in a place like

256
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,300
 his Willy Wonka Chaka Factory. He walks in there's blood everywhere. He's like

257
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,840
 dancing on a pile of eyeballs. He's juggling them. He has a cane made out of

258
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,300
 a bone. This would be awesome for a sicko. There's a bunch of people listening to this

259
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,620
 at a meatpacking plant right now. They're like shut it off. He just insulted our

260
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:59,420
 entire profession. They're throwing blood at the Bluetooth speaker. Gregory Hale is

261
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:04,620
 fired from the meatpacking plant. And you know what he's whatever he's just kind

262
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:13,320
 of gliding through life anyways right? Well on June 6th 2014, Gregory Hale pulls

263
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:18,440
 up outside of a liquor store in Coffey County, Tennessee and sees Lisa Marie

264
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,520
 standing there. And they chat for a while and she talks about waiting for a ride

265
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,800
 and he goes you know what I can give you a ride home. Not a problem. She's like

266
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:36,860
 sure he's like yeah yeah hop in. Take you on out there. June 9th 2014. So three days

267
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:42,960
 later. And just to show okay so she has now disappeared and it doesn't really say

268
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,720
 in the article that there's a big manhunt for her. She was supposed to be picked up

269
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,420
 on June 6th. It's three days later. She's disappeared. And this is one of the

270
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:55,380
 problems with someone who has like drug and alcohol problems right? Is because

271
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:00,320
 they act in erratic ways. When they go missing for a couple days it's not the

272
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,760
 same thing as if you went missing. Like let's say you go you have like a good

273
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,160
 attendance at work. You're always there on your Monday starting your shift at a

274
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:13,040
 meatpacking plant. You're like oh I want to get the freshest eyeballs. I got to get

275
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,320
 there nice and early. When you go missing when I go missing I have like

276
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,880
 really good attendance right? And so when I stop showing up to work I get a phone

277
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,940
 call. Like where are you? The search for me would start almost immediately. But you

278
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,180
 know when you have someone who's suffering from it she probably has just

279
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:35,340
 not shown up to work and things like that. They may have been looking for her

280
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,300
 but we don't know about that. And the reason why that's important is because

281
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:43,380
 there's a chance that Gregory could have gone away with this. Because it was

282
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:49,140
 completely random that he drove up to that liquor store. And random crimes are

283
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,560
 very very hard to solve. I'm not saying that he never would have got caught but

284
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:59,520
 it's possible. But on June 9th 2014 now we're near the town of Manchester, Tennessee

285
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,640
 Gregory Hale is chatting with his neighbor. He's like hey yeah what's going

286
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,320
 on how's everything going? They're like oh you're going good with me Gregory. If you

287
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,680
 found a new job yet and he's like no apparently I went to the bank hoping it

288
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,280
 was a blood bank. I put in my application. It was a regular bank. What do you expect

289
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,820
 me to do there? And the neighbors like to it on your Facebook friend. I know what

290
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,800
 you post. Maybe you should just try getting a normal job and posting minions

291
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:29,340
 on your Facebook page instead of love poems to serial killers. Anyways Gregory

292
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,700
 Hale is talking to his neighbor and Gregory goes hey you know what I was

293
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,620
 wondering if he could help me with something. The neighbors like yeah sure

294
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:39,500
 you know what do you need? And Gregory Hale goes could you help me dispose of a

295
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:46,460
 body? And at first the neighbor thinks that he's joking right? People say stuff

296
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,180
 like that all the time. But the neighbor starts to realize that oh Gregory's not

297
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:54,840
 joking like he's actually asking me if I can help him dispose of a body. He

298
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,200
 contacts the police. It's so funny because if you think about people who would say

299
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,580
 that to you in your life hey you want to help me dispose of a body a lot of times

300
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:06,380
 you would think it was a joke. But this guy knew Gregory's reputation and knew

301
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,620
 this guy wasn't joking. He's being dead serious. He called the police. The police

302
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:14,500
 show up at Gregory's location and again I don't even know if they know Lisa

303
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,780
 Marie's missing at this point. They may have it's been three days but who knows.

304
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:25,820
 They show up at Gregory's house and they find the dismembered remains of Lisa

305
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:33,380
 Marie. And she was chopped up in such a way that there were two plastic buckets

306
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:42,140
 full of different parts of her and her torso was on a burn pile. It's very hard

307
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:47,540
 to burn a body. My dad used to have a crematory. My summer job for a while was

308
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:51,140
 going down there helping him out. It takes a lot. It's an extreme amount of heat. It

309
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:55,060
 takes to reduce a human body to ash. A lot of people think oh you know just like

310
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,420
 a marshmallow throw it on a fire. Uh-uh. I know you guys see in those Viking

311
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:02,060
 movies they burn them on the pyre. You're watching the Northman. They're just

312
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:05,220
 constantly burned. Everyone gets killed in that movie. They're constantly burning

313
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:10,420
 bodies and as a religious thing sure but to actually reduce it to ash there's no

314
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:16,740
 evidence left. It just doesn't. You can do it but it takes a lot of heat. Now when

315
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:21,140
 they the police show up like they find this stuff before they're even talking

316
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,780
 to Gregory. They show on the property and they see these two buckets of human

317
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:28,420
 remains. They're just kind of like sitting out. This torso on the burn pile

318
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:33,820
 and they go into the house and Gregory is taking a nap. He was completely

319
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:38,420
 unconcerned that he asked his neighbor if he could help him bury a body. He's

320
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:42,620
 like oh well guess he doesn't want to be buried in a body. That made me sleepy. And

321
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:48,700
 it is after the police wake him up from his nappy time. He confesses that he

322
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,380
 killed Lisa Marie and he fully reveals to the officers that not only did he

323
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:57,540
 kill Lisa Marie not only did he dismember her but he ate parts of her as

324
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:05,500
 well. Now he says that during this whole time the kidnapping, the murder, the

325
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:10,740
 cannibalism, there was a satanic ritual performed and there's no details in any

326
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:16,060
 of the articles of what the ritual was. I have a feeling this guy was a YouTube

327
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:20,460
 Satanist. So he's one of those guys that just watches a couple YouTube videos

328
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:24,300
 and thinking those all of the esoteric knowledge out there that involves

329
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:29,580
 Satan worshipping and Lucifer and the dark ones. I don't think he really knew

330
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:33,540
 what he was doing. He probably just painted... I don't know why he painted... I'm painting this

331
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:39,740
 guy as a tryhard loser but and he is not saying that. He's exceptional because he

332
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:44,420
 murdered someone. He's not. He's a monster but there's a lot of tryhards out there

333
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:47,940
 in the world of Satanism. Really in every religion but they kind of stick

334
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,500
 out in Satanism because they're just doing the tryhard type of stuff. Dressing

335
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:56,500
 in all black clothes, they got it Kmart and holding a bone sword. They bought

336
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:01,100
 online and it's somehow that's supposed to make them these edgy people. So I don't

337
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:06,140
 know if this guy actually performed the ritual that was written down in the dark

338
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:11,020
 grimoires from the 1500s or if he just saw something on YouTube and thought

339
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:15,540
 that looks cool and painted a pentagram. Again, it doesn't really matter. He did

340
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:24,180
 murder and eat a woman and yeah he just... there's a classification the FBI

341
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:29,980
 uses for serial killers. Now this guy's only killed one person but it's... he

342
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:33,980
 probably would have killed more had he been a little smarter. It's called... they

343
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:38,660
 have an organized killer which would be someone like Ted Bundy who plans

344
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:43,860
 everything out and then they have a disorganized killer which is someone

345
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:48,300
 like the Vampire of Sacramento who was walking around breaking into people's

346
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,100
 houses. He actually wasn't really technically breaking in. He'd walk up

347
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,660
 to your house and if your door was unlocked, this is back in the 1970s, if your

348
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:58,260
 door was unlocked that was God giving him permission to murder everyone in the

349
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:05,100
 house. I had a really good friend of mine in college. He was in the neighborhood

350
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,820
 where the Vampire of Sacramento had eaten the baby, walked in and killed a

351
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:15,020
 woman and the woman was babysitting and ate a baby, drank all the baby's blood

352
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:20,580
 and he said that happened. He goes, "I actually... it was... if I remember correctly

353
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:26,620
 there was a babysitter and her son..." like I'm trying to remember the details.

354
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:29,700
 There was a babysitter, there was like a six-year-old boy that was the babysitter's

355
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:37,540
 son and that woman was watching an infant at the time and my buddy went over to

356
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:41,140
 the house to see if the kid wanted to go play because it was a friend of his. "Hey

357
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,700
 you want to go play?" and he knocked on the door and no one came into the door and

358
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:48,700
 he goes, "I guess my friend's not home." And he left and it turns out that while he

359
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:54,700
 was knocking on that door, the killer was inside the house and when the cops get

360
00:28:54,700 --> 00:29:00,540
 to the house, they find a dead mom, they find her dead kid and they are not even

361
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:04,180
 looking for a baby at that point. Someone came up and goes, "Oh my god, is my baby

362
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:08,260
 okay?" and the cops are like, "Uh... because there was no baby there. He was

363
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:12,180
 actually the vampire of Sacramento." I forgot what his name was. Let me look it

364
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:17,300
 up real quick. Richard Chase. Richard Chase, if I remember correctly, he was caught

365
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:24,220
 like walking down Watt Avenue covered in blood and he had the remains of a baby

366
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:28,940
 in a bucket just like sitting in his house and and the FBI has steadied him

367
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:33,300
 as a disorganized serial killer because he didn't plan anything out and he

368
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:37,980
 really wasn't thinking, "Oh, I might get caught." So he just walked around covered

369
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:42,060
 in blood, walked in and out of houses and he took the baby with him and ate it,

370
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:47,100
 ate a good portion of it and drank his blood and all that stuff. So that's what

371
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:51,980
 I would classify Gregory as well, a disorganized serial killer because he

372
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:55,140
 just had the body... he was trying to dispose of the body. He had the body

373
00:29:55,140 --> 00:30:00,740
 parts just in buckets and Lisa Marie's heart, he threw it over into a neighbor's

374
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:06,540
 yard and landed in her garden. Like obviously you're gonna find... I mean

375
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:11,740
 obviously you're gonna notice that doesn't belong here. That looks like a human heart.

376
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:17,700
 So very very disorganized in his way he was doing. I mean luckily, right? Luckily

377
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,740
 he was an idiot and it turns out, right, this wasn't a spur-of-the-moment thing as

378
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:28,380
 the police are investigating him and all that. He revealed that for a long time he

379
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:32,940
 had fantasized about killing and eating someone. This guy's a father too, remember?

380
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:37,420
 The beginning this guy lives with his parents or lived in his parents' home.

381
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,100
 Maybe they weren't there. I think they probably would have been a little alarmed

382
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,460
 at his antics but he lived at his parents' home. I believe they all live

383
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:48,360
 together but that... some of the details on this story I couldn't verify. But he

384
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,500
 does have a child of his own. He has a girlfriend. He had spent years fantasizing

385
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:58,300
 about killing and eating somebody and he had actually practiced stalking women

386
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:04,780
 before. He would follow women around and he would fantasize about how it would be

387
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:09,420
 to capture them and kill them and eat them. That was always his desire. And when

388
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:13,420
 he drove up to the slicker store and saw Lisa Marie waiting for a ride, it was

389
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:18,860
 just a crime of opportunity. He goes, "Here's my chance." She got in the car and

390
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:23,660
 he didn't take her home. He took her back to his house.

391
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:28,100
 So he's been sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. He's already

392
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:33,500
 in the prison system. They'll never let him out. That's the story of Gregory Hale

393
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:42,340
 and his victim, Lisa Marie Heider. What a terrible tragic story, right? I mean, she

394
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,820
 knew she didn't have much longer to live. She knew that she had only been given

395
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:50,060
 six months but that's six months she could have spent with her kids. That's

396
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:57,660
 six more months on earth. But she never would have guessed that she wouldn't die

397
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:05,580
 from cancer but that she would be eaten. She would be killed and eaten as part of

398
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:13,100
 a satanic ceremony. And the scariest thing about this story is we know. We know

399
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:19,900
 that Gregory Hale, although rare, is not one of a kind. I mean, I just off the top

400
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:24,100
 of my head were rattleing off facts about the vampire of Sacramento, Richard

401
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:30,060
 Chase. People who fantasize about eating people and doing it. People who fantasize

402
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:34,940
 about killing people and eating them and getting away with it. You know, this guy

403
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:40,860
 luckily got caught. But how many others are out there? Not only already doing

404
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:45,540
 this and getting away with it, but just also the young men sitting around

405
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:50,860
 fantasizing about this. How many cannibals have we covered on this

406
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:58,620
 podcast? A lot! A surprising amount of cannibals. I'll put the episodes in the

407
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:04,380
 show notes. I don't want to hear those. I don't want to hear this one. Insane.

408
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,580
 Absolutely terrifying to think that there are other people out there like him

409
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:15,460
 right now fantasizing about eating people and some of them may have already

410
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,820
 taken that step. How do you protect yourself? How do you protect your loved

411
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:26,180
 ones against the man who has spent years fantasizing about killing them? Killing

412
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:33,300
 you? Like we just go about our day and we have our safety radar on, right? We're

413
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:37,660
 kind of aware of our environment to a certain extent and watching for trouble.

414
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:42,340
 Maybe we keep some sort of self-defense item on us, but there's someone behind me

415
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:48,980
 who spends day after day after day after day of what it would be like to kill and

416
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:54,500
 eat me. Someone who's run every scenario through their head, if the person does

417
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,300
 this, I'll do this. If the person says that, I'll say this. If the person tries to run,

418
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,540
 I'll do this. If the person runs and falls, I'll do that. And they've played out all

419
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:07,420
 these scenarios in their head and they're sexually aroused by it. I'm expecting to

420
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:13,900
 fight insane homeless people and dumb kids who don't understand that they

421
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:20,620
 shouldn't pick a fight with an adult. Some teenager malden off. Like that's where

422
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:30,140
 my fight experience comes from basically. Drunks, stupid teenagers, and crazy people.

423
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:37,620
 Like just, you know, like not this crazy. Random violence is the type of

424
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:41,540
 fights that I've been in and that's the type of fights that I expect and that's

425
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:48,260
 the type of fights I know how to, if not win, survive. But I've never gone up

426
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:53,780
 against someone who spent day after day after day after day trying to eat me,

427
00:34:53,780 --> 00:35:00,900
 stalking me, observing me, and then going home and sexually fantasizing about

428
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:06,020
 what it would be like to eat me. Right now there's a listener on this podcast. He's like,

429
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:10,860
 "Oh man, you totally, we have a soul bond. That's exactly what I want to do." It's

430
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:14,260
 like, how do you fight against something? How do you fight against someone who's

431
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:22,780
 obsessed with this level of depravity? It's terrifying to think about. So we don't.

432
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:30,380
 We try not to think about it. We just go on with our lives. But people like Gregory

433
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:38,460
 and people like Richard Chase exist. And while those people have been caught, how

434
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:49,460
 many more are out there watching you, stalking you, fantasizing about you, and

435
00:35:49,460 --> 00:36:02,540
 each day their hunger grows. And at that point you're not fighting a man.

436
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:09,540
 You're fighting a monster.
