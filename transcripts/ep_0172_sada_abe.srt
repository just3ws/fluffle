1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
 A ghost points out his murderers to a group of assassins.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,680
 And then we take a look at the story of Sada Abe.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:19,680
 Part-time prostitute, part-time restaurant employee, all-time one of Japan's most notorious

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,480
 criminals today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:32,480
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,480
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,480
 I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,080
 I hope you are having a great day too.

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,160
 We got a lot of stuff to cover today, so we're just going to jump right into it.

10
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,480
 But I want to say, hope you guys are having a happy Monday.

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,800
 Or if you're listening to this episode in the future, I hope you're having a happy

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,800
 blank day.

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,960
 Let's go ahead and move on to our first story though, and that is going to be the story

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,040
 of Wong.

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,880
 We don't have his first name.

16
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,880
 That might be his first name.

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:04,160
 But there's not a lot of details to the personal who Wong was, but it's an interesting story

18
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,160
 and on the lesson, we'll kind of dig into it a little deeper.

19
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,160
 A little deeper.

20
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,840
 Because I think there's some, I have some questions about it debunking-wise, but it's

21
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,080
 still an interesting story.

22
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,160
 Hold on.

23
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:18,520
 The year?

24
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,520
 The early 1900s.

25
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:29,800
 It's a little saloon town.

26
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,800
 Beautiful women.

27
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,800
 We'll back for them.

28
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,280
 They're probably really gross thinking about it now.

29
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,760
 But you had saloon town.

30
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:41,520
 You had Rootin Tootin saloons, gun slingers, but mostly gold miners in this town.

31
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,200
 We're in the town of Whiskey Flat.

32
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,400
 It's this little town in California.

33
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,280
 Okay, enough of the music.

34
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,440
 But anyways, we're in the town of Whiskey Flat.

35
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,080
 And there we find a young man named Wong.

36
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,880
 He's a Chinese cook.

37
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,880
 He's a cook who happened to be Chinese, I guess would be a better way to say that.

38
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,120
 He wasn't making Chinese food.

39
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,640
 He was making Chinese food for, I mean, he was making food for miners.

40
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,000
 Not little kids, but he was making food for miners.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 You know what I'm saying?

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Gold miners.

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 So early 1900s.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,200
 Little kids may have ate it.

45
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,000
 I don't know.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,080
 Well, one day he's making dinner and a white woman comes in and starts making moves on

47
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,680
 him and he's like, "No, I'm good.

48
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,160
 I'm kind of busy right now.

49
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,200
 Plus you're really, really drunk.

50
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,120
 So I'm going to kind of say no to this."

51
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,520
 And she's still kind of like coming on a woman.

52
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,880
 He's like, "No, listen, I have no means no."

53
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,720
 And the white woman leaves.

54
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,080
 And she tells these five loggers nearby that Wong had raped her.

55
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,000
 Now I got to say this as an aside.

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,440
 How, it's been 20, 30 years since I'm 42.

57
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,280
 So it's been a long time since I've been in school and especially like high school, middle

58
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,280
 school.

59
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,840
 How do they, do they, first question, do they still teach to kill a mockingbird in school?

60
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,560
 And two, how do they teach that part of it?

61
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,600
 Because a huge part of that is the white woman making up the rape allegation.

62
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,000
 Like how do they teach that today?

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 But you know, it did happen.

64
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,840
 It did happen where a white woman would accuse an ethnic minority of rape and then, never

65
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,040
 had a good result.

66
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,320
 Never had a good result.

67
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,880
 So she points him out and says, "That guy raped me."

68
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,720
 And these five loggers, they go.

69
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,560
 So the five men walk into the Chinese, not Chinese restaurant.

70
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,720
 The five men walk into the kitchen and they grab the cook and they pull him out.

71
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,720
 They string him up and they hang him.

72
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,080
 They lynch him.

73
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,760
 And then they go into the kitchen and eat his food that he was making for them.

74
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,520
 Very, very cold blooded.

75
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,520
 Very, very cold blooded.

76
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,520
 Now there was an investigation into the murder of Wong.

77
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,120
 It wasn't just like, "Aye's just a Chinese cook.

78
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,120
 We don't got to worry about this guy."

79
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,920
 Like people were like, he was well liked.

80
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,320
 People were like, "I wonder what happened to that guy."

81
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,320
 Like they found his body.

82
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,320
 He didn't go missing.

83
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,080
 But they couldn't find any proof that anyone did anything.

84
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,720
 Everyone was keeping their mouth shut.

85
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:05,880
 But a few months later, these five other Chinese men come to Whiskey Flap.

86
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,520
 They didn't look for work.

87
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,760
 They had a bunch of money in their pocket, kept to themselves.

88
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,960
 Everyone was thinking, "That's weird."

89
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,320
 I mean, it's not like seeing Chinese people was weird, but they come here for work.

90
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,280
 And these guys are just kind of walking around the town, not doing anything.

91
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:29,680
 So one of the men that the woman had grabbed to help her with Wong, he goes missing.

92
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,680
 Never found him.

93
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,520
 Never found a body.

94
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,080
 And then another one of the men goes missing.

95
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,920
 Couple weeks later, another one of the men goes missing.

96
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,880
 One by one, eventually, all five of the loggers go missing.

97
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:50,160
 And when the last logger who was involved in Wong's murder disappeared, the five men

98
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,040
 left town.

99
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,960
 Now the idea in town was that the five men were a member of the Dong.

100
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,320
 It was basically the Chinese mafia.

101
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:05,400
 And they used Taoist techniques to contact the spirit of Wong.

102
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,640
 And he pointed out each person who had something to do with his murder.

103
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,080
 And after they were done seeking vengeance, they left town.

104
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,480
 Today, the city of Whiskey Flap is no more.

105
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:22,280
 It was actually flooded and it's at the bottom of Lake Isabella.

106
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,280
 Lake Isabella is near Kernville, California.

107
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:31,120
 And sometimes the lake gets so lowered you can actually see the tops of buildings because

108
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,200
 the town was just flooded in there.

109
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,120
 I wasn't able to tell whether or not it was flooded naturally or they built a dam.

110
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,120
 I was looking for that.

111
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,640
 I couldn't figure that out.

112
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:46,560
 But people still say that to this day, sometimes hovering over the lake, you'll see the spirit

113
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:53,560
 of Wong pointing his finger at the men who killed him.

114
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,960
 Now that's the story.

115
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,960
 Here's the thing.

116
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,280
 When I read it, I go, "That's a fascinating story, but I have a couple things to debunk

117
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,280
 at one.

118
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,280
 Why wasn't the woman killed?"

119
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,560
 There's no mention of the woman ever again.

120
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,360
 And why would the ghost still be pointing out in the middle of the lake?

121
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,000
 Like just pointing at random people in rowboats.

122
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,480
 And how would you be able to see it if you're on the coast of the lake and you saw something

123
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,640
 pointing at you?

124
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,640
 You'd be like, "What?

125
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,640
 Why are you pointing it?"

126
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,640
 And behind you, you'd be like, "What?

127
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,640
 Are you pointing it?

128
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,640
 Who are you pointing at?

129
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,640
 You're pointing at me?

130
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,640
 You're pointing at me?

131
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,640
 What did I do?

132
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,800
 I just came here and the little ghost guy pointing at you."

133
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,160
 The reason why I wanted to cover this story, I don't think it's true.

134
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,160
 I don't think it's true.

135
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,360
 Some of the details are true.

136
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,840
 Whiskey Flat was real.

137
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,880
 The really is the city at the bottom of Lake Isabella.

138
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,880
 We know those two facts are true.

139
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,400
 But the reason why I wanted to cover this is because I almost feel like somebody worked

140
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
 backwards.

141
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,800
 Because the story itself doesn't really make sense.

142
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,520
 How would the five guys be able to contact...how would they know he was killed in the first

143
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,880
 place and then they go there and they're talking to his ghost and he's pointing people out

144
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,040
 but he doesn't point out the woman and he points them out one by one.

145
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,600
 And here's the most interesting thing in thinking about this as a debunker.

146
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,320
 No one in the town knew who killed him.

147
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:13,760
 So if the story is true, why would they think those five people who went missing in a mining

148
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,560
 town which is fairly transient to begin with?

149
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,960
 If nobody knew who the suspects were in the first place and five people went missing, how

150
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,960
 would they make the connection?

151
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,120
 It'd be one thing if the people in town knew who did it but they couldn't prove it.

152
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,880
 But they didn't know who did it.

153
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,680
 Just five people left and they're like, "Oh, there must have been the guys who hung Wong."

154
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,000
 So there's a lot of weird coincidences.

155
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,560
 This is what I think happened though.

156
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,680
 This is how I think...and I think this is why I wanted to talk about this story as well.

157
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,800
 There may or may not be a ghost pointing over the lake of Lake Isabella.

158
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,000
 There may or may not be a ghost there.

159
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,840
 Could be a trick of a light.

160
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,800
 Could be an urban legend.

161
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
 Could be a ghost.

162
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,160
 But what I think happened was...and we'll talk about a couple other stories this week

163
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,920
 where this has happened.

164
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:03,880
 Is that somebody...let's say that there is a ghost floating over the lake of Lake Isabella.

165
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,360
 Pointing at people.

166
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,800
 Somebody created the story to explain the ghost.

167
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,120
 They saw a ghost of...again, how are you supposed to tell his ethnicity on a lake?

168
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,120
 You're in a rowboat.

169
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,320
 You're hundreds of yards away.

170
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,280
 I don't think they were super close to this dude.

171
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,720
 Otherwise he'd be picking their nose.

172
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,800
 He'd be poking them in the eyeball.

173
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,120
 You saw a misty figure 300 yards away.

174
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,480
 I don't think you'd be like, "Hmm, that guy's probably from Bulgaria."

175
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,280
 You'd just be like, "It's a ghost."

176
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,960
 But anyways, so unless he was wearing a super traditional Chinese outfit.

177
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,960
 He's a ghost.

178
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,680
 He doesn't look like Liu Kang or anything like that.

179
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,680
 He's not dressed in traditional clothes.

180
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,440
 He's just wearing cooked clothes.

181
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,840
 Anyways, what I think happened is that somebody saw a ghost and then the story was crafted

182
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,720
 to create this narrative.

183
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,960
 That really doesn't make sense when you put any weight on it.

184
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:57,240
 And the reason why I think that's interesting, it makes you think how many other haunted places

185
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,240
 may have this same thing.

186
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,000
 They're like, "Oh, if it's a ghost, something tragic must have happened here."

187
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,320
 And we actually, we saw that with the town of Dudleyville.

188
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,680
 Where people thought the town was haunted and then they made up this whole backstory

189
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,400
 about this guy pissing off the king of England and getting sent to Dudleyville.

190
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,440
 And none of that stuff was true.

191
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,400
 None of it was true.

192
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:23,880
 Interesting take on the ghost story are sometimes, are there real ghosts, but the stories we

193
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:30,280
 create to explain them are the thing that's made up and the thing that's easily debunkable.

194
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,800
 Is there really a ghost pointing at people out in the middle of the lake?

195
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,360
 Who knows?

196
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,040
 But it wasn't Wong and that story almost 100% never happened.

197
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,400
 Like I'll debunk the story before I can debunk the ghost.

198
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,440
 So our next story is the story of Sada Abe.

199
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,400
 Now yes, I do know in my episode about the guy who loved euthanasia, I called the president

200
00:09:53,400 --> 00:10:00,000
 of Japan Shinzo Abe and I was corrected very quickly, not just on YouTube comments, but

201
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,440
 a friend of mine in real life punched me in the arm and said "It's Abe!

202
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:12,480
 And then when the guy who sent me this story sent me this story via email, when I got the

203
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:19,760
 email, he said "Now, Jason, this is how you pronounce the girl's name.

204
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,760
 It's Abe."

205
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,240
 And I was like "Yeah, yeah, I know.

206
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,760
 But you know, he's just looking out for me.

207
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,960
 So thank you, Abe.

208
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,160
 Thank you for this suggestion.

209
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,240
 Now this is the story of Sada Abe.

210
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,040
 Bizarre, bizarre crime.

211
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:38,120
 And it's one of those things that I think if you're not in Japan, you've never heard

212
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,120
 of this ever.

213
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,120
 I've never heard of this before.

214
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,360
 And it's quite gruesome and incredibly famous.

215
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:50,880
 We're going back to the year of 1905 and we see a little baby girl named Sada Abe.

216
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,720
 Her mother loved Sada, taking care of her.

217
00:10:53,720 --> 00:11:00,200
 Her father was also pretty appreciative of her, but he was a little more stern.

218
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,080
 She had an older sister and an older brother.

219
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:11,360
 And from all accounts, her early life was fairly normal, normal in the sense of Japan.

220
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,960
 So her older sister was a little slutty, a little loose.

221
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,480
 And apparently this was the thing back then.

222
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,240
 You know that thing, like if you get caught smoking a cigarette and your dad's like,

223
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,240
 "You like cigarettes?

224
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,240
 You like cigarettes?

225
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,240
 Here, smoke a whole pack."

226
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,160
 And you're like, "Ugh, ugh, ugh."

227
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,680
 And you eventually get nicotine poisoning and you get really sick and throw up and you're

228
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,040
 like, "I'm never smoking another cigarette again."

229
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,840
 In Japan, they did that for sex.

230
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:46,000
 So when Sada's older sister was sleeping around, the dad was like, "Oh, you like sleeping

231
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 around?

232
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 You like banging dudes?

233
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 You like banging dudes?

234
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,640
 Bang 30 dudes!"

235
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:56,320
 And he dropped her off at a brothel and she just started banging dudes.

236
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,920
 I don't imagine it works the same as it does with cigarettes, but apparently that's what

237
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,440
 they did back then.

238
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,880
 So you kind of know where part of the story's going.

239
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:12,040
 Sada, as she's getting older, she starts to get, first off, she actually starts taking

240
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:18,280
 singing lessons and she started learning this instrument called the shamisen, which back

241
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:24,920
 then was more connected to the geisha culture and geishas were still basically like, had

242
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,040
 a foot in the prostitute culture.

243
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,040
 And they had legal brothels and unlicensed brothels and stuff like that.

244
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,680
 And geishas, you had high level geishas who would just perform and then you had lower

245
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,640
 level geishas who were there to bang the people, bang the dudes you came to visit.

246
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,840
 So, but anyways, she starts singing, they didn't have any YouTube back then, so singing

247
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,680
 would really only lead to one thing.

248
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,960
 And she's learning this instrument and she starts to become really rebellious.

249
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,160
 She starts hanging out with the wrong crowd, she starts skipping school, she starts wearing

250
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,760
 a lot of makeup.

251
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:02,520
 So all really early warning signs of someone who may have trouble in the future.

252
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,400
 At this point in time, she ends up getting raped by a friend.

253
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,360
 She's still fairly, she's like in high school at this point, the equivalent of high school

254
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,960
 in Japan.

255
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:17,440
 And her parents are, you know, defend her and are like, okay, we have your back.

256
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,040
 But then she starts to become even more uncontrollable and lashing out at them and not going to

257
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,760
 school and stuff like that and sleeping around all the time.

258
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:34,400
 So at that point, the dad goes, worked with her sister and he sent her to a brothel.

259
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,560
 She liked banging dudes, banging 50 dudes.

260
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,920
 So she's at the brothel, she ends up becoming a prostitute.

261
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,720
 Now we're jumping ahead to the 1930s.

262
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,120
 So at this point, she's around 25 years old.

263
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,040
 She ends up working at a licensed brothel, she still has money from them, she gets in

264
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,200
 trouble.

265
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,320
 She goes to an unlicensed brothel, she's not supposed to be working there, I think the

266
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,000
 place gets raided, she gets in trouble.

267
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,400
 She's kind of moving around and in this time period, she actually went to a geisha house

268
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,520
 because she's like, oh, I can be a geisha because I have all these skills.

269
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:07,120
 When she goes there and she realizes that to be a traditional geisha, you have to start

270
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,920
 practicing full on geisha training at a super young age.

271
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,960
 So they said, you can come and work for us, but you have to be a low level geisha, you're

272
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,960
 just going to bang dudes.

273
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,920
 So basically, she's still a prostitute now she's just wearing geisha makeup.

274
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,080
 But that's when she starts meeting all of these high profile people.

275
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,980
 And one of them says, you've got to start thinking about a career path, you've got to start thinking

276
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,400
 about the future, you can't do this forever.

277
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,760
 You should open a small restaurant.

278
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,240
 You go into business for yourself.

279
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,880
 And it's funny because I imagine like as he's giving her this fatherly advice, he's

280
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,880
 banging her.

281
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,640
 But he was trying to help her and saying, you know, you just can't do this forever.

282
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:50,720
 And he goes, why don't you go to this restaurant, get a job, learn the trade, and then in a

283
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,840
 couple of years, you can go and open your own little restaurant.

284
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,760
 And she thought, that is a good idea.

285
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,080
 Because you're right, I can't do this forever.

286
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,600
 Now we're jumping into the year 1936.

287
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,680
 She does get a job at a restaurant.

288
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,160
 She's a server.

289
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,720
 And she meets Kichizo Ishidi.

290
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,400
 Kichizo Ishidi, he's the married owner of the restaurant.

291
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,400
 She's smitten by him.

292
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,600
 She has no problem sleeping with a married man.

293
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
 She was a prostitute.

294
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,880
 She'd done it all the time.

295
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,320
 And she starts to kind of try to seduce him.

296
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,800
 And it works very, very quickly.

297
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,800
 Very quickly.

298
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,600
 Young woman.

299
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,680
 He's like 42.

300
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,320
 He's totally into her.

301
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,200
 He's like, yeah, let's do this.

302
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:36,040
 And basically it's one of those things where, hey, let's go away for the weekend and have

303
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,720
 sex.

304
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,720
 And they did.

305
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,160
 But the weekend became two weeks.

306
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,280
 They just couldn't get out of bed.

307
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:47,160
 Now she had always talked about how no one could really, she probably had nymphomania

308
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,960
 at a certain point.

309
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,640
 Because she was constantly talking about how she couldn't be sedative.

310
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,760
 Like she needed a man who could really satisfy her.

311
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,680
 She found one in this man.

312
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,760
 She found one in this man.

313
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,960
 He could pleasure her like nobody else could.

314
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,880
 But after two weeks, he's like, you know, I do have a restaurant to run.

315
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,600
 Plus, my wife.

316
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,680
 So I'll see you at work tomorrow.

317
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,680
 And he bounces.

318
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,840
 And she becomes insanely jealous.

319
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,920
 Super, super jealous.

320
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,920
 She pawns.

321
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,320
 This is one of the details that I thought was quite odd.

322
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:24,040
 She pawns some of her clothes off to buy a kitchen knife.

323
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,040
 First question.

324
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,720
 How expensive were kitchen knives in Imperial Japan?

325
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,720
 Second question.

326
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,720
 She works at a restaurant.

327
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,400
 Couldn't she have just gotten a kitchen knife there?

328
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,720
 But for whatever reason, it must be a jewel encrusted monogrammed kitchen knife.

329
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,600
 She pawns some of her clothes, gets this fancy, dancy kitchen knife.

330
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,800
 And the next time they meet up, she says, I'm going to kill you.

331
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,960
 And she pulls a knife on him and puts it to him.

332
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,960
 And he laughs it off.

333
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,720
 He's like, ah, whatever.

334
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,360
 And they bang each other.

335
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,720
 Now I'm all down for crazy chicks.

336
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,120
 I think every guy loves a little bit of crazy in their chick.

337
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,280
 But there's a limit.

338
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,640
 Like, that's the limit.

339
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,600
 That is the limit.

340
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,720
 Pulling a weapon on me is the limit.

341
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,520
 If you pull a weapon on me and say you're going to kill me, then I'm done.

342
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,520
 I don't care how hot you are.

343
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,720
 But anyways, so they start making love again.

344
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:19,600
 And at one point, in between their lovemaking, I'm assuming, otherwise she has a death wish,

345
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,600
 she takes the knife and she puts it to the base of his penis.

346
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,320
 Now I'm going to let you guys know there are going to be several parts where you may want

347
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,160
 to cross your legs during the story.

348
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,360
 This isn't even close to one of them.

349
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,640
 She puts a knife to the base of his dick and says, I'm going to make sure you never take

350
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,440
 another woman as a lover.

351
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,760
 And he laughs it off.

352
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,200
 He's like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

353
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
