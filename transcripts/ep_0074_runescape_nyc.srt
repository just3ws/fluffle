1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
 A mental disease that makes you think you're already dead.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:10,000
 And what exactly is the relationship between the old school video game RuneScape

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,880
 and the city of New York today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:24,080
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,240
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,080
 I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,400
 I hope you're having a great day too.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,680
 It is a busy, busy day for me here.

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,240
 Got to go to work and I got to play.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,880
 This is the last weekend of the play.

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,800
 Not going to do any plays for a while so I can focus more on the podcast.

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,760
 Probably not until the beginning of next year.

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,640
 This is also the last episode of the week before Halloween month, October.

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,440
 We've got some spooky stuff coming.

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,920
 We're going to launch our listener mail as well.

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,000
 Those episodes are going to be appearing at the end of podcasts.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,960
 I may include they may be their own separate bonus episodes.

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,680
 I'm not for sure yet, but people who listen to the podcast

19
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,000
 will be able to listen to listener mail.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,120
 And then of course they'll also be available on YouTube.

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,560
 We've got a lot of cool things going on here.

22
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,360
 Now I wanted to say something.

23
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:12,160
 I think there's an issue where you may feel like I'm being a little inconsistent on things.

24
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,480
 And I think it's because the two episodes came kind of hit back to back that I realized it.

25
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:23,600
 On the episode about vortex jumpers and it was the people who got radiation sickness

26
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,160
 from the UFO, they hired the lawyer.

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,080
 The lawyer was like, I believe a vortex will open up at the bottom of this cliff

28
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,320
 and I'm going to jump off into it.

29
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,840
 And I was like, the guy's nuts.

30
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,280
 That's totally ridiculous.

31
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,640
 And then the next episode, I'm like, believe you are better than you are.

32
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,560
 And magical stuff will happen if you create this hyper sigil.

33
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,600
 And as I was as a day passed between the episodes, I thought, really, what I was

34
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,560
 explaining with the hyper sigil was really no less crazy than what that lawyer

35
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,360
 was talking about with vortex jumping.

36
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,880
 And that's a fair criticism.

37
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,000
 What I would like to say to that, though, is that there are people that

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,640
 we profile on this podcast, you have very dangerous ideas or fraudulent ideas,

39
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,280
 i.e. they're asking for money.

40
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,400
 I don't know if the hyper sigils work.

41
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,320
 They work for me.

42
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,000
 That idea, that way of kind of manipulating your own life, the positive

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,680
 thinking aspect of it, that's where I'm coming from.

44
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,840
 So I'm telling a guy who's encouraging a guy who wants to jump off of a cliff

45
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,720
 to go into another dimension.

46
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,360
 I feel is more damaging to the overall human psyche than somebody saying,

47
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,680
 think positively and have a positive outlook and create the world you want

48
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,000
 and then work towards it.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,720
 They're both, when you break them down to the metaphysical aspect,

50
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,120
 skeptics could go, they're both equally insane, fair enough.

51
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,480
 But talking about hyper sigils and talking about positive thinking and that,

52
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,360
 I think is different than people saying, you know, the government's after me

53
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,160
 because I was created in a laboratory.

54
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,320
 You may be created in a laboratory to join me in our fight against the government.

55
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,520
 Or 2012 is coming.

56
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,640
 The world's going to be destroyed.

57
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,080
 Fear, fear, fear, hate, hate, hate.

58
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,160
 That's the difference.

59
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,840
 So again, if you say Jason, you're just your shows getting a little inconsistent

60
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,640
 because every so often you'll talk about some sort of mystical thing you believe

61
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,520
 in and the next episode you just talk trash about these other people.

62
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,840
 That's kind of where it comes from.

63
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,520
 Sungazing to me is different than carrying a rock in your pocket

64
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,280
 and thinking it brings you good luck.

65
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,120
 One causes you to go blind.

66
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,320
 The other one is a harm at its very least as a harmless superstition.

67
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,840
 You're not going to go into debt because you have a rock in your pocket.

68
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,280
 You're not going to get hurt unless you unless you fall on your side where the rock is.

69
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,840
 And it was a like sharp piece of obsidian, but you know, I can't take any blame for that.

70
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,760
 So I just wanted to address that.

71
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,440
 The first story we're going to talk about is actually something I heard about a long,

72
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,560
 long time ago. And like I said, I'm kind of a big fan of zombie lore.

73
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,560
 And so this kind of came across my desk years and years ago.

74
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,320
 It's called the Cotard delusion, also known as walking dead syndrome before the comic book.

75
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:10,960
 So what it is, it's a it's related to Capgras syndrome, which we talked about before,

76
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,720
 where you you think people have been replaced by clones.

77
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,120
 It's a brain disease, but this time it's totally inwards.

78
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,040
 So you start getting lesions on your brain.

79
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,480
 You have some sort of traumatic brain injury.

80
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:30,280
 You have some chemical imbalance and you start to get the feeling that you're dead.

81
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,480
 It's not an overwhelming thing at first, usually.

82
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,160
 You'll wake up one morning, you'll start brushing your teeth,

83
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,280
 you're looking the mirror and you'll think, I don't look alive.

84
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,480
 Something something's not right.

85
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,160
 I can see it in my eyes. People who suffer from this will say,

86
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,880
 my heart's not pumping anymore. I don't feel my pulse.

87
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,200
 My blood, my blood is missing from my body.

88
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,840
 My stomach has rotted away. It's petrified.

89
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,040
 All my guts are slowly rotting and their brain is reinforcing this.

90
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,200
 Their brain is basically giving them signals that they are dead.

91
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,680
 Now, they're not. It's a delusion because obviously when they go to medical personnel,

92
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,240
 they'll say, oh no, listen, that's your heart beating and they'll have an excuse for that.

93
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,360
 Or your organs haven't haven't actually liquefied, dude.

94
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,480
 And they'll be like brains, brains.

95
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,640
 Actually, sometimes they'll become mute because what's the point of speaking when you're dead?

96
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,960
 They'll stop eating. They had one woman starved to death.

97
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,160
 I she was actually the first reported case of it.

98
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,760
 It's called cotard delusion.

99
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,920
 It's called cotard delusion because it's named after the guy who

100
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,760
 discovered it. It was named after Jules Kotard.

101
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,640
 And this was in the 18 in 1880.

102
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,520
 They've had cases of it. It's very, very rare, but they don't know how rare.

103
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,840
 They don't know much about it because it's rare.

104
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,120
 And really the only thing that doctors have to go off of is case study.

105
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,800
 So they can go, well, you know, it could be related to this, could be related to that.

106
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,360
 But until someone pops up with the cotard delusion,

107
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,920
 they really can't study it. And these people aren't necessarily the most cooperative

108
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,240
 because they're dead.

109
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,000
 So they recently had this one girl who's had it and she was 17 years old.

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,640
 And there's an interesting article because she has gotten better.

111
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,320
 You know, you can you can fix it. It is treatable.

112
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,680
 And so this young girl was saying that one day she was sitting there in class

113
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,040
 and she just got the overwhelming feeling just like that she's dead.

114
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,840
 And she didn't know what to make of it.

115
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,440
 She's like, wait, she just felt that she had passed away.

116
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,800
 And she said as she was walking home from school, she thought, you know what?

117
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,680
 I'm going to go visit a graveyard because that's where my family is.

118
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,880
 Those are my friends. But she goes, there is no graveyard on the way home.

119
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,040
 So she just went home and to sleep it off.

120
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,600
 And it was gone.

121
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,920
 And then a period of time later, a couple of weeks, a month or two later,

122
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,560
 it came back. She's like, I'm dead.

123
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,640
 Like it terrified her, but she's like, I'm dead.

124
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,800
 I'm dead in this body.

125
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,320
 And it didn't go away this time.

126
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,840
 It lasted, it lasted for years and years.

127
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,280
 And she just dealt with it.

128
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,840
 She said, I'm just going to eat whatever I want because I'm dead and I can't put on any weight.

129
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,960
 So she started to eat whatever she wanted.

130
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,880
 She watched a lot of zombie movies and stuff like that.

131
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,440
 She said it felt comforting seeing other dead people because to her,

132
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,560
 everyone else was alive and she was like the outsider.

133
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,400
 And what happened was she eventually confided in a friend and she was really nervous about.

134
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,360
 And this is why it's always important to talk to people about any sort of issues

135
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,040
 you're having. A lot of people are like, I don't want to burden you.

136
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,440
 And they're really like struggling with some heavy stuff.

137
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,320
 And if you ever do tell someone any burden, then with it, they're just going to say,

138
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,920
 Hey, I think you need to see a professional.

139
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,600
 And that may be the push you need to go see a professional.

140
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,720
 But anyway, so that's what happened.

141
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,120
 She finally told her friend and her friend said,

142
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,080
 Well, I think you need to talk to your father about this.

143
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,400
 And then she told the father and the father goes, we need to take you to

144
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,000
 get you some psychiatric help.

145
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,760
 And at this point, it had been like two years.

146
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,120
 She goes to the psychiatrist and the psychiatrist goes, Oh,

147
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,840
 you're suffering from cotard, cotard delusion.

148
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,680
 And she was like, I had a name.

149
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,640
 I wasn't the only person. So once she knew what it was called,

150
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,040
 she started looking up online.

151
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,960
 She saw other people had suffered with this.

152
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,240
 She saw that it was rare and she started treatment.

153
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,000
 And she said she attributed her success to the

154
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,240
 basically friends, her family and her boyfriend and watching Disney movies

155
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,680
 because watching Disney movies like made her happy.

156
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,600
 And she said, at one point, I turned to my boyfriend and said,

157
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,400
 How can I be dead if I'm this happy?

158
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,000
 And that was kind of that push out of it.

159
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,640
 And now she talks to other people about it and, you know,

160
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,680
 tries to let people know that this is a real thing.

161
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,120
 So there is the way to get out of it.

162
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,120
 Now, that is the most like in depth story we could find on it.

163
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,560
 A lot of stuff is just little references and medical journals.

164
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,040
 There was a dude, this is not a good travel guide.

165
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,440
 Don't ever put this in your tourism book, South Africa.

166
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,080
 There was a dude in Ireland who got a traumatic brain injury.

167
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,280
 And his mom takes him to South Africa to live.

168
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,520
 And when he gets there, he's like, I'm dead and I'm in hell.

169
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,920
 I died of AIDS and I'm just a corpse walking around.

170
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,520
 Leave that out of your tourism guide,

171
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,080
 because if somebody is comparing your country to hell,

172
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,000
 probably not going to get a lot of people visiting it.

173
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,680
 If like someone who visits there is like,

174
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,400
 I must have died on the airplane over.

175
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,600
 It must have gotten AIDS on that plane over.

176
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,760
 Now I'm in hell. That's not good.

177
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,520
 So, yeah, a cotard delusion.

178
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,760
 It's the brain can control the body to the point

179
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,800
 where you're feeling physical sensations

180
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,200
 and you're feeling your guts liquefy.

181
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,760
 It's tell your brain is telling you your guts aren't there anymore.

182
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,960
 And then you go, well, then I guess I don't need to eat.

183
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,400
 So fascinating, little delusion, creepy.

184
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,000
 You know, there's also the other theory.

185
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,840
 I don't believe this, but I'm going to throw this out here.

186
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,800
 What if people who suffer from cotard delusion

187
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,560
 have been Mandela affected into a reality where they're still alive?

188
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,120
 So let's say that they died in their reality.

189
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,960
 Let's say the guy did get AIDS on the plane over to South Africa

190
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,280
 and then died immediately because I guess that's how AIDS works in his head.

191
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,520
 And when he gets off on the plane, so in our reality

192
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,160
 where we're treating him medically, he's still alive.

193
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,320
 But in the reality he came from, he died.

194
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,840
 Or the woman who was the first case, Madam Iselle X, who starved to death.

195
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,800
 She said, I'm dead, so I don't have to eat.

196
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,360
 What if in her original reality, she did die, but she switched to our reality

197
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,200
 where she's alive and now that she's died in our reality,

198
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,040
 she switches into yet another reality where she is still alive.

199
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,280
 I'm going to say this to going on to that little rant.

200
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,440
 The whole thing about quantum immortality and quantum suicide.

201
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,040
 And we'll do a separate episode on that.

202
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,320
 I do have to say that is a thought experiment.

203
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,280
 Please don't put a gun to your head, pull the trigger and think you're going to live.

204
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,840
 Quantum suicide is the belief that if you commit suicide,

205
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,160
 you can't exist in a reality where you have no consciousness.

206
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,200
 So if you die, you actually switch to a reality where you're still alive.

207
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,040
 Meaning everybody lives forever.

208
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,040
 You can't comprehend a world that you can't.

209
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,440
 You have no senses for.

210
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,400
 Therefore you don't die.

211
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,000
 So you pull the trigger and in the original reality, you die from the gunshot.

212
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,160
 But in the reality, you continue to experience the gun jams,

213
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,840
 or someone walks in the room or something like that.

214
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:14,720
 And John McAfee, who came up with the McAfee antivirus, which is garbage antivirus.

215
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,000
 He's a big proponent of that.

216
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,640
 He actually put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger in front of a reporter.

217
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,520
 And he said, in another reality, I died.

218
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,680
 But here's my question.

219
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,880
 Here's my pushback on quantum immortality, quantum suicide.

220
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,000
 If you, let's say you get in a car accident, you're paralyzed from the neck down.

221
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,720
 So you didn't die, paralyzed from neck down.

222
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,800
 And then you, you're breathing to breaks and you suffocate.

223
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,520
 When you switch to the new reality, are you still paralyzed from the neck down?

224
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,360
 But your breathing tube didn't break.

225
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,320
 So does that mean you're paralyzed from the neck down forever?

226
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,520
 Because you're still conscious.

227
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,800
 You can still perceive things.

228
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:54,680
 Basically, that would mean that if you ever were incarcerated for life or ever horribly

229
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,600
 paralyzed or mutilated or anything like that, you will just keep switching from reality to

230
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,720
 reality forever and always be locked in prison for life.

231
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,920
 So, or paralyzed from the neck down.

232
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,840
 And I just think that's a ridiculous idea.

233
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,440
 But I didn't want to throw that out with the Cotard delusion thing.

234
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,840
 The next story we're going to talk about is on the conspiracy iceberg.

235
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,440
 It's actually one that I've gotten a lot of requests for.

236
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,080
 We're talking about an MMO here called Runescape.

237
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,480
 Now Runescape was one of the original MMO.

238
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,640
 Let me back up here.

239
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:30,120
 I don't know if Runescape is one of, I think Runescape is one of the earliest MMOs.

240
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,480
 Ultima Online may have beat it by a bit.

241
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,120
 But anyways, Runescape is an MMO and what that is, it's a massive multiplayer online

242
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,800
 role-playing game.

243
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,800
 And you're basically, you can go off and quest by yourself or quest with a group.

244
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,280
 And there's two components to it.

245
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,040
 One is the questing, fighting monsters.

246
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,680
 The other one is the social aspect.

247
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,320
 So you're hanging out with your buddies or you go into town.

248
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,560
 You're talking to people.

249
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,720
 There's all sorts of stuff like player versus player, where on certain servers

250
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,680
 you can kill each other.

251
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,120
 And then there's servers where you just kill monsters.

252
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,400
 Brief overview of what MMOs are in general and then Runescape as well.

253
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,640
 So what Runescape, it's because it's so old.

254
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,880
 It's from 2001.

255
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,960
 It has this still a loyal, loyal fan base who plays it.

256
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,560
 And they live in that game.

257
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,960
 Not literally, but they live, like that's their form of entertainment.

258
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,800
 They go there, they talk to their friends and all that stuff.

259
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,360
 Now, what happened was back in 2017, again, January 2017 on that iceberg,

260
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,040
 a conspiracy theory popped up.

261
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,520
 It was called Runescape.nyc.

262
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,840
 And so of course, people are like, what does that mean?

263
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,360
 So people began, again, this kind of comes to stuff like golf rumors, where the

264
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,960
 phrase appears and sometimes people, it could just be made up phrase.

265
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,760
 Could just be a phrase somebody put up on the iceberg as a joke.

266
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,440
 And we have to address that.

267
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,760
 That could be the answer to what this conspiracy is.

268
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,320
 It's not the most interesting answer, but we do have to address it.

269
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,080
 It could just be something made up.

270
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,200
 Now, also when phrases appear on the iceberg, sometimes people work backwards.

271
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,920
 They'll create a myth behind that phrase.

272
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,240
 One of the first ones I saw was that Runescape is actually used as a

273
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,120
 money laundering operation, and they tied it into a robbery where a guy pulled

274
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,320
 out a BB gun on another player in real life and asked for like four million

275
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,160
 gold pieces in the game to be deposited in his account.

276
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,600
 And that happened in New York City and the kid with the gun, the BB gun,

277
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,200
 got like five years because it is, you know, robbery.

278
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:27,400
 Now, I'm sure that online games are used as money laundering to a point.

279
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,360
 Definitely.

280
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,000
 It's an easy way to transfer money back and forth because you can cash in and out

281
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,600
 of games, sell items in real life and so on and so forth.

282
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,720
 So I can buy an item in real life, sell it to someone else in real life.

283
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,640
 I've transferred the money from one individual to another, which was my end

284
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,640
 result, but I didn't have to worry about getting banks involved or wire

285
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,960
 transfers, things like that.

286
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
 Definitely possible.

287
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,680
 Definitely possible that people are using video games to launder money.

288
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,440
 That's not what I think the conspiracy theory is, though.

289
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:59,200
 There's the other conspiracy theory that Runescape, the land that Runescape

290
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,480
 takes place in, is based on New York City.

291
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:06,360
 Apparently one of the things that I saw was two of the guys who worked on

292
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,000
 Runescape.

293
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,160
 They were urban explorers and they were going through New York and they

294
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,320
 found the skeleton of a hobo and they're like, let's create sewer levels in this

295
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:14,840
 game.

296
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:21,360
 I think any game that has like a rich lived in world is going to try to be as

297
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,480
 realistic as possible.

298
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,560
 They're going to have high society and low society.

299
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,600
 They're going to have people who live in rich houses and they're going to have

300
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,840
 people who live on the outskirts.

301
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,800
 So I kind of disregard that one.

302
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,480
 And again, that's not very interesting.

303
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,800
 Runescape.nyc, I don't think is related to a hobo skeleton that two people

304
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,200
 found.

305
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,960
 There's another theory.

306
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:45,520
 That Runescape is basically set up like New York.

307
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,880
 This guy, and I'm not going to go through all the points because I think you'll get

308
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,520
 the idea of where we're at.

309
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,960
 This one guy said, this was his quick rundown on Runescape NYC.

310
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,320
 A single city is densely packed with multiple ethnicities on multiple islands

311
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,440
 and separate boroughs.

312
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,440
 Runescape is densely packed with multiple races on multiple islands with

313
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,480
 separate kingdoms.

314
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,880
 Multiple methods to earn income at NYC and Runescape are parallel.

315
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,880
 From begging on the streets, long term skilled labor, PK, which is player killing,

316
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,600
 playing the stock exchange, begging only works because densely packed area.

317
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:26,400
 So basically the elements that make the world of Runescape work are closely

318
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,240
 related to the elements that happen in New York City.

319
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,360
 That you could compare it to Mumbai.

320
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,240
 You can compare it to London.

321
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,280
 You can compare it to San Francisco.

322
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,000
 It's an interesting thing.

323
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,520
 But again, when you're building a game that you want players to feel is a

324
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:47,440
 lived in vibrant world, you're going to have those levels of society.

325
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,760
 You're going to have the underclass, you're going to have the overclass or the

326
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,360
 upper class, I guess is a better term for it.

327
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,880
 Here, the idea of people just kind of going about their day doing jobs.

328
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,360
 Some people just want to sit around and beg for stuff.

329
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,640
 Some people work hard.

330
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,000
 Some people steal.

331
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,080
 That applies to any city.

332
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,960
 It's an interesting observation, but you'd see things like that in

333
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:14,560
 pretty much any MMO and any city, not any MMO, but, you know, the good ones.

334
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:21,520
 So that leaves us with one theory, which I think is the source of Runescape.nyc.

335
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,280
 So again, when we look at these conspiracy theories, the timing is important.

336
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,960
 The one I just read you about the quick rundown that was about 11 months ago.

337
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,680
 This one comes from July 2017.

338
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,240
 So it is after Runescape NYC showed up on the iceberg list.

339
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,440
 So it could have been made up because of that phrase.

340
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,040
 But let's go ahead and take a look at this.

341
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,760
 This was a post on 4chan and I'm going to read it.

342
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,720
 I remember correctly about three years back, there was an anon claiming to be

343
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,560
 a research associate of Warren Sachs, the media theorist known for his

344
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,360
 computational maps of online social patterns.

345
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:02,840
 He claimed to have used Sachs methods for building network models to an

346
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,920
 unprecedented degree, tracking the interactions of hundreds and thousands

347
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,240
 of users of MMO RPGs, including Runescape.

348
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,760
 His claim was this.

349
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,080
 After doing cross comparisons, he saw that all results showed fairly similar maps.

350
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,440
 However, one server showed anomalous results.

351
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:26,200
 He saw that in this map, users seemed to rotate in routine micro networks rather

352
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,880
 than interconnecting with disparate users as would be expected.

353
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,360
 So basically he was running these models on these MMO servers and he could see

354
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,520
 that the groups of people would all sorts of groups of people would just

355
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,640
 kind of intermingle with each other over time.

356
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,160
 And he was mapping out how they were interacting with each other.

357
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:47,120
 But he found one particular server where you would see one group almost always

358
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,600
 interacting with themselves separate from this other group always interacting

359
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,920
 with themselves in this third group.

360
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,040
 And these servers aren't like 10 people.

361
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,120
 These are thousands and thousands of players.

362
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,040
 Instead, he wouldn't really see them cross contaminate.

363
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,400
 They would always run in their own little networks.

364
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,600
 Now, when you have, when you're playing MMO, you may have your clan that you're

365
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,840
 always talking to, but you will come back into the city and interact with

366
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,920
 other people as well.

367
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,520
 But he wasn't seeing that on this particular server.

368
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,960
 Now, now back to the note here.

369
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,680
 Now, this guy was using similar methods to map the uses of a residential area

370
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,160
 in, you guessed it, New York.

371
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,480
 He noticed that the data he retrieved synced perfectly with the Runescape

372
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,040
 networks if certain obvious translations were made, going to work in real life

373
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,520
 correspond to grinding and game, travel routines and distances synced up.

374
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,560
 Intrigued, he did more tests on different servers, cross analyzing them with

375
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,040
 random residential areas from his New York data and started finding

376
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,200
 correspondences localized in certain places.

377
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,720
 Eventually, he even completed a map of New York showing which areas matched

378
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,840
 places in Runescape.

379
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,480
 He checked the results by cross comparing other similar surveys from

380
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:00,080
 American cities and other MMORPGs, but failed to find even remotely the same

381
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,440
 depth of similarities.

382
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,840
 So basically what he was doing was once he found he was mapping out people's

383
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,520
 movements in New York City as well as best as he could.

384
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,680
 And he started to notice a comparison between a particular area of New York

385
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,400
 City and a particular server of Runescape.

386
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,160
 Now, when he brought in his search to other boroughs in New York City and

387
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,320
 different servers in Runescape, he noticed the same patterns.

388
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,280
 When he tried to replicate it with different video games or different

389
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,440
 cities, it wasn't working.

390
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,720
 He does go on to say here that the person who told him the story said that

391
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,360
 he was eventually fired because people thought he was crazy.

392
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,480
 He said, the guy who came up with this original story, that walking around

393
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,520
 the streets, he realized people were being controlled via players in Runescape

394
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,400
 and that the entire city was an experimental zone testing digital control of

395
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,320
 populations.

396
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,640
 So that sounds obviously a lot like Creepypasta.

397
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,360
 It sounds like someone posted that on 4chan and was like, oh, this would be a

398
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,920
 good idea for a story that, you know, I'm uncovering this mystery.

399
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,320
 And I found out that the people of New York are being controlled by Runescape

400
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:01,640
 players.

401
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,840
 So these people are just kind of walking around and going to their job.

402
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,920
 But the player in real life is saying, oh, I'm going to grind today.

403
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,920
 I'm just going to focus on like, I'm a metal smith.

404
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:16,720
 And in real life, that person wakes up and goes and works at the auto shop and

405
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,360
 comes home and the players controlling him coming home.

406
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,600
 Now, obviously that sounds like Creepypasta.

407
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,920
 There's a couple of different theories I have with this too.

408
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:29,640
 And again, I have to say that this story came back, came out after we're

409
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,720
 reading it after it appeared on the iceberg.

410
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,680
 The author claims that the story was posted on 4chan three years ago.

411
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:43,200
 What's interesting is that in the story that we're reading takes, it was posted

412
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,960
 in 2017, three years ago was 2014.

413
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,320
 In 2014, New York City got its own domain.

414
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,480
 It got.nyc.

415
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,320
 The entire city now has .nyc.

416
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:02,920
 So that matches up to if the story is true, that the story takes place three

417
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,320
 years ago when he discovers this.

418
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,880
 And that was the same time that the city of New York got its own web domain.nyc.

419
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,560
 Which would explain why it's called Runescape.nyc.

420
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:16,960
 The theory that this guy's putting forward is that the people of New York,

421
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,160
 or maybe not all of them, but there are people in New York who are being

422
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,560
 controlled by players on Runescape and neither person knows either one's happening.

423
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,320
 The guy who's playing Runescape just thinks he's on a cool server.

424
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,920
 The guy in New York is just going about his job.

425
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,920
 There's the possibility that the people playing the game do know what they're doing.

426
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:41,040
 And the system is set up as an exercise in how to digitally control people.

427
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,280
 So you set up a .nyc.

428
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,560
 You basically localize the internet for New York in some way.

429
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,120
 It still has broad access, but they're setting up a network.

430
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,160
 Who's they?

431
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,880
 I don't know, the government, whoever.

432
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,640
 Again, I'm just throwing out theories here.

433
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,040
 And the people who are playing the Runescape game are doing it,

434
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,560
 knowing fully well what they're doing.

435
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:07,960
 And they're trying to see if they can control random people through this network.

436
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:12,360
 So those are the more sinister sci-fi possibilities of what's going on.

437
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,040
 That it's some sort of government control.

438
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,640
 The thing with that theory is that you would have to have,

439
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,440
 you would basically have to have the ability to control people's minds

440
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,200
 with the internet.

441
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,480
 And that's really super sci-fi.

442
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,880
 And not only control people's minds through the internet, but have no way of

443
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,480
 having it being detected.

444
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,360
 And it would have to have a pretty effective, pretty effective control rate.

445
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,200
 Because what if one day you're like grinding?

446
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,320
 I mean, anyone who plays role-playing games, you get bored after a while.

447
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,720
 Let's say you do make the guy go to work for the auto shop.

448
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,480
 And then you're like, you know what?

449
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,800
 I'm going to go and fight monsters.

450
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,480
 Is he just like going to the sewers?

451
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,000
 They're like, John, John, where are you going?

452
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,960
 You're still on the clock.

453
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,760
 And he's like lifting up a manhole and he jumps down.

454
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,520
 He's like beating up 10 goblins.

455
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,880
 So, I mean, I think that when you put a little bit of thought into it,

456
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,960
 that kind of falls out.

457
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,320
 If we do accept that this story is true, and let's do it for the sake of argument.

458
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,400
 I think it's the other way around.

459
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,840
 I think that it's not the people in the RuneScape,

460
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,520
 not the players at RuneScape who are controlling the people.

461
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,720
 I believe...

462
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,160
 Let me rephrase it.

463
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,400
 I don't necessarily believe, but let's, for the sake of argument,

464
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,120
 what is far more likely is that there is a surveillance apparatus

465
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,200
 in New York City that is being tested.

466
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,840
 And it is so advanced that what people do in real life is mirrored in the game.

467
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,760
 So you basically are using an algorithm and you could sit at a server and go,

468
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,200
 "If you know what player represents what person,

469
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,680
 you could look at the server and go, 'Oh, he's at his job today.'

470
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,720
 That's weird. How come he's not there?

471
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,040
 That's weird. Why is he talking to this person?"

472
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,440
 You would have a surveillance apparatus that would basically

473
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,800
 break down people to ones and zeros,

474
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,600
 and then you could watch them in real time on this server.

475
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,240
 That's more realistic, and that's actually more feasible.

476
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,440
 So there's no control taking place.

477
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,080
 There's no mind control.

478
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,760
 There's no player involvement.

479
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,760
 You're basically able to watch these people where they're at

480
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,120
 because you would be able to correspond,

481
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,880
 "Oh, he's in the Valley of Dorgdoth that is Brooklyn."

482
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,720
 So he's there.

483
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,000
 Why they would do this, other than like surveillance?

484
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,200
 I guess why is not the right word, but you think it would just be easier

485
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,200
 to have video cameras everywhere.

486
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,400
 But again, you might get a bunch of civil liberties stuff going on.

487
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,720
 If you're pinging people off of their cell phones

488
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,280
 and you give everyone an avatar and everyone a name

489
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,560
 and only you know what those mean,

490
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,160
 if anyone ever caught you,

491
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,480
 they would literally have to find the servers

492
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,000
 and prove that the servers are actually

493
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,800
 recorded information from real people in New York City.

494
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,920
 And of course, any court would throw that out.

495
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,280
 They're like, "What are you talking about?"

496
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,360
 I think that's what the conspiracy theory is.

497
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,440
 I don't think it's about NPCs or mind control.

498
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,800
 I think if it is real,

499
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:58,160
 it is a surveillance network that is so vast because it's undetectable.

500
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,880
 Because you take that information and you put it into a video game

501
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,320
 and unless you know the code of what to look at,

502
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,400
 it just looks like a bunch of random video people doing

503
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,400
 random video game stuff.

504
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,400
 What are they going to do?

505
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,520
 "Sapina, your server?"

506
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,800
 Yeah, like, "Yeah, sure, go ahead."

507
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,800
 It's just a bunch of dudes fighting orcs.

508
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,800
 But in real life, he's playing football or something.

509
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,800
 I don't know.

510
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,160
 But it would be a surveillance tool

511
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,840
 that you would never have to worry about showing in court,

512
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,520
 but it would give you complete view of what everyone was doing

513
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,520
 at every single time in this entire city.

514
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,520
 Spread out over multiple servers,

515
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,520
 but you're the government, you're whoever who has this type of money

516
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,520
 to throw around and you want access to that information.

517
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,520
 But basically, the .nyc wasn't like this great gift

518
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,520
 for the people of New York City.

519
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,520
 It was a way to localize their internet

520
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,520
 so this system, this surveillance system would work.

521
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,520
 Is it possible?

522
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,520
 I guess. Is it plausible?

523
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,520
 Maybe.

524
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,520
 But again, what we're going off of as far as we can see

525
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,520
 is creepypasta written after the initial iceberg was posted.

526
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,520
 So it does say that it took place earlier

527
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,520
 and we have to take, we don't have to,

528
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,520
 but we're taking this person's word for it.

529
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,520
 And they're saying people were controlled,

530
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,520
 but I think if it is anything, if it exists in any way, shape, or form,

531
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,520
 I think it may be one of the most advanced, undetectable,

532
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:23,520
 unprovable surveillance systems that exist on the planet.
