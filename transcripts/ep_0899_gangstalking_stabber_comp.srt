1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 What happens when a gang-stalking victim is pushed to the limits of his sanity?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Then we travel to Vermont to take a look at a bizarre version of the Bigfoot legend.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 When Native Americans and European settlers realize that someone keeps pulling pretty hilarious pranks on them,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 they have to wonder, "Is this the work of a human or the beast known as "slippery skin"?

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 [Music]

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Garvin,

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 I'm having a great day, I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Hope you guys don't have as bad as allergies as I do.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 I'm getting dangerously close to overdosing on Benadryl.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Until I fall into a dark spiral of delirium.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Let's go ahead and get some episodes recorded so they can release them while I'm in the mental hospital.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 First off, coming into Dead Rabbit Command, one of our Christmas livestream contributors,

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 I'm still working my way through that list.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 So many people keep donating to the show, it's so awesome.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Coming on is the middle of June, he's dressed up like Santa Claus, he's sweating super hard.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Give it up for Joe Logan.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 He's like, "I don't even listen to the show anymore, bro. I don't even remember donating money on Christmas."

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Joe, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 If you guys can't afford to pay to your own, that's fine too.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Or the livestream or any way financially, that's totally fine.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Just helps for the word about the show that really, really, really helps out a lot.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Get the word out, it helps the show grow.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Joe, let's go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 We're gonna jump off the highest point of Dead Rabbit Command and we're gonna glide all the way out to Missouri.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 I found this posted online the other day, it was actually posted five years ago, but I just stumbled across it.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 The person who posted this has completely deleted their account, so we don't know who posted it.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 And that's concerning.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 It's concerning because this guy, I mean, this is five years ago, this guy may have snapped by now

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 and already gone on some sort of violent spree, but we talk a lot about gangstalking on this show.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 I'll try to put a couple episodes in the show notes. It's something we keep coming back to.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 I find it so fascinating because it's just this bizarre mental illness that feeds off other people's mental illness.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Now, I will say, people do get gangstalked.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 The government will stalk people because they think that they're spies

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 or they think they have some information that they need, and gangs, criminal organizations will stalk people as well.

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 So there is a thing where it's a legal definition where you're stalked by three or more people is what gangstalking is.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 But there's also the mental illness that when you're walking down the street and every third person you're seeing

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 is wearing a white t-shirt, that's a signal to other gangstalkers and every so often you'll be walking on the street

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 and someone will be dribbling a ball and that's a message to other gangstalkers.

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Like, you get that level of paranoia.

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Every time I leave for work I see a black Subaru driving behind me.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Well, they also have a life and they also have to go somewhere and their commute is probably when yours is.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 This is where that paranoia kicks in.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 And we're going to go ahead and call this guy Terry. I don't actually know his name.

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 If that's your actual name, it was just a guess.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 What's weird is for someone who believes they're being gangstalked, they give a lot of information out.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 This person states that they live in Oklahoma City, Missouri, and they live in the Edmund neighborhood.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 You would think you're being stalked. You would want to cover up your identity more than anyone.

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 But I've actually come across the accounts of gangstalkers and because they believe the government already knows everything about them

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 and there's this huge conspiracy to stalk them, why hide information?

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Fascinating, fascinating, you know? They figure what's the point. Everyone already knows everything.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 So this guy, he posted this, this is what really caught my attention.

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 He put this post on the conspiracy subreddit and he says this is the title of it.

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 So if I know or 95% sure that the CIA NSA are messing with my life, pretty much destroyed it,

55
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 and are trying to get pics of me with little kids, should I tell anyone?

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Who? Help, please.

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Now the conspiracy subreddit obviously has its own set of lunatics running around,

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 but gangstalking is actually an ostracized community within the conspiracy community.

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 You have serious conspiracy theorists who look at government and business conspiracies,

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 and then you have people who are flat earthers and the moon's fake and monkeys don't exist and stuff like that.

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 And there's a pretty wide gap between those two.

62
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Even a flat earther thinks gangstalkers are cuckoo.

63
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 So this post didn't get much engagement, but it really caught my eye when he's saying they want to get pictures of him with little kids.

64
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 And I was reading this, this is just such a journey, I want to take you on your life, please don't do it.

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Please don't tell me about the rantings of this man, man. Too late.

66
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 He talks about when he goes for a walk, it's so interesting because he has such a little self-awareness.

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 This guy whose mental illness is so obvious by his writing,

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 so you have to imagine that it's obvious just standing next to this guy that he's mentally ill.

69
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 He says, "A lot of times I'm walking down the street with my 100 pound dog, and there's always kids in front of me, and they're always crying."

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 I'm thinking maybe because there's some lunatic, maybe there's some lunatic with a giant dog behind him.

71
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 He goes, "Every time I leave my house there's a bunch of kids in front of me, and I can't get around them and they're crying."

72
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 And he thinks that these kids are being put there by the government.

73
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 These kids are probably just walking to school, right? It's a neighborhood.

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 He thinks that the government is putting these kids here in front of him, and he believes that these children in front of him,

75
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 this is going to get real dark real quick, he believes these kids that are always in front of him are pizza gate victims.

76
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 So basically, you're basically from the point of view of the kids, right?

77
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 These kids are walking down the street, totally normal kids on their way to school.

78
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 A crazy man, a man that your parents have probably told you to stay away from, starts walking behind you with his big dog,

79
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 and you don't want to be around that guy, he's giving off weird vibes, and you're just a normal kid.

80
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 You're just a normal kid on your way to school, you're being followed by this guy.

81
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Now, let's switch back to Terry's point of view. He's looking at the same group of kids and think they have all been molested by members of the Democratic Party.

82
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 They're just on their way to school, bro, they're just on their way to school.

83
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Why are you transposing that thing? He's saying that these kids are being forced by the government to walk in front of him,

84
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 and he goes the way that they're crying. He's always talking about these kids crying, is that I think they were forced into some pedestrian stuff.

85
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Anyways, he thinks, we're just getting started here, when he sees kids walking on the street, he thinks they're victims of pizza gate,

86
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 and they're always crying, and he can't figure it out, but it could be because you're a lunatic and you're walking behind them.

87
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 He talks about, you know, I use the examples of the people wearing the white shirts, or the kid dribbling the basketball,

88
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 he talks about people clicking.

89
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 He says that's how the gangstalkers communicate with each other, they click, and they have little clickers.

90
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 He goes, he tells this long story, I'm gonna spare you a lot of the details, but he doesn't involve children, he doesn't involve children.

91
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Apparently, one time he was in the airport, he was trying to go through security check, he has a hundred pound dog,

92
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 they're like, sir, you can't take this hundred pound dog on the plane.

93
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 He's standing there in the line, and these kids jump in front of him in line, and then someone walked up right behind his ear and clicked the pin, click, click,

94
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 and he thought that was like, showing that the CIA was giving orders to the kids in front of him.

95
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 And if I remember correctly, it's, yeah, I haven't written down my notes, I don't have to remember it.

96
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Two clicks for yes, one click for no.

97
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 You figure most pins do that, right? Click, click, when you, you know, the pin, but anyways, he believes that all of this is some CIA technology to communicate with each other.

98
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 He gives this interesting backstory, and this could be an origin, right?

99
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 He said, listen, in 2015, this is when this all started, he goes, I lived in New York City, and I had it all.

100
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Nice car, I slept around with a bunch of girls, I would go to the electronic music festivals, EDM music, I had lots of sex, lots of drugs,

101
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 so he might have just totally wasted his brain away on E.

102
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 But who knows? So he, in 2015, he has it all, and then his wife, I don't know if she was part of this party scene either, she might have been working.

103
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 Apparently his wife finished her college and she was getting ready to start her career, and wherever she applied, she couldn't get accepted.

104
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 And he was like, well, that's weird, because you seem overqualified for a lot of these jobs. She's like, yeah, no one will hire me.

105
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 And so this is when he thinks the CIA starts interfering with his life.

106
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 They end up, the only job she can get is in Oklahoma City, Missouri.

107
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 So he's like, oh no, imagine leaving behind the party scene in New York City, and you're like, oh, I hope I like country music.

108
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 I hope it's electronic country music. Can I still do ecstasy out here?

109
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 They moved to Oklahoma City, they're in the Edmund neighborhood, and what he starts to believe is that they, they being the CIA, wanted him there so they could keep a better eye on him.

110
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 And then he just starts listening off just random weirdness.

111
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 He says, I've moved into Oklahoma City and my cat got sick, and I took him to the vet, and the vet tried holding my cat hostage.

112
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 And he says that he tells the story, when he's telling the story about the vet, he describes himself as a scary man.

113
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 He goes, I'm not bragging, I can just make people frightened of me.

114
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 And so he frightened me, he scared the vet into giving his cat back.

115
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Now what I imagine was, the vet took the cat, I don't think the vet has sent a hostage video of a cat back to this dude.

116
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 The cat's all tied up to a chair with a little bag over its head, and the vet's like, ha ha ha ha ha.

117
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 You need to pay your bill, I think this is what he needed to pay his bill.

118
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 He probably had some work done, and the, actually I don't know if vets do that, do vets do that?

119
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 You take your dog in to get like a root canal or something, get a thorn taken out of its paw.

120
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 And then you're like, oh that's great, can I have my dog back in there?

121
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 Like, I can not tell you pay me money, I don't know how that works actually.

122
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 That would be kind of hilarious.

123
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 That'd be a total racket, I'd be like, getting these super expensive dogs and performing unnecessary surgeries.

124
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 I wouldn't perform the surgery, I would just say, oh, his gallbladder's removed and I'd hold out like a piece of raw liver.

125
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 There you go, give me $10,000 or you don't get your dog back, I don't know how that works.

126
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 And then I eat the liver, oh, they're like, oh it's disgusting, is that really a gallbladder?

127
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 You'll never know, it's in my tummy.

128
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 He talks about his vet, he talks about scaring his vet into getting his cat back.

129
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 He meets this evil psychiatrist.

130
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 He meets this evil psychiatrist, I don't know if this person's real, I don't know if this person's real, but he calls her Anita Walker.

131
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Sounds like a fake name.

132
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Sounds like a name that Bart Simpson would call a bar, Anita Walker.

133
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Anita Walker, and I'd be terrified if I was her.

134
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 I thought about whether or not to use her name.

135
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 I was thinking, someone might listen to this and might be a friend of Anita Walker's and say, hey, did you know that a guy was posting online about how evil she was?

136
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 And as the story continues, you'll understand that this is more than just a guy ranting online.

137
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 This is a very dangerous individual.

138
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 He's talking to this psychiatrist, Anita Walker, and he's talking about how evil she is because she, shocker of shockers, tries to put him on medication to make him less nuts.

139
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 She's trying to medicate him, and he's like, what, I don't need Prozac, that's what the CIA wants me to take Prozac.

140
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 I'm not going to take it, but he ends up taking it.

141
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Weird, right?

142
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 I mean, he's probably good that he's taken it, he obviously has some mental issues.

143
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 But he starts taking Prozac and at the same time he's going to a doctor and he gets diagnosed with low testosterone.

144
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 So that doctor starts prescribing him testosterone gel.

145
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 And this does make him go nuts.

146
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Taking the prozac, starting Prozac is really hard.

147
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 So he's starting Prozac, he's starting testosterone challenge, it must have been a delight.

148
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 I'm sure his wife loved hanging out with this guy, we'll get to her in a second.

149
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 But he starts taking this stuff and then he realizes, no, he doesn't have low testosterone.

150
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 He said he snuck into another doctor's office and got a test.

151
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 I don't know if he wore a mustache, he's like, hello, I'm not insane.

152
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Mr. Not Insane, can you test me for my low test?

153
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 Do I really have low testosterone?

154
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Apparently he says he went to another doctor's office and snuck away or whatever.

155
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 And they said he didn't have low testosterone and then he started, again, this guy's nuts.

156
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 This is so fascinating because what I imagine, we covered a story like this, I think, last week,

157
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 where a guy was hallucinating, he would say one thing, but he would hallucinate something else.

158
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 He would hallucinate you begging him to murder you.

159
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 This is the same thing.

160
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Here's a quote he has from his meetings with Anita Walker.

161
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 He says, quote, I stopped taking the medicine, I'm changing around some of the customers here.

162
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 I stopped taking the medicine after I realized the evil that is Anita Walker.

163
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 And she was messing with me the whole time.

164
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Okay, that's fair, that's his opinion.

165
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 Then he continues, I think she was telling me about how her daughter likes illegal porn or protects it.

166
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 What?

167
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 He, it's weird because he seems to have a fascination with children.

168
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 And he seems to think that his fascination with children is coming from the government.

169
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Now, we did an episode a long time ago about intrusive thoughts, where that is a very popular intrusive thought,

170
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 where people are like, oh my God, am I a pedophile?

171
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 And they get stuck in the, they're not.

172
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 They don't watch child porn, they find the idea completely repulsive.

173
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 But for whatever reason, like suicide is a very popular intrusive thought.

174
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Homicide is a very popular intrusive thought, and so is child pedophilia.

175
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 And it's just your brain gets stuck in a programming loop,

176
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 it thinks of the worst thing you could possibly think of, and then makes you go, what if I did that?

177
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 And it causes this loop. It's super common. People get intrusive thoughts all the time.

178
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 That's what I'm thinking. He might have, but instead of going, oh, this is a very common medical thing,

179
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 and I'm not actually a murderer, I sit there laying next to my wife and I go,

180
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 what if I bashed her head in right now with a hammer?

181
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 And then that scares you because you love your wife.

182
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 And then you, you have to get out of that intrusive thought cycle.

183
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 A lot of times it just leads to anxiety attacks.

184
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Very, very, very, very rarely does it ever lead to you picking a hammer up and killing your wife.

185
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Very rarely. But you're just afraid you might. It's your worst fear.

186
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Your brain gets stuck in a loop of your worst fear.

187
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 That's probably what's happening with this guy, but he keeps bringing it up.

188
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 He keeps bringing up, which would show that it's an intrusive thought.

189
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 But I don't think that Anita Walker's daughter is involved in the illegal pornography business.

190
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 So he must be hallucinating these conversations.

191
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 So it's even worse than an intrusive thought.

192
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 And then, so he deals with that. He stops taking the prozac and then he has to go take care of the doctor

193
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 who prescribed him the testosterone gel because he's in on it as well, right?

194
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 He doesn't need that. And so we have this other quote.

195
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 This is him going to the doctor's office who said he had a low test.

196
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Quote, "So I go over to his office in a wee bit of a huff and put, this makes no sense.

197
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 I don't understand what this means. I will, we'll break it down.

198
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 We know if we're going to get to the Bigfoot story. I'm so fascinated with all this stuff."

199
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 Quote, "So I go over to his office in a wee bit of a huff and put him in a situation involving metal and muscle and necks that issue the truth."

200
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 CIA. It's the CIA. Well, what do you know? There it is.

201
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 What does that mean? I didn't change any of the words there.

202
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 I didn't change any of the cuss words he actually said, "wee bit of a huff."

203
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 I put him in a situation involving metal and muscle and necks.

204
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Did he get this doctor in a headlock? Did he walk into this doctor's office

205
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 and get this doctor in a headlock until he admitted it's the CIA?

206
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 CIA, it's the CIA. That's what the doctor's saying.

207
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 What in the world is going on?

208
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 Don't you think that should have been in the news? This was so weird about this.

209
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 That should have been in the news.

210
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Man walks into... Maniwes Lotus Dostrone.

211
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Walks into a doctor's office, gets him in a headlock until the guy starts screaming out, "It's the CIA."

212
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Bizarre. Absolutely bizarre. That's the only thing I can imagine.

213
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 But see, at a certain point we don't have to imagine.

214
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 Because he wrote another post, a follow-up post, to this called "A Day in the Life of What It's Like to Horrible, Hellish, Life Distur-

215
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 His grammar is- I guess that's the least of his problems, right? He's mentally insane.

216
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 His grammar can have a few errors here and there.

217
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 "A Day in the Life of What It's Like" This is the title of it.

218
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 "A Day in the Life of What It's Like to Horrible, Hellish, Life Distur-

219
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 Twilight Zone I Now Call Reality."

220
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 Now in the earlier post he talks a lot about his wife and he says his wife is constantly crying.

221
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 And he seems to think that she's crying because the CIA is tormenting them as a family.

222
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 But again, I think it's just a total lack of self-awareness.

223
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 I think she's crying because her husband is losing it. He's going insane.

224
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 This post where he's talking about a normal day in his life.

225
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Starts off he says, "I wake up from the normal nightmares that I always have and then the very next line was,

226
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 'See my wife of 16 years off to work, the one I can no longer trust, as I've caught her doing suspicious things several times.'"

227
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 Strange.

228
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 So now his wife is clearly in the crosshairs of his illness.

229
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 Like before she was an ally, before she was someone the CIA was also hurting because it was trying to hurt him.

230
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 But now, could you imagine being in that situation?

231
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 Could you imagine living with someone who thought you were an agent of the CIA?

232
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 Hope she doesn't collect she brings home a box of crickets one day. She's like, "Hey, look it! My new pets!"

233
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 And he's just clicking all night long.

234
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Crazy. Anyways, he then goes, he leaves his house with his 100-pound dog. They go for a walk.

235
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 And he goes, "I know that the entire neighborhood is spying on me, because this is how crazy things are.

236
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 I'm walking down the street and I see these guys cutting the limbs off of a tree.

237
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 And then there's a woman and a baby stroller right by them.

238
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 There's a woman and a baby stroller going down the sidewalk. These guys are cutting limbs off the trees.

239
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 And he goes, "How insane would you have to be to take a baby and a stroller by a tree where they're cutting limbs?"

240
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 He answers his own question, because he then demonstrates.

241
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 There's only two places to walk, right?

242
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 She's walking with her baby, pushing the stroller down the sidewalk.

243
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 And he goes, "I'm too smart to fall for that trick. I'm smarter than that woman and her baby."

244
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 "I'm not gonna walk on the sidewalk."

245
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 He then says that he's walking down the middle of the road.

246
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 He's walking right down the center of the road.

247
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 So I imagine the mother weighed her options.

248
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 She could either walk by a tree that had guys cut.

249
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 They weren't literally like cutting limbs off of their falling on the sidewalk. It was just close.

250
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 She goes, "I could do this or I could walk in the middle of the street."

251
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 And there's that guy with that giant dog, that lunatic, that keeps making all the kids cry.

252
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 So that's the only other option.

253
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 So he thinks he's so smart because he's walking on the middle of the street with his dog.

254
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 And of course, again, when you're doing that and people are gonna stare at you,

255
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 you're gonna think you're being gangstalked, but you're just doing weird stuff.

256
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Then he passes by a construction site and he notices something.

257
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 You can criticize a lot of things about him.

258
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 He's crippling mental illness, the fact that he gets doctors and headlocks.

259
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 But he definitely has an eye for observation.

260
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 He's walking on the-- they're wrong observations, right?

261
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 He's walking on the street, he sees a construction site.

262
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 And he says that everyone on the-- I don't know what to make of this, either.

263
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 He says everyone on the construction site is wearing, quote, "brand new construction outfits."

264
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 What's a-- first off, what's a construction outfit?

265
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Like a hard hat and a little vest?

266
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 I mean, that's it, right?

267
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 I mean, is that suspicious if like the boss is like, "You know what?

268
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 You guys have been so good at constructing lately.

269
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 Here's brand new hats.

270
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 I was giving you those straw hats.

271
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 That wasn't really helping you guys when girders and hammers were falling on your head.

272
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 Here's some brand new hard hats.

273
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 And I gave you some shiny vests as well.

274
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 That's it.

275
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 I mean, were they also wearing like brand new Levi's and a brand new plaid shirt or whatever,

276
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 but brand new construction outfits.

277
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 So he's walking on the street, he sees a construction site,

278
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 everyone's wearing a brand new construction outfit.

279
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 And then also on the opposite side of the street, there's three women,

280
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 three middle-aged women wearing brand new construction outfits as well, right?

281
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 They're hard hats on and their little vest and he says they're laughing and taking pictures of him.

282
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 Now, if you think, Jason, you've just kind of been reading the rancings of a madman.

283
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 That would be a correct summary of the past 20-some-on minutes,

284
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 but this is what we get to.

285
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Remember, this took place five years ago.

286
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 These posts were put up five years ago.

287
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 And this is an average day.

288
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 This is what happens when he's walking on the street, he sees these women.

289
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 "These women have their phones out laughing, having fun,

290
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 and taking photos or video of me.

291
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Okay, well, just another goddamn day in the twilight zone.

292
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 If I hadn't had my dog with me, I would have ran over there and started stabbing."

293
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 Unquote.

294
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 So this dude, from here on out for the rest of his day, for the rest of his day,

295
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 he has this knife on him and he just describes situations where he has to restrain

296
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 from stabbing people.

297
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Later in that same day, we get to this quote,

298
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 "I get in an alleyway and a Hispanic man and his little dog are walking.

299
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 I get that feeling this guy is here for me.

300
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 This isn't an organic situation, so I pull out my knife to kill him."

301
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 He books it.

302
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 Unquote.

303
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 Again, if the kids in the neighborhood are crying when they see you,

304
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 it's not because they work for the CIA, it's probably because everyone knows you have a knife

305
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 and you're pulling it out on people.

306
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 The women had no idea he was thinking about stabbing them all.

307
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 And the only reason he didn't was because he had his dog,

308
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 but he has this dog later on and he's in the alleyway and he feels,

309
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 he gets quote, "that feeling."

310
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 And he wants to stab this dude, this dude walking this little dog.

311
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Quote.

312
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 "I am now at the park."

313
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 At a certain point, at a certain point, he just goes home, bro.

314
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 At a certain point, while he's walking down the street,

315
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 why are you going to the park?

316
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 Why are you at the dog park and you're like,

317
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 "Oh, this is where I love to relax.

318
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 This is my favorite stabbing space.

319
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 Just go home."

320
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 Quote.

321
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 "I am now at the park, almost home."

322
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 So maybe he wasn't on the slides.

323
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 Now that I read those extra two words, maybe.

324
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 He's like, "Weee!"

325
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 He's sliding out of the slide stabbing people.

326
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 Maybe he's just walking past the park.

327
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 Maybe he wasn't like, "It's time for a snow cone.

328
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Hopefully no one spies on me and I don't have to kill anyone."

329
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Quote.

330
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 "I am now at the park, almost home."

331
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 A van full of people, all looking at me, are pulling in.

332
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 And a young man behind me holding some type of hoverboard.

333
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 He's holding some type of hoverboard looking thing.

334
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Now you would think, is it the hoverboard with a giant wheel?

335
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 No, because he actually thinks it's a hoverboard from Back to the Future.

336
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 Because he says, "Are those real now?"

337
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 So did the guy just have a regular skateboard?

338
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 I don't know what.

339
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 I mean, this matter, he's going to stab all these people.

340
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 It doesn't matter.

341
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 Like, what the guy's actually holding.

342
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 They're going to get stabbed.

343
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 So let me start this over again.

344
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 Let me start this back here.

345
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 The van full of people, all looking at me, are pulling in.

346
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 And a young man behind me holding some type of hoverboard looking thing.

347
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 Are those real now?

348
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 Is behind me.

349
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 I reach for my weapon just in case they all back off.

350
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 I get home.

351
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Unquote.

352
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 So it must be known in this community that this guy carries a pretty big knife.

353
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 I don't think he's reaching for like a little boy scout knife.

354
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 He's like, "Oh, I'm poking in the belly."

355
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 And the people leave.

356
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 Now again, it's also weird because he could be in such the throes of a hallucinatory world

357
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 that maybe none of this is happening.

358
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 Like, what if he's just walking on the street and none of these events happening.

359
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 But then later on, he has to leave the house again.

360
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 I can't believe this guy would even live in this neighborhood.

361
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 How the, how the, very least the homeowners association hasn't kicked him out.

362
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 Let alone the police.

363
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 Later on after a long day of almost having people.

364
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 He has to go to the pharmacy to get some medicine.

365
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 So he gets in his car.

366
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 This guy has a driver's license.

367
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 He gets in his car and he's driving on the road to go to the pharmacy.

368
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 And someone is driving a truck and he thought this guy was following him.

369
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 And then the truck passes him.

370
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 He, according to him, according to him, he then did the pit maneuver.

371
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 It's where you hit their back tire and cause them to spin out.

372
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 And then the guy drove away and drove to a Chinese restaurant and ran into the Chinese restaurant.

373
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 And he's like, oh, I was totally, I totally was gonna stab that guy, but too many witnesses.

374
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 And then he got, he just went to the pharmacy, the Chinese restaurant's next to the pharmacy.

375
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 He's like, oh, I'm here.

376
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 Might as well go pick up my tile and all.

377
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 And then the end, he does get his medicine.

378
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 He walks in.

379
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 He's like, oh, I'm an order some Chinese food as well.

380
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 He's sharpening chopsticks.

381
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 He's just spoken to people.

382
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 He's walking through the restaurant.

383
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 He let this guy go.

384
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 Thankfully, he then goes home.

385
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 And here's the final sentence of this post.

386
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 The end of his day, it says, quote, I get back home and the clicks start again.

387
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 Wife hears them too.

388
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 This guy hasn't posted anything in five years.

389
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 Well, his account's been deleted.

390
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 So I mean, he might have, he might have had an alternative account stabbing McStavenstein.

391
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 But what is just a terrifying look at that, right?

392
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 Like this guy has to be in jail by now.

393
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 This guy either needs to have been locked up for his own good and for the good of other people, or he stabbed someone by now.

394
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 This guy has to be in jail by now, right?

395
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 Something had to have happened to this guy actually tried researching like Edmund stabbings and, you know, people get stabbed in the city.

396
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 It's not unusual, unfortunately.

397
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 There's a couple of people getting stabbed, but none that I could, all the suspects were way too young.

398
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 One was 16 years old.

399
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 This guy was married to his wife, he's just 16.

400
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 So unless she was into zygotes, unless she loved banging fetuses, I doubt that it's the same person.

401
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 But it's creepy.

402
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 Like the fact that this guy exists in the community.

403
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 We have a couple of different things to look at here.

404
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 We'll wrap it up like this.

405
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 One, he exists in the community and everybody knows that he's a problem.

406
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 Because he's walking around with a knife pulling it out on people, hitting people with their cars and things like that.

407
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 And then people aren't reporting it to the police because obviously that was a single day in his life.

408
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 He pulled the knife on like a bunch of different people.

409
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 People aren't reporting it to the police.

410
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 Two, which is troubling, right?

411
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 You should call the police when people are trying to stab me.

412
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 I shouldn't have to tell you that.

413
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Someone's trying to stab you, call the police.

414
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 Or even if it's not you, if you're looking out your window and you see a guy, cause a car crash.

415
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 The dude gets out of the car and runs into the Chinese restaurant.

416
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Call the police and then call for some Chinese takeout.

417
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 But then it's also troubling to think what if none of this is happening but he's that crazy he thinks it is.

418
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 Like he's walking down the middle of the street and there's just a tree there.

419
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 No one's cutting it down.

420
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 There's no woman or the baby.

421
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 Or he's walking out the street with his dog and he's hallucinating crying children.

422
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 Victims of child abuse children in front of him.

423
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 Like what's creepier?

424
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 Think about it on a realistic level.

425
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 What's creepier? Really think about this.

426
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Walking down the street, what's creepier?

427
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 A bunch of crying children who have been subjected to horrible abuse.

428
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 Or, okay that's creepy. That's the worst one.

429
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 What's creepier? Forget that one.

430
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 What's creepier? Walking down the street and there's a bunch of children crying in front of you.

431
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 Or, okay that one's pretty creepy too. It's creepy if it's real.

432
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 But you know what I mean? Like imagine if your hallucinations were that vivid.

433
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 That you could hallucinate a group of crying children and you build this whole backstory for them to explain the vision.

434
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 And like there was not a construction site.

435
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 It was like a fully built CVS pharmacy.

436
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 But he's hallucinating so badly he sees people working with his new uniforms on.

437
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 Like that is terrifying to me as well.

438
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 That he's that lost.

439
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 And you have to think like yeah people in this community probably know about him.

440
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 But do they know he's posting? Like do they know the depth of his insanity?

441
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 It's just creepy to think that this guy's out there and he's just the guy posting online.

442
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 I'm sure that we interact with these people.

443
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 It's not super common right? I'm not gonna say it's your boss at work who's hallucinating you crying in the corner.

444
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 But now that would be terrifying too, right?

445
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 Like for what? Whatever you give me the job review.

446
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 You always say that I spend at least three hours a day sobbing in the corner.

447
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 I clearly don't do that.

448
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 He's like well I do see you do that.

449
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 And I've thought about stabbing you once or twice just to get you working again.

450
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 You're like what?

451
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 Like this guy, I mean obviously this guy has a driver's license right?

452
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 He can move around town.

453
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 He was functional enough at one point to hold down a job.

454
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 So was it just like a mental decay?

455
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 Did he just blow his mind out with drugs?

456
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 Who knows? But whatever the origin story is, he's out there.

457
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 And he might still be out there.

458
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 The fact that he's a council leader and he hasn't posted makes me think that he did something.

459
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 He did something and he got incarcerated.

460
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 I can't imagine his wife still with him right?

461
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 Could you imagine living in a situation like that?

462
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 Absolutely insane.

463
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 And this is, we have the gang stalking and then we just have an underlying mental illness colliding to the point that

464
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 he cannot tell what's real and what's false and his narrative makes it hard for us to tell what's real and what's false.

465
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 Did he get a doctor and a headlock?

466
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 Like shouldn't he have gone to jail for that?

467
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 But if nobody's calling the cops, if everyone truly is afraid of him or they only know their single interaction with him,

468
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 they may go it's not worth it, but man what a cancer on the city of Oklahoma City.

469
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 Right to have someone like this out there.

470
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 A terrifying story when the world of gang stalking collides with the real world,

471
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 there's only two ways these stories get resolved.

472
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 The authorities deal with it before or after it becomes a serious problem.

473
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 Either he gets the help that he needs, which of course he's going to say is just part of the conspiracy, right?

474
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 When he's forced to undergo medical treatment, mental medical help is just part of the system taking him down.

475
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 Or they can come in and clean up the mess afterwards.

476
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 And by then it's too late for somebody, right?

477
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 Instead of having mental health counselors, he's now in prison.

478
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 If not, you know, murder, suicide or something like that.

479
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 It's a terrifying story.

480
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 Are any of these people still alive?

481
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 How's his wife doing?

482
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 How is he doing?

483
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 How's that man with the dog in the alley doing?

484
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 The story of Terry is the story of a man in the middle of a delusional world.

485
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 One where he is an important enough figure that the CIA wants to take him down.

486
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 It makes him feel strong.

487
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 It makes him feel important.

488
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 Even though they've ruined his life, it makes him special that the CIA would want to destroy him.

489
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 But in the end, Terry will most likely, if he hasn't already, destroy himself.

490
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 He'll stab someone.

491
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 He'll kill someone.

492
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 He'll commit a crime that ends up throwing him behind bars.

493
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 And if he thinks that he's being gangstalked now, if he thinks that every single move that he makes is being watched by hateful eyes,

494
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 if he thinks that his life is a hellish reality now, that is nothing compared to what he will face day after day for decades

495
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 in a Missouri prison.
