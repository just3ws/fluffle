1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,760
 A woman opens up her closet one morning and finds something unusual.

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:17,460
 And then we take a look at the creepy world of children, everyone's favorite little goblins.

3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:23,640
 We need them to repopulate the earth, but why are they so creepy and weird?

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,640
 We don't know.

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,680
 And we're going to take a look at a story of a young child who all of a sudden develops

6
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,200
 a new habit.

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,720
 But is it possible that this kid is just going through a bit of growing pains or has the

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,040
 world of the supernatural taken them over?

9
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,200
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:54,480
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,320
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

12
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,320
 I'm having a great day.

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,320
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,320
 I hope you guys are staying warm wherever you're at.

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,320
 Having fun, that's secondary as long as you're warm.

16
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,200
 I'd rather be warm and bored than cold and having fun.

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,220
 But someone who knows how to do both, I think most people know how to do both.

18
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,320
 But this guy in particular does, walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now is a long time

19
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,840
 legacy Patreon supporter.

20
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,840
 Everyone give it up for AZ.

21
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,840
 Woohoo!

22
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,840
 Yeah!

23
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,840
 Come on in buddy.

24
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,840
 Look at him.

25
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,560
 He's playing Parcheasy and he has a jacket on.

26
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,320
 AZ, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

27
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,680
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

28
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,680
 I do.

29
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,720
 This helps read the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

30
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,840
 That helps out so, so much.

31
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,320
 And a quick update.

32
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,120
 Pretty soon the end of season 20 is coming.

33
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,320
 That's where I take a two week break.

34
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,320
 And that does coincide with my appearance at the Oregon Ghost Conference in Seaside,

35
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,320
 Oregon.

36
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,680
 It's a three day event.

37
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,120
 It's like $15 and that includes all three days of speakers and vendor tables and all

38
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,000
 sorts of fun stuff.

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,280
 I will be giving a lecture speech.

40
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,960
 I don't know what the best term is for it.

41
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,160
 But I've written it.

42
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,160
 I haven't written it yet.

43
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,160
 I'm not going to write it.

44
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,320
 I'm just going to write some notes down like I do with the show.

45
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,440
 We see how well these go all the time.

46
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,880
 I will be giving a presentation.

47
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,880
 That was the term I'm looking for.

48
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,880
 A presentation.

49
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,000
 Why are there no fat ghosts?

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,640
 And that will be on opening day, March 24th at 6pm in Seaside, Oregon.

51
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,000
 So I'll leave all the info in the show notes.

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,760
 It would be so awesome to have you guys there.

53
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:37,520
 I'm pretty sure they think I'm trolling them at this point because they asked for a bio

54
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,520
 photo.

55
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,320
 They asked for a bio photo.

56
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,720
 And I think for this episode's art I will include, I will do like a little montage of

57
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,960
 the three pictures I sent them.

58
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,920
 I don't have any photographs of myself.

59
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,880
 I never have photographs of myself.

60
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:00,960
 Pictures I sent them was a promo for a play I did where I was a king, King Richard or

61
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,120
 Prince Richard I think at the time.

62
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,880
 A photo of me putting on an Easter Bunny outfit so I don't have the head but I'm wearing

63
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,400
 a big white fuzzy suit.

64
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,920
 The giant yellow bow tie.

65
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,920
 And oh the other one was me in the winter wearing an eye patch.

66
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,720
 I'm pretty sure they think I'm trolling them at this point but I'm not.

67
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,360
 Those are the three best photos of me doing stuff that I don't do.

68
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,600
 I'm not a prince.

69
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,280
 I don't normally wear an eye patch.

70
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,000
 I do when it gets cold and I'm definitely not the Easter Bunny or am I.

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,600
 But let's go ahead and get started here.

72
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,320
 AZ, I'm going to toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

73
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,120
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

74
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,000
 Drive us all the way out to Georgia.

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,120
 Nice leisurely ride all the way out to the Peach State.

76
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,520
 The reason why we're headed out to Georgia is we're about to meet a mother.

77
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,320
 We're going to go ahead and call her Nancy.

78
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,320
 That's not her real name.

79
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,240
 We're giving her that name.

80
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,520
 She just recently posted this online.

81
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:14,320
 February 21st is when it went up and she goes "I can't make any sense of this."

82
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,400
 This is to be fair an incredibly puzzling story and really there's a few options we

83
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,480
 have but let's take a look at the story itself.

84
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:29,280
 Sounds completely armless but let's take a look at this because it's just so weird.

85
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:36,320
 Nancy said a few weeks ago she went to her closet to retrieve an article of clothing

86
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,400
 and in her closet is a coat.

87
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,600
 But it's not where she normally puts her coats.

88
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,080
 Okay you're like Jason seriously?

89
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,080
 Seriously?

90
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,920
 I misplace stuff all the time.

91
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,920
 Let me finish.

92
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,640
 Let me finish because it's going to sound like this is super mundane but the deeper I get

93
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,200
 into it you're going to be like that is super weird.

94
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,200
 Nancy found it.

95
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,560
 She opened up her closet.

96
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,920
 She found a coat where she normally doesn't put her coats.

97
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,560
 So she has like a pretty organized closet.

98
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,560
 I don't.

99
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,080
 I don't know if it goes on a hanger it's in there.

100
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:19,080
 She said that this coat was a heavy winter coat and she lives in Georgia.

101
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,320
 She goes "I would never buy a heavy winter coat because I live in Georgia it's the sweatiest

102
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,760
 state known in the universe.

103
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,760
 It's a heavy winter coat.

104
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,160
 It's a Calvin Klein coat."

105
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,080
 She goes "This coat is way out of my price range."

106
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:41,560
 And then it's a petite size.

107
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,040
 And she goes "Listen I know I don't have a photo of myself up on the internet but trust

108
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,560
 me I'm not petite."

109
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,040
 She goes "I'm five foot eight.

110
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,560
 I'm 200 pounds.

111
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,240
 She's a veteran."

112
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,240
 She's not a petite.

113
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,240
 Not saying that petite people can't be veterans.

114
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,240
 Maybe they can.

115
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,640
 Probably it's a height requirement to join the military right?

116
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,920
 I think there's a height and a weight requirement.

117
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:07,520
 Anyway she's five foot eight she's 200 pounds and she goes "I'm looking at this coat and

118
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,840
 I'm thinking there is no way I bought this coat."

119
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,880
 It's the wrong type of coat for Georgia.

120
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,200
 It's too expensive and it would never fit me.

121
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:29,400
 But yet here is this coat hung up in my closet still wrapped in the plastic to protect it.

122
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,040
 This isn't my coat.

123
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:39,320
 It was really interesting to read her post because she is basically debunking it as

124
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,440
 she's going by saying all that stuff like I couldn't afford it.

125
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,880
 But she goes "Listen I gotta be honest.

126
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,800
 I did see some stuff when I was a veteran.

127
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,320
 I have PTSD and I don't have the best memory.

128
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,080
 But you know what does have a great memory?

129
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,520
 The computer.

130
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,240
 So she will allow herself.

131
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,200
 Maybe I bought this maybe one time I was a petite she's like "What?

132
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,640
 I woke up one morning and I was five foot eight."

133
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:10,480
 She went to her computer she began looking at she began going through her emails to see

134
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,280
 if she could find an online order.

135
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,640
 And that was the other thing she also goes in pretty much a hermit.

136
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,360
 I am in the house 90% of the time.

137
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:24,200
 I don't ever really leave very rarely do shopping in the real world or release clothes shopping.

138
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,800
 She doesn't buy everything online.

139
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,520
 So I went I started looking through my emails for any proof that I had ordered this jacket

140
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,200
 because I'll be honest with you guys.

141
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,200
 Maybe I forgot.

142
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,800
 I didn't mean that I have poor memory and that I suffer from PTSD.

143
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:46,600
 It's possible that I bought this jacket that was I mean think about it I mean it's possible

144
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,400
 that I bought this jacket that's the wrong size that's too much money I can afford it.

145
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,440
 Had it shipped here opened up the package go huh and then hung it up and forgot all of

146
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,880
 that stuff but the computer never forgets so she's going through her emails to see if

147
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,520
 she can find any record of ordering a Calvin Klein jacket whether from a Calvin Klein

148
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:12,360
 retailer or eBay or whatever there's nothing.

149
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,880
 But because she's holding this jacket she knows that it's in her house and she didn't

150
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,240
 order it she actually goes to the point where she's like calling up her bank and she's like

151
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,960
 hey this is going to sound super weird.

152
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,320
 Actually I don't think she goes oh this this coat magically appeared in my closet help

153
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:33,520
 me US bank probably not she probably just said hey were there any transactions and I

154
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:38,680
 miss anything like that because she has the tags are still on it so she can see the dollar

155
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:44,960
 amount she can look for transactions in that amount nothing.

156
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:51,560
 This money never came out of her bank account she never ordered it so even if she had mistakenly

157
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,080
 you know I people will get drunk on eBay and they'll buy a bunch of stuff and the next

158
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:01,920
 day they're like what why do I own the entire 1988 line of micro machines it wasn't that

159
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,680
 now if all the micro machines just showed up at your door or it wouldn't even be that

160
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,240
 imagine if you walked into your living room one day and there was a micro machines play

161
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:19,920
 set set up in your living room with all the micro machines you're like oh no what is this

162
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:27,280
 home alone trap you you would be like wait what where did these micro machines come from

163
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,560
 but that it's not as cool as micro machines it's just the jacket it's a jacket that doesn't

164
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,440
 fit that's even like the funniest part about it right if someone delivered a bunch of micro

165
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,760
 machines to you at least you have someone to play with while you're trying to figure out

166
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,560
 a mystery you're like mystery solved the answer was fun she has a tiny person's jacket it

167
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:51,880
 won't fit her it will never fit her it will never ever fit her even if she lost weight

168
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,320
 it would basically be like a crop top if she could get her arms through it she's just too

169
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:03,920
 tall even if she lost weight so she has this petite slash extra small jacket now you go

170
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:10,600
 obviously I think we're thinking first of your body Jason's really running out of material

171
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,600
 no I find this absolutely fascinating I know this sounds so benign but that's kind of what

172
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:22,200
 I love about it this and it happens in her house like this is a what I think this is

173
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:28,680
 is like some sort of dimensional rift but let me keep let me keep going on there's not

174
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:34,840
 much more left of the story as she's pre bunking it basically but she's saying it could be

175
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,960
 this it could be that it could be this but she's wiping all of those off she goes but

176
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,520
 it's not that because of this she goes listen I do have a daughter I have an adult daughter

177
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:49,400
 and she comes by my place a couple times a month and you go mystery solved Jason it's

178
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:54,520
 obviously her daughter her daughter is bigger than she is her daughter is five foot ten her

179
00:10:54,520 --> 00:11:00,920
 daughter is taller than she is she also cannot wear a petite slash extra small and the daughter's

180
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,760
 like I didn't buy that I want such a tiny jacket what is that jacket for an American

181
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:13,440
 girl doll so it's bizarre and she goes like you know going back to begin at hermit like

182
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,140
 I don't leave the house I didn't pick it up like I couldn't have such bad memory problems

183
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:22,720
 that I got in my car and drove to the Calvin Klein store or to Nordstrom's or wherever

184
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,520
 and bought it and drove back and hung it up because again even if you would allow that

185
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:34,560
 right people do have memory problems where'd the money come from how did how did she buy

186
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:41,480
 it it's funny because now I think about you know I go it could be a dimensional shift

187
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:49,720
 right in an alternate world there is someone who fits in that jacket in that same place

188
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,680
 which actually kind of hilarious to think about because they just bought an expensive

189
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,600
 jacket and they're like oh hang it up right here and then they went into their closet

190
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:06,640
 and it was gone like vanished and they would never find it they wouldn't be like well I've

191
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,240
 checked the closet and I've checked my car possibly it's in an alternate dimension let's

192
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,240
 fire up the rift generator no you would just eat the cost you would freak out and be like

193
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,040
 what happened to you probably use people of stealing it all your petite friends who are

194
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,320
 a little bit poorer than you would probably that would be the rift you wouldn't need a

195
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:33,360
 rift generator you'd lose friends over it the that girl's jacket transported to our universe

196
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:39,840
 and it's in this woman's house it's funny to think like what if Nancy could fit into

197
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:48,160
 the jacket I guess that's not the most mysterious thing it's not like she pulled the sword out

198
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:54,480
 of the stone she's like now I'm queen of England because I fit in with this jacket but you wouldn't

199
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,960
 notice it as much you'd be like that's where where did this jacket come from I do have

200
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:03,480
 memory problems but it fits really well mystery solved oh well I mean you might investigate

201
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,720
 it a little bit more than that but it doesn't fit her and that's like the sticking point

202
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,760
 it doesn't fit her and she couldn't afford it that was the other thing where to come

203
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:15,360
 from so it had to come from somewhere did it come from another universe but it was funny

204
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,080
 because that was my original thought but as I was saying this a long time ago I don't

205
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:26,160
 know what episode it was I talked about on Dead Rabbit Radio what would be scarier if

206
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:33,840
 you came home and you're like you left a pillow on the couch it's always been on the couch

207
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,840
 you always know that it's a couch pillow it's not a couch cushion but it's like a couch

208
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:44,560
 pillow you leave you come back an hour later and that pillow is missing what would be scarier

209
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:52,480
 that or you leave for an hour you come back the original pillow is still there but there

210
00:13:52,480 --> 00:14:02,640
 is a new pillow you've never seen before also on your couch now what's scarier and pretty

211
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:09,840
 much everyone said it's the extra pillow because then you know somebody was in there you 100%

212
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:15,760
 know that somebody came in without your knowledge stuff goes missing all the time but finding

213
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:21,400
 new items in your home it's funny we've covered basically two stories that have a kind of

214
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:26,880
 a similar been this one where you have a new item not like a ghost materializing a coin

215
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,520
 which it can be I don't want to say common but it does happen we have this one and then

216
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:37,520
 we covered that story recently it's not really the same but the omnivore trials and that had

217
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:42,040
 a woman whose blanket was missing her favorite blanket was missing they went to the movies

218
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:47,920
 they came back and her favorite blanket was folded up neatly sitting on her couch and

219
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,880
 that's when they knew something really really weird that that whole omnivore trials thing

220
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:58,800
 there was all this nonsense people slamming doors and silhouettes staring at them from

221
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,280
 the backyard and people just like I don't know what it is I don't know what it is it's probably

222
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,880
 just the wind probably just the wind making the shape of a human silhouette but it was

223
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,600
 that blanket being folded up missing and then being folded up on the same place where she

224
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,640
 had left it and looked for it and didn't see it it is creepier everyone said Jason that

225
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:22,720
 the dumb question of course is creepier to find something so I think there's the I mean

226
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,720
 I would say paranormal rift I would say some sort of dimensional shift but it was only

227
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,480
 big enough for a single jacket to go through but I host a paranormal podcast and I believe

228
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:38,040
 in the paranormal and it could be that it could be that completely unbelievable thing

229
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:43,680
 but I believe it or it could be some the beginning of some weirdo stalker what if it is like

230
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,640
 the omnivore trials not to give that episode away but what if there's someone in Nancy's

231
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:53,400
 bedroom right now being like oh you don't fit that jacket yet but then he's all sharpening

232
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,280
 knives under her bed he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he

288
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,360
 I don't know but anyways that's the story of Nancy

289
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,360
 and interesting where did this jacket come from

290
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,360
 now you're imagining Zach back and talking about the big boner

291
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,360
 hey don't blame me don't blame me she's the one who said that

292
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,360
 can't sue me either I'm just repeating

293
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,360
 I'm just repeating an unfounded accusation on a show that I don't watch

294
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,360
 AZ let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the world

295
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,360
 famous carbon helicopter we are leaving behind Georgia

296
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,360
 flying us all the way out

297
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,360
 to a house in the suburbs

298
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:11,360
 da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da

 we're flying all the way out there and shhhhhh

300
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,360
 it's late at night we're walking into this house

301
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,360
 luckily I have a key I have a key to every house in the world

302
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,360
 click click click we walk in and we see

303
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,360
 a family sitting in the living room

304
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,360
 you have a mom and a dad and then Sophia

305
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,360
 who's only a year old

306
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,360
 it's late it's like 2 in the morning we're like hiding

307
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,360
 we're all stuffed in one of their closets and we're kinda looking out all creepy and stuff

308
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,360
 I don't know why we are, I don't know why we're so creepy

309
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,360
 I don't know why we just didn't be a third person but anyways we were stalking this family

310
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,360
 little Sophia is sitting there

311
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,360
 and she's eating a snack

312
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,360
 like crackers and we're like this is weird it's like 2 in the morning

313
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,360
 what's she doing up

314
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,360
 eventually she gets done with the crackers and she lets out a big little kid yawn

315
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,360
 wow

316
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,360
 and the parents pick up Sophia

317
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,360
 she's one right I don't think you walk when you're that young

318
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,360
 they pick up Sophia and they go back to bed

319
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,360
 the reason why we're showing up at this house

320
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,360
 we don't have an exact location for this story

321
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,360
 the person who posted it actually deleted their account

322
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,360
 I don't think it's because of the story I think it's just because they found out reddit sucked

323
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,360
 they posted this story

324
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,360
 and it's the story of their daughter Sophia

325
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,360
 so you have mom and dad and Sophia living in this house

326
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,360
 and they said

327
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,360
 we'll say this is stories from the mom's point of view and we'll call her

328
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,360
 Jody

329
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,360
 Jody said

330
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,360
 Sophia is what's known as a unicorn baby

331
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,360
 not that she has like a cool horn

332
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:05,360
 but it's a term used for a baby who sleeps through the night

333
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,360
 which is what babies are not known to do

334
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,360
 they're known to be really loud poop factories

335
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,360
 at every single minute of every single day

336
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:19,360
 but she goes Sophia was a unicorn baby from about 2 months

337
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,360
 to her first year slept through the night

338
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,360
 slept like a log it was awesome

339
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,360
 we'd always heard all these horror stories about babies waking parents up in the middle of the night

340
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,360
 marriages just crumbling underneath the weight and the sleep deprivation and the stress

341
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,360
 she said not for us not for Sophia

342
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,360
 she slept all night long

343
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,360
 until she turned 1

344
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,360
 and she said what happened was after she turned 1

345
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,360
 Sophia would wake up in the middle of the night

346
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,360
 which means we would wake up in the middle of the night

347
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,360
 and Sophia would want a snack

348
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,360
 a late night snack

349
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,360
 so they would walk Sophia down to the

350
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,360
 because they don't have a snack available in their bedroom right

351
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,360
 they'd be eating it

352
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,360
 you can't have food in your bedroom otherwise you would eat it

353
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,360
 you're like oh this delicious this delicious

354
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,360
 butternut squash mashed into a baby food jar

355
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,360
 when you're one I don't think you're eating baby food anymore

356
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,360
 you're eating normal stuff

357
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,360
 but if you had a bowl of like animal crackers right next to your bed

358
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,360
 you'd eat them you'd eat them

359
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,360
 you couldn't help it and if you if you didn't the ants sure would

360
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,360
 the ants must have a field day in a house with a baby

361
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,360
 anyways you don't have a snack in your bedroom

362
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,360
 you keep them in the kitchen like a normal human

363
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,360
 so you walk Sophia down

364
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,360
 to the living room and you go you wait there Sophia

365
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,360
 I'll get you a snack

366
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,360
 but as you're walking to the living room you notice

367
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,360
 Sophia looks over at this chair

368
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,360
 it just sits in your living room

369
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,360
 it's been there for a long time it's not a new chair

370
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,360
 but Sophia walks by and she looks at this chair

371
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,360
 and she waves to it and goes hello

372
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,360
 and then sits down and waits for her snack

373
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,360
 and then you come out with a little bowl of crackers

374
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:06,360
 you set it down and she's eating them

375
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,360
 and you're just kind of just sitting there

376
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,360
 you can't be like hey good luck eating those crackers

377
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,360
 and you know how to swallow

378
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,360
 so you don't want to morning you gotta wait there

379
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,360
 so she doesn't die

380
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,360
 or make a mess or get carried away by ants

381
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,360
 so Jodi or her husband would be sitting there in the living room

382
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,360
 and as Sophia was eating these crackers

383
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:32,360
 she would carry on a conversation with the chair

384
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,360
 it wouldn't make any sense

385
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,360
 it would be like I mean she can talk

386
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,360
 but how big of a vocabulary do you have at age one

387
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,360
 and she's a kid she's a kid

388
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,360
 she's not asking about like oh did you see whatever in the news yesterday

389
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,360
 nom nom nom nom

390
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,360
 it's just nonsense

391
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,360
 imaginary friend talk

392
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,360
 goofy stuff

393
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,360
 the parent would sit there

394
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,360
 and Sophia would eat the snack

395
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,360
 and when Sophia was done

396
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,360
 bye

397
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,360
 and Sophia and the parent would walk back to the bedrooms

398
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,360
 and Sophia would go back to bed

399
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,360
 the first time it happened you go that was weird

400
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,360
 like she's always slept all the way through the night

401
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,360
 she doesn't normally talk to chairs during the day

402
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,360
 or she has an active imagination

403
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,360
 like all children do but that's weird

404
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,360
 but when it happens again to the next night

405
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,360
 Sophia wakes up

406
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,360
 parent walks down the hallway with him

407
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,360
 they get to the living room

408
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,360
 Sophia goes how wow

409
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,360
 and waves at the empty chair

410
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,360
 and sits down waiting for her snack

411
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:44,360
 another full on conversation with nothing

412
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,360
 the parents are like okay this is weird

413
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,360
 the first time she woke up in the middle of the night

414
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,360
 and wanted a snack that was weird

415
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,360
 but you know now it's happened twice

416
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,360
 could this be the start of something new

417
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,360
 but this goes on

418
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,360
 and on

419
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,360
 and on

420
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,360
 this lasts four months

421
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,360
 and it's always the exact same thing

422
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,360
 the parents actually start pre-making the snack

423
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,360
 before they go to bed

424
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:16,360
 so now there's a bowl of crackers

425
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,360
 or cereal whatever it is

426
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,360
 on the table

427
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,360
 when they go to bed

428
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,360
 so when Sophia wakes up

429
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,360
 and they walk down the hallway

430
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,360
 the parent doesn't have to worry about putting it together

431
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,360
 because this goes on for months

432
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,360
 they're like okay this is obviously part of this kids development cycle

433
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,360
 it's weird

434
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,360
 and every single time Sophia would walk in the living room

435
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,360
 and go how wow

436
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,360
 and wave to the chair

437
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,360
 and then sit down

438
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,360
 and carry on a conversation

439
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,360
 and again

440
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,360
 these were two to three word sentences

441
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,360
 that Sophia was using

442
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,360
 so it's not like

443
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,360
 you could gleam any sort of information from it

444
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,360
 it's also one sided right

445
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,360
 it's just your little girl going

446
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,360
 yeah and then Pony

447
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,360
 oh Pony go boom

448
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,360
 you're like what does that mean

449
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,360
 I mean obviously that means she's making up a story about some dumb

450
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,360
 cartoon horse

451
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,360
 but it's not like

452
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,360
 it's not

453
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,360
 well we'll get to it

454
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,360
 because obviously if we knew both sides of the conversation

455
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,360
 this

456
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,360
 the climax probably would have happened much sooner

457
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,360
 I would think

458
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,360
 if the parents had any idea that this wasn't just a weird

459
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,360
 quirk of Sophia's childhood

460
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,360
 they probably would have done what they're about to do

461
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,360
 much much earlier

462
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,360
 because this goes on every single night

463
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,360
 for months and months and months

464
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,360
 until one night

465
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,360
 Sophia wakes up

466
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,360
 they're walking down the hallway

467
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,360
 pre-made snack already sitting on the table

468
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,360
 and Jodi the mom was with her at this point

469
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,360
 they're walking down the hallway

470
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,360
 and all of a sudden

471
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,360
 Sophia stops

472
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,360
 she stops cold

473
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,360
 in her tracks

474
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:05,360
 and with a frightened finger

475
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,360
 she points at the empty chair

476
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:13,360
 this chair she's been talking to for months

477
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,360
 she greets with the wave every single night

478
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,360
 ignores it during the day

479
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,360
 I mean it's just a chair

480
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,360
 she probably sat on it from time to time

481
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,360
 but she didn't definitely know wave at it

482
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,360
 she didn't carry on conversations with it

483
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,360
 usually she greets it with a wave and a "Hello!"

484
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,360
 this time

485
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,360
 she freezes dead in her tracks

486
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,360
 she points a finger at the chair

487
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:38,360
 and lets out

488
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,360
 a terrified scream

489
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,360
 and she's screaming

490
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,360
 and screaming

491
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,360
 and screaming

492
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,360
 it's the middle of the night

493
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,360
 and her cries of terror are filling the home

494
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,360
 Joe at this point

495
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,360
 the other parents up now

496
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,360
 the husbands up now

497
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,360
 they're both like

498
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,360
 what in the world is going on

499
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,360
 and she's screaming at the top of her lungs

500
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,360
 horrible terrified screams

501
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,360
 is how Jodi

502
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,360
 described it

503
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,360
 and she's pointing at that chair

504
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,360
 screaming, screaming, pointing

505
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,360
 frozen in place

506
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,360
 refuses to move

507
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,360
 until Jodi scoops up

508
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,360
 Sophia in her arms

509
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,360
 and takes her to another room

510
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,360
 trying to calm her down

511
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,360
 it takes a while

512
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:42,360
 because Jodi can't say really what she saw

513
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,360
 she doesn't have the vocabulary for it

514
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,360
 all she can do is scream

515
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:53,360
 and even then when she's been removed from the living room

516
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,360
 when Sophia's in her mother's arms

517
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,360
 and they're in another room

518
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,360
 and she's being soothed by her mother

519
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,360
 she still can't say what it is

520
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,360
 but the screaming just turns to sobbing

521
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,360
 this poor little girl is terrified out of her mind

522
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,360
 the dad

523
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,360
 you have to wonder like again

524
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,360
 I think they weren't explicitly

525
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,360
 the parents weren't saying

526
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,360
 that there is some sort of paranormal activity going on

527
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,360
 but as the months went by

528
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,360
 and as they saw these conversations take place

529
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,360
 you have to figure they did start to think

530
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,360
 maybe it's something

531
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,360
 maybe this just isn't a imaginary friend type of thing

532
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,360
 because what happens is

533
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,360
 when that goes on

534
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,360
 when Sophia stops and points at the chair and screams

535
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,360
 the dad takes the chair

536
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,360
 and removes it

537
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,360
 from the living room

538
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,360
 like he feels like the chair caused that

539
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,360
 not that she was having a waking nightmare

540
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,360
 not that she had seen something spooky on television that day

541
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,360
 he 100% was like

542
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,360
 "okay, I'm getting rid of this chair"

543
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,360
 which is probably something that he'd been wanting to do for a while

544
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,360
 because it was probably creeping him out

545
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,360
 maybe he didn't specifically say that to his wife

546
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:14,360
 but I believe at this point they were taking turns

547
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,360
 you don't need both parents to be up in the middle of the night

548
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,360
 to feed the kids

549
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,360
 so there would be some nights where it would just be the dad

550
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,360
 sitting down there with Sophia

551
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,360
 having an imaginary conversation

552
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,360
 or a real conversation

553
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,360
 see, that's the thing

554
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,360
 you could say it's an imaginary friend

555
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,360
 I believe in the father's mind

556
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,360
 no, she's talking to something

557
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,360
 like this is a... she's having real conversations

558
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,360
 I can't see it

559
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,360
 but she can

560
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,360
 and I'm sitting down here in the middle of the night

561
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,360
 in the middle of the night which is already creepy

562
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,360
 with what

563
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,360
 at best is my daughter's

564
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,360
 imagination running wild

565
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,360
 that's sweet, that's cute

566
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,360
 but at worst there's some sort of unseen phantom

567
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,360
 sitting just a few feet away from me

568
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,360
 that my daughter is just carrying on with

569
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,360
 now maybe it's a ghost of an old grandpa

570
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,360
 maybe it's the ghost of an engineer

571
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,360
 who died on this very spot

572
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:16,360
 but it's so creepy, I don't want him there

573
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,360
 I definitely don't want him talking to my kid

574
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,360
 and the dad took this opportunity

575
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,360
 to remove the chair from the living room

576
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,360
 he's like, nope

577
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,360
 that's kind of what I've been waiting for

578
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,360
 I thought I'd be the one doing the screaming and the pointing

579
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,360
 I imagine that one day I would come down the hallway

580
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,360
 and see something terrifying but Sophia saw it

581
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,360
 so I'm gonna remove this chair and

582
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,360
 the very next day he threw it away

583
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,360
 that night he just moved it out of the living room

584
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,360
 and the very next day he held it off to the dump

585
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,360
 and what's interesting about that story

586
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,360
 the little kid seeing the ghost

587
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,360
 that happens

588
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,360
 that's actually a big part of

589
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,360
 paranormal research

590
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,360
 the belief that babies

591
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,360
 and children can see

592
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,360
 paranormal entities much easier than adults can

593
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,360
 because they've been told they don't exist yet

594
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,360
 they don't understand the rules of the universe

595
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,360
 I don't understand the rules of the universe

596
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,360
 a normal adult brain

597
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,360
 I shouldn't say normal but I'll say it again anyways

598
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,360
 a normal adult brain has filters placed on it

599
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:30,360
 by society, by belief systems, by experience

600
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:37,360
 so that creepy half-naked old woman

601
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,360
 who's standing in your kitchen right now

602
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,360
 if you went in there you wouldn't see her

603
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:46,360
 but if you were three

604
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,360
 you might

605
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,360
 if you were six months old

606
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,360
 you probably definitely would

607
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:58,360
 there's no signs in the back that I would have a chart or anything like that

608
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,360
 but you know what I mean

609
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,360
 the idea that we go ghost aren't real

610
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,360
 even people who believe in ghosts have so many filters

611
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,360
 it's a big thing with the law of attraction

612
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,360
 a big thing is you have to believe it works

613
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,360
 you can't ever believe it won't work

614
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,360
 if you believe it doesn't work it won't work

615
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,360
 and they say if you're studying the law of attraction

616
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:20,360
 don't read anything that says it doesn't work

617
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,360
 don't go "well I want to see what the other side has to say about it"

618
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,360
 because they go "it won't work"

619
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,360
 it's a filter

620
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,360
 you place your own filters over things

621
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,360
 so that's interesting in and of itself

622
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,360
 and that's pretty normal in the world of paranormal

623
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:37,360
 that children can perceive ghosts and spirits

624
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,360
 far easier than adults can

625
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,360
 so it's interesting on that level

626
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,360
 it's interesting on the level again where this account's been deleted

627
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,360
 we can't do any follow-up questioning

628
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,360
 but I do think it's interesting that you have the two parents

629
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,360
 I would say

630
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,360
 that you probably did have a schism

631
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,360
 where the father thought

632
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,360
 this is ghost

633
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,360
 like she's talking to a ghost

634
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,360
 and the mother would be like

635
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,360
 well you know she's just it's imaginary

636
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,360
 it's not real ghost

637
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,360
 it's her imagination

638
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,360
 for whatever reason she's developed this imaginary friend

639
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,360
 that only shows up at the creepiest time

640
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,360
 night time

641
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,360
 but

642
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,360
 he was ready to get rid of that chair

643
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,360
 it wasn't even like

644
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,360
 well you know what I mean like

645
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,360
 when she pointed it

646
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,360
 and started screaming

647
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,360
 it could have been anything

648
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,360
 like I said it could have been a nightmare

649
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,360
 she could have seen something

650
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,360
 a creepy shadow or something like that

651
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,360
 but the second she got upset by that chair

652
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,360
 he got rid of it

653
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,360
 he did not even wait

654
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,360
 she was still sobbing in the other room

655
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,360
 when he's like

656
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,360
 nope you're out of here

657
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,360
 I'm getting rid of you

658
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,360
 I think there probably was that schism

659
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,360
 where one person thought

660
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,360
 it was totally normal

661
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,360
 to talk to an imaginary friend

662
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,360
 and then the other parent was like

663
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,360
 no there's something creepy going on here

664
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,360
 so that's an interesting

665
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,360
 because that happens in real life right

666
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,360
 that they

667
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,360
 on the war trial

668
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,360
 story

669
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,360
 the wife was like

670
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,360
 I think there's an intruder in our house

671
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,360
 I think he's living in our walls

672
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,360
 and the husband kept going

673
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,360
 it's just a wind

674
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,360
 and they almost

675
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,360
 they almost got all of their hands chopped off

676
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,360
 that's a crazy episode

677
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,360
 I'll put it in the show notes

678
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,360
 now I've brought it up twice

679
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,360
 but I really like that story

680
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,360
 but the thing that I

681
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:19,360
 really the reason why I really wanted to cover this story

682
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,360
 and we got to wrap it up

683
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,360
 I don't want to go on too long

684
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,360
 but I find this absolutely fascinating

685
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,360
 is

686
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,360
 remember how this all started

687
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,360
 it was the late night snack

688
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,360
 this child slept through the night

689
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,360
 from two months old to one year old

690
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,360
 but when

691
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,360
 when Sophia turned one

692
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,360
 I don't know if it was exactly on her birthday

693
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,360
 but you know around there

694
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,360
 she began

695
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,360
 to crave a midnight snack

696
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,360
 it was something that she had never exhibited before

697
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,360
 and

698
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,360
 she would walk in the living room

699
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,360
 she'd go how wow

700
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,360
 and then she would sit down

701
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,360
 and eat her snack

702
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,360
 and my question is

703
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,360
 did whatever was in that chair

704
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,360
 and what I believe

705
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,360
 that what she saw that night

706
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,360
 was its true form

707
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,360
 she probably did see some sort of friendly spirit

708
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,360
 it may not have even looked completely human

709
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,360
 or humanoid

710
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,360
 it may have been like

711
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,360
 something that resembled something that a child

712
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,360
 would want to talk to an imaginary friend

713
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,360
 they dropped dead Fred-esque character

714
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,360
 but that night

715
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,360
 when she came down

716
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,360
 it looked more like

717
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,360
 the demon from Little Monsters

718
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,360
 starring Fred Savage

719
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,360
 she saw a horrific

720
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,360
 she saw it without its mask on

721
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,360
 she saw this terrifying horrific

722
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,360
 entity sitting in the darkness

723
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,360
 waiting for her to come down

724
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,360
 she saw its true form that night

725
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,360
 and what I think is interesting

726
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,360
 is

727
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,360
 did that spirit

728
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,360
 did that entity

729
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,360
 make her

730
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,360
 hungry

731
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,360
 and

732
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,360
 because if she just slept through the night

733
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:01,360
 she would never see it

734
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,360
 remember this thing didn't show up during the day

735
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,360
 he was sitting in that chair

736
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,360
 and we don't know how long they had the chair

737
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,360
 again there's some cool follow up questions

738
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,360
 I'd like to ask

739
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,360
 but the person deleted their account

740
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,360
 but it didn't sound like they got the chair

741
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,360
 from a garage sale that weekend

742
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,360
 it was a chair that had been there

743
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,360
 so if he has to sleep

744
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,360
 this thing wants to make contact with her

745
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,360
 but it can only manifest at night

746
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,360
 if it simply wakes her up

747
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,360
 then she wakes up and the parents

748
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,360
 swaddle her

749
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,360
 and rock her back and forth

750
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,360
 or whatever you do to a one year old

751
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,360
 and then she goes back to sleep

752
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,360
 the entity is still sitting in the darkness

753
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,360
 in the living room

754
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,360
 what it had to do was

755
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,360
 it had to bring her down

756
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,360
 it had to create

757
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,360
 a habit

758
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,360
 a need

759
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,360
 that she did not have previous

760
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,360
 it had to wake her up

761
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,360
 and make her hungry

762
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,360
 in the middle of the night

763
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,360
 that was the only way that the parents

764
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,360
 would have let her walk down there

765
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,360
 and spend enough time down there

766
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,360
 to talk

767
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,360
 right isn't that so

768
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,360
 that to me

769
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,360
 this story seems kind of just a creepy kid story

770
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,360
 little innocuous

771
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,360
 but that's creepy because you think

772
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,360
 what is really the power level of the paranormal

773
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,360
 sure we talk about demons

774
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,360
 being able to possess people

775
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,360
 turning into a murderer

776
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,360
 rapist

777
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,360
 some sort of hardened criminal

778
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,360
 and that sucks

779
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,360
 that's not good either

780
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,360
 but

781
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,360
 is it possible for a dark spirit

782
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,360
 to simply give you

783
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,360
 a habit

784
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:38,360
 to make you do a particular thing

785
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,360
 and you start to think

786
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,360
 like I stay up late

787
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,360
 I go to bed

788
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,360
 around

789
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,360
 I lay down around midnight

790
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,360
 I'm asleep by one in the morning

791
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,360
 I'm up at 5.36

792
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,360
 to go to work

793
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,360
 and you think

794
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:57,360
 I've been doing that my entire life

795
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,360
 I've been doing that my entire life

796
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,360
 but you think

797
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,360
 is it

798
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,360
 like that's

799
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,360
 I've always

800
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,360
 people think I'm crazy for doing that

801
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,360
 and they go it's super unhealthy

802
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,360
 I take naps

803
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,360
 I take naps

804
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,360
 but you know

805
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,360
 people go

806
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,360
 that's unhealthy

807
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,360
 your body's not giving enough time to regenerate

808
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,360
 you lift weights

809
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,360
 you gotta sleep 8 hours to build muscle

810
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,360
 all this stuff

811
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,360
 I've been doing it my entire life

812
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,360
 and it's something that I own

813
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,360
 it's a decision that I make

814
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,360
 but what if that's not the case

815
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,360
 like what if I didn't choose to be

816
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,360
 a late night person

817
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,360
 and oddly enough

818
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,360
 a morning person as well

819
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,360
 but

820
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,360
 how much

821
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,360
 I guess I'm

822
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,360
 kind of getting

823
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,360
 off track here

824
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,360
 but I'm thinking like

825
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:44,360
 how much of our lives

826
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,360
 are dictated by us

827
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,360
 how much of our lives are dictated by

828
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,360
 environmental factors

829
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,360
 or genetic factors

830
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,360
 but you know the decisions we make

831
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,360
 but then how much

832
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,360
 like a simple

833
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,360
 habit of waking up at the middle of the night

834
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,360
 to get a snack

835
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,360
 did Sophia start doing that

836
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,360
 on her own

837
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,360
 and then

838
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,360
 see this creature

839
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,360
 see this entity one night

840
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,360
 and it just happened that way

841
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:11,360
 that's possible

842
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,360
 but

843
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,360
 Jodi does add in her narrative

844
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,360
 that after they got rid of the chair

845
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,360
 Sophia

846
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,360
 slept through the night

847
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,360
 she once again

848
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,360
 every night after that

849
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,360
 slept through the night

850
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,360
 and no longer needed

851
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,360
 a midnight snack

852
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:38,360
 so

853
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,360
 does the world of the paranormal

854
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,360
 have a day to day impact

855
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,360
 on even simple habits

856
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,360
 we have

857
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,360
 because again

858
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,360
 it's not like

859
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,360
 she woke up

860
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,360
 and she saw this thing

861
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,360
 and she goes

862
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,360
 next night I do that again

863
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,360
 we play

864
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,360
 I believe this entity

865
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,360
 was waking her up

866
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,360
 and making her hungry

867
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,360
 both of those things

868
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,360
 needed to be accomplished

869
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,360
 for her to come into the living room

870
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,360
 if she just woke up

871
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,360
 she wouldn't be able to go

872
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,360
 in the living room

873
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,360
 her parents would put her back to sleep

874
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,360
 she had to be woken up

875
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,360
 and be made hungry

876
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,360
 so they would have time to talk

877
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,360
 because she would eat this stuff

878
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,360
 like someone would eat a bowl of crackers

879
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,360
 that's going to give you a good

880
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,360
 10-20 minute conversation

881
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,360
 depending on how many crackers

882
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,360
 this spirit

883
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,360
 this demon whatever it was

884
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,360
 woke her up

885
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,360
 and made her hungry

886
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,360
 that is

887
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,360
 it's weird because you

888
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,360
 you go

889
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,360
 sure a demon possessing a guy

890
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,360
 and turning him into a mass murderer

891
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,360
 that is worse

892
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,360
 that takes a huge amount of power

893
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,360
 it does

894
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,360
 I'm not diminishing

895
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,360
 I'm not diminishing all the

896
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,360
 demonically possessed murderers out there

897
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,360
 I'm just saying that

898
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,360
 this would take a lot of energy as well

899
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,360
 and to what

900
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,360
 end

901
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:00,360
 what was this spirit's goal

902
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:08,360
 why was it waking up this one year old girl

903
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,360
 and making her hungry

904
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,360
 so she would be in the living room with it

905
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,360
 and they could have a conversation

906
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,360
 what was the end game there

907
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:20,360
 fascinating story

908
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,360
 it really at first glance

909
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,360
 it just seems like this is the story of a creepy kid

910
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,360
 but it really has to

911
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,360
 but it really opens up that

912
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,360
 whole question of how powerful is the world of paranormal

913
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,360
 and how much of an effect does it have

914
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,360
 on our daily lives which is funny

915
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,360
 because that's what ancient cultures

916
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,360
 used to believe 100%

917
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,360
 like the paranormal is constantly interfering

918
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,360
 in the daily lives of the humans on the planet

919
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,360
 and over time

920
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,360
 we either say this stuff doesn't exist

921
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,360
 or it's rare

922
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:53,360
 but what if some of the habits you have

923
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,360
 that I have

924
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,360
 that we think we've developed on our own

925
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,360
 are actually the work of spirits

926
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:05,360
 and I think there's a case to be made

927
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,360
 when you can look at stuff like porn addiction, gambling addiction, drug addiction

928
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,360
 that there's a demonic element to those things

929
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,360
 I think that there's an art

930
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,360
 we've talked about those on the show

931
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,360
 I think any sort of addiction where you

932
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,360
 forgo your family

933
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,360
 and you forgo your job

934
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,360
 and you forgo your own health

935
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,360
 to pursue something you

936
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,360
 know is destructive

937
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,360
 but you just keep doing

938
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:30,360
 I think you could definitely argue there's a demonic element to that

939
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,360
 but eating crackers in the middle of the night

940
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,360
 did this spirit just want some company

941
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,360
 and was stuck in the darkness

942
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,360
 and decided to use what little energy

943
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,360
 it had outside of that chair

944
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:47,360
 to wake up a child so it would have a conversation

945
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:51,360
 so it wouldn't be so lonely through the eternal nights

946
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:55,360
 well if that's the case

947
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,360
 what did she see on that last night

948
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,360
 what frightened her so much

949
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,360
 if this was a benign spirit

950
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,360
 what did she see

951
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,360
