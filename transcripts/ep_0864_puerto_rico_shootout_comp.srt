1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
 If you saw someone in your house and they weren't supposed to be there, you would know

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,920
 how to deal with it.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,760
 But what if you only saw part of them?

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,640
 And they would travel to Puerto Rico to cover one of my favorite stories that I love covering

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,840
 on this podcast.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,280
 What happens when a local cattle rancher gets tired of finding his livestock mutilated?

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:36,720
 He forms a posse and goes to war today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:47,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,120
 I'm your host Jason Parvinder.

10
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,120
 I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,360
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,360
 I mean it.

13
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,360
 I mean it every time I say it.

14
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,360
 I really do hope you guys are having a great day.

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,600
 And I hope you guys have some fun plans for the weekend coming up.

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:06,880
 Just a quick reminder, I will be at the McMinnville UFO Festival May 13th and 14th.

17
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,720
 Actually let me rephrase that.

18
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,560
 People might be making plans to come see me.

19
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,120
 I will be there walking around.

20
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,280
 But on May 14th, I'm gonna have a vendor table.

21
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,960
 And I'm gonna have haunted items that we've talked about on this show or you've seen in

22
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,520
 my TikTok videos laid out on this table.

23
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,160
 So come and meet me.

24
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,160
 I'm not there.

25
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,600
 It's like an official conference guy.

26
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,000
 I'm not giving a lecture or anything.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 I'll lecture you.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,040
 I'm like you need to tie your shoes.

29
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,040
 Come out.

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,040
 It'll be a lot of fun.

31
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,040
 We're gonna have our vendor table set up.

32
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,240
 We're gonna be giving away bookmarks.

33
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,160
 And we're gonna have a menagerie of haunted items.

34
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,800
 We're gonna have Veronica the Haunted Dolls gonna be there.

35
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,480
 You're like Jason, wait a second.

36
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,480
 Back up.

37
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,800
 You know, not only do you plan on throwing a bunch of cursed items in the back of a

38
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:58,160
 car and driving for a couple hours, which is already super dangerous in and of itself,

39
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,880
 but then you want me to touch them.

40
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:07,120
 You want me to travel from where I'm at to touch items that you believe are cursed.

41
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,120
 Just for random people to walk up and touch these items as they're walking away.

42
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,000
 They start getting convulsion fits.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,560
 I was like, see proof.

44
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,920
 Everyone doesn't want to touch them anymore.

45
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,840
 I'm throwing them at people at this point.

46
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,840
 Yeah.

47
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,840
 Come on down.

48
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,720
 Come on down to Jason's haunted Emporium.

49
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,800
 May 14th, I will be in McMinnville, Oregon at the UFO Festival.

50
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,920
 You don't have to come out for me.

51
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,720
 Yeah, technically you don't have to come out at all, but come out for the UFO Festival.

52
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,920
 Come out for the UFOs.

53
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,800
 Stay for the curses that will follow you home as you're driving away.

54
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,920
 You see like a haunted doll in your rearview mirror.

55
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,200
 So yeah, that sounds like a great time, right?

56
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,800
 Someone else who's always a great time coming into Dead Rabbit Command, the last of our

57
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,040
 Thanksgiving live stream Patreons, but never last in life.

58
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:57,920
 Long time supporter of the show, a very active member of the Patreon Discord and of the,

59
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,720
 and the Patreon live episode that everyone gets.

60
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,440
 They just get to hear it live the time it's recorded.

61
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,000
 Everyone give a round of applause to Rudy Jazz.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Woo!

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,400
 Rudy coming on in, blushing, blushing as they walk into Dead Rabbit Command.

64
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,960
 Rudy, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

65
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,760
 If you guys can't support the Patreon or the live stream or anything like that, I totally

66
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,760
 understand.

67
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,280
 I 100% get it.

68
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,920
 Just help spread the word about the show.

69
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,160
 That really, really helps out a lot.

70
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,160
 Help get the word out about Dead Rabbit Radio.

71
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,840
 That is another way you can support the show.

72
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,160
 Rudy, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the oars for the Dead Rabbit Roadboat.

73
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,160
 I don't think we've used this one recently.

74
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:42,000
 Let's get in it and we are going to row, row, row our way down a river to a suburban neighborhood.

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,040
 The suburban neighborhood that has a river through it.

76
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,040
 Splash.

77
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:52,080
 Oh, a row in our way all the way down there as Rudy is enjoying the view.

78
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,480
 We row ourselves to this unnamed neighborhood.

79
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,120
 This was posted online by someone going by the handle Veggie Panda.

80
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,080
 We're going to go ahead and call you Monica.

81
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,840
 That's your real name, just guess.

82
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,800
 Monica one day wakes up.

83
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,800
 Hit seven in the morning.

84
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,000
 Oh, yawning.

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,960
 Now, she doesn't say that she normally sleeps with her bedroom door open.

86
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,960
 I don't.

87
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,360
 I think it's, I think it's super creepy.

88
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,640
 Honestly, I have all doors shut when I'm sleeping.

89
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,640
 Even your door shut.

90
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,880
 I can't sleep if you have a door open.

91
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,080
 I shut all my doors.

92
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,040
 But Monica, she doesn't say whether or not she normally sleeps with her door open, but

93
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:39,320
 when she wakes up, her bedroom door is open and looking out the bedroom door, she sees

94
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:48,720
 that from the wrist up a human hand and the hand is just waving at her.

95
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,720
 She lives alone.

96
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,640
 I don't know if I need to go to that detail.

97
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,200
 You're like, Oh, it's maybe, maybe it's her boyfriend waving.

98
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,200
 Good morning.

99
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,200
 That's what I always do.

100
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,960
 I go, Hello, just wave when I'm waving to my girlfriend.

101
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,600
 I just let them see my wrist.

102
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
 Then nothing else.

103
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,480
 I'm such a tease.

104
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,280
 Her brain can't process really what's going on at this point.

105
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:18,360
 She lays back down and then she remembers she lives alone.

106
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,920
 She jumps up.

107
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,880
 She grabs her mace, which apparently she keeps in her bedroom.

108
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,100
 And if not, everyone should, everyone should sleep with their door shut and everyone should

109
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,400
 sleep armed.

110
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,440
 She grabs her mace.

111
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,960
 She begins checking the house.

112
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:37,640
 She goes room to room looking for the person who was waving at her.

113
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,520
 She doesn't find anybody.

114
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:49,360
 So she posts this online and it was titled, I saw a hand wave at me this morning.

115
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,440
 So this just happened a couple of weeks ago.

116
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,400
 But that's not where her story ends.

117
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,080
 I mean, technically I did end it and you thought I was tricking you and seeing if you were

118
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,080
 paying attention.

119
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,560
 I know you're washing your dishes right now.

120
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,760
 That's not where the story ends.

121
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,520
 She goes, I got to be honest with you.

122
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,880
 You've been under a lot of stress.

123
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,640
 My best friend died recently.

124
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,640
 I'm dealing with that and processing all of that stuff.

125
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,360
 But so it could be stress right.

126
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:25,160
 But this also isn't the first time I've just seen a hand.

127
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,520
 She said when she was a child, she was sitting in her day bed.

128
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,480
 So how old would you be when you're in a day bed?

129
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:36,280
 And I don't know, like nine months, three years old, something like somewhere in between

130
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:42,760
 a fetus and a conscious human child who wears clothes and can talk somewhere in that time

131
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,840
 period, right?

132
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:51,080
 She's sitting in her day bed and apparently I guess it's like a crib maybe because it

133
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,560
 has bars on it.

134
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,720
 She's just look up the definition of day bed before you make it a main factor of your

135
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,720
 story.

136
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:05,360
 She says she's sitting in the day bed and she sees a human hand reach up and wrap its

137
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,760
 fingers around one of the bars.

138
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,480
 She begins screaming because she is terrified by this.

139
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,160
 She knows that there shouldn't be anyone in here.

140
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,680
 But here is this hand holding onto the bar of her day bed.

141
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,800
 She screams her mom comes in.

142
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,560
 There's nothing there.

143
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,480
 Trick of the light.

144
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,480
 Imagination.

145
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,480
 Who knows?

146
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,400
 But her mom is able to calm her down.

147
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,440
 Honey, just go sleep in your day bed.

148
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,440
 Anyway, there's church school tomorrow.

149
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,560
 Or I'm gonna breastfeed you.

150
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,200
 It's somewhere in between there.

151
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,720
 How old you are?

152
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,720
 The hand closed around the bar and it disappeared and the mom leaves and then little Monica's

153
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,080
 sitting in her day bed and right when the mom leaves the hand returns.

154
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:59,760
 It slides up the side of the day bed and grabs onto one of the bars.

155
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:06,400
 She goes all I could do was hide under my blanket.

156
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,160
 To this day, she's posting this online from her day bed.

157
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
 She's totally grown out of it as an adult.

158
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,680
 We've done a couple of episodes recently about Phantom Hands.

159
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:20,240
 This is a super recent phenomenon that I've come across.

160
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,440
 These stories are popping up pretty regularly now.

161
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,760
 Like I said on yesterday's episode, one story is an anomaly.

162
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,080
 Two stories is a coincidence.

163
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,120
 But three stories is a phenomenon.

164
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,320
 At this point, this is a phenomenon.

165
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,880
 We are seeing an increase of Phantom Hands stories.

166
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:41,600
 Now, does that mean because people are comfortable telling them or does it mean that the phenomenon

167
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,560
 is increasing for whatever reason?

168
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,560
 Who knows?

169
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:53,560
 It's so creepy to already think of ghosts in your house where you're supposed to be comfortable,

170
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:59,320
 where you're supposed to be able to get naked and take a shower and take a dump and eat.

171
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,680
 Hopefully different times.

172
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,720
 Hopefully you don't do that all at once.

173
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,560
 But the idea that there is some sort of Phantom in your house, a ghost in your house with

174
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,560
 you, that's already creepy.

175
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:15,800
 But if you know who the ghost is, like I say, my apartment is haunted, my closet is haunted,

176
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,440
 but I've made contact with the spirit here, I'm not too stressed about it.

177
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,120
 I don't really think he hangs out here much.

178
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,400
 But if I just saw a hand, that's way creepier.

179
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,800
 That I honestly, and I know people disagree with me on this, but I would much rather see

180
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,040
 a full-bodied apparition of a ghost than it's just its hand.

181
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,360
 It just seems creepier to me.

182
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:46,880
 Okay, there's a little bit of coffee out to that if it is a full-bodied, blood-drenched,

183
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,440
 fully-marry Phantom in my mirror or a hand waving at me.

184
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:56,560
 Now I'm a little, I don't know which one I'd pick on that, but it's just so creepy.

185
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,760
 And the more I'm thinking about it, when I tell the story, I'm thinking, was it a male

186
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,760
 hand?

187
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,240
 Is that just implied?

188
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,080
 Because every time I tell the story, I'm mad.

189
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,840
 One of the stories, I'll put all the stories in the show notes, but one of them, they specified

190
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:14,680
 that it was a Caucasian male hand because she lived in a building with a bunch of people

191
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,000
 from Asia.

192
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,760
 So she specified, it was a Caucasian hand.

193
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,440
 She specified the ethnicity, but I'm really curious, like, did it have hairy knuckles?

194
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,240
 How well manicured were the fingernails?

195
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,240
 These are intra...

196
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,920
 Is it the same hand in all these different locations?

197
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,880
 Or is this a phenomenon that we're starting to see an increase in?

198
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,880
 And why?

199
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,000
 Why are we only seeing parts of a ghost?

200
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,560
 What's interesting is that if this phenomenon was from the 1800s, we saw stuff like this

201
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,600
 all the time in ghost studies.

202
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,640
 You could make the theory that it takes a long time for a ghost to appear, and maybe

203
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,400
 the first thing they can make visible is their hand.

204
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,400
 That's hogwash.

205
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,680
 We know that's hogwash because we've had ghost stories now since really the dawn of time,

206
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:05,760
 but documented ghost stories since the 1800s, like well-documented ghost stories, late 1800s,

207
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,480
 and none of them were about hands, just hands.

208
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,280
 We really have, we've had the three stories now that I've talked about hands recently on

209
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:21,120
 the show, and then there was a old urban legend about a pair of hairy hands in Britain that

210
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,320
 as you were driving down the road, the hairy hands would kind of take control of your car

211
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,800
 and just start making you swear around.

212
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,800
 I'll put that episode on the show notes.

213
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,400
 That was like episode 70 or something.

214
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,120
 That was a long time ago.

215
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,560
 But they think that that actually was an urban legend.

216
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,200
 The road has a weird curve to it that does cause a lot of car accidents, and it does

217
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,240
 make you lose control of the car.

218
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,880
 I mean, there are some, there's no one seeing hairy hands of the Daytona 500.

219
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,280
 There's some curves there too, but yeah, it's a weird phenomenon.

220
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,560
 That would be the oldest I would know of is the hairy hands.

221
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:55,800
 And even that, again, they're thinking that's, the vision is one thing, but they understand

222
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,880
 why the car accidents are more in that area.

223
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,000
 But why are these hands just appearing to people?

224
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 Just the hand.

225
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,840
 I don't know, there's something more sinister about that because I guess it's hiding its

226
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
 true nature.

227
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,280
 At least the ghost that appears briefly when you shut your light off to go to bed and it's

228
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,200
 standing at the edge of your bed all, "Uhhh."

229
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,680
 At least I mean, it's terrifying as that is.

230
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,920
 It's letting its full form be known.

231
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,400
 Even a shadow person, you can see the outline, right?

232
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,800
 Who knows what this thing is?

233
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:31,920
 Is it a human hand, but it's connected to some sort of unspeakable, unknowable cosmic

234
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,720
 horror and it just has one human hand to kind of coax us over.

235
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,720
 I mean, the hand was waving at her, right?

236
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,640
 One of the hands in the other story was kind of beckoning to a person with its finger,

237
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,640
 like, "Come here."

238
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,880
 So these hands do seem to have phenomenon.

239
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,160
 Again, it could totally be fake, right?

240
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,120
 These could be building up to some stupid ARG.

241
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:59,200
 I'd be super disappointed, but as of right now, these do seem like a bunch of unconnected

242
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,360
 incidents.

243
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,400
 And are we seeing an increase in the phenomenon?

244
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,360
 Or do we just happen to stumble across these stories?

245
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,200
 I'm not typing in "fantom hand."

246
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,200
 I'm searching.

247
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,560
 I just read ghost stuff all the time.

248
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,800
 Read paranormal stuff all the time.

249
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:20,840
 And here we go, another story about a young woman who's seen it twice in her life.

250
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,320
 Just a hand.

251
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,680
 Very, very terrifying.

252
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:29,960
 Rudy Jazz, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the world-famous carboner copter we're

253
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,480
 leaving behind this house.

254
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,880
 The hand is sneaking up on the girl while she's sleeping.

255
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,160
 I'm sure everything will be fine.

256
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,400
 We're leaving behind this house.

257
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:48,560
 We are headed all the way out to Puerto Rico.

258
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,560
 Specifically we're headed to Northern Puerto Rico.

259
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,080
 And the year is 1980.

260
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:03,880
 It's late at night and there's a local ranch owned by a man we're going to call him Peter.

261
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:09,400
 Peter comes out of his house and he looks at all of his cows and probably some chickens

262
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,400
 too.

263
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
 Maybe a goat.

264
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,920
 And he looks out and he's like, "Good night, Farms!"

265
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
 He's the village idiot.

266
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,640
 "Good night, Farms!

267
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,640
 Good night, everybody!

268
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,120
 Good night, well!

269
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,680
 Good night, moon!"

270
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:27,120
 And he walks into his house knowing that everything is right with his life.

271
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,360
 He's lived a good life.

272
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,600
 He has a good piece of land.

273
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,920
 He has all this cattle.

274
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,920
 This morning he wakes up.

275
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,920
 "Ugh!

276
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,800
 Man, I can't wait to say hi to everyone."

277
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,120
 They'll be so surprised.

278
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,040
 And he walks outside and he hi cows, hi goats.

279
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,600
 He doesn't really like to go that much.

280
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,600
 He's all perturbed.

281
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,600
 He's like, "Fine!

282
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,200
 I'll say hi to you too!"

283
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,440
 Hi chickens.

284
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,720
 But then as he's going about his road job, right, he's not an idiot.

285
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,040
 He's not actually doing this.

286
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,040
 He's walking around.

287
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,040
 He's doing his job.

288
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,040
 He sees all this cattle.

289
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,800
 But one of his cows is missing.

290
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,080
 A while later, "Hey Peter, Peter, guess what, dude?

291
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,680
 I found one of your cows, dude!

292
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,680
 He's dead!"

293
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,120
 Peter's like, "Oh, what, dude, man?

294
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,120
 Ah!"

295
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:16,120
 And so he goes out and he gets shown his cow and it's classic cattle mutilation.

296
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,680
 Holes bored into it.

297
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,680
 Missing blood.

298
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,880
 All of that stuff that we see with cattle mutilation.

299
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,880
 1980!

300
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,280
 Cattle mutilations were just really starting to take off.

301
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,240
 It was the 80s and it was really one reporter.

302
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,800
 Linda Molten Howe.

303
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,280
 She was an investigative journalist for like a legitimate new...

304
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,280
 I forgot what it was.

305
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,800
 It was like ABC or CBS or something like that.

306
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,080
 Like a legitimate news site.

307
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:43,320
 And she got assigned the story to start looking into cattle mutilations and she's like, "Wow,

308
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,440
 this is an actual phenomenon.

309
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,320
 This isn't a puff piece."

310
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,800
 And she's been doing it since.

311
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,280
 She is the driving force behind cattle mutilations.

312
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,320
 I don't think it would be as big as the story as it is.

313
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,560
 Definitely wouldn't have been as well documented if it wasn't for her.

314
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,560
 But anyway, so we're just getting this into the consciousness but you're looking at this

315
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,560
 cow.

316
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,560
 It doesn't matter.

317
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,560
 Like you're a cattle rancher.

318
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,560
 You're not really thinking about, "Hmm, I wonder if aliens did this."

319
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,200
 This is super expensive.

320
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,000
 Like when we think of cows getting mutilated, we're like, "Oh, that sucks for the cow."

321
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,560
 But then you just have a baby cow and then he'll grow up.

322
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:18,760
 It would be the equivalent of if you walked to your workplace and one eighth of your workplace

323
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:24,280
 was covered in blood and cut open and organs were missing.

324
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,280
 I think cattle mutil...

325
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:30,200
 I think the economic impact of cattle mutilation gets lost a lot.

326
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,920
 You raise this cow to be able to milk it and then eventually chop it up and sell the meat

327
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,920
 or eat it yourself.

328
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,920
 I don't know.

329
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,760
 But now you can't do that.

330
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:44,720
 And this keeps happening to Peter.

331
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,360
 Cows keep getting taken from his ranch.

332
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,720
 He's probably upset it's not happening to other ranches.

333
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,200
 He's like, "Come on, just go down the street and kill Steven's cows for once."

334
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:58,440
 These cows keep getting taken and they're found later, standard cattle mutilation, chopped

335
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,120
 up style.

336
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,680
 So Peter gets a couple of his buddies together and they're like, "We're just gonna keep

337
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,680
 watch for a couple nights."

338
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:10,520
 I'm gonna sit out here with our rifles.

339
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:17,480
 We're gonna see who comes to kill one of my cattle and we're gonna light them up.

340
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,680
 This goes on for a couple nights apparently and one night when they are waiting to see

341
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:29,960
 whatever horrible human being would kill a cow just rip its guts out, they see movement

342
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,880
 along this nearby ravine.

343
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,680
 See something moving in the darkness.

344
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:44,040
 And what they see absolutely shocks them.

345
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:50,120
 Out of that ravine crawls what could only be described as gray aliens.

346
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,240
 Large head, gray skin, kind of short bodies.

347
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,800
 And there's four of them.

348
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:03,880
 They crawl out of the ravine and they are making a beeline right towards Peter's cattle.

349
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,200
 He says he watched it there.

350
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,720
 They're just shocked by what's going on.

351
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
 This is not what they expected.

352
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,520
 They expected Steven down the road.

353
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,960
 His rival cattle ranch was sending some bandits over or something.

354
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,600
 They're seeing this alien life walking towards the cattle.

355
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,800
 They're like, "What in the world is going on?"

356
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:29,200
 The aliens go into the cattle pen and they find one of the young calves there and suddenly

357
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:37,240
 it begins to float a couple inches off the ground.

358
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,480
 It begins to move as the aliens are hovering it.

359
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,960
 It doesn't say what the other cows are doing.

360
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,480
 I'm sure they gave this all a wide berth.

361
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,360
 I don't think any of them were trying to interfere with what was going on.

362
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,480
 These aliens were hovering out this little calf.

363
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,280
 They're walking next to it as its little hooves aren't touching the ground and they begin walking

364
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,160
 back towards the ravine.

365
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,440
 But they are...

366
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,160
 This happens very, very quickly.

367
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,600
 That is what they are thinking they're going to do.

368
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,760
 So many times before they're going to take this cow somewhere, they're going to experiment

369
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,640
 on it, they're going to drop it off in some random location.

370
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,040
 But as they are leaving the cattle pen and as this little cow is floating next to him,

371
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,760
 Peter finally realizes, "Wait a second.

372
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,120
 This is super weird and all, but I am here to stop this.

373
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,960
 I need to shake this shock out of my head."

374
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,920
 Do something about this.

375
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:36,040
 He's there with his two buddies and Peter has that moment of clarity.

376
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:44,440
 He raises his rifle, takes aim and fires.

377
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,640
 The two men with him begin to unload on these aliens as well.

378
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,600
 You have three men shooting from a concealed position at this group of four aliens in a

379
00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:01,680
 hovering cow and through this flurry of bullets one of these grey aliens gets shot.

380
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:10,920
 He falls to the ground and begins shrieking in pain.

381
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,720
 The calf stops hovering.

382
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,160
 He's actually now on the ground.

383
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,720
 I'm assuming he's running for cover.

384
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,120
 He's like, "I gotta get out of here.

385
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,880
 I'm going to milk my pants."

386
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,320
 He's running away.

387
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:27,280
 The three grey aliens are looking at their fallen comrade and no alien left behind is

388
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:33,720
 apparently their motto because they grab him and they begin to drag him towards the nearby

389
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,760
 ravine, but humans don't quit.

390
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,760
 Humans don't quit.

391
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,760
 They continue to fire on this group.

392
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,720
 They're trying to carry away their wounded buddy, but Peter and these two dudes aren't

393
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,720
 having any of it.

394
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:53,120
 They continue to shoot at the aliens to the point that they have to leave behind their

395
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,640
 fallen brethren.

396
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,200
 They have traveled the cosmos together.

397
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:08,280
 They've seen sights that we can't even comprehend, but this brotherhood is ending tonight.

398
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:13,000
 These three aliens have to leave behind their buddy and they begin to run off.

399
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,560
 They can't make it to the ravine in time.

400
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:22,800
 They turn and they head off to a nearby wooded area, disappear into the trees, leaving behind

401
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,160
 their fallen comrade.

402
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:34,800
 He's bleeding out alien blood that soaks into the soil of Earth and he begins to crawl

403
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:44,400
 across the ground.

404
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:52,640
 His shrieks of pain, his prayers to some alien god no human will ever meet go unanswered.

405
00:21:52,640 --> 00:22:00,120
 As Peter and his two friends begin to approach this alien, the alien sees these humans getting

406
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:08,080
 closer and closer and he realizes he's not going to be able to crawl away from this.

407
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,920
 With his last ounce of strength, he kind of gets to one knee.

408
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,120
 He's trying to get up to run.

409
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:21,880
 If he can make it to the forest, he can...

410
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,920
 Peter puts a bullet right through this alien's neck.

411
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:39,240
 The alien though is still alive.

412
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:55,640
 But it's just laying there bleeding out, squirming.

413
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:03,880
 Looking down at this creature may be in a fit of wrath or may be in an act of mercy.

414
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:10,800
 One of Peter's friends lifts up his rifle and smashes the butt of it right into the alien's

415
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,520
 head.

416
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:23,600
 Killing it instantly and finally silence has returned to the ranch.

417
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,920
 No more shrieking.

418
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,800
 No more gunfire.

419
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:36,880
 Just silence.

420
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:45,160
 Peter took the body and had it preserved in formaldehyde, an alcohol-formaldehyde mixture.

421
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,800
 And photos of this creature have begun to circulate around.

422
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,800
 When I say begun, actually we're going back to the year 1984.

423
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:59,640
 This was a very famous alien story, very famous UFO story.

424
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,040
 You can actually see a photo of it.

425
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,040
 There's no...

426
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,520
 Let me finish the story proper.

427
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,240
 What happened was he preserved the body in formaldehyde, began showing it around.

428
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:18,640
 Photos started to be taken of this creature and eventually Puerto Rican authorities and

429
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:26,120
 then US authorities began to visit him trying to get the body.

430
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,720
 And he hit it.

431
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:33,240
 He never revealed where the alien is to this day.

432
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,720
 That is how the story ends.

433
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,160
 The government wanting to find this and him not revealing it to anyone else.

434
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,360
 It's a super interesting story.

435
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:50,280
 We do see a photo of it appearing in a magazine called Evidencia Avni, number 11.

436
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,720
 I'll put all of that in the show notes.

437
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,560
 You can look at the picture.

438
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,360
 This story I got from ThinkAboutItDocs.com.

439
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,440
 Again, one of my favorite resources for this show and just for recreational reading when

440
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,960
 it comes to UFO stuff.

441
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,160
 They got it from a story written by Jorge Martin.

442
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,100
 We've covered stuff that he's done before.

443
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:13,720
 He is a big writer, if not the writer for Evidencia Avni, which is a Spanish language

444
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,440
 UFO magazine.

445
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,040
 I'm not for sure if they're still in print today, but they still have left a huge presence

446
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,960
 in the UFO community.

447
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,840
 What's interesting about this story is that if you look at Evidencia Avni, number 11,

448
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,040
 you'll see a picture of this alien.

449
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:34,560
 We have no scope of size of how big this alien is.

450
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:39,900
 Now in the story I just told you, we have these gray aliens that are standard gray aliens

451
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,460
 crawling out of the ravine.

452
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:47,380
 What is interesting is around the same time, December of 1980, there's a story about a man

453
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:55,620
 walking through a forested area near Tatos de Caye, or Caye, in Puerto Rico.

454
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:01,500
 He came across several 14-inch tall humanoids and they tried to grab his legs.

455
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,560
 He said they had large heads and webbed hands.

456
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:10,800
 He grabbed a branch and knocked one of these in the head and it smashed its head open, killing

457
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,800
 it instantly.

458
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,440
 The rest of the tiny guys moved into the woods.

459
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,920
 He then took the tiny body to a local chemist and had it put into formaldehyde.

460
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:25,480
 Pictures of this circulated and the item is being hid to this day.

461
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,560
 It's interesting when we look at things about a docs.com, we have this piece.

462
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:34,740
 It has both of these stories and it says, "Source tends to think that this is the version that

463
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:39,340
 is the most accurate, but there's not rule out two separate incidents."

464
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:43,740
 So think about it, docs.com does have both of these stories as well and says, "Listen,

465
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:48,780
 it could be two separate stories, but if the photo is real," because see we have the

466
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:54,620
 photo, we have the photo of the little alien, it does look incredibly small.

467
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:59,760
 You figure if a full-sized grey alien, they tend to be three to four feet tall.

468
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,560
 Sometimes they're taller, but usually they're about three to four feet tall.

469
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,880
 The photo, it looks much, much smaller than that.

470
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,600
 So they say the photo itself could be related to this story, but you also have to think

471
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,400
 of that disinformation, right?

472
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:20,260
 If you have a legitimate story, you could easily come up with a fake story and then

473
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:23,880
 everything gets blurred trying to cover up the actual story.

474
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,980
 Now there's possibly two versions of the story, there's possibly two events.

475
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,100
 We've been to Puerto Rico a lot on this show.

476
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:34,220
 It does seem to be very active with UFO activity, which is interesting.

477
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:38,540
 Not a lot of cryptids, not a lot of ghosts, but a ton of UFOs.

478
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:44,900
 And the fact that Puerto Rico is in essence the 51st US state has a large US presence,

479
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:52,300
 but is more isolated, it makes it interesting that any of this alien craft could be rival

480
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:59,080
 governments or aliens that want to test things against America without being fully sighted

481
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:04,520
 by the full scope of the American military, but still have a presence in American territory.

482
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:08,200
 So it's interesting that we have a ton of UFO stories coming out of Puerto Rico, and

483
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,640
 alien stories specifically.

484
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,920
 Not just sightings, but aliens.

485
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:18,600
 But I love this story obviously, because I love stories where aliens get blasted.

486
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:26,820
 The war between humans and aliens, it might just be a pipe dream, someday it may happen.

487
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:31,220
 I'm looking at my window as cartoon birds are flying around and there's an alien drop ship

488
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,340
 sending down death squads.

489
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:39,260
 Obviously on the one hand I hope it never happens because it would result in probably

490
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:43,420
 art destruction and the enslavement of humanity for a couple hundred years until we fought

491
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,380
 back and used their own weapons against them.

492
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:54,760
 But you know, the idea of an alien is a superior force, and I'm a guy who roots for the underdog.

493
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,760
 And I'm a human, so I'm always going to be on the side of humans, but the idea of aliens

494
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,520
 coming down and messing with our stuff, messing with our money, never get between a man and

495
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,520
 his money.

496
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,320
 And that's what these aliens were doing.

497
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,400
 They're taking this guy's cattle, they're chopping him up, they're dissecting him, taking

498
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:12,240
 out organs, draining that sweet sweet blood, and the guy's losing money.

499
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,320
 He's losing money.

500
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,940
 So that's the motto, right?

501
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:21,020
 If you cost a man a dollar, you get shot in the neck.

502
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,100
 I love this story, right?

503
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,100
 It has everything I love.

504
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:28,500
 It has aliens, it has guns, it has guns shooting aliens when we're at your last point.

505
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,860
 Then you also gotta think about it this way, too.

506
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:34,600
 I mean, I don't want to think about it this way, but I've gotta be realistic.

507
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:40,500
 We know that it's tit for tat.

508
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,920
 You come at me, I come at you.

509
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,860
 You bring a knife, I bring a gun, that type of thing.

510
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:50,920
 You kill one of my people, I'm gonna kill ten of yours.

511
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,360
 You go after me, I'm gonna find your fourth cousin.

512
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,060
 I'm gonna take him out.

513
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,060
 That was an accident.

514
00:29:56,060 --> 00:30:00,460
 Actually, I just ran over some random guy and it turned out to be your fourth cousin.

515
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,460
 That was an accident.

516
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,460
 But you know what I mean?

517
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,460
 You have this tit for tat.

518
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,200
 And what if, what if that is going on?

519
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,860
 What if for every time we do shoot an alien?

520
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:12,620
 Because it's not super common, but we do come across them from time to time.

521
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:17,240
 What if those three gray aliens in the woods were like, "Oh, we're gonna pro-- we're gonna

522
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,800
 do so much more probing this weekend."

523
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,960
 You thought us taking your cattle were bad.

524
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,120
 Just wait until we take you.

525
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,120
 You know what I mean?

526
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,120
 Like, vengeance.

527
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,860
 Is that a human emotion?

528
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:34,600
 Or did we start the alien abduction craze?

529
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,860
 Like, is it because we were trying to shoot down their aircraft?

530
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,560
 They're just flying around, right?

531
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:45,740
 Kenneth Arnold, the old timey UFO stories, just UFOs flying around.

532
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,340
 And then we were trying to shoot them down.

533
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,460
 We were chasing them.

534
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,540
 They weren't doing anything weird.

535
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:56,100
 Sure, they were stealing this man's cattle, but aliens getting shot, aliens getting shot

536
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,380
 at, whatever.

537
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,220
 Being pursued, being vilified.

538
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,540
 Maybe that's the reason why they started abducting people.

539
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:06,380
 It wasn't their first goal.

540
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:09,760
 But that became the mission.

541
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,000
 And it's not because of any sort of scientific principle.

542
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,040
 It's out of cold, calculating revenge.

543
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,840
 To them, they're like, "What's a cow?

544
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,760
 Like, we don't even know what money is.

545
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,320
 It's just a big thing that we can operate on and we can see how Earth biology works.

546
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:30,360
 And now you're shooting us in the neck when we're already down.

547
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,440
 We're already like crawling.

548
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,240
 And that didn't even kill me, bro!"

549
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:43,220
 So what if, when humans get abducted, it is not for a scientific reason or for an ambassadorship.

550
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,220
 It is for revenge.

551
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:50,300
 Now, we do have a ton of stories about people who are abducted and aren't brutally tortured

552
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,100
 because they come back to Earth and they tell us.

553
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:56,680
 But remember, the key part of that is they come back.

554
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:01,620
 If you were one of these three gray aliens and you saw that happen to one of your countrymen,

555
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,580
 you saw that happen to your brother, you saw him get shot.

556
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,640
 Dude, they were just swinging by Wendy's.

557
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:13,360
 They were just swinging by and picking up a piece of food.

558
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,120
 They got shot at, one of them got shot.

559
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:20,080
 And while they were trying to save him, the rescuers were shot at.

560
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,400
 Right there, that's a war crime.

561
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,320
 That would be a war crime in a combat situation, I think.

562
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,360
 Don't quote me on that, war lawyers.

563
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,640
 But they're trying to rescue him.

564
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,000
 Now the rescuers are being shot at.

565
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,860
 While he is dragging his bloody body through the soil and then trying to get up and run,

566
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:44,740
 out of fear, he gets shot in the neck, still not dead.

567
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:49,180
 And then finally, you watch the person you've spent countless decades with flying through

568
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,180
 the cosmos.

569
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:57,980
 You watch his brains get splattered across Puerto Rican mud.

570
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,700
 You tell me you wouldn't take revenge.

571
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:08,920
 You tell me you wouldn't find some sort of sadistic delight in abducting frightened school children.

572
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,920
 Taking them aboard your UFO.

573
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,920
 And then you're reading the newspaper.

574
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,920
 You're laughing.

575
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:17,160
 You're reading all the news paper articles about the moms like, "Please just send my

576
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,480
 children home, the aliens."

577
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:34,020
 Maybe not that sadistic, it's UFO.

578
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,020
 You would take revenge.

579
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:42,860
 And if you're going to take revenge against Peter, you would take revenge against somebody.

580
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,140
 On earth there's a rule, kill or be killed.

581
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,100
 We've evolved past that.

582
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,680
 Well we like to think we have.

583
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,880
 In nature it's kill or be killed.

584
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:59,120
 Is that true for the entire universe?

585
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:08,920
 If we treated our alien visitors not as invaders into our airspace or stealers of our livestock,

586
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:13,360
 would we be on better terms with them?

587
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:19,120
 If we didn't just get out of a world war and move into a cold war and begin seeing these

588
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:26,140
 unidentified flying objects in the sky in a state of total global paranoia, if we saw

589
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:32,140
 them at a different time in our development would we have treated them differently?

590
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:35,900
 Because the way history has played out is we've chased them out of the air, we've tried

591
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:43,060
 to shoot them down, we've shot down a few UFOs, we find crashes and take the survivors

592
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:50,320
 where they die because they have no alien medical help, take apart their fallen vehicles

593
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:57,720
 trying to weaponize it, and then if you ever come down where three humans meet four greys

594
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:02,360
 we open fire on them and then brutally murder one of them.

595
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,960
 They executed this guy.

596
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,560
 On earth the rule is kill or be killed.

597
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:18,380
 We don't know if that is the standard rule throughout the universe, but we may have made

598
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:24,180
 that the rule throughout the universe.

599
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:33,140
 Earth may have fired the first shot of an intergalactic war.

600
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:39,760
 We may not see the ships now, we may not see the invading armies now, but maybe they're

601
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:46,920
 on their way, maybe it won't be a war for resources or a war for slave labor or a war

602
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:51,020
 to take our people and turn them into alien hybrids.

603
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:55,560
 It may be a war of petty revenge.

604
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:03,580
 And if the only reason for starting the war is to completely destroy your enemy, that

605
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:16,340
 war does not end until your enemy is completely destroyed.
