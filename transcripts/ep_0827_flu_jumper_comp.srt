1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,260
 When a young woman is doing some renovation to her family home, she has no idea she's

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:10,540
 about to come face to face with something truly horrifying.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:16,020
 And then we take a look at the story of a man who claims that he can hop realities, that

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,860
 he can move from one parallel earth to the other.

5
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:27,260
 He's currently living in our version of reality because where he's from, humanity is about

6
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,060
 to go extinct.

7
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,060
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:41,540
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,540
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,540
 I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,540
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,500
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing.

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,900
 We got a ton of stuff to cover.

14
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,740
 So first off let's go ahead and introduce our Patreon supporter.

15
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,980
 One of our new Patreon supporters walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

16
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:55,980
 Give it up for Skrelpish.

17
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:01,140
 Give him a big round of applause as he's skrelping on in here to Dead Rabbit Command.

18
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,540
 Skrelpish you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

19
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,340
 If you guys can't support the Patreon I totally get it.

20
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,020
 Just help spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

21
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,420
 So Skrelpish let's go ahead and I'm going to toss you the hair hang glider.

22
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,780
 We're going to jump off this huge cliff at Dead Rabbit Command and we're going to glide

23
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,980
 all the way out to a suburban neighborhood.

24
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:29,540
 And as we're gliding on out there I wanted to touch on something I talked about yesterday's

25
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,540
 episode.

26
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,900
 If you listened to yesterday's episode I was talking about that movie Death on the Nile

27
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,900
 and this is super interesting.

28
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,460
 Like no Jason actually that was the least interesting part of yesterday's awesome episode.

29
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,580
 I saw this movie called Death on the Nile.

30
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:48,460
 It's based on some Agatha Christie story and it was so dumb.

31
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,460
 It was really, really bad.

32
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,900
 It was about this guy who got hit in the face with a grenade.

33
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,980
 You're like Jason also quit saying that.

34
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,740
 That's not what the movie was about.

35
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,020
 This guy gets hit in the face with a grenade and it blows off his lips so then he has to

36
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,500
 grow a big mustache to cover up the fact that he has no lips.

37
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,460
 And then he also solves mysteries.

38
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,340
 And it was really weird at the beginning he was British and he's like hey guys don't

39
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:38,340
 go over there look out there's a pffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff

40
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:55,540
 even know what's going on.

41
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,900
 We were talking about Death on the Nile.

42
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,020
 And here's a little conspiracy theory for you.

43
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:05,980
 When I got home I looked up Death of the Nile on IMDB because I wanted to figure out why

44
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:13,020
 that movie was made and looking at the IMDB cast listing it has the whole cast except

45
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,020
 for one guy.

46
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,620
 I've never seen this before.

47
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:25,340
 He's not listed on the IMDB cast but he was the star of the movie.

48
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,340
 Army Hammer.

49
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:32,940
 World famous cannibal Army Hammer was in Death of the Nile and he's not on their IMDB

50
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,940
 page.

51
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,500
 The movie was supposed to come out in 2020 and it was delayed and I go oh it's because

52
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,980
 of COVID and they're no.

53
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:45,540
 The movie was supposed to come out and a month before Army Hammer was accused of eating women.

54
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,540
 What was he actually accused of?

55
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,060
 I don't think they actually accused him of it.

56
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,140
 No they did.

57
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,140
 Those two women went missing like around where he owned a house.

58
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,860
 I'll put those episodes in the show notes.

59
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,020
 I know you probably just woke up and you're like wait what's going on?

60
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,660
 Why is he talking about this?

61
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,420
 Army Hammer is this movie star.

62
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,740
 He was writing like cannibal fan fiction.

63
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,740
 He was sending it to women.

64
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,780
 He's like oh I can't wait to nibble on your ear and not romantically either.

65
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,500
 I want to put it in my soup.

66
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,980
 He was writing all these really weird cannibalistic things to people.

67
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,660
 He's buying them for presents.

68
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,380
 He doesn't buy them rings or jewelry.

69
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,980
 He buys them a giant iron pot to climb into.

70
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,540
 He's like no no I swear it's a spa.

71
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,540
 It's not sauna.

72
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,860
 That's what all us Hollywood people use for saunas.

73
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:33,420
 He's not listed in this movie and they actually, I think this is so funny, so they're supposed

74
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,620
 to release this in December 2020.

75
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,980
 Couple months beforehand Army Hammer gets accused of eating people.

76
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,420
 That's the worst thing your actor can be accused of.

77
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:48,180
 I know like sex crimes is technically the worst thing but I mean Kevin Spacey.

78
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,700
 Kevin Spacey was still in stuff.

79
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,220
 He was accused of talking about eating people.

80
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,420
 Okay I mean that's like the worst.

81
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,420
 That is the worst.

82
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:02,180
 And so they said oh let's not release this movie right now.

83
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:07,180
 So they sat on it for a while and they thought well how can we release this movie.

84
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,700
 They should have just not released it because the movie sucked.

85
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,300
 But they talked about digitally editing in a new dude which would have been so funny.

86
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,420
 Because they talked about how bad the special effects were on the movie already.

87
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,940
 Like the boat looks fake and it's so fake.

88
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,100
 The movie's so fake.

89
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,780
 I can't imagine if they had a holographic you and McGregor walking around and he's

90
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,780
 like hello.

91
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,580
 Like you can see underneath him.

92
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,540
 You can see an Army Hammer blur.

93
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,820
 Oh man what a mess of that movie.

94
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,820
 It's so funny.

95
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,540
 IONDV refused to tell me that Army Hammer is in this movie.

96
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,140
 You have to Google.

97
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,260
 That's what Nick Bustin did.

98
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,540
 He Googled the cast of it and all these articles pop up.

99
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,540
 Say it.

100
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,700
 Army Hammer tried to eat people.

101
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,980
 It's the worst publicity ever.

102
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,700
 I think that's interesting.

103
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,700
 Maybe you don't.

104
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,180
 Maybe you hope that I never talk about this movie again.

105
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:01,820
 But yeah movie starring alleged to be fair alleged cannibal Army Hammer.

106
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,820
 But I do think people do think that he murdered a couple women and ate them.

107
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,820
 Who knows.

108
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,940
 But I'll put those episodes in the show notes.

109
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,420
 I just thought it was so weird.

110
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:13,620
 The producers of this movie so badly don't want you to know that Army Hammer was in it

111
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,940
 even though he's in it.

112
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,940
 He's such a bland dude too.

113
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,940
 Like Army Hammer.

114
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,980
 Army Hammer can take a bite out of me and I wouldn't know it was him.

115
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,980
 He's so milt toast looking.

116
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,980
 Sorry Army.

117
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,020
 I'm gonna listen to this podcast.

118
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,020
 You might be crying right now.

119
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,020
 You're like oh that's it.

120
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,860
 I have to do some of my sad eating.

121
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,740
 There's Girl Scouts sitting at your door.

122
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,740
 I don't know.

123
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,020
 Anyways I thought it was just interesting.

124
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,220
 They don't want you to know.

125
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,580
 They've changed the IMDB page.

126
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,020
 But Skrullpitch that wasn't our main story.

127
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,500
 But that's why it did make me a little hungry.

128
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,220
 So we're gonna stop at a gas station to buy some donuts and Pepsi and then after we eat

129
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,940
 that delicious meal take us out to this suburban neighborhood.

130
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,940
 Now I found this story the other day.

131
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,660
 It was posted by someone called Spirited Zone 3949.

132
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,540
 We're gonna go ahead and call you Tracy.

133
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,540
 That's your real name.

134
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,540
 It's just a guess.

135
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,540
 I'm not trying to dox you or anything.

136
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,060
 Don't want Army Hammer finding his way to your house.

137
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,540
 We're in this suburban household and Tracy is there.

138
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,020
 This story took place 30 years ago.

139
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,820
 So we're back in the year 1998.

140
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,500
 And this house has been in Tracy's family for a long time.

141
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,140
 It was actually her grandfather's house that was passed down through the family.

142
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,140
 And now it's her house.

143
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,900
 Her and her husband are there.

144
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,500
 They're making this house a home.

145
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,660
 And that includes major renovations.

146
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,380
 So first off, they want to tear down all this wallpaper, all this wallpaper that's been

147
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,380
 up for ages.

148
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,820
 And so Tracy's husband's another room and she's working near the entryway.

149
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,940
 This is like almost the last part of the wallpaper to really get down.

150
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,260
 She's up on the step stool.

151
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,620
 This is the final section right by the front door.

152
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,180
 Rip, rip, rip, rip.

153
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,380
 She's pulling down the wallpaper.

154
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,580
 She throws it on the ground and then rip, rip, rip.

155
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,340
 She's tearing it down more.

156
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,180
 And then there's finally just like the very last pieces of this.

157
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,900
 And she's thinking, oh, what a job well done.

158
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,420
 I've finally got all of it.

159
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:06,580
 All I have to do is remove this final piece and then the house was mine.

160
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,860
 That was the contest, right?

161
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,620
 Yeah, 30 days to remove every piece of wallpaper and you win the house.

162
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:16,940
 And she's peeling this last piece of wallpaper off.

163
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:23,700
 She sees a face staring at her underneath the wallpaper.

164
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:28,780
 Now, obviously, like you can look, I used to, as a little kid, I used to lay on my back

165
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,620
 in the living room and I'd look up at the ceiling like the stucco ceiling and I would

166
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,780
 imagine myself walking on the ceiling.

167
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,220
 I did that all the time as a kid and everything was upside down.

168
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,540
 It was crazy world, Jason.

169
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:45,100
 Sometimes I look up and I imagined it as the map of an alien world, all the bumps and stuff.

170
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,740
 You would see continents and then low line areas for the oceans.

171
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,820
 And of course, sometimes you look at a wall and you will see a face.

172
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:58,460
 You will see the outline of what could look like two eyes and nose and mouth.

173
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,580
 That's something the human brain does.

174
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,140
 It finds patterns in things.

175
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:06,220
 That is not what she's looking at right here.

176
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,980
 This is a face.

177
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:15,620
 There's a face, an angry face, a tortured face etched into the wall underneath all of

178
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:21,740
 this wallpaper, decades worth of wallpaper, layered one after another after another as

179
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,820
 the seasons changed, as the fads and fashion changed.

180
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:34,860
 Underneath all of that was the twisted, tortured face of a man etched into the wall.

181
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:42,900
 He's looking at his face and then it begins to move.

182
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,540
 It bulges out of the wall.

183
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:51,700
 No longer is it just the image of a face, it looks like the face is forming into a full

184
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,700
 head.

185
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:58,740
 It looks like someone somehow is pushing their face through the wall and it's getting closer

186
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,900
 and closer to her.

187
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,580
 It's mouth twisted in agony.

188
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:12,060
 Its eyes rolled back in pain.

189
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,820
 She screams, which is obvious for editing most people would do that.

190
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,220
 And then she's on the step stool.

191
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,700
 This thing's coming at her.

192
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:26,260
 She steps off the stool far too quickly and falls to the ground.

193
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,820
 The face continues to bulge out of the wall.

194
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,180
 She runs off and finds her husband.

195
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,180
 Freaking out.

196
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,180
 There's a face in the wall.

197
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,180
 There's a face in the wall.

198
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,620
 How would you even process that?

199
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,660
 She tells her husband about what she had just seen, this terrible visage.

200
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,100
 And he leaves her there and runs to check it for himself.

201
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,420
 She's sitting there crying in this room as her husband runs off to check.

202
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,940
 And then a couple of moments later he comes back and he goes, there's nothing there.

203
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,540
 Like I saw that she would have removed all the wallpaper from that section, but I didn't

204
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,220
 see a face.

205
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,220
 I didn't see anything.

206
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,300
 I didn't see anything that could look like a face.

207
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,300
 Now she explains to you, my husband's super skeptical.

208
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,300
 He's a real skeptical dude.

209
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,300
 He doesn't believe in the paranormal at all.

210
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,620
 But he's convinced I saw something.

211
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,980
 He's convinced that I saw something because the panic I was in.

212
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,900
 He goes, there's no way you could have faked that.

213
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,060
 That level of just sheer fear was real.

214
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,220
 It was palpable.

215
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,860
 That story took place 30 years ago and she says to this day, whenever I think of that,

216
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,140
 it still puts the hairs up on the back of my neck.

217
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:38,860
 A truly terrifying tale of a face in the wall.

218
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,360
 Creepy story, right?

219
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
 It's creepy.

220
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,220
 Like you wonder was that face always there?

221
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,220
 Did they free it when they removed the wallpaper?

222
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,500
 I mean that would have sucked if the face was always there and they just kept putting wallpaper

223
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,020
 on and it couldn't move.

224
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,500
 That wouldn't make me tormented and angry as well.

225
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,220
 What was it doing behind the wallpaper?

226
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,220
 Whose face was it?

227
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:02,180
 There's a lot of really creepy questions you can ask about it.

228
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:07,420
 And you, what was that face doing back there?

229
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,860
 I mean it's not like it would be normal if they were like walking to the kitchen and

230
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:15,460
 there's a face hanging out over your faucet and you're like, hey what's up facey?

231
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,460
 Like that's spooky too.

232
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,460
 Right?

233
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,460
 You're rushing your teeth.

234
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,460
 There's a face in the mirror.

235
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:23,980
 But the fact that it was like trapped under the wallpaper, like that seems, that would

236
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,540
 make me tormented and angry and make me roll my eyes back in agony.

237
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,660
 But then you wonder like was it there the whole time?

238
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,660
 Is it the grandpa?

239
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,660
 Is it the grandpa's face?

240
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,260
 That would make it super awkward.

241
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,460
 Like you're trying to have sex with your husband and you're like I sure hope grandpa's not

242
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,400
 watching you look up in the entire ceiling.

243
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,900
 Is this creepy face?

244
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,780
 He brings a bunch of his friends.

245
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,060
 He brings a bunch of other old faces floating around the house on the wall.

246
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,500
 I don't, I mean it's just creepy.

247
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,100
 Face in the wall is creepy enough but to think that it was hidden that whole time.

248
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,820
 Think about all the times when you'd be hanging out in that house and you'd hear like a muffled

249
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:03,460
 noise and you'd look and you'd be like oh you look expecting to see an old man.

250
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,660
 Oh grandpa is facing the wall but you can't because it's covered up with wallpaper.

251
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:11,420
 And then when they removed the wallpaper, maybe now has free reign.

252
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,420
 Just floating everywhere.

253
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,740
 You're rolling dice, you're trying to play Yachtsy and the face appears on the table.

254
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,820
 You're like grandpa, stop it.

255
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,340
 He swallows the dice.

256
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,340
 Oomp.

257
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,340
 Creepy.

258
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,340
 Creepy.

259
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,340
 I'm making a bunch of jokes about it.

260
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,500
 You're like yeah Jason, it would have been creepy if you just finished the story.

261
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,140
 Now I'm thinking about all these jokes that you're telling.

262
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,700
 But yeah like the face in the wall.

263
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,660
 And it's funny because it's almost like a trope of a horror movie.

264
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,060
 The face in the wall.

265
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,060
 Ugh.

266
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,500
 Squirrelfish, let's go ahead and touch the keys to the carboner copter.

267
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:45,020
 We are leaving behind this house we are headed all the way out to Tokyo, Japan.

268
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:51,980
 The year is 2017.

269
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,820
 There's a young man online he posted this story.

270
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,220
 He went by the name Patech Hestvenik.

271
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,660
 We're going to call him Peter for short.

272
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,540
 Peter is currently living in Japan.

273
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,100
 He's not his home country.

274
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,500
 He's here for work purposes.

275
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,580
 And he's having a good life.

276
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,060
 He has a lot of friends in the area.

277
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,220
 They go out a lot.

278
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,340
 And work seems to be fairly fulfilling to him.

279
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,340
 He's living in the middle of Tokyo with two roommates.

280
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,180
 And everything is working out swell.

281
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:25,460
 Now it's a common stereotype but Peter says it's really weird when people call in sick

282
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,460
 to work in Japan.

283
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,020
 Like it's just not part of their society.

284
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:34,460
 Their work culture is very, very like you just keep going, keep going until you fall

285
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,820
 down dead.

286
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,580
 So the fact that he was having coworkers call in sick.

287
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,580
 It was weird.

288
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,940
 It wasn't super alarming at first.

289
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,460
 But what Peter starts to notice is as he's going about his daily life he'd be going to

290
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,860
 restaurants they'd have less staff there.

291
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:52,580
 When you'd go to other businesses, when you'd go to stores there'd be less staff there.

292
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:57,740
 And then eventually some of these businesses, his included, started having these things

293
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,740
 called vacations.

294
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,180
 They're like that's a new thing in Japan.

295
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,740
 Where the entire business would just shut down for a couple of days.

296
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,740
 You know what?

297
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,340
 We don't have enough employees to really do what we need to do this week.

298
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,900
 So we're just going to end the week early.

299
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,340
 And take Thursday and Friday off.

300
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,900
 Peter's like what in the world is going on?

301
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,780
 This is so bizarre.

302
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:22,300
 But as this continues people start to talk.

303
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,660
 Rumors start to spread because this isn't just in Tokyo.

304
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,460
 This is all over Japan.

305
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,820
 And you're starting to see rumors of a flu.

306
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:37,020
 A very, very bad flu circulating around Japan.

307
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,780
 The government's keeping a tight lid on this though.

308
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:46,460
 But Peter, just through navigating life, reading newspapers, going online, keeps hearing these

309
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,460
 rumors.

310
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,020
 It's an avian based flu.

311
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:55,020
 This flu is spread by birds, but when a human gets it, it can kill them.

312
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:00,060
 That's one of the worst diseases that it doesn't kill the carrier, but can kill us.

313
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:06,820
 And if the carrier flies and there's millions of them, that would be super bad news for humanity.

314
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:12,140
 And that's what's happening to Japan in Peter's reality.

315
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:17,300
 Because obviously we've had avian flu, we've had swine flu, we've had this stuff here.

316
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:23,820
 But in 2017 there was no mass outbreak in Japan where people are calling in sick, where

317
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,020
 people are dying, and the government's covering it up.

318
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:31,220
 So Peter's story is from an alternate reality.

319
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,220
 But he's here now.

320
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,060
 He's with us to share the story with us.

321
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,060
 So how?

322
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,060
 This is so interesting.

323
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:41,180
 In his version of the world, this disease is spreading through Japan, and the government

324
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:45,060
 is trying to figure out a cure as well as stop panic.

325
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:53,060
 But the rumors get proven true, and the world takes notice.

326
00:16:53,060 --> 00:17:00,620
 China, United States, Russia, Mongolia, Singapore, all these countries begin mass colings of

327
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,500
 their bird populations.

328
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,660
 They begin killing them.

329
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,780
 If you have a parakeet in your house, you better hide it.

330
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,780
 Because someone's coming to chop its head off.

331
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:14,740
 You had millions of birds killed worldwide trying to stem this virus.

332
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,740
 And that's good, right?

333
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,740
 You're trying to stop it.

334
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,980
 But remember Peter is in Japan.

335
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,980
 This is where this started.

336
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,980
 All flights have been canceled.

337
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,980
 He's stuck there.

338
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,380
 He actually, when he was hearing the rumors, he goes, "You know what?

339
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,620
 I better go back to my home country just in case.

340
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,620
 It's time for a vacation."

341
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,620
 And in ways I'm getting vacations from work, he bought a plane ticket and he said, "That's

342
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,900
 the day before his flight was supposed to take off.

343
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,580
 That's when they canceled all the flights.

344
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,260
 So I'm stuck here.

345
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,260
 I'm stuck here."

346
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:45,540
 And both of his roommates at this point, they're sick.

347
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:51,860
 And he's sitting in his room, and he's trying to figure out what his next step is going

348
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,860
 to be.

349
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,860
 Because his roommates are sick, right?

350
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,300
 It's right at his doorstep.

351
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,340
 So news reports are starting to spread.

352
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:04,220
 This disease has left behind Japan.

353
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,220
 It is now in mainland Asia.

354
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,020
 It's in China, Korea, places like that.

355
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:15,980
 And he's sitting there in his room, staying away from his roommates, watching the news.

356
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,620
 It's being spread all over Asia now.

357
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:22,940
 The mass bird colons might have slowed it down, but definitely did not stop it.

358
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,940
 Humans are passing it to each other.

359
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:29,660
 Humans are carrying it for hundreds, thousands of miles and dropping it off in other cities.

360
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,660
 Peter has an idea.

361
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,780
 He has a motorbike.

362
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:35,020
 He's going to pack up a bunch of supplies.

363
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,220
 Tomorrow morning, he's going to hop on it and just go out into the wilderness of Japan

364
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,540
 and try to outlast this virus.

365
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,260
 But the night before he leaves, he goes to Reddit.

366
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:50,260
 If I had one night possibly left alive, I hope it's not spent on Reddit.

367
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,140
 He goes to Reddit and he's actually, he's apparently a believer in the paranormal.

368
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,660
 He was on the Mandela, the Mandela FX subreddits.

369
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:03,500
 He's looking around and he ends up finding himself going to the dimensional jumping subreddit,

370
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,580
 which we covered a long time ago.

371
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,940
 And it is what it sounds like.

372
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:12,580
 It is a bunch of tips and tricks on how to move from one dimension to the other.

373
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,580
 And you know what?

374
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,700
 He has nothing to lose, right?

375
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:21,220
 Virus is sweeping across Asia very, very shortly, if not already be in Europe and be

376
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,500
 in the United States.

377
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,740
 He cares about any of those places, right?

378
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,580
 He's in middle of Tokyo.

379
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,620
 He doesn't have to worry about, "Oh, I wonder how the Prime Minister of Canada will react

380
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,620
 to this."

381
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,940
 He's dealing with it right now and two of his roommates are sick.

382
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:40,300
 So looking at the dimensional jumping subreddit, he decides to do the two-bottle method to

383
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,380
 change dimensions.

384
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,420
 Very, very simple, very, very simple thing.

385
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,420
 This is how you do it.

386
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:50,860
 He took two containers, in his case, two plastic soda bottles.

387
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:55,060
 And on one of the bottles, you write your current situation.

388
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:59,780
 So he wrote, "Killer flew on a piece of paper," and he didn't have any tape.

389
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,020
 He only had what was in his room.

390
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,980
 He didn't want to go out in the living room where there's two other sickos right.

391
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,500
 He had a piece of paper.

392
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:11,580
 He took some chewing gum, stuck it to the one bottle, and filled that bottle up with water.

393
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,260
 And it says, "Killer flew."

394
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:17,380
 On the other bottle, the empty bottle, he wrote, "All is fine."

395
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,740
 Put a little chewing gum on a piece of paper.

396
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,100
 It stuck the label on that second one.

397
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,220
 Then he went and he watched news coverage about what was going on, to remind himself

398
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,500
 of where he's at.

399
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,860
 Then he pulls up a picture of himself and some of his friends out for drinks that was

400
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,620
 taken earlier that year.

401
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,620
 Good times.

402
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,660
 Before all of this madness erupted.

403
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,820
 He pictured that piece.

404
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,940
 He pictured that fun, that companionship, all of that stuff.

405
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:47,700
 He then pours the water out of the killer flew bottle into the "All is fine" bottle,

406
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:52,140
 and then drinks the "All is fine" bottle until all of the water is gone.

407
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,700
 You're basically pouring out the bad reality into the reality you want, and then you drink

408
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,780
 it.

409
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:03,220
 And then he shut off his laptop and he went to sleep.

410
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:12,220
 When he woke up the next morning, ooooh, man, sure is restful when there's a world ending

411
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,220
 disease floating around.

412
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,660
 He goes out of his room.

413
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:21,220
 He's laying there in bed and he starts to hear this commotion out in the living room.

414
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:26,100
 He hears one of his roommates kind of bumbling around and he goes and he opens the door.

415
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:30,220
 And there is one of his roommates, totally healthy, going "Oh my god, oh my god, I'm

416
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,380
 totally going to be late for work.

417
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,380
 I slept in.

418
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,980
 Oh my god, where are my shoes?"

419
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,820
 Peter turns on the television set.

420
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:42,220
 No news about any sort of virus sweeping through Japan.

421
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,140
 He goes to work.

422
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:47,260
 He shows up.

423
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,660
 Everyone is there, no one's calling in.

424
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,660
 There's no vacation plan.

425
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,580
 He's like "Hey, do I get five days off this weekend?"

426
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,020
 Your boss is like "Yeah, you're fired."

427
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,380
 He shows up and he said it was the same place of employment.

428
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:05,300
 I had the same coworkers, but I had a slightly different job than I had in my previous reality.

429
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,940
 Because at this point he realizes he's jumped universes.

430
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,980
 He goes same place of business, different job.

431
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,580
 He goes "I could do it."

432
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:19,900
 It wasn't totally out of my realm of expertise, but it's not the job I had.

433
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,860
 He stayed there for a short period of time continuing to work there.

434
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,820
 And then he quit.

435
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:31,260
 And he bought tickets to go back home, back to his home country, just in case.

436
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,260
 He's like "See you later Tokyo, Japan.

437
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,100
 I'm going Wuhan, China."

438
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:41,780
 It doesn't actually say where his home country was.

439
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:47,020
 But he goes back there and he says "It was weird.

440
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,620
 Things were different here."

441
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:52,340
 He goes "I don't know, maybe it was because I'd been gone for a while and people were

442
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,340
 happy to see me."

443
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:58,140
 But he goes "All of my friends and my family, they're nicer here.

444
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,500
 Some of them have a few quirks, a few interesting details about them that they did not have

445
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,460
 in my home reality.

446
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,540
 But all of them are nicer.

447
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,820
 Some of them are a little louder, oddly enough.

448
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,820
 But all of them are nicer.

449
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:12,820
 I can do this.

450
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,580
 This works for me."

451
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:20,300
 It's interesting because he says in one of the, he makes that initial post and then he

452
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:25,060
 replies a couple of times and then this account was never used again.

453
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:29,260
 One of these replies, he was talking in more details about the story, he ends it like this

454
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:34,820
 "I have to admit, some part of me wasn't actually really hoping this works.

455
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:40,220
 Because as terrible as that epidemic was, it was sort of exciting trying to keep it alive

456
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,420
 despite it."

457
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,920
 That's the story of a young man, right?

458
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:52,340
 When you're young you do yearn for action and adventure, even if it does mean the world's

459
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,340
 falling apart.

460
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:57,940
 If you get older you start to think "Oh dude, if a zombie is attacked today, how am I going

461
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,460
 to get my beta blockers by the end of the week?"

462
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:05,580
 I'm at that age where it would be fun to fight zombies off for the weekend.

463
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:12,300
 But if I had to look at my back hurts, I have two thakes, my vision's not the best.

464
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:17,140
 So I don't really want a zombie apocalypse as much as I did when I was in my 20s and

465
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,500
 I was far more spry.

466
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,900
 So you have this young person going like "Yeah, it was kind of cool even though two thirds

467
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,380
 of humanity were dying."

468
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,500
 I didn't die.

469
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:31,500
 I was actually really good at staying alive.

470
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,700
 And then there's no more from him.

471
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,060
 No more posts.

472
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,220
 Which could mean that it's a lark, right?

473
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,220
 He had his laugh.

474
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:45,020
 It's a lot of fun to tell that story and to make that up.

475
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:48,940
 Or he went back.

476
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,020
 Maybe intentionally.

477
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:55,100
 Maybe he was here and things were just a little too different.

478
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,100
 Right?

479
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:00,100
 Just a little too different.

480
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,820
 He wanted to be with his family, not this family.

481
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:09,460
 He wanted to be with those friends, not these friends, who act just slightly off.

482
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,820
 He might have gone back intentionally.

483
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:17,220
 It's possible that he went back unintentionally.

484
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:22,980
 That the doorway that brought him here was so unstable.

485
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,620
 It was a temporary journey.

486
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:30,460
 And the fact that in a way he kind of wished that he hadn't left in the first place, that

487
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:37,060
 might have been enough to retract him back into his home dimension.

488
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:42,100
 But what did he see when he returned?

489
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:48,100
 Did he return to a home dimension where the disease had been cured and humanity was breathing

490
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,260
 a sigh of relief?

491
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,700
 They caught it in time?

492
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,260
 Or did he return to an apartment?

493
00:25:54,260 --> 00:26:02,260
 Did he wake up in his bedroom with his nostrils overcome by two dead bodies that had been

494
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:06,540
 stinking up his apartment for the past few days?

495
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:12,860
 And as he walks through the apartment complex, he can smell the death behind each door.

496
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:17,420
 And when he walks out onto the balcony and he can look down on the streets of Tokyo,

497
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,340
 they're silent.

498
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,180
 They're empty.

499
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,380
 They're dead.

500
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:30,860
 Did he return to a world where he is one of the few humans remaining?

501
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,580
 On an island, right?

502
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:43,140
 On an island in Japan with no hope of leaving unless he knows how to sail or fly a plane.

503
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,500
 So his story ends there.

504
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:49,100
 We don't know what happened to him after he came to our reality.

505
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,100
 Did he go back?

506
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,420
 We don't know.

507
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,940
 If he went back, was it intentional or unintentional?

508
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,940
 Who knows?

509
00:26:54,940 --> 00:27:00,140
 I think we like to think of dimensional jumping as this cool trick.

510
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,740
 But what if it's more of a trap?

511
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:07,580
 It's not someone drinking two glasses of water and moving to a world where things are more

512
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,580
 of their liking.

513
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:14,180
 It's a burning man running out of a burning building into a building that is not yet on

514
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,180
 fire.

515
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:20,460
 But when that burning man runs into it, he sets the entire place ablaze.

516
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:24,900
 Now both buildings are burning down.

517
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:31,160
 What happens if someone jumps from another reality and brings their disease with them?

518
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,220
 To us.

519
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:39,140
 The end of the world may be a glass of water away.

520
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:46,460
