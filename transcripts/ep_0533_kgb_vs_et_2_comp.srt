1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
 Does an old French ghost story actually have terrifying implications for everyday life?

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:14,160
 And then we travel to the Soviet Union to follow a group of KGB Special Forces out on

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,680
 a mission.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:22,360
 When an island is mysteriously shrouded in fog and people go missing from time to time,

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,000
 the government wants to know why.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,640
 Little did they know that this investigation would turn into a bloodbath today on Dead

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,640
 Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:41,080
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,200
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,800
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,280
 We got a ton of stuff to cover so we're going to get started right away.

12
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,480
 First off let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Joseph Zuts.

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,880
 Joseph Zuts thank you for supporting the show.

14
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,800
 He's actually just started listening to the show and he's a new Patreon that's very very

15
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,800
 exciting.

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,240
 You're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

17
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,560
 You can't decoy the Patreon that's fine too.

18
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,960
 Just help spread the word about the show that really really helps out a lot.

19
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,400
 Now Joseph I'm going to toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Robot or an ore.

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,400
 Catch!

21
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,920
 It's a huge ore but he's a strong guy.

22
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,920
 Toss you an ore.

23
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,480
 We're going to take the Dead Rabbit Robot but first off I want to give you an update to

24
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,880
 yesterday's episode Samson Forever.

25
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,000
 So yesterday we talked about Samson the dog.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,880
 Samson is a long time listener of the show along with his best friend Sean.

27
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,280
 We actually used one of his websites as a source a long time ago on the Gattington Canyon

28
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,280
 story.

29
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,720
 So he told me that his dog Samson had come down with something called leptocereiosis.

30
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,720
 It's not it.

31
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,720
 It's not it.

32
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,560
 Leptoprosis and it's very common.

33
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,560
 It's super common.

34
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,200
 You usually get it by being a dog.

35
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,960
 Just like your dog you're like swimming and you're chasing animals and stuff like that

36
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,960
 biting squirrels.

37
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,960
 You can get this disease.

38
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,840
 It's so common among dogs that the vets say you should get them vaccinated once a year.

39
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,760
 So if you have a dog talk to your vet about that because it can kill your dog it would

40
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:16,560
 ended up causing internal organ failure in Samson and they were going to put him to sleep

41
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,380
 on Wednesday.

42
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,920
 So we rushed the episode out.

43
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,320
 We put Samson in the cockpit of all of our vehicles and I wanted to let you guys know

44
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:30,840
 that although Samson is no longer with us Sean was a I thought this was pretty cool.

45
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,320
 Sean I sent Sean the email and he woke up the next day and he was going to take Samson

46
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,840
 out to the yard one last time to play catch and he thought he had something in his head

47
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,560
 going I should check my email and he saw the episode and so Samson got to hear that episode

48
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,220
 with all of us this show isn't just me it's all of us so we all got to go on this giant

49
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,580
 adventure with Samson and he got to hear it and he had a great time.

50
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,980
 Sean said he just seemed so alive running around in the backyard.

51
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,660
 So we're sorry to see Samson go but he may make returns in future episodes.

52
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,860
 He may be a dog that pops up helps us fight aliens chase Bigfoot all sorts of stuff.

53
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,020
 We're going to miss you Samson but you'll always have a place in the heart of the dead

54
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,380
 rabbit radio family.

55
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,280
 So Joseph I'm going to nod to you you nod to me you try to salute with the ore you bump

56
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,120
 your head it's very comical to us not to you.

57
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,200
 Let's go ahead and hop in that dead rabbit row boat we are going to row all the way from

58
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,360
 America to France.

59
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,040
 Joseph gets to stand on the bow of the dead rabbit row boat he's technically the captain

60
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,400
 where we all have to row we're rowing with one hand drinking our beverage of choice in

61
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,400
 the other.

62
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,640
 And Joseph's like a man I'm going to have a drink we're like yeah sure but you got to

63
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,320
 help row and he's like no I'm fine.

64
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:52,380
 I brought my own water so we finally are making our way all the way out to France.

65
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:57,740
 We're going back to the year 1710 and I want to give a shout out to two Twitter followers

66
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:04,760
 burnt toast ghost and Lusurter Chuckle F word I can't they actually say the word but

67
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,660
 try to keep the show not super explicit although I'll talk about horrible horrible disgusting

68
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:14,300
 diseases that meth users have those episodes aside thank you so much Lusurda thank you

69
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:19,140
 so much burnt toast ghost they helped do some translation for this episode.

70
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,200
 So we're going back to the year 1710 we're in Brittany France we're going to get out

71
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,600
 of the dead rabbit row boat we're walking through the forest we're specifically in the

72
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,600
 forest of Ludock and we're walking through the forest and shh be quiet be quiet we hear

73
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,440
 two people arguing in the distance we see two men poking each other's chest with their

74
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,580
 fingers I love her and then the other guy goes no I love her and they keep poking each other's

75
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:48,160
 chest we're seeing a fight this is how all the time people fought we're seeing a fight

76
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,320
 between Pierre LaRoy and Jan Jan so they're like poking each other's chest I love her

77
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,880
 no no no I love her more and we're like oh this is kind of like a lovers quarrel except

78
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,440
 except the lover isn't there it's two dudes fine over one they're just poking each other's

79
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:08,520
 chest and then we see a startling movement but we can't do anything because otherwise

80
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:14,140
 I don't have a story we have to let this happen Jan Jan stops poking Pierre in the chest with

81
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:19,180
 his finger and he reaches down he pulls out a dagger and goes this will be more effective

82
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:26,740
 than my finger and he stabs Pierre LaRoy oh no my blood I need that to live Pierre exclaims

83
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:34,220
 as he falls to the ground and uh p- Jan Jan goes I guess I win I guess I now have the

84
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:39,100
 love of my life and he walks away so Pierre is laying there out in the forest and he's

85
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:45,440
 bleeding and he dies oh wait no I looked at my notes that's not what happens we kind of

86
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,680
 I skipped a step so Jan Jan comes back he's like oh I forgot this part of the story he

87
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,760
 comes back and Pierre is dead he just kind of walked around the tree until he died and

88
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,960
 then he goes okay I committed the perfect crime I murdered someone that's step one of

89
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,420
 the perfect crime now I have to dispose of the evidence so he digs a grave right by an

90
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:10,140
 oak tree deep in the forest and he buries it he's like ah ha ha now the perfect crime

91
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,580
 has been committed step two hiding the evidence now step three to leave the scene but the

92
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,860
 perfect crime is not what he committed because he's very shortly found out to have murdered

93
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:25,100
 this guy I don't know why those details have kind of been lost to history or I didn't research

94
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:31,920
 that part but the point of the story is he was found out and poor Jan Jan is executed

95
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:39,480
 on December 11th 1710 now there's actually a record of his execution so we know this

96
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:45,080
 part of the story is true and that's not in the realm of impossibility right so we know

97
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:50,720
 that part of the story is true where we get into the legend is this at that oak tree in

98
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:57,500
 the middle of the forest five holes appear in the ground that's the sound of a hole

99
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,980
 appearing you know if you're not a geologist five holes appear in the ground right where

100
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:06,260
 his body was buried I'm a suit actually now that I'm saying this out loud I'm assuming

101
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:11,260
 they dug them up I'm assuming they didn't leave them buried there but for whatever reason

102
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:18,620
 it was ghost ground five holes appear right by this oak tree now a legend started this

103
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:26,160
 where the ghost story starts that if you cover the holes up you die within a year it's interesting

104
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,520
 because we don't know how the legend started or even when it started we just have anecdotes

105
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:40,000
 later on supposedly at some point like the first story we have about this is two drunk

106
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,320
 dudes show up at the crime scene and they're like I'm more drunk no no no I'm more drunk

107
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,580
 they're poking each other in the chest and then one guy starts reaching for a knife and

108
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,520
 they're like whoa whoa whoa hey I don't know I don't know what you're trying to do but

109
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:57,640
 first let's tempt this ghost story I heard that if you cover up one of these holes you'll

110
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,120
 die within a year and the guy the guy's still reaching for the knife he's like you might

111
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,440
 die right now and he's like yeah yeah don't don't do that let's let's continue the story

112
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,200
 if we cover up these holes will die within a year apparently one of them did one of the

113
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,260
 drunk guys decided to cover up the holes I don't know if he covered up all of them or

114
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:20,080
 one of them or what but he died within a year now there's no names associated with the story

115
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,920
 there's no dates associated with that story and that's really when you read about this

116
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:30,560
 online they tell it's pretty much the story I told you dude gets murdered body gets dumped

117
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,200
 holes appear legend starts and then they'll go for example two drunk guys once da da da

118
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,440
 da da you're like okay just a simple local ghost story it's a legend if you go out there

119
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,300
 you walk around a tree three times say boogity boogity ghost pops up the national forestry

120
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:52,820
 office of France has the area roped off you can see photos of this there's four posts

121
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:57,940
 put up there's a rope covering the areas and there's a sign there that warns people to stay

122
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,820
 out of the area and that's what I was getting help from Lasserta and burnt toast ghost because

123
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:06,580
 I was like I don't know French right that's actually a long story I might I might have

124
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:12,000
 told that story before but I might know French but I definitely can't read it I asked for

125
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,160
 a translation and people are like oh you know that's actually what it says it says beware

126
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,840
 that some dude died here don't cover up the holes you'll die within a year so stay out

127
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:28,080
 so the national forestry office put this up now obviously it could just be a tourist trap

128
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,280
 but where are you spending your money at there's not like a person selling whole trinket around

129
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,940
 the corner selling donut holes test your luck try to throw these into the rope dairy and

130
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,420
 see if you can plug a hole up could be a tourist trap but it's unlikely it could be a legend

131
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:50,660
 that nobody really wants to test it's interesting on two levels one it's a very very hard myth

132
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:55,740
 to disprove because a lot of people die within a year your chances of dying in the next year

133
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,700
 are actually quite slim if you're generally healthy and you don't do any sort of like

134
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:05,640
 crazy things like drinking and driving and stuff like that but everyone has a chance

135
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:11,840
 of dying within a year you can increase those chances plugging holes isn't one of them unless

136
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,040
 you're plugging in like you know Godzilla's butthole then you might be in trouble but

137
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,760
 for the most part plugging holes isn't a high risk factor you could have a hundred people

138
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,440
 plug these holes a hundred people do this and then within a year one of them dies and

139
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,260
 that was the 65 year old man who was drunk driving and trying to drive his car and Godzilla's

140
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:37,720
 butthole so he was going to die anyways the other people who do it who keep on living

141
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,940
 aren't part of the legend so it's like confirmation bias you're looking for the stories that back

142
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:47,700
 up what you're looking for you could even say my uncle died and a year before he went

143
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:53,380
 to the forest maybe he plugged one of the holes I think there's actually a scarier implication

144
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:59,480
 to this story what we know is that there is a record of this crime taking place at this

145
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:06,160
 area we have these five holes in the ground we have this legend around them how many of

146
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:13,280
 these locations are out there that we don't know about the world could be littered with

147
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:19,000
 paranormal landmines like this I'm not even talking about like haunted houses or sacred

148
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,320
 ground I'm talking about places where someone was brutally murdered the crime was never

149
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,220
 discovered it was the perfect crime bodies buried just feet under the ground and while

150
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,700
 it's decaying into the earth it's releasing all of this vengeance energy because it was

151
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:43,880
 killed because of a lover's quarrel basically fosters and grows so the chance of you stepping

152
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:49,680
 on one of these or you're like spitting sunflower seeds and there's tiny little hole tiny little

153
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:56,440
 bird got stabbed are quite high so I'm not asking you guys to be a gorophobic or anything

154
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,360
 I'm just asking you to be a little careful around all those holes you see in your daily

155
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,720
 life if you happen to see one just step aside because although you might think oh that's

156
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,320
 just a hole there's no big deal it can't hurt me within a year you may find out how much

157
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:18,600
 damage a hole can actually do I guess I said that statement out loud and yes I'm saluting

158
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,880
 to Joseph Zatz he's saluting back we are going to give him the keys to the carboner copter

159
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:32,720
 we are taking off and we are headed out to the Soviet Union to helicopter is flying out

160
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,000
 Joseph take us high in the air as I do this introduction a while back I a long time ago

161
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,520
 did an episode about the KGB fighting aliens in Antarctica I actually might do that episode

162
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:51,080
 as a rerun because it's one of my favorite episodes and spoiler alert the KGB got slaughtered

163
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,080
 they got turned into concrete pillars you know those things you see outside of like a Walmart

164
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:00,840
 so people don't crash their car into the store that's what happened to the KGB they all work

165
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:06,520
 a Walmart now these KGB soldiers try to shoot down a UFO with a rocket launcher and they

166
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:12,360
 all got turned to giant concrete poles but see that can't be the end right that can't

167
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,740
 be the end of that so also that story was fake that story was provably fake but this

168
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:26,600
 story this story from a r u dot UFO for not r u a UFO is from a Russian UFO forum by Alexander

169
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,880
 Glasunov now this story might be this story might be real doesn't end with anyone turning

170
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:37,320
 into pillars of concrete this story actually is more in line with how the KGB would actually

171
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:43,480
 interact with alien life because this is how they interacted with humans as well Joseph

172
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:52,000
 bring us down low put on that stealth mode we're landing at Barsek Lemme's Island we're

173
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,320
 in the Aral Sea of Kazakhstan and I know I added letters and mispronounced each of those

174
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,560
 but it doesn't matter Joseph is our weapons master he's each given us the weapon that

175
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,120
 we deserve most based on our skill set he gives me this cool cool looking rifle with like

176
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,320
 all these laser pointers and there's just laser pointers taped onto the end of it and then

177
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,200
 he's like giving you I don't know like shotgun you like shotguns he's asking he doesn't know

178
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,840
 anything about weapons he's just handing out random weapons to people hey you look like

179
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,960
 you could use a grenade launcher gives it to like a 10 year old kid Joseph is now handing

180
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,200
 us all weapons we gotta check them because this is gonna be a dangerous mission guy we're

181
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:33,000
 putting on our ghillie suits we're going off the year is 1976 and it's dark it's night

182
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,960
 time and as we're sitting there in darkness we all got night vision on we see a boat come

183
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:47,680
 up to Barsek Lemme's Island there's been a lot of this island is uninhabited but there's

184
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,840
 been a lot of reports of people in the area I know that doesn't make sense but but I'm

185
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:59,360
 assuming that it means other fishermen I'm assuming fishermen had reported other fishermen

186
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,320
 going missing around this island the island itself was uninhabited but there were reports

187
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,120
 from locals that people had gone missing in the area so the Soviet Union wants to know

188
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:13,920
 what's going on here is it US secret spies here or US not secret spies you just walk

189
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,760
 around with big shirts and say I'm a spy on it in this landing craft is about a dozen

190
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:24,960
 KGB special forces troops these are the best of the best of the best they're being led

191
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:30,600
 by a major we'll call him major Jones major Jones hot everyone's like dude that's an

192
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,000
 American name I think he's the spy he's like what no I'm not I shift inside of side they

193
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,960
 jump all out of the boat now major Jones is leading these 12 special forces KGB guys so

194
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:46,000
 they're walking up this dark beach and now they're exploring the inner part of the island

195
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,760
 and even though it's so dark out they can start to see fog begin to roll through the

196
00:15:50,760 --> 00:16:00,600
 area and the major describes a sensation of fear

197
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,480
 he had never known before he's been in a lot of dicey situations breaking into people's

198
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:11,480
 houses beating up peasants but he's never experienced fear like this so he holds his

199
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:19,040
 hand up to halt his men the fog just rolls over him now they had an aerial footage of

200
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:26,200
 this island they knew it was uninhabited that's why when the fog clears and they see a giant

201
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:32,000
 fence in the distance the major knows something's up so they begin to make their way towards

202
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,960
 the fence when they get to it's quite high the Russians actually have to climb over

203
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:40,560
 it they all scramble over it and now they're on the other side of this fence there's a

204
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:49,320
 rocky hill now going up and on top of it they can see in the darkness a 16 foot wide silver

205
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:55,160
 sphere just sitting on the ground soldiers all look at each other the major just stare

206
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,120
 straight ahead so major Jones commands his troops to get down get down get down and they

207
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,120
 begin moving through the darkness weapons ready this wasn't supposed to be here the

208
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:10,400
 fence was weird enough but now there's an alien craft they're walking up this hill very quietly

209
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,040
 and when they get to the top of it they see what's described as strangely dressed people

210
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:22,240
 there's three of them they're standing around this sphere the major sees these these strangely

211
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:28,120
 dressed people standing around and they're wearing holsters and in those holsters is

212
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:33,440
 what is described as a laser gun major Jones gives the command he goes listen what we're

213
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,840
 going to do is we're going to walk up to them really really quietly and then we're going

214
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,000
 to jump out we're going to point our guns at them we're going to take them prisoner

215
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,560
 because I really want to know who built that fence it's a really nice fence we're going

216
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:49,760
 to take a prisoner however men if they even think about reaching for one of those things

217
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,360
 in their holsters you know what the KGB does best and everyone knows everyone nods in agreement

218
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,240
 yeah they just shoot people so major Jones and his men start getting closer and closer

219
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,880
 to these aliens it doesn't describe them as actually being aliens they're just strangely

220
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,080
 dressed people could have been Amish for all we know but they generally don't have laser

221
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,760
 guns eventually the soldiers pop out and they're holding their guns aimed at the ready at these

222
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:22,160
 three strangers and major Jones has his weapon aimed at them as well one of the little alien

223
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:30,040
 dudes starts reaching it's just a minute touch but his hand goes to that weapon in his holster

224
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:40,800
 major Jones and his men know what they have to do they immediately open fire the aliens

225
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:51,360
 are all screaming and stuff they slaughtered these three dudes now that is pretty typical

226
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,160
 for the KGB right you can't knock them it gets results done they've been doing this

227
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:02,480
 for years generally you kind of want to keep one of them alive maybe to like you know find

228
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,400
 out secrets of the universe how to build spaceships things like that or you could just shoot three

229
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,560
 dudes just because they're strangely dressed and might have a weapon on them just massacre

230
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:16,440
 them major Jones really isn't worried about this at this point they have at least as giant

231
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,000
 silver orb they can like hang out take pictures and and reverse engineer that's something

232
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,240
 for the eggheads in Moscow to figure out what he's more interested in is that laser gun

233
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:32,960
 so major Jones walks up to one of these previously alive aliens and he pulls it out and it's

234
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,800
 actually like a wand he figures just by looking at it which direction whatever's gonna come

235
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,520
 out of it will come out of it I mean he has a 50/50 chance right he's either gonna destroy

236
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:50,920
 his arm or do something cool so he takes this wand type device out and he points it at the

237
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:59,760
 ground and he presses a button and it goes and everyone at first is very very afraid

238
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,760
 they don't know if he made the right choice it's 50/50 they don't know if this dude's

239
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,920
 about to get disappeared but nothing happens they hear that whistle noise and everyone

240
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:13,440
 is on edge even major Jones isn't exactly for sure what that whistle noise signifies

241
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,080
 but there's no light there's no flash it's just the noise and then nothing and then major

242
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:25,360
 Jones looks down and sees that the dirt where he had been pointing the rod at was beginning

243
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:32,200
 to turn into glass so this wasn't in fact some sort of laser weapon major Jones puts it in

244
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,320
 his belt I'm assuming it doesn't actually say that in the story but you're not gonna leave

245
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,880
 that behind at this point he is stationed at this silver sphere and there are scouts

246
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,560
 kind of surveying the area there are more of these things out there are there more of

247
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,880
 these really cool guns are gonna be able to have a laser tag battle to the death eventually

248
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:55,160
 one of the scouts comes running back and says major Jones major Jones found a cave I think

249
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:00,960
 there might be more of them in there suit up boys get all their weapons ready they're

250
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,400
 ready to go they begin making their way to this cave major Jones is leading his men through

251
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,400
 and it's just a normal cave but then he notices that the cave stops being a cave the walls

252
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:18,800
 stop being jagged and all rocking stuff they start to become smooth like walls as they're

253
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:24,960
 walking through this tunnel they begin to see tables which while those aren't very sci-fi

254
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,960
 everyone has one there's probably one in front of you right now you don't expect them in

255
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,000
 caves especially caves with smooth walls if you see a table in a cave don't call a national

256
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,080
 inquire that's kind of weird it's not super weird but they also saw a bunch of like weirds

257
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,320
 alien equipment is how it's described they're walking through this tunnel they're starting

258
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,360
 to see these tables and it looks like alien equipment is just being stored here it's not in use

259
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:55,760
 but as they continue to walk through the tunnel they see it starts to open up and in this massive

260
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:03,280
 open chamber it's full of alien technology view screens and control panels and all sorts of stuff

261
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:09,840
 and this is being used it's lit up little lights flashing and in this

262
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:16,400
 room they see a ton of these tiny little alien guys these guys are actually described as being

263
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:24,000
 dwarf size these may actually be gray aliens the people in the first part of the story they

264
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,880
 weren't described in any sort of alien fashion other than they were wearing weird clothing

265
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,520
 they could have just been vacationers honestly and they were just flying around in a silver-shaped

266
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,160
 balloon and i guess they also invented laser guns they were probably aliens but this part of the

267
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:44,640
 story actually seeing what's described as several dwarf sized aliens so most likely a room full of

268
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:51,040
 grays but it wasn't just a room full of gray aliens going about their business there was also two

269
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:58,160
 giant aliens sitting at different control panels now both of these guys are six foot five so not

270
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,880
 giant in the nephaleme sense like 13 foot tall but still six foot five is not something you want to

271
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,720
 go in combat against sure you're the kgb you got all these weapons but still these guys are pretty

272
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,240
 huge they're definitely familiar with alien tech they most likely have laser guns as well so major

273
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,280
 jones is kind of running this game through his head he goes okay here's the thing we can retreat

274
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,880
 because there's only 12 of us there's a bunch of these dwarf little alien dudes in here and these

275
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,240
 two giant guys so we can retreat come back with better forces we could bomb it we could gas it we

276
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,400
 could be like throwing gas grenades should have brought some of those but i didn't gas them out

277
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,840
 take them back dissect them all that stuff or we could keep them alive we could go in kind of hold

278
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,840
 them hostage that didn't work so well the first time just about 30 minutes ago but we can hold

279
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,880
 them hostage we can actually learn from them maybe we can actually apologize for what we had done

280
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,080
 before because we thought we were under attack maybe we can make first contact in 1976 we're at

281
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:58,080
 the height of the cold war we could use all this stuff but this technology is so much more useful

282
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,360
 if you can talk to the people who know how to work it out so he's running these games through

283
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:09,200
 his head he's trying to think what's the best move what would vladimir linand do then he then he

284
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:16,400
 goes what would stall and do his men pour into the room and begin to massacre everyone in it

285
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:24,240
 these kgb soldiers come in with guns blazing not a single word said they direct all their fire to

286
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,800
 mowing down all the tiny people the two chinese are still just sitting there they're not even

287
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:40,480
 aware what's going on until half the grays are split in half by russian gunfire goes on and on

288
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,720
 and on longer than i have breath for just play that segment over and over again put it in a loop

289
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:51,600
 they slaughter these guys they blow them up it would have been an absolute massacre and after

290
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:58,320
 they're done shooting everything smaller than four feet in that room the major then directs all of

291
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:04,480
 his fire towards the giants this is happening so fast the giants are still at their control panels

292
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:12,720
 when the first bullets come flying towards them it's in slow motion now these bullets

293
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:24,720
 flying towards the giants the giants begin to turn and the bullets begin to hit them

294
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:35,840
 automatic gunfire just hitting these aliens the aliens just start to stand up they start to stand up

295
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:44,000
 concentrated fire from automatic weapons 12 kgb special forces aiming at two targets and these

296
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,920
 giants are just getting up out of their chair cracking their back a bit oh yeah oh sit on the

297
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:55,680
 computer too long and then they just begin walking towards russians the bullets have no effect on

298
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:01,120
 these guys doesn't say that they're bouncing off of them doesn't say they're going through it's kind

299
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:06,160
 of a moot point because basically from the point of view of the kgb soldiers who are telling this

300
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:10,960
 story their bullets weren't working you weren't you weren't concerned about the physics of it

301
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:17,120
 you just massacred a ton of aliens and now the two threats left are just walking towards you

302
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:23,360
 like it's a bright sunny day so the kgb does something that's quite uncharacteristic they run away

303
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,640
 they've been running through this tunnel they stop being kgb agents they become scared humans

304
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:34,080
 they're running through this tunnel and these big giant aliens are chasing them

305
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:43,040
 when they finally get out of the tunnel all of a sudden a white beam shoots from the sky

306
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:51,360
 into the hill that the cave was burrowed into and then it turns red

307
00:26:51,360 --> 00:27:01,200
 and then it turns blue well usa action if i don't say so myself but then it turns multicolored so

308
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,520
 then the patriotism leaves plus i'm pretty sure russia's flag is red white and blue doesn't matter

309
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:15,040
 you're seeing this multicolored beam shoot out of the sky into the top of this hill that

310
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:24,800
 hid this cave and they said they could actually it was this giant cylinder and it got smaller and

311
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:29,680
 smaller and thinner and thinner until eventually it was like a just the size of a pencil coming out

312
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:38,080
 of the night sky into this hill and then the beam disappears and the sky catches on fire

313
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:46,480
 and major jones and his men just stood there watching this

314
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:53,120
 completely bizarre phenomenon there would be really other than a nuclear blast there would be no other

315
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:59,920
 way you would see the sky on fire primordial earth the sky was on fire and now this

316
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:09,040
 they stood there for 20 minutes as this event continued just watching these flames

317
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:18,400
 above this hill and then finally it is a clear night they get back to their landing craft they

318
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,560
 do they don't go back in the cave because they're thinking oh maybe the aliens want to wait or

319
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:27,440
 maybe there's reinforcements we don't know it's 50 50 i already tried my luck with that once they

320
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,240
 go back to their landing craft go back tell their supervisors hey you won't believe what happened

321
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:37,200
 to us over there there's a fence so we're like what okay that's fine no no you don't let me finish

322
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,480
 there's something over the fence they're like oh i'm listening so the soviet union sends back more

323
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:51,200
 troops they scour every part of that island it's empty nothing but an island sitting in the middle

324
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:57,120
 of the soviet union stories like that i think are fun because they have a combination of stuff

325
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,080
 that we enjoy to hear about aliens and then you got the combat attack attack attack attack

326
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:08,320
 people shooting stuff your mileage may vary on that i do love combat alien stories but it's combined

327
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:17,040
 with that these things are everywhere everyone's always looking at the sky for a UFO all these

328
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:23,440
 UFO reports i mean that's why they're called UFOs but if you were planning any sort of long-term

329
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:31,760
 operation you have to have boots on the ground for example this the cold war the united states and

330
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,880
 the soviet union had sleeper agents in each other's countries in each other's allied countries they

331
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:42,320
 had little safe houses the aliens are here for scientific purposes we go out to the jungles

332
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:49,280
 and hang out with apes to observe them if they're here for military purposes we have bases as close

333
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:55,680
 as we can as close as we can get undiscovered to enemy territory they're here for some like

334
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:01,040
 subversive world conquering a long-term conspiracy reason then you would definitely need to have

335
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:09,440
 boots on the ground so i think stories like this are a very cool part of alien lord it also has

336
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,160
 the creepy factor so we have this story and it's action packed and not so much for the aliens they

337
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:19,200
 all got massacred but you have humans gunning down aliens it's always great because you know humans

338
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,320
 are better so this story is an action story but before the story starts it's a horror story

339
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,960
 because we get that segment of it but we don't get the story before it of the fishing boat

340
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,880
 floating empty in the aral sea and another fishing boat comes by it and they look

341
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:43,520
 this is Yuri's boat where did he go fishing oh he went to the island i told him not to go there

342
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:53,280
 let's bring his boat back and tell his wife a tugboat listing alone day and night day and night

343
00:30:53,840 --> 00:31:01,280
 abandoned for days weeks who knows people had gone missing in this area so much so

344
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:06,080
 that the soviet union said we need to figure out what's going on out there and that's not one

345
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,360
 missing person that's not three missing people that's a lot of missing people for a national

346
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:18,000
 government to say let's figure this out so you would have to have a mass amount of people missing

347
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:27,520
 before it even came to the notice of kgb and even then a few more to really get them off their butts

348
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:32,960
 and figure out what was going on out there so we have the action packed part but what happened to

349
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:39,440
 those missing people where did they go i can keep making jokes about the kgb just slaughtering these

350
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:46,000
 aliens without any real contact with them but how many times did one of these fishing boats get too

351
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,400
 close to the island and a fog bank rolls off the island and covers up the boat and they find themselves

352
00:31:52,400 --> 00:32:00,000
 on the island they're lost they're walking through the fog until they find a fence and hoping there's

353
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,960
 help they scuttle over it but there's not 12 of them it's just one lone fisherman he's not heavily

354
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:13,440
 armed he just has a fishing knife in his sheath what are the odds of him surviving any of these

355
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:21,920
 encounters with these aliens they were obviously armed and they were obviously hidden so if they

356
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:29,520
 need to keep their location secret they'll do whatever it takes how many soviet citizens

357
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:38,320
 disappeared on that island their names lost to time until the kgb showed up and shot everything

358
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:44,480
 with a heartbeat and remember these aliens just packed up and left they didn't leave earth they

359
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:52,320
 had a mission they set up somewhere else and after a few humans came in and slaughtered their entire

360
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:58,480
 staff save two giants the next location they set up they're going to be much more careful

361
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,000
 about letting intruders in they're going to have better security and they're going to have better

362
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:12,320
 weapons to fight off any adversaries but a byproduct of having an alien installation on earth

363
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:19,280
 is that it breaks the realm of the normal and the paranormal and every so often a dimension

364
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:26,480
 defying mist seems to spread out in the area so the next time you're out for your morning walk

365
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:32,800
 and you start to see that fog bank roll through your area maybe you should turn that walk

366
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:40,880
 into a run because while it might be a beautiful natural phenomenon it could also be something

367
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:50,800
 darker and more dangerous a portal to an alien base and unless you're a member of the kgb the

368
00:33:50,800 --> 00:34:00,640
 chances of you ever being seen again are slim to none dead rabbit radio at gmail.com is going to
