00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Somewhere out in the ocean, a cruise ship moves slowly through the water, unmanned, except for hundreds and hundreds of rats.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 And then we travel to Black River Falls in Wisconsin.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Today it's a normal town, pleasant to the eye, but for 20 years, at the turn of the 20th century,

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 rumors of satanic worship and demons led people to do unspeakable things today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 [Music]

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I'm having a great day out. You guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 We got a lot of stuff to talk about, so we're just going to jump right into it.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Okay, so let's go ahead and jump into the first story here.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 So we are on a beach. We're on a beach somewhere near your hometown.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Assuming you don't live in the desert, you're like, "Oh man, I wish I had water near me."

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 We're at a beach. We're standing there with binoculars looking out at the ocean.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 And you're like, "Jason, why are we looking at the ocean?

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 There's so many better things we could be doing."

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 And I'm like, "Well, there's a reason for you on this whole setup. There's a reason for this."

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 I throw my arm over your shoulder. I'm like, "Look out there. Point out into the ocean. Point out."

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 I'm like, "Look over there. Look over there."

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 And while you're looking over there, I'm going to whisper in your ear the story of the MV "Louis Bove Orlova."

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 "Louis Bove Orlova." You put the binoculars down, you're like, "You don't know how to pronounce any of this, do you?"

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 And I was like, "No, no, no, I don't. I don't." But I know the story.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Put the binoculars back up and let's gaze back out of the ocean. Seagulls.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 [orlova sounds]

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Flying by.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 So the boat, we'll call it the Orlova, because I know how to say that part, at least.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 So the Orlova was this big, giant cruise ship that was built to withstand, like, icebergs and stuff,

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 which is pretty good considering stuff that's happened in the past.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 It was made by the Russians, and they said, "We're going to build this cruise ship,

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 and it's specifically to, like, take cruises around Antarctica."

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 So you could go, I don't know whether it would be to see out there,

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 you could just go near Antarctica, you see a bunch of penguins, and you leave.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 And so it goes around Antarctica, and so it had to be built, like, super sturdy,

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 more sturdy than, like, say, a carnival or, like, a Disney cruise ship.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 I don't actually know if that's true. I'm just assuming it's dirtier built,

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 because I don't think normal cruise ships can take an iceberg.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 This one was built to go around Antarctica.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 But it did end up running aground on a place called, I keep wanting to call it Decepticon Island,

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 which would be cool, but it went aground on this island by Antarctica called Deception Island.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 And it's actually called Deception Island because it's not an island, it is a volcano.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 It looks like a caldera, so it's like you think it's an island,

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 and then you get on shore and you realize you're, it's an active volcano too.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 A bunch of nerds were there doing science stuff a while back.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 They put up all their outposts, all those nerds, with all their stuff on Deception Island.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 And then there was a massive earthquake, and it destroyed all their research stations,

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 which is hilarious when even, like, nature is picking on nerds.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 They're like, "Get out of here."

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Now it's basically a tourist stop, and I think the Swedes have something there.

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 But anyways, it ran aground on Deception Island, and that was kind of the start of its bad luck.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 The Orlova though was able to get pulled off the island and started going around,

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 but by the year 2010 showed up, all that stuff happened, like in the early 2000s.

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 In the year 2010, the boat ends up sitting at St. John's, which is in Newfoundland, Canada.

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Through a series of mishaps and business deals falling through and stuff like that,

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 a bunch of money was owed on the boat, and eventually the city of St. John's,

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 it had been sitting there for two years, it was just sitting in the harbor.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 So the city says, "We're just going to sell the ship,"

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 because no one's ever going to pay all these fees that are on it.

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 We're going to sell the ship to someone else so they can take it out and they can scrap it.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 We just want it out of our harbor.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Now, boats have a rat problem.

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 There are certain things you can do to prevent rats from coming onto your boat,

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 but not for two years.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Like, eventually rats are--they're not the smartest thing, but they're also not the dumbest thing.

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Eventually they're going to find a way to get on the boat.

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 It was a cruise ship, and they were preparing to do a cruise,

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 so any amount of food on the ship, and there would have been--

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 and I'm not going to say the thing had like all you can eat buffet,

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 but it did have food supplies on the ship.

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Rats would become drawn to it, and they would start eating it,

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 and more importantly, banging each other and having rat babies.

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 So this rat-infested ship is sitting at the harbor,

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 and finally they're like, "Let's just pay someone to get rid of it."

71
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 So the rats are just hanging out, you know,

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 they're wearing their little like tuxes and stuff,

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 and then you have the rats in steerage that are dressed in like rags,

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 and they're like, "Oh, wonderful, fine true love in the upper decks."

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 And the boat starts getting pulled away from the harbor, and they're like, "Ugh."

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 And as the tugboat is pulling it away from the harbor, the tow line breaks.

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 So now the cruise ship is just floating around by itself.

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 They had to hire another company to come out, start towing it farther out to sea,

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 because at this point it was like flowing around oil, Derrick's.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 And they're like, "This thing is going to cause a huge catastrophe."

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 It's an unmanned cruise ship just floating around Canada.

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 But the boat is headed towards, I think, Jamaica, where they're going to scrap it.

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 And what happened was the people who got hired to tow it,

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 they finally towed it far enough out to sea, and they just said, "Let's just cut the line.

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Just cut the line, dude. We're not going to take this thing all to Jamaica.

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 We'll just cut the line, and it'll eventually sink."

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 So I don't think they actually had a guy out there with a knife cutting this rope,

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 but and the rats are watching, they're like, "No, don't cut the line, don't cut the line."

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 And the dude cuts the line, and the boat starts kind of...

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 And then it just kind of starts sailing away.

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Now what's funny is that they really shouldn't have done that.

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 They said it wasn't safe to take it all the way to Jamaica.

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 But nobody knows where the boat went.

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 People thought that it was going to end up in Ireland.

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Some people thought it was going to end up in Iceland.

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 But this cruise ship is just cruising around.

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 And the whole time in the pitch darkness of that ship, just rats just crawling all over each other,

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 eating the food and just breeding and breeding and breeding.

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 But what would happen is all the food would run out eventually.

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 Rats would start to check out each other.

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 That people in the steerage, like awfully yummy in the steerage people,

102
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 are like, "There's more fuss than there are of you, 99%."

103
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 And they would start eating each other.

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Which you eat a couple rats and then you're like, "Oh, my belly's full, it's time to have sex."

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 And then you have more of your baby rats and then you start eating rats.

106
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 As of today, nobody knows what happened to the boat.

107
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Some people say it's already sunk.

108
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 There was an alarm that went off.

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 This Irish station picked up an alarm that only goes off if the boat's taking on water.

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 People don't know.

111
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Some people have said because the boat was built to withstand,

112
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 it was like basically an icebreaker cruise ship, it would last quite a while.

113
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 There may be a cruise ship floating around out there full of rats.

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Just clawing their way through the darkness.

115
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Because it would be pitch black.

116
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 They wouldn't even be able to see each other.

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 There would just be so many of them, they would just crawl over each other.

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 They would know there was another rat there through scent.

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 Or they would feel those little rat hands crawl across their back.

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Just sailing out there still in the ocean today.

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 A true ghost ship full of cannibal rats.

122
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 So the boat may still be out there.

123
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 And at any moment, it may crash into a shoreline and spill out its bloated guts of nothing but big black rats all over the countryside.

124
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Or the ship did sink, but one dedicated rat was able to get off.

125
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 And he swam.

126
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 And he swam across the ocean, eating fish the whole way.

127
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Big ol' fish getting bigger and bigger.

128
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 Until finally he sees a drainage pipe leading right into your sewer line.

129
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 And tonight you'll hear a...

130
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 As your closed toilet lid keeps getting pushed up a little bit at a time.

131
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 But you ignore the sound.

132
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 You ignore it.

133
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 You go to bed.

134
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 And at night that big black rat finally lifts off the toilet seat cover and crawls out into your bathroom.

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 And then looks at the camera and goes...

136
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 Shhhhhh!

137
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Story may continue in your bathroom tonight.

138
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 You know what's funny?

139
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 I was looking, the story took place in Canada.

140
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 I have another story to take place in Canada and I thought,

141
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 I should try to do a Canada specific episode.

142
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 So I wonder what Canadian...

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 I wonder what Canadian cryptids.

144
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Now I know about the one to go.

145
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 He's a pretty popular Canadian cryptid.

146
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 But I was like, I wonder if there's any Canadian cryptids, dude?

147
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Canada...

148
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 First one I came across was a cryptid tree.

149
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 And I was like, oh, does it eat people?

150
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 No, it's just a tree.

151
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 It's a yellow tree in the middle of the forest.

152
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 That got cut down.

153
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 That one of Canada's cryptids is a yellow tree.

154
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 It's a spruce or something like that.

155
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 That people were like, oh my god, it's like such a rare genetic mutation.

156
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 They shouldn't exist.

157
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 And then some environmentalists cut it down to protest industrial logging.

158
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 And then the tree...

159
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 Then they tried cloning the tree and it never worked.

160
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 They could never make a copy of the tree.

161
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 So they took what was left of the tree and turned it into a guitar celebrating Canadian history.

162
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 And also part of the guitar was Pierre Trudeau's ore and Wayne Gretzky's hockey stick.

163
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 They cobbled it all together to make a guitar.

164
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 What is wrong with you, Canada?

165
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 That...

166
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Okay, America has Bigfoot.

167
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Africa has the Groot Slang.

168
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 South America has like a thousand of them.

169
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 It has the Amboonshe.

170
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 We've covered all that stuff.

171
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Canada has a yellow tree.

172
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 That's ridiculous, dude.

173
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 That might be one of the worst cryptids I've ever come across.

174
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Sure, there's photos of it.

175
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 There's evidence that existed, but turned into a guitar with an ore and a hockey stick.

176
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Come on.

177
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 You make my job so difficult, Canada.

178
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 I was looking for a cool cryptid story.

179
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 I'm sure I'll find one, but that was a bad one to come across first.

180
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Oh, and here's a little interesting segment.

181
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Make that slightly interesting.

182
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 The dude who chopped down the tree went missing because they were looking for him.

183
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Because he destroyed this "national landmark", this mutant tree.

184
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 That's all you have.

185
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Anyways, he went missing and is presumed dead.

186
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 They found some of his supplies on a rocky beach somewhere.

187
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 So they're wondering, authorities think he was either murdered for cutting the tree down.

188
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 Someone really liked that tree.

189
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 A lot of people really liked that tree.

190
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Or that he just died in an accident.

191
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 I would assume he most likely just died in an accident.

192
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Some people think he faked his death or whatever.

193
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 Who knows?

194
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Oh, I mean that part's a little intriguing.

195
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Cryptid tree.

196
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 There's man-eating plants out there.

197
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 There are stories of man-eating plants and your tree doesn't even do that.

198
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 It doesn't move.

199
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 It doesn't sing.

200
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 It died and became a guitar.

201
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 That's part ore and part hockey stick.

202
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 He also took some ballerina's outfit and added that to the guitar or something.

203
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 I couldn't make heads or tails of that.

204
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 At that point it was midnight and I was like, "I'm done researching this nonsense."

205
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 But anyways, let's go ahead.

206
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Thanks, Canada.

207
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

208
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 We're saying goodbye to Canada.

209
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 We're saying goodbye to the beach.

210
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 We are headed to Wisconsin, the cheese state in the United States of America.

211
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Every state has a theme.

212
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 California is the state of yuppies, I guess.

213
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 That's how it was when I was a kid.

214
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 It was like a yuppie state.

215
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 I guess now it's more like hippies and homeless people.

216
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 But when I was a kid, it was just yuppies and stuff like that.

217
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Oregon's the state of people who smoke a lot of marijuana.

218
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 I'm not going to go through all 50 states.

219
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 But anyways, Wisconsin is the cheese state.

220
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 That's where all the cheese comes from.

221
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 I think so, right?

222
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 Yeah, Green Bay Packers aren't they in Wisconsin?

223
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Isn't Green Bay?

224
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 It doesn't matter.

225
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 We're ignoring all that, but we're eating as much cheese as we can.

226
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 I hope you're not lactose intolerant as we spend time in Wisconsin.

227
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 It's specifically going down to a tiny little town in Wisconsin known as Black River Falls.

228
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 Established in 1839.

229
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 Today has a population of a little less than 4,000 people, I believe.

230
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Tiny little town, it looks similar to Hood River.

231
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 You're like, "That doesn't help me.

232
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 I've never been to Hood River."

233
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 But it's how you would imagine a tiny town to be, at least according to the photos that I saw.

234
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 It's basically just a stretch of like one street town, and then it kind of branches off a bit.

235
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 It's not a major city.

236
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 It's a tiny little burb.

237
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 And you had in this town, back in the late 1800s, it was a booming lumber mill town.

238
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 There was mines in the area.

239
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 You had your town.

240
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 You had your people, your houses all around the town, jetting out into wilderness.

241
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 People had farmland.

242
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 It was a great place to be.

243
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 We can look at NewsArticle.

244
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 This is all true, by the way.

245
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 At the end, I'm not going to go.

246
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 And then I've debunked all this stuff.

247
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Like this, I've researched this a lot.

248
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 These stories are all true.

249
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 Some of them may have been a little exaggerated, but I'll point those ones out,

250
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 because there are some different encounters and stuff.

251
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 But all of the stuff I'm about to tell you has been verified from newspaper clippings at the time,

252
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 and then a book that was written about it later, and then a movie that was written about it.

253
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 Not written about it.

254
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 A movie that was made about it later as well.

255
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 So it was a booming economy for a long time.

256
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 About 70 years, which is a good amount of time.

257
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 In the late 80s, as we got closer to the year 1900, things started to fall south.

258
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 First off, a string of freak winters came.

259
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 They're like, "Where are the freaks?"

260
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 They're like, "Punk Rock Winners, Big O'Hawks," and stuff like that.

261
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 Coming through, and it would just paralyze the town.

262
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 And they would get back over it, and they'd start doing their duties and stuff like that.

263
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 And then the next winter, it was just as bad, if not worse.

264
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 So when you have any sort of outdoor, all of this stuff is outdoor economy.

265
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 It's trees, and going through mines, I guess it's kind of indoor.

266
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 But still, you don't want to be down there during a blizzard.

267
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Farmlands can't really operate during freezing, freezing colds.

268
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 You started to have kind of a mini, before the Depression, I found out research in this.

269
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 There was kind of a mini-depression, which I guess technically is a recession.

270
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 So the economy wasn't doing that great in the United States around that time to begin with.

271
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 You had this small town that was getting just pummeled by freak weather.

272
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 And I'm going to tell you this too, I guess I should tell you this too.

273
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 This story is really, really dark.

274
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 I think parts of it are kind of funny and amusing, but this one, I packed it with the rat episode,

275
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 because this is basically like a horror episode, because both of these stories you're just like, "Ugh!"

276
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 The imagery is really gross, and a lot of bad things happen in this story.

277
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 But anyway, so you have these freak winners, so if you want to shut the episode off, that's fine.

278
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 I'll see you tomorrow.

279
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 Just fair warning, the winners are paralyzing the town.

280
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 The lumber mills start to shut down, so that hurt a lot of people who are working in lumber mills, obviously.

281
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 The banks started to leave the area, so now you're getting to a place where there's no way that you can do business at all in this area.

282
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 It was so bad, trains in the area were offering people one-way free tickets out of the area.

283
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 If you wanted to, because it was that bad, everyone knew it was that bad.

284
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 But people who had plied their trade there, who owned land there, who had large families, really any family at all,

285
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 they decided to stick it out.

286
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 So not everybody left, but a lot of young single men did.

287
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 Figure, "I'm just going to try my luck somewhere else."

288
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 If you had a big family, you don't want to start from zero, you'd rather take your chances and Black River falls.

289
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 And that was not a wise decision.

290
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 From about 1890 to 1910, an entire city descended into madness.

291
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 And we know about these things because of news article clippings from the time.

292
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 And a lot of photography took place as well.

293
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 The town still seemed to try to be normal.

294
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 And you may go about your day and not encounter anything bizarre.

295
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 You may go wake up, go to your unemployment, you don't work, so then you just walk to your next chair and sit down in your living room.

296
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 You're like, "Ugh." And then after eight hours of that, and then you go and you sit back down in your living room.

297
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 And nothing bad happens. But that wasn't always the case.

298
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 There was a statistic. This is one of the things I don't know exactly how true it is, but it will set the tone for the rest of what we're talking about.

299
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 So this took place in Jackson County, Wisconsin.

300
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 One out of every 472 inhabitants were considered insane.

301
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 A lot of the people of this town were ended up getting shipped off to jails and insane asylums.

302
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 They simply couldn't deal with what was going on.

303
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 And so you're thinking, "Jason, well tell me what's going on."

304
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Nobody knows why these events happened.

305
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 There were rumors of devil worship.

306
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 There were whispers of demons.

307
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Some people said they could hear the voices of demons in their heads and it made them do these things.

308
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Some people said, "Ah, it's just the economy was bad. It was a bad economy for 20 years and this is how people act up."

309
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 But let's talk about some of these incidents of why Black River Falls is so famous today.

310
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 There was a woman named Mary Sweeney. She was a former teacher.

311
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Makes sense. No one had jobs. No, I don't think anyone was going to school. Maybe they were.

312
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 But anyways, former teacher, she leaves her husband and then begins using cocaine.

313
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Now before you're like, "Oh dude, what is she, like 25? She's super hot and she's using coke on the weekends?"

314
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 No, no, no. It's woman 60 in her late 60s. She snorting coke and one day she goes,

315
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 "I got to break a window. I got to break a window. I got to break a window."

316
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 And she goes and she busts the window.

317
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 "Ah, that felt so good. That felt almost as good as coke, but here, let me compare that again."

318
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 Does some coke. She's like, "No, coke's way better." But she doesn't stop there.

319
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 She ends up doing, so remember, this story takes place in the early 1900s.

320
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 She ends up doing $50,000 worth of all the time money, damage, just breaking windows, all over town.

321
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 She was known as not just the Black River Falls window smasher. She was known as the Wisconsin window smasher.

322
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 There was no one in the entire state who smashed windows as good as she did.

323
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 Jailed 100 times, eventually shipped off to an insane asylum. That's the last anyone ever heard of her.

324
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 You're like, "Jason, that's not too weird. I smashed windows on..." No, no.

325
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 I'm sure you do smash windows on the weekend. It is quite satisfying, but let's move on.

326
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 Famous opera singer moves into town.

327
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Singing through the streets. Oh, they get noise, everyone.

328
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 But opera singer says, "You know what I'm going to start doing? I'm going to start as a hobby making homemade Ouija boards."

329
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 Uh? Uh, it's pretty creepy, right? But it doesn't stop there.

330
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 According to reports, which is a very vague way to say that when I run on the internet, one day this opera singer is walking through the streets of Black River Falls.

331
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 Just... they can see from behind his shoulders are kind of moving.

332
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Like, he's walking away. It's supposed to be... Okay, you can tell he's eating from behind is what I'm trying to say.

333
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 And then he turns around and he's just eating chicken. And you're like, "That's not scary. I eat chicken all the time."

334
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 But do you eat live chickens? This guy went crazy from making Ouija boards and then would just pick up chickens as he walked down the street and eat them.

335
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 And you go, "Jason, what's the most? Like, how many chickens are walking through the street? How many chickens could you possibly find just walking through the street?"

336
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 "Ah, let me move on to this next story. There's this guy who had a farm named Sheldon Farm."

337
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 So I'm pretty sure his name was Sheldon. Either first year or last name. Again, so a lot of these reports are old, so we don't have a ton of information on them.

338
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 But one day he comes out of his house, looks at his farm, 18 headless chickens laying in the ground.

339
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 "Hawk?" Actually, they wouldn't be doing that because they don't have heads.

340
00:19:51,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 Now he thinks that Satan worshipers have attacked his farm, that Satan himself has led them here to chop off all these chicken heads.

341
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 It would seem ritualistic that their heads were chopped off. So this is where the insanity starts.

342
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 What would you do if you came out and you saw 18 chopped off chickens, heads?

343
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 You didn't see the heads. You just saw the bodies. You walked out of your...

344
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Well, if you did and you don't own a farm, you'd be like, "Where did all these chickens come from?"

345
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 But if you owned a farm and you walked out and you saw a bunch of headless chickens dead, you would go, "Dagnabbit! Damn Satanists came back!"

346
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 And probably good ol' hoof foot is back as well. And then go and clean up all the chickens and go about your business.

347
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 He thought the only way to get rid of the devil was he just burned his property down. Just torched it all.

348
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 So now he's homeless and his business is gone. And the funniest part is that we know who chopped off the chicken heads.

349
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Apparently, off in the forest, there was a 50 drifter. So I mean, basically, that is like a division of homeless people.

350
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Had come through his farm and chopped off the chicken heads and then left and ate them.

351
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 But here's my question. Why would you leave the chicken? Like, wait a second.

352
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Now I'm thinking I might have read this wrong. Maybe he left the heads and took the chickens.

353
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 But the way I read it was that they were eating chicken heads in the woods.

354
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 And then one of the homeless people go, "Hey, I think we got this backwards."

355
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 We went through all this trouble and we just got a little tiny piece and they were like, "Oh, yeah, right. We should have grabbed the whole chicken."

356
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 I think he came out and found just 18 chicken heads, I think.

357
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 Anyways, he freaked out. He went insane. He thought the devil was there. Burned his whole farm down, burned his house down, got rid of it.

358
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 One woman, she had a sore on her back. She's like, "Oh, I think I have cancer. I think I have this lump on my back," which is sad.

359
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 That's a horrible thing to be afraid of. I have a friend right now who has some lumps. He thinks he might have cancer.

360
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 It's terrifying. But rational person would go to the doctor. Let's say there's not a doctor in town.

361
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 A rational person would just be like, "Oh, maybe I'll get my friend to like cut it out with a knife."

362
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 I don't know. She covers herself in gasoline and lights it on fire. That is not something you do if you think you have any disease at all.

363
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 "Oh, I have water on the brain." "Well, maybe if I boiled it." No, it doesn't work like that. Fire is not a medical tool.

364
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Now, all of this, imagine all of these things. I know it just seems disconnected like it's all these stories.

365
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 Imagine you are living in this town right now and you wake up and you're like, "Hey, what ever happened to Betty?"

366
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 And they're like, "Oh, you didn't hear? She's lit herself on fire." What? Yeah, she thought she had cancer on her back.

367
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 You'd be like, "What is going on? Well, I better go to my job at the farm here. I have 18 chickens I have to feed."

368
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 And as you're walking across town and going to that farm, you're the one guy with a job. You see the farm on fire.

369
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 The guy's like, "It's okay. It's okay. I destroyed the devil. Peace on earth."

370
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 And you're like, "What? I see homeless people out there eating chickens." And he's like, "Nah, nah, it's an illusion.

371
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 I killed the devil." Goes around and around. There's one little girl named Lydia Berger. We have a name for some of these people.

372
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 She was 15. Dad beat her up. That's not funny. Dad beats her up. She goes to say to the neighbor's house.

373
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 The neighbors take her in, start taking care of her. She burns their house down and then starts burning houses down all over town

374
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 until eventually she's caught and arrested. Just nutty stuff. This one actually might...

375
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 This one is... This is where we start to get really, really dark. Those ones were quite playful.

376
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 This is where... I mean, the woman burned herself alive, but this is where we start to get a little more dark.

377
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 There was a guy who was named Christ Wold. He was a farmer and the bank collapsed and he was going to lose his land.

378
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 He was unemployed. He had no money. He had nothing. So he decides to take his own life. He decides to take his own life.

379
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 The way he goes about it, though, again, there are traditional ways. I'm anti-suicide.

380
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 If you're ever having trouble with suicide or anything like that, you need to reach out. I'm against suicide.

381
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 I guess when you're at end-of-life type thing, that's different for me, but depression and things like that, things can always get better.

382
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 I guess I have no segue from that. This guy just finds this so bizarre that this is his go-to method.

383
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 I guess it would be quite painless and a little theatrical, but still. It would seem like it would be more grim.

384
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 He basically digs a hole and then puts his head in the hole. Still attached to him, though, so he's laying down on the ground and he has his head in the hole.

385
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 Then he grabs a piece of dynamite and lights it and throws it in the hole with his head and blows up.

386
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 Now, you could say, "Well, that's instantaneous, man." Yeah, but I gotta look at a wick slowly burning down a dynamite stick that...

387
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 [imitates explosion]

388
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 Yeah, I mean, like, you would have to look at that. Even if you closed your eyes, you would still hear that...

389
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 [imitates explosion]

390
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 It almost seemed to be more terrifying than any other form of suicide. Just...

391
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 "And what if it was a dud and then you gotta go get another stick?" Yeah.

392
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Horrible. Horrible. Sorry, guys. Sorry, guys.

393
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 You have this girl. We have her name, Sarah Smith.

394
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 She died and is buried in Rosedale Cemetery. Eventually, though, the cemetery gets investigated because they weren't doing stuff right, so they're like, "Okay, dig up all those graves.

395
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 You gotta make sure you did the funeral stuff right on those graves. Dig her up. Half her hands are eaten."

396
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 And they go, "Oh, yes. Sorry, we buried that one alive." I guess that one's not necessarily, like, insanity.

397
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 I think that just adds to the overall terrifying circus that was Black River Fall.

398
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 Again, all of this stuff happened within a 20-year time span, and I'm leaving out the child murders and the wife beatings, because there was a lot of those.

399
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 I'm, like, I'm not even touching those. There was a lot of stories of just people just beating their kids to death or beating their wives to death.

400
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 I drown. I'm leaving all that stuff out. Anything? Lydia Berger, the 15-year-old who got beat up and then started burning stuff down, that was the lowest age that I was gonna do.

401
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 And that's just basically because she became some sort of fire-based vigilante. I'm leaving out a ton of stuff.

402
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 Imagine any one of these events happening in your town over the course of 20 years, people would be like, "Dude, they buried that woman alive and she bit her hands off."

403
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 All of this stuff is happening in two decades, in one town. And let's, let's, we got a few more, though, if you'll indulge me, and then we'll kind of dig into what I think's behind it.

404
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 Drifter, a drifter, a homeless person is invited over by a family, nice little family meal, sitting down, puts a little napkin in a shirt, and he goes, "Oh, that's great. Thank you so much. It's such a good meal."

405
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 And as they're eating, the drifter pulls a gun out, shoots himself in the neck, dies. What? Like, that is the idea of insanity.

406
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 Like, you have a, as normal as you can get in this town, a guy is invited in to have a meal, and he's eating a meal with these people, and something just snaps in him, and then he blows himself away.

407
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 Wall, everyone else is eating, ruining their meal as well. None of those kids are going to be able to eat spaghetti after that. Like, that is a horrible thing to do.

408
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 That is insane. There's a difference between, like, depression, which is walking out in the woods and shooting yourself, and then waiting until you have an audience of a family that is feeding you and then killing yourself.

409
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 And then to really drive the nail home, and to wrap it up with this.

410
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 There was a bar in Black River Falls. Oh, I'm sure there was more than one, but there is this particular bar in Black River Falls.

411
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 One day, a guy walks into the bar and says, "What time is it?" And the guy told him the time, and he goes, "Okay."

412
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 And then he continued to drink and drink and drink and drink until he died. Now, that is the bartender's fault.

413
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 The bartender should have cut him off at a certain point, but the bartender also may have just been like, "Eh, I know what's outside this bar."

414
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 That same bar another guy walks in later. Not the same day, although that would be hilarious.

415
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 I don't know how this is possible, but it's stated he ate cigar butts until he died.

416
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 I don't know if he came back every day and ate nothing but cigar butts until his stomach became nothing but filter, but apparently that's what happened.

417
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 He just ate... again. That is an insane way to kill. That is the definition of insanity.

418
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 "Hey, what are you doing this weekend? I'm eating cigar butts." Oh, same thing you did last weekend. Same thing I do every day too.

419
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 I'm trying to kill myself eating cigar butts. Your cigarette butts. I know that it will eventually kill me, but it just seems like it's so hard to do.

420
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Although it's possible that he just shoved them all in his mouth. You're like Jason, you're just reading out.

421
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 You're spending the whole episode talking about people blowing themselves up and dying in horrible ways.

422
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 What does any of this have to do? Is this just you being morbid? Well, no.

423
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 Okay, so here's the thing. We've talked about missing towns in the past, like Dublin, Wisconsin, and what was it?

424
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 Belray, the Belray, Surge. Those are really early episodes. Really early episodes.

425
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 But go back and listen to those if you haven't. So we've talked about missing towns and things like that in the past.

426
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 Now, both of those have basically been inconclusive. Did this town exist? Nobody knows.

427
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 But we have a town that is that with documentation.

428
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 This town. I'm detailing all these events because this town almost did kill itself.

429
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 The written records exist because people live there today and they could be like, "Oh, yeah, let's go through these old newspapers."

430
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 But you had such rapid self-destruction in this town that the town itself very easily could have just fallen into disrepair.

431
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 People leave. It wasn't worth it. And it would have been littered with these bodies, these stories, these victims of their own mind.

432
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 This town would have just disappeared, been swallowed up by the wilderness.

433
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 And historians would say, "We can see references to a town called Black River Falls, and we believe it was in this area,

434
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 but all that's out there now is a burned-down building." So we don't know what happened there.

435
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 All we know is maybe the mills closed because we saw freak weather during that year and then everyone left.

436
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 And they wouldn't have the detail of these stories.

437
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 So the disappearing town phenomenon could be real. It really could be something that cities have existed.

438
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 We know it happens worldwide. The question has always been, does it happen more recently?

439
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 Could it happen within the past two, three hundred years of a town simply disappearing off the map and being completely forgotten?

440
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 Towns do get unincorporated and just fall apart and things like that, but like a ghost town.

441
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 We're talking about a town that people forget was ever really there.

442
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 This town tried really hard to prove that that's possible. This town tried really hard to destroy itself.

443
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 But I... Economies go bad.

444
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 Okay, there's bad natural disasters. There are entire countries that suffer through economies far worse than what was happening in Black River Falls.

445
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 I believe there has to be another component to this.

446
00:30:49,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 The madness, the insanity, and the sheer violence that took place over these twenty years in this one town is staggering.

447
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 There has to be something else there.

448
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 I get it. The human condition, depression, bleakness, hopelessness may drive a man crazy.

449
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 May drive a woman to drown her children.

450
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 But come on, I mean like this stuff is beyond the pale.

451
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 It all started with rumors that those freak winters were brought by satanic worship, by demons.

452
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 It all started after that first freak winter when people believed that something paranormal was happening in that town.

453
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 Is it possible that the stories of Satan worshipping was true?

454
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 Is it possible that some sort of curse was put on this town?

455
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 If so, why? Who did it?

456
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 But more importantly, could it happen again today?

457
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Could there be a town somewhere out there, picturesque, peaceful, that is right now on the verge of becoming the next Black River Falls?

458
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:39,000
