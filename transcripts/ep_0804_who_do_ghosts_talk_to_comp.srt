1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 What would you do if you caught a man masturbating?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 [laughs]

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 What would you do if you caught a man masturbating right outside your door?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 It's a true story, that's not a hypothetical question.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 And then we take a look at a really kind of a...

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 It's really kind of hard to even put in a word.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 What happens to ghosts when the people they love the most die?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 [music]

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 I'm actually super stressed out.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 The weather, it's like 29 degrees here.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Long time listeners know how much I hate the snow, I hate the ice, I hate all of it.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 I kind of hate humanity for even settling in places like this.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 It's awful.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 And I'm stressed out about having to walk anywhere, literally anywhere.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 So hopefully by recording this podcast in this really warm closet, it will give me happy thoughts.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Actually based on the subject matter of this episode, there's not much happiness about it.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 But someone who always makes me happy coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our newest Patreon supporters.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Everyone give it up for Jack1789999.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Everyone give Jack a big round of applause walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Jack, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Just help spread the word about the show that really, really helps the show.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 It makes or breaks the show, right?

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 We got to have listeners to keep going.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Jack, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Go ahead and catch them in your hand.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Let's leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 We're headed all the way out to San Antonio, Texas.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 We've actually covered a lot of Texas stuff this week. I mentioned on Monday's episode over the break, I found a bunch of really cool ghost stories from Texas.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 This isn't one of them. This is just some sicko pervert.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 But Jack, go ahead and lower this Dead Rabbit Durgible.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 We're flying over this small neighborhood in San Antonio.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 It's September 26, 2021, so fairly recent story. And me, Jack, and you are walking down the street and we see this car driving by.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Inside the car is Xavier Downs. He's a 29 year old man and he works for a company called Hebb.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 I'm sure they love how much press they've gotten from this story.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 It's like an Uber Eats type of thing. You order groceries and then they go pick them up and deliver them.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 It's a beautiful, I just order tons of stuff from Amazon and Walmart and all those places nowadays.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 I don't even have to go into stories anymore. I do love that side of technology.

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 But Xavier Downs, people like Xavier Downs is the downside of that.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Xavier Downs gets out of his car. We're watching from the bushes. We're the perverts in this story.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 We're watching from the bushes and we see Xavier Downs bring the groceries out of the car and he sets them outside the door of where they're supposed to be delivered.

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Good job, Xavier. He walks back to his car and the person who ordered the groceries is in the house.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 They come out of the house, pick up the groceries, go inside. This is a textbook delivery, right? This is exactly how you want it to go.

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 But then it gets featured on Dead Ravv Radio because of this.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 So the owner of the house, we don't have their name. We'll call them, we'll call her Nancy.

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Nancy has a Ring Doorbell Camera, which are pretty common these days. I don't understand anything about this story.

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Why this guy would do this? Everyone knows everyone has a camera.

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Xavier Downs, this is all caught on camera by the way, wasn't included in the article. The police have a copy of this video.

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 They're not letting this around the internet. Xavier Downs, after Nancy picks up her groceries and goes inside, he gets back out of his car.

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 He walks back up to her house and he begins masturbating. I guess that's probably why I paused so long. I gave it away in the beginning.

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 He's standing outside of this house, furiously masturbating, and he does it for a while until the dog, he does it for a while until he hears, "Woof woof woof woof woof woof woof."

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 There's a dog in the house that, I don't know if he's watching, I don't know if the dog's watching the doorbell camera, or the dog's looking through the people, or the dog can just smell perverts.

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 But the dog realizes, actually I don't know if the dog realized the guy was masturbating. I think the dog probably just realized there was a stranger on the porch.

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 But anyways, the dog starts barking and he puts it back in his pants and he runs away, or he might have slowly walked, it doesn't say.

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 He doesn't say he sprinted to his car, he should have. He walks away to his car, stops smelling the flowers, he's playing a game of hopscotch with some kids.

61
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 And the owner of the house is sitting in there, what was her name again, Nancy, is sitting there and she hears her dog barking and she sees that there's a ring doorbell alert.

62
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 And I think that's how she knew the groceries were there right away in the first place. She gets a ring doorbell alert showing that there's motion outside.

63
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 So she goes to check to see, "Oh, that's where my dog's barking ring doorbell alert. Who's out there?"

64
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 And when she queues up the video, she sees Xavier, she doesn't know his name, she knows it now, but Xavier walks back up the door and whip it out and start masturbating.

65
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 So obviously, she calls the cops. And the cops show up and they're able to track this guy down because I'm sure the receipt had his name on it.

66
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Your driver was Xavier or whatever, the cops go and they get this guy and they arrest him.

67
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 When they arrested this dude, there actually was a guy, a detective investigating a previous case of this.

68
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 It turns out back in February of 2021, there's video footage of a guy dropping off some deliveries from Uber Eats this time, it was a different company, and then masturbating on camera.

69
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 But apparently it's like, I don't know who this house, the Munchkins, the doorbell camera was too low I guess to pick up the guy's head.

70
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 So it was the perfect camera view if you were a pervert, right?

71
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 But they caught this guy, maybe they saw his head, maybe he was just all blurry, maybe he was just like a misty, was blurry like Bigfoot is he's masturbating.

72
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 The point is, back in February, they had this dude masturbating after dropping off groceries and the police were like, "What is, what in the world is going on?"

73
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 And then fast forward all the way to September, they got him, they got Xavier Downs.

74
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 I think once they were able to match, like they, first they were just looking at a blur, but now that they look at Xavier Downs, they go, "Oh, that's an Xavier Downs shaped blur."

75
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 They're like in hands in hands.

76
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 And man, I don't know, maybe he left DNA at the scene.

77
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 I don't know.

78
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 They're like, "Oh, the person comes out to get their groceries."

79
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 They're like, "Oh, that's so awesome, look at my groceries are here. Where did the cinnamon roll frosting come from?"

80
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 So they were very optimistic.

81
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 They ordered a bunch of cinnamon rolls.

82
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 They're like, "Oh, when must they rolled around?"

83
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 They caught him.

84
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 This guy, he was masturbating in February 2021 after dropping off some groceries.

85
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 He was masturbating in September 2021.

86
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 I can guarantee it.

87
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 Guarantee it.

88
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 I guess I shouldn't say that.

89
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 For legal reasons, allegedly, I make an alleged guarantee.

90
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 This isn't the only two times he did that.

91
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 Think about how many times you fantasize about being with somebody, right?

92
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 You're like, "Ooh, Spider-Man or Britney Spears or whoever it is, like, they're sexy, right?"

93
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 And you think about them?

94
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 It's not just twice a year, right?

95
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 I bet you he did this other times where there weren't ring cameras around.

96
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 They're not as ubiquitous as I say they are, but they are everywhere.

97
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 They're enough to keep me from bashing cars up with baseball bats nowadays.

98
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 Yeah, it's interesting.

99
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 This can't have been the only two times.

100
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 He won't fess up to any, I would assume.

101
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 There'd be no reason for him to.

102
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 But I'm sure he's been masturbating all over groceries in San Antonio.

103
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 And if that doesn't make you think you're in San Antonio right now, you're like,

104
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 "Oh, I ordered all those cinnamon rolls all the time."

105
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 And I thought they tasted weird.

106
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 He probably did it multiple times.

107
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 And if that's not unnerving enough, he's free.

108
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 He was released on bond.

109
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 They said, "Hey, you gotta pay some money, and then you're free to go until the trial."

110
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 He's like, "Well, I have to have a job. I have to have a job to pay my bail.

111
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 I must deliver groceries."

112
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 And he's out.

113
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 He's out.

114
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 He's walking the streets of San Antonio right now with a bag of groceries in one hand.

115
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 And you don't want to know what's in his other hand.

116
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Looking for another patio to go towards.

117
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 I don't think he's a werewolf. I don't know if he has some sort of compulsion.

118
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Every full moon, he has to masturbate on your groceries.

119
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 But listen, there are certain people you do not want walking the streets.

120
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 And sometimes the problem is that we wait until they do something super violent,

121
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 until they plow through a crowd full of...

122
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Remember that Christmas parade thing? Wasn't that awful?

123
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 That guy who was on bail for running over his girlfriend ran over a bunch of people in a parade.

124
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 What in the world? Like, there are certain people...

125
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Okay, I'm not saying this guy is the same level as that one,

126
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 but there are certain people that you don't want walking the streets.

127
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 And a guy who's masturbating in public, that's so weird.

128
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 They're just released him on bond. They're like, "You'll be good, won't you?"

129
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 And he has his fingers. He has his fingers crossed behind his back.

130
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 You don't want to know what his other fingers are doing.

131
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 This is crazy, because you know he's just going to masturbate in public.

132
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 He's done it twice, and he's probably done it more times than that.

133
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 I mean, I don't know what the thing is. You lock him up forever?

134
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 I hear it. Let's split the middle.

135
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 You let him walk free, but he's handcuffed. He's handcuffed behind his back.

136
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 So, I'm not a legal expert. I do not want people masturbating.

137
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Not when they're delivering my groceries.

138
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Uh-uh.

139
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 So, San Antonio, that's weird. Xavier Downs.

140
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 I will retroactively say all that stuff is a legend.

141
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 He has not been convicted of any of it yet, but yeah, just so weird, right?

142
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Such a weird thing.

143
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 And it's so unnerving. And what I think is creepy, it's all creepy, but he probably...

144
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 I don't think he did this for every delivery, because he would be so tired.

145
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 He's like, "Oh, no. Eight deliveries today. Ah, my max is five times in a day.

146
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 I don't have that much stamina."

147
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 I don't think he did it every time, but I bet you he waited to see who came out.

148
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 So, if it was a woman he found attractive, then he went back up and masturbated in front of the door.

149
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 And if the dog hadn't barked, he probably would have ejaculated all over the ground.

150
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 So, if you ever come out, if you're in San Antonio and you've ordered groceries and you're like, "Hmm, that's weird."

151
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 There's a lot of snail trails all over my front porch, and I...

152
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 There's no snails here. I've never seen a snail here. Whatever.

153
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 That could be something else is what I'm saying.

154
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Gross, dude.

155
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 I really have no other comment than that, and that's so weird that they just let him go on bond.

156
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 You should stop this stuff before it escalates, before he's like walking up to people in public.

157
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Have you ever seen? They have a whole subgenre of porn, where it's dudes masturbating on women in public.

158
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 And it's video clips of dudes walking up to women shopping at Walmart, and he ejaculates all over her.

159
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 And she doesn't know. And then he runs away.

160
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Yeah, they actually don't run away. They just walk away.

161
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 It's bizarre. It's a criminal act. It's like watching someone shoot another dude in the face.

162
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 You know how I every show, often the New York Post, will have a video of some mafia don getting his brains blown out?

163
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 It's like that. But they're oddly enough grosser for whatever reason.

164
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 It's more disturbing. A girl going up an escalator and then a guy like ejaculating on her butt.

165
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 It's so weird. And that is a subgenre of porn. It's a crime. It's an absolute crime.

166
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 And you don't want those people just walking around free because that's what they do. They masturbate on people.

167
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Whatever. Anyways, this guy is, again, a legend. Right? A legend.

168
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 I might get a knock on my door later from some lawyer. So I get a knock on my door and open the door and it's a bag of groceries.

169
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 And I'm like, "No, he found me. He found me. He's webbing me to the wall like Spider-Man. I'm going to take my time with you." No.

170
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Jack1789999. Let's go ahead and touch the keys of the carboner copter. We're going to get out of this sticky situation.

171
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 We're going to head all the way out to...

172
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 This also takes place in Texas. It's a short journey. We're headed to Fort Davis, Texas.

173
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 The guy who downs like, "That's where my next delivery is." You mind if I get a ride? We're like, "No!"

174
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 He's sticking to the bottom of the helicopter.

175
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Jack keep flying us out here in Texas. We're headed to Fort Davis and hit that time travel button. We're headed back to the year 1854.

176
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Now I found this story in one of my favorite books. I talk about it all the time. Haunted Places, The National Directory.

177
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 It's in the show notes. You can buy a copy. It's not an affiliate. I get no money if you buy it. I just highly recommend that.

178
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 I got additional reporting from a new website. I mentioned, I think, yesterday, Stormy Night Tales, which is all urban legends.

179
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Another great website. I always want to give a shout out to people who are doing good work in the field.

180
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 The reason we're at Fort Davis is this land is currently being run by a very prosperous rancher.

181
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 At his facility, you got ducks and cows walking around and probably a couple cowboys and dudes.

182
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 At this ranch, working here is a young beautiful woman named Dolores Gavino de Porto.

183
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Dolores, she is just a very sweet woman. She's a very hard worker. Everyone loves her at this ranch.

184
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 She falls in love with Jose, a sheepherder. They're making eyes at each other. He puts his hand on her knee.

185
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 I wonder if girls back then shaved their legs. I wonder if, in 1854, we're razors. They had swords. They had knives.

186
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Back then, girls shaved their legs. When we watch cowboy movies, which aren't real, obviously, it's modern-day actors.

187
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 The girls have smooth legs, but I wonder if that's just tied into what we expect.

188
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 What was that movie? Jodie Foster, Played Like Some Prostitute in Maverick with Mel Gibson. I don't think she was rocking Chewbacca legs.

189
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Jose and Dolores are madly in love. The issue was that he was a sheepherder. His job took him away from Dolores for long amounts of time.

190
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 They started this tradition. Every Thursday night, she would walk up this nearby mountain and she would set a little signal fire.

191
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 Across the blackness of the night sky, Jose would see this signal fire and then him in the valley, where he's with his sheep, he would set a little signal fire.

192
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 It was a way for them to kind of be with each other. This was before Messenger, this was before razors were invented.

193
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 You weren't able, I can't, I can instantly pick up my phone now and talk to anyone in the world, but back then you had to burn, you had to burn branches to do the same thing.

194
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 And there was no emojis. It was just fire. This one had for a while and he would come back and they would be sweetly in love with each other.

195
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 And then he'd go back out and be heard in the sheep and she'd go up on Thursday nights to set the fire.

196
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 And then one night, Dolores walks up the mountain and she starts her little signal fire and she looks out into the valley and there's nothing.

197
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 She continues to stoke the fire, but she sees no signal that Jose is down there.

198
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 And she stays there all night, desperately keeping the fire going, hoping, hoping that she just sees a glimmer of flames in the valley below.

199
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 Dolores stayed out there until the sun began to rise and still no sign of Jose.

200
00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 She ran back to the ranch and she begged her boss to go send a rescue party, or not even a rescue party, just a search party, or just a scout.

201
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 She wants to know what happened to Jose and he's like, "Yeah, yeah, we'll take care of that." So he does send out some people because obviously it's his sheep too.

202
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 He probably liked Jose. He probably wasn't like, "Hey guys, find out what happened to my sheep."

203
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 And then if you have time, see if everything's okay with Jose. I'm sure he was fine with Jose too.

204
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 He sends some people out and Jose is not there with the sheep. They're just baaah walking around by themselves.

205
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 So now they really know something's wrong because Jose is a trusted employee and this search party continues to search the area.

206
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 Two days later, they find his mutilated body.

207
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 What they believe is that the Apaches who were native to the area and still in the area, and they did not take kindly to anyone else in their territory, that's generally what people do when other nations invade them.

208
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 They must have seen Jose's signal fire one night and they captured him, tortured him, and killed him.

209
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Dolores becomes absolutely heartbroken by this and pretty much they say she loses all joy. Like, you just can't keep her excited about anything.

210
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 And all she does is do her job and be sad. She's not a really good employee. You should at least be kind of happy at your work.

211
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 But she's super sad. She's doing her job. Everyone feels really bad because she was such a sweet girl and they knew how much she loved Jose.

212
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 But what are you going to do? You can't really console somebody like that.

213
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 And then several months after Jose was murdered, Dolores walked up that mountain on a Thursday night, set a fire, and stayed up there through the night, stoking this fire.

214
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 The last time she was happy was stoking this fire. Maybe this would give her something.

215
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 She began doing that every Thursday. She still continued to do her job and she still was super depressing to be around.

216
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 But every Thursday she'd light that fire, stoking it all night long.

217
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 She did that for 40 years.

218
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Her long, luxurious black hair turned gray.

219
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 Her body became weak, but still she walked up that same path she had worn into the mountain to light that fire.

220
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 She eventually passed away. She never found another love. She never got over this. She passed away and they buried her on the trail, headed up to that mountain top.

221
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 And they actually named the mountain. The mountain today is known as Dolores Mountain.

222
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 Some people say when you go up to that mountain on a lonely night, you'll see her apparition, the ghost of this young woman now once again having long black hair, staring off towards the valley, waiting for Jose to come home.

223
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Some even say, if you're in the valley or really hanging out anywhere in Fort Davis and you look up at Dolores Mountain on a moonless Thursday night, you'll see a signal fire.

224
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Up there.

225
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 And people have gone up there afterwards the next morning and they'll find smoldering pieces of timber.

226
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 Classic ghost story, right?

227
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 Beautifully crafted classic ghost story. We see stuff like this all the time in the lore, whether it's a lover's leap,

228
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 man and woman jumping off the cliff and then their ghosts are still there or anything like that, right?

229
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 The wife says goodbye to her husband who's the sea captain. This is very common on the East Coast.

230
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 You have a lot of reports of ghosts of women staring, not like appearing on the shoreline or appearing in a lighthouse, staring off into the distance because they used to always come out to the shoreline and wait for their lover to come home.

231
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Very, very classic, very classic American ghost story.

232
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 What's interesting about this one is that we know some of it's true.

233
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 There actually is some historical precedent to this. There actually is some historical connection to this.

234
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 One, it is called Dolores Mountain. We know that to be a fact, but sometimes urban legends it could be called Dolores Mountain and someone makes up a story as to why it's called that.

235
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 But apparently in the region there was a woman in that time period named Dolores Gavino de Porto.

236
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 This is all we really know about her. Dolores Gavino de Porto was a woman who died in 1893 and she was nuts.

237
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 The locals considered her a wackadoodle. Why? Do they think she was weird? This is so interesting.

238
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 They thought she was weird because it was this old woman in town named Dolores Gavino de Porto who every so often, there was no real schedule to this, but every so often,

239
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 she would walk up the mountain and start a fire.

240
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 And so this mountain was unnamed. It's not Mount Everest or anything like that. It's not huge.

241
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 She didn't have crampons and ice axes and stuff.

242
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 An interesting historical piece to it. At least we have someone in the area by that name who lit fires.

243
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 Was any of the previous stuff true? Who knows?

244
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Think about it. In this time period, we're talking about 1854 is when it takes place, when it starts off.

245
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 She dies in 1893. That does actually make it like that 40 year time gap. Just fascinating on that level.

246
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 But I started to think about she's setting the fire both alive and now as a ghost to signal someone who's simply not there, but it's her grief.

247
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Her grief is continuing this act. Again, that's pretty typical in the ghost lore.

248
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 But let's go ahead and shift gears. And this is really, it's so fascinating to me.

249
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 I stumbled across this kind of around the same time. We're going to meet a woman who goes by the name C Miller 2006.

250
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 They recently posted the story and it really got my brain working on this one.

251
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 How do ghosts talk to us and what the ramification is when things change?

252
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 So we have Dolores setting the fire alive, trying to talk to Jose, trying to signal Jose, even though he's long gone.

253
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 And now they're both gone, but the signal fire is being set.

254
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Now we're, you know, what, 100 years, about 150 years out and we're still seeing the signal fire.

255
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 C Miller, we're going to call her Carol. That's just a guess, but Carol had an unfortunate tragedy.

256
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 On August 4th, 2021, her son died in a car accident. He was driving home, I believe, and got killed.

257
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 She begins to get text messages from his disconnected phone.

258
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 One day they were painting his room after he passed away and she gets a text that says, "My room."

259
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 Another time she was telling someone she wanted to get a tattoo of his signature and she was trying to find a good copy of his signature that would be, you know, good for this tattoo.

260
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 And she gets a text from her son's phone saying, "Signed."

261
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Now you go, Jason, this is absolutely ridiculous, right? Like, there's so many other things that can go on here.

262
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 This can be easily faked. She could be making it up.

263
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 What's interesting is she is providing photographs of this. She is showing photographs of the text, but however it could be faked still, right?

264
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 You could have just someone texting and people do fakes, fake this type of stuff.

265
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 But let's assume that it's real because this is a paranormal podcast. She's getting text messages from her son.

266
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 And then another time, this was the one that got my attention.

267
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 On January 6th, 2022, she was driving down the road and she gets a text from her son who died in a car accident.

268
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 She gets a text from her son that says, "Almost home."

269
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 That's creepy. Like, I get it, man. It would suck to lose someone close to you.

270
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 But if they're texting me spooky stuff like that, almost home.

271
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 And there's a photo of this. She gets the text through her, like, display of her car.

272
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 And then she says the next song on the radio, she switched over to Sirius XM Station.

273
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 And the song that popped up was "I'll Be Missing You" by Puff Daddy with Faith Evans.

274
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 It's again, it's a, this isn't a classical ghost story, but we do see this happening more and more often.

275
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 This episode might go a little bit long because this is actually going to be kind of the meat of the story.

276
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 I really like that Dolores story, but I want to get through this.

277
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Not a classic ghost story, but we do see people ghost using electronic methods to talk to people.

278
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 People passing away and then loved ones, phones ringing, like, right when they died.

279
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 And they pick it up. It's a call from Joey or whatever. They pick it up and no one's online.

280
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 We're starting to see those stories pop up.

281
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 So it's not out of the realm of possibility. It's not super common, though.

282
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 But we have these text messages coming from, I think the guy's name was Michael.

283
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 I'm not for sure, but I forgot to write that down.

284
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 But she's getting text messages from her son.

285
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 And she's showing us this. Two questions popped up in my head.

286
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 The first one is the rate. I don't really know how Sirius XM works.

287
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 I'm pretty sure it's just like a regular radio station, but there's just like 500 stations and there's no ads.

288
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 It's just constant music. It's not like Pandora, right?

289
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 Where you can stop music and rewind it and things like that are spot-fying.

290
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 I could be wrong on this, but I think Sirius just plays music like regular radio.

291
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 If that is correct, my question is, did everyone who was driving down the road or sitting at home or working, listening to Sirius XM at that time, this particular station, did they all hear that Puff Daddy song?

292
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 Like obviously just a coincidence. It could be just a coincidence.

293
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 But my question is, these stories we do hear.

294
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 My daughter died and I was sad and then one day I was driving down the road and I was thinking about my daughter and that song came on that she always loved.

295
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 "Tik Tok" by Kesha, whatever it was.

296
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 Is it a coincidence or is the ghost actually getting that song to play?

297
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 And then my question would be, so does everyone hear that song throughout wherever Sirius XM is? It's satellite, right? It's like global.

298
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 At that point in time, did that ghost influence that song to come on and it played throughout the entire planet?

299
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 That's nuts if that's true.

300
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 Again, the most likely thing is it's a coincidence, but if the ghost is saying, "Mom, I'm still here and I'll be missing you and you'll be missing me."

301
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 Like did he influence the global pop charts?

302
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 Because if that's true, then I mean, that almost deserves its own episode, right?

303
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 Are the top 100, the Billboard top 100, controlled by ghosts?

304
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 Maybe if you want to be a hit musician, just make songs about people dying and missing each other and the ghosts will be like, "Oh, that's the best song and they'll be fighting over who gets to play that."

305
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 I'm not trying to make light of the subject, but I just find that interesting.

306
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 If it is paranormal, is everyone hearing that song, did that ghost interfere or just move the song ahead or whatever so his mom could hear that, but also everyone else was hearing that song at that same time?

307
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 That would be a very, very powerful ghost.

308
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 My other thing is this, and this is why I included the Dolores story in this.

309
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 The Dolores story is all about sending these messages back and forth from Jose to Dolores and then even in death.

310
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 You know, it's interesting. I just thought of this. It's interesting, Jose's spirit wasn't constantly stoking the fire here.

311
00:28:51,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 Like he died tragically by the lore, his ghost would be out there, but it wasn't just the violent death, it was those other 40 years of going about the ritual of setting the fire, but the messaging, right?

312
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 And now she continues even in death to set that fire, hoping Jose will respond.

313
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 What happens when the people, specifically going back to this story with Carol and her son, what happens when the people that this ghost is talking to, again, I think his name is Michael, what happens when Carol passes on?

314
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 Here's what I mean. He's using these electronic means to communicate with her.

315
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 When she passes on, does the ghost no longer have anyone to talk to? Is the ghost now content because you're in the afterlife with them?

316
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 The problem with that is that Dolores' signal has lasted long past both Jose and Dolores' natural life.

317
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 The signal fire is still seen today, even though the person who was intended for is no longer around.

318
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 Is Michael sending these messages to his mother? What happens when she passes on?

319
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 Are the messages still floating through the void? What happens when her phone number is assigned to somebody else?

320
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 Do they wake up at two in the morning one night and they see a text from Michael saying, "Almost home? I'm nearby. I love you."

321
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 Why do I keep getting these text messages? Who's Michael? Block.

322
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 It is very, very rare. This is possible, but when you look at Ghost Lords, very rare when a ghost shows up to a location and is only there until a particular person is there and when they leave the ghost disappears.

323
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 Generally, that's a sign of a hoax, honestly. When we look at the Amityville House, the house was not haunted and then a couple people moved in and it was super haunted and they got book deals and movie deals and they left.

324
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 There's never been a ghost since. That's a lot of sign of a hoax.

325
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 But, every so often we do see stories about someone haunting the house and they're basically tormenting someone there and then when the person dies, the ghost goes away.

326
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 But for the most part, you'll have a ghost walk around the location and it will haunt the location family after family after family.

327
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 And sometimes they'll demolish the house and the ghost will still be sited in the ruins.

328
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 And it takes a lot of energy to be moving around the house. This is just speaking, this is just sending text.

329
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 So what happened? Like, right now he's communicating with his mom.

330
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 But what happens when the mom passes away, which hopefully doesn't happen for a long time?

331
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 Or the mom gets a new phone or they move to 6G or there's some sort of glitch at the company and she's automatically assigned the new number and all this stuff.

332
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 Would the ghost move to the new number or would it continue to haunt the old number, just like Dolores lighting that fire on the mountaintop?

333
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 I mean, if you demolished the mountain, would the fire be seen? You know, 300 feet in the sky?

334
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 It's weird. This is one of those episodes where I just have a lot of questions about it.

335
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 And I don't want to just keep asking questions. Here's my theory. My theory is this.

336
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 He's putting out so much energy to be able to communicate with his mom to let him know that everything's okay.

337
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 And that energy will echo. That energy will echo through time. And when she finally does pass away, it will continue to echo.

338
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 His messages will continue to float around this digital realm. That's what I believe. I believe that when ghosts use the digital world to talk to people, it's not going to go away anytime soon.

339
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 It's still out there. These ghostly voices are still out there and they're being aided by technology. It's no longer throwing branches on a fire.

340
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 We've made it so easy to communicate with each other and this ghostly world can tap into that. But when the person they're talking to is no longer there, I believe the messages still are.

341
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 The voices still are. The ghosts still are.

342
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 I think the idea of a haunted house is going to become old fashioned. I've been talking about this a lot on the show. I think we're going to see a rise in haunted websites and maybe even haunted phones. Haunted phone numbers.

343
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 There's actually been a-- that's actually not even controversial. There's been a lot of talk about haunted phone numbers in the past. I don't remember them off the top of my head, but there is one phone number that was supposed to be connected like six or seven deaths.

344
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 I'll try to put it in the show notes, but I think we'll get to a point where the fire on the mountaintop is just a quaint old ghost story. We're going to see more stuff coming about where someone gets a brand new phone number.

345
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 And it's haunted. They keep getting text messages from weirdos and I'm not talking about spam. I'm talking about text messages from someone they don't know saying hello. I'm scared.

346
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 What? What does that even mean? And you could block the number, but there's really no number to block. It's coming from somewhere else. It's dark and cold here.

347
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 You may put up with it for a while. You may be like, "I don't want this," and you can change your number again. That number may not be in use for a while, but those messages are still floating around.

348
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 I'm lonely here until someone else gets that same number and it becomes haunted again. Really, if you look at ghost as a phenomenon, there's no reason why that wouldn't be a thing. Haunted phone numbers.

349
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 And we've made it so easy to communicate with each other. Who's to say that stops at death?

350
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 We covered that guy recently who's trying to build the Soul Phone. Put that on the show notes that's kind of complicated to go into at the end of an episode, but yeah, it's just using technology to talk to the dead.

351
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 That's actually been something people have been trying to do. People have been trying to talk to the dead since we realized death was a thing.

352
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 With technology, people believe that we get closer and closer each day. Maybe we do. But until we prove the fact that we can talk to the dead, we rely on the dead to talk to us.

353
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 And I'm sure it is incredibly comforting to this mother to be getting these text messages from her son. I think it would be comforting for anyone who lost someone to be getting messages. I'm not messages like I'm cold on the loan.

354
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 I was doing that to be spooky, but getting these good text messages, you know, I think that's very comforting.

355
00:35:50,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 But I'm thinking down the line, like, where do these voices go? Who do the dead talk to when the people they love the most have joined them in the afterlife? Is that it? Is the haunting over? Or do the voices remain?

356
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 So the next time you hear the phone ring and you look at it and it says unknown number, or you get a text from someone you don't really recognize their name.

357
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 Maybe don't answer it. Maybe go. It's from 911. They're like, your house is on fire. You're like, I don't recognize that number. I don't know anyone at 911.

358
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 Be careful when you pick up that phone, because who knows who's on the other end. Best case scenario, it's a bill collector or a spam call.

359
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 But the worst case scenario, it could be a voice from beyond the grave, telling you they're almost home, followed by a dial tone.

360
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 It may be a comforting thought for a mother, but for you, you have to wonder, whose home are they coming to?

361
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 It's Xavier Downs. It's Xavier Downs' ghost. He's like, I have some groceries for you. Dead Rabbit Radio, Gmail.
