1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,620
 What would you do if you're home alone and one night you hear the sound of a child crying out in the darkness?

2
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:14,240
 And then we travel to the year

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:21,120
 1676 where young nun is found unconscious in her room

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,900
 her face covered in black ink and on her desk a note

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,960
 Written by the devil himself today on Dead Rabbit Radio

6
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:44,120
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,320
 I hope you guys are having a great day too freezing cold though super super cold

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,040
 I'm gonna try to record this episode as fast as possible because I have a heater running in my bedroom

9
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,040
 I'm gonna take my laptop. I'm gonna edit it

10
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:01,460
 Bam, let's see if I can record this in one take half hour probably won't but let's see if I can at least get it close

11
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:08,320
 You might hear the occasional sound of me rubbing my little paws on my pants to keep my hands warm

12
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,360
 Currently wearing thermals pajama pants jeans

13
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,960
 Coat a coat inside. It's that cold a little baklava from my ears

14
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:25,320
 I'm cold but you guys want an episode. I want to record an episode. So let's do this our first story

15
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,560
 Let's hop aboard the carboner copter guys get on board

16
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,120
 Got to scrape the ice off put the de-icer on the helicopter

17
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:37,520
 We're taking off we're headed to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. This first story is actually a recommendation from

18
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,680
 Scaryman Esquire long-time listener of the show. Thank you so much scaryman for this

19
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,680
 We're headed to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,720
 Specifically the south side of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. This one's gonna be a little spooky. So we're on board the carboner copter

21
00:01:51,720 --> 00:02:00,000
 We're flying out to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and it's night time by the time we get there and we're gonna land in like this

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,640
 Soccer field right?

23
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,640
 They're still playing soccer. They're like, oh look out look out

24
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,280
 We look out for no one

25
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,120
 Crush and we pop their only ball whole city of

26
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,600
 Pennsylvania wait, that's not a city whole city of Pittsburgh is like oh like no more soccer

27
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,160
 We're strutting off the helicopter boo soccer and

28
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,600
 We're walking around the south side of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

29
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,240
 We see all these little houses and dorms and apartments and stuff like that and we see

30
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:33,800
 Across the field we see this young woman kind of looking outside of her door

31
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,960
 We see she has a scared look on her face not scared because of us not scared because

32
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,400
 She really loves soccer balls and she's afraid that we're gonna pop hers

33
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:49,520
 We just noticed she's kind of spooked out. So we were like hey lady. Hey us. Yeah, we're total strangers

34
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,160
 But we're gonna come in and talk to you so we walk over into her house and she's like oh I'm so glad you're here

35
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,560
 I just heard the craziest noise outside my door now. This is something that's been happening all over

36
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,400
 Well, I shouldn't say all over so this is what's interesting

37
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,720
 There are four you're like Jason

38
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,480
 There's a big difference between all over and four but hold on hold on there are four

39
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,120
 known reports of

40
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,460
 This in the south side of Pittsburgh

41
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,840
 and

42
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,080
 You'd have to say that it's possible. There's only these four or

43
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,800
 Other people have experienced this and they haven't gone through the trouble of reporting it

44
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,360
 But four reports have come through

45
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,600
 Primarily college students

46
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,960
 Generally later in the evening sit at home doing your homework

47
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:43,600
 Looking up the physics of a helicopter a helicopter landing gear on top of a soccer ball

48
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,880
 You're like my thesis is that the helicopter will pop the soccer ball and

49
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,800
 Then outside your door

50
00:03:50,800 --> 00:04:00,560
 Help me help me

51
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:11,480
 You're like what what huh? That's weird normally those voices are coming from inside my head

52
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,680
 But now I'm hearing them out in the darkness of my door

53
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:23,640
 They're not shrinking. He's not the voices of people in 1950s movies slowly shrinking help me

54
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,280
 You're like looking for ants that they're writing on the back of

55
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,040
 people are hearing the sounds of babies or toddlers crying and

56
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,280
 Young children calling up for help

57
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:45,240
 You give the point you get the point I don't think I I think we've all heard children calling up for help

58
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,080
 Hopefully not in real life kids are like falling off a cliff and you're like theater of the mind my friend theater of the mind

59
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,840
 In movies, I mean

60
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,280
 Right, I don't think I've ever heard a child in real life go help help me

61
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,240
 But I would know it if I heard it so anyways

62
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:07,400
 They're calling up the police you open up your door or maybe not maybe just hear these horrible noises outside

63
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,840
 But either way there's nothing out there and

64
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,800
 The police actually issues people are calling up the police the police send units out there because you know

65
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,280
 It's it's something that you want. There's enough

66
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,680
 If someone's keen your car you want the police to be able to take care of that

67
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,640
 But unless you're the one doing the keen then you're totally fine with it

68
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:35,240
 But nobody's pro children screaming in the darkness like no one's gonna be like what a waste of tax dollars

69
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,120
 The police showed up and there was nothing there

70
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:43,340
 Well, I hope the next time a child begs for his life the police don't show up that'll teach them like everyone's like

71
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,000
 Yeah, yeah, it's either a prank or something scary

72
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,840
 Police are showing up and they don't know what to make of it. They have not caught any suspects

73
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:58,960
 They have issued these statements the police. This is from the Pittsburgh deputy public information officer. This is Cara Cruz

74
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,160
 She's Lois Lane's cousin. Here's a quote

75
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:10,520
 Police have received multiple reports recently from people in the South Side area of the city of Pittsburgh who hear what sounds like this is interesting

76
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:17,040
 I should have stated this too before I got in school. It's not the sound. It's not the sound of a child crying outside your door

77
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,120
 It's the sound of a recording

78
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,640
 Of a child crying outside your door

79
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,960
 So if the marinade on that for a second, let me go back to this quote

80
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:32,280
 People have received multiple reports recently from people in the South Side area of the city of Pittsburgh who hear what sounds like a record

81
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,720
 of a baby crying or a child's voice asking for help zone three officers

82
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,160
 That's not some sci-fi. That's not some like sci-fi hologram cop

83
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:49,800
 Sting zone three is the area this take place in zone three officers have responded to each call in each case for altogether

84
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,040
 Officers did not hear the sound or locate the source of the sound

85
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:59,280
 However, we asked that anyone who hears something similar to these reports call 9-1-1 immediately

86
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,120
 No one from Pittsburgh police will be commenting on this at this time. So they're definitely taking it seriously

87
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:11,480
 They're not saying it's a prank so much as if you hear this call us, but we're not answering any more questions about this

88
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,640
 So they want to get to the bottom of it. It's not like they're like oh

89
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:20,480
 We think it's some fraternity frat prank. They actually want to get the bottom of this the question is this

90
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,000
 And this is an ongoing story this thing's happening right now right now

91
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,640
 It's happening outside your house if you turn down the volume of the podcast. You'll hear it

92
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,840
 But here's my question

93
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,160
 What's creepier to you the sound of a child in the darkness outside your house help me

94
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,120
 Help me. I'm assuming it sounds a little more realistic than that

95
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,880
 It's not obviously the sound of a 43 year old man imitating a child's voice. It's sound of a child's voice

96
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:55,880
 But what's creepier the sound of a child's voice outside your house in the darkness or the recording of a

97
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,600
 child's voice outside in the darkness

98
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:04,120
 Because let me say this if there's a kid outside your house calling for help

99
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,720
 This is what I personally think the recording is creepier because if there's a child outside your house calling for help

100
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:16,080
 Theoretically you could run out and help that child in the moment, but if it's a recording

101
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:23,040
 Whatever they're calling out for what's ever causing their misery has happened

102
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,360
 long ago

103
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,760
 You're just hearing an echo of their pain

104
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,680
 So I think on that level I would much rather

105
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:38,400
 I don't want to hear either one honestly, but if I was in my house and I heard someone go

106
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,600
 Oh, help me help me and I opened the door now if I didn't see anyone there

107
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,640
 I think it was a ghost but when I hear that noise

108
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,640
 I think maybe I can go out and help this person

109
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:51,880
 But if it sounds like someone's just playing a tape recording that means somebody's already done something awful

110
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,000
 It's not an incident where someone might need my assistance right now

111
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,440
 Someone's already been hurt and in trouble and that situation has been resolved

112
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,800
 And I'm just hearing an echo or a memory of that pain

113
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,160
 Coming from the shadows beyond my house and there's nothing I can do to save that person

114
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,600
 So that to me that's way creepier. Let's go ahead speaking of creepy. Let's move on to our next story

115
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,480
 Now our next story is one I just found out about today, and it's absolutely

116
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,520
 Fascinating to me. We're leaving the south side of Pittsburgh. Hopefully this mystery is solved

117
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:33,440
 Hopefully it's just a prank. No kids were harmed in the making of this wacky escapade that's going on hopefully

118
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,040
 But we will keep you updated as we leave Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

119
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:47,480
 So we leave the city behind we're headed off to Sicily, Italy, and we're going back in time to the year

120
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,960
 1976

121
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:59,400
 Helicopter is flying over a convent the Palma de Montecario. I have no idea. I Palma probably means like

122
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,940
 hand right and Montecario

123
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,680
 Monty is like

124
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,440
 Well, there's the count of Monty Cristo so Mont mount

125
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:16,120
 So maybe that means like the the and Charo means darkness, right?

126
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:23,600
 Oh, man if this story is fake either my either my Italian is really bad or the story's fake or both

127
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,280
 But Palma de Montecario does that mean like the hand of the dark mountain convent?

128
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,720
 Maybe but anyways, let's forget that that

129
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,000
 Let's forget that that might be like a trick the whole time I was reading the story

130
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,120
 I thought this story is too good to be true

131
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,560
 So I was looking for anagrams and stuff and some of the names

132
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:49,640
 I didn't even think about that now again. Like I said my Italian is non-existent. I don't know any Palma de Montecario

133
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,520
 Could mean all sorts of stuff

134
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:56,040
 But anyways, I hope it doesn't mean hand of the black mountain because then that's just a creepy convent and it would make us

135
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,400
 Thank this whole story fake, but we are land

136
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,800
 I vetted the story as much as I could because again

137
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:07,000
 I was enthralled by it today and looked it up in a bunch of different sources seems to be accurate

138
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,160
 But but anyways, let's quit building it up. We're gonna land at this convent

139
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:18,780
 And we're walking around the nuns come out and they're like hey people let's like shaking our hands whatever nuns do do they bow

140
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:26,160
 I don't know they do something they greet humans in some way or fashion and after we're done doing the traditional nun greeting

141
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,880
 They're like hey, do you want to check out the convent? It's a pretty cool place

142
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:35,680
 It's on the spooky black dark mountain in the shape of a fist of God's fist to punish all the evil doers

143
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,840
 It's holding a giant ruler really good

144
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:44,800
 And it's scarier because the rulers in the metric system because we're in Italy. We're like a double or we go into this convent

145
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,160
 We're walking around there showing us all this stuff and they're like this is where we like do pray

146
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,260
 Right, and then this is where we like do some more praying because we're nuns and that's all we do

147
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:00,740
 We're like it's pretty interesting and then we come to this like room and we go what's in there and they go

148
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,580
 Oh, that's just sister Maria

149
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,760
 As they're looking over at their notepad file on their computer. They're like, uh, yeah, let me look that up

150
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,400
 That is sister Maria

151
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,560
 crocifissa

152
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,840
 Della

153
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,840
 Concezino

154
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:22,000
 And then we're like we like are you sure you pronounce that right and then head none

155
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,840
 Whatever they're called the mother Teresa person the mother the head head mother the din mother

156
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,560
 anyways, she goes

157
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:35,520
 Um, I guess I've spent so much time trying to prove this story to be true or false

158
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:41,600
 I didn't even look up basic nuns nun facts the mother superior. That's it the mother superior goes

159
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,760
 Yeah, I think that's how you pronounce her name. She before she came to the nunnery

160
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,120
 She was known as Isabella tomasy

161
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,600
 So anyways Isabella tomasy a k a sister maria

162
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,240
 crocifissa Della concienz

163
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,560
 zion

164
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,120
 And we're like can we check on this chick? We want to see if she has such a wacky name that no one can pronounce

165
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,720
 Knock on the door and we don't know. She's not getting up. We're like, that's kind of rude. We're knocking again

166
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,040
 Come on open up. We want to talk to you. We we want you to like

167
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,400
 I don't know preach to us and stuff. What what what do nuns do and she's still not coming in

168
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,080
 So mother superior gets her master key and she opens up the door

169
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,640
 And there is this young nun. She's in her like 20s

170
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,520
 mid 20s laying on the ground

171
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,880
 unconscious so she's not making a noise

172
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:39,280
 And we run over and we're like wake up wake up dude. You're you're like something's wrong

173
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,360
 You're not dead so we can see breathing. She's like rolling around. She's like, oh man

174
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,800
 What and she rolls over and her face is covered in black ink. She's like, oh man

175
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:54,640
 That was unexpected. But then we remembered back in time. They didn't have like pins and stuff

176
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,920
 They just had a bunch of ink laying around them like little bottles

177
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:04,800
 And when you wanted to write something you took something sharp like a feather because I I I don't I've seen this in movies

178
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,680
 Okay, I'm not an ink inkologist. You take a feather or something sharp

179
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,400
 And you stick it in the ink. I don't know why I'm explaining it to you guys. I'm seeing the same movies

180
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,680
 I have anyways her face is covered in ink and

181
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,200
 there's a bunch of ink like on the table and

182
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:27,600
 Then there's a letter on the table as well. And so she we help her to her feet. She's all slipping in the ink

183
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,800
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, and then we let her fall because it's funny and she's like jerks

184
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,120
 We help her back up and we're like, dude, what happened? You're like knocked out. You all covered in ink

185
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,680
 Like what's going on and she goes you won't believe

186
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,200
 The night I had you won't believe the night I had

187
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:47,600
 Go pick up that letter. We we pick up this letter and it's completely indecipherable

188
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,680
 It's a combination of greek letters and

189
00:14:51,680 --> 00:15:00,000
 Krillik shrillik letters krillik shrillik shrillik the cyr l l ic krillik

190
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,360
 Anyways, it's a bunch of those letters too, right? It's greek letters and and krillik letters

191
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,800
 And a bunch of other letters that nobody can decipher and we're like, what is this like? What were you doing?

192
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,040
 And she goes dude, uh, it's totally sucked

193
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,760
 Can I at least get a towel to wipe this ink off my face?

194
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,560
 So then we give her a towel and she gets all clean and then she tell comes back and tells us this story

195
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,800
 She said last night. I was just chilling in my little convent hole

196
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,120
 Praying and stuff, right?

197
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,160
 And the devil came to me and everyone's like, oh

198
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,040
 The devil wanted me to write a letter

199
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,920
 And I said no no, no, I'm not gonna do that and then the devil started to like beat me up

200
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,280
 Now, okay, so here's the thing, right?

201
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:50,080
 Obviously we're sitting in this monastery in 1676 and we know these people are like super religious

202
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,080
 They've given up their life for their religion

203
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,760
 it's

204
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,080
 Not it's not super dark ages time, but it's definitely not

205
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:03,040
 Like the most enlightened time is it's kind of that in-between phase

206
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,000
 I think the Renaissance was kind of in full swing, but still like

207
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,800
 1676 in a nunnery

208
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,560
 You know, we're just kind of looking at each other. We're like, oh, you know

209
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,400
 Yeah, the devil came to you and like beat you up and made you write a letter

210
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:21,600
 Now the letter is gibberish. You can see it in the show notes. It is it's written out as words and sentences, but

211
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,480
 Makes no sense. You're like Jason. You can't even pronounce the word

212
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,560
 Srillik or Krillik or whatever. How do you know what their alphabet looks like?

213
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,480
 Well, even back then and even today they're saying it just doesn't make sense

214
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,320
 So we have this basically an art a letter written in gibberish

215
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,320
 That conveniently fits on one page from this woman who was all by herself who deeply is

216
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,480
 deeply the vout person

217
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,200
 Satan shows up beats her up and makes her write a letter that nobody can decipher

218
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,240
 So we're kind of like it's kind of like speaking in tongues like what's going on here

219
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,440
 And she says so the devil wanted me to write this letter now. I know what the letter says

220
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,160
 So we go, what does the letter say? She goes, I'm not gonna tell you

221
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,760
 But I know what it says. It actually makes sense, but I'm not gonna tell you what it says

222
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,840
 Oh, okay. So now again, it's super suspicious

223
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,760
 There's one word that is decipherable in the letter

224
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,840
 Omi like oh me or alas is another way. It's been translated

225
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:25,920
 But other than that everything is this weird language and she said that was the one time I was able to break satan's control

226
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,400
 And I wrote omi

227
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,600
 On there or omi. It's it's written. It's an italian. Oh, oh me. Oh me

228
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,080
 But anyways

229
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,640
 That is where we're at with that now

230
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:45,680
 She says that she wrote it. She says that it was dictated dictated to her by satan satan made her do it

231
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:50,240
 She broke his control for just a minute. She wrote omi then she became paralyzed

232
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,960
 And he made her finish writing it

233
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:59,600
 And she and then at that point the church elders got a hold of the letter and they believed her story

234
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,640
 They said we actually believe this like the way this is structured. We think it says something

235
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,320
 but

236
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,320
 she won't tell us what it is and

237
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,120
 That's that really now before she died 14 years later

238
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,520
 And she said in that time period satan came to her two more times

239
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:23,680
 Wanted her to dictate more letters and she wouldn't do it and satan beat her up. She wouldn't do it at all the first letter

240
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,880
 She kind of had to like she got beat up and then she wrote it down

241
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,920
 Then he appeared two more times and she would never say what the letter was supposed to say and she didn't write the other two letters

242
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,520
 But she ended up the church elders did believe her story

243
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,400
 She ended up beginning venerated. She wasn't a saint

244
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:47,760
 But people really believe that she had this bizarre connection to God and over the centuries two possible theories popped up regarding this letter

245
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:54,640
 One it was a letter that satan wanted to send to God satan wanted to send a message to God, but didn't want to do it directly

246
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,680
 So he had to use an intermediary

247
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:04,000
 Which would have been sister maria, but satan didn't want any human to know what the letter said so he wrote it in this crazy language

248
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,880
 When I find that kind of creepy to me that reminds me

249
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,560
 Something you would see on an episode of supernatural now getting this story is throwing up a lot of alarm bells for me

250
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,080
 This is one of them

251
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,880
 because that involves there's something so

252
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,640
 fictional about that

253
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,320
 Like it doesn't necessarily make sense, but it's a kind of a cool gimmick where you could have a story where

254
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,280
 You have satan and god these two

255
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,760
 supremely powerful figures

256
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,560
 having to use little people us to

257
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,880
 Send messages back and forth and then this would be the prologue and then eventually

258
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,640
 You would jump to the year 2020 and you would have sabina a 16 year old girl in idaho

259
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:51,040
 Who doesn't have a really good home life and she's not good at school and then she becomes the messenger of satan

260
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:56,240
 And you have this whole and then she meets these really hot guys and they start fighting over her and then one of them turns out to be an angel

261
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,560
 The other one's just like a billionaire

262
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,960
 You know and you could see this

263
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,000
 mythology being born out of this this idea of

264
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,320
 Satan simply wants to send a message to god, but he can't do it directly. He has to find you know what I mean like it sounds

265
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:18,800
 Too good. It sounds too interesting. It sounds too much like an episode of supernatural or a series of teen novels

266
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,760
 The other theory is that the devil actually

267
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:29,120
 And again, this kind of falls into that fictional thing that maria was some sort of prize and the devil was trying to torment her directly

268
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,640
 By getting her to write this letter and that's why he kept appearing to her and not other people

269
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:41,440
 And the devil and god were fighting over her devil wanted to break her soul and god was testing her letting him try this

270
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,720
 She ended up dying in her 40s. So she did end up dying quite young

271
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,800
 But the the letter was kept the letter was studied for centuries and people just thought

272
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:58,240
 Gibberish eventually people started to say she's probably having some sort of mental breakdown because the cloistered life was so hard

273
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,280
 You know, you're going you're just praying all the time your knees hurt. You're dressed in all those drab clothes

274
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,960
 It's not the best place for someone who might be a free spirit

275
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,920
 she joined the nunnery when she was 15 years old and she just might have had a mental breakdown and

276
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:18,320
 You have the skeptics believing that you have the church believing this was a legitimate letter and now we travel to the year

277
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,280
 2017 and all of that stuff was I think an interesting little story, right?

278
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,160
 And normally that would be the way I'd start off an episode

279
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
 until 2017

280
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:33,120
 2017 again people studied this letter for a long time 2017

281
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,760
 There is a museum in

282
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,920
 a katani

283
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:45,040
 Katania Sicily Katania Sicily. It's the Ludham science museum and they came across

284
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,280
 software a basically a cryptography

285
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:55,280
 Software a code breaking software that was developed by the government of turkey to crack

286
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,680
 Isis codes

287
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,680
 That were being used on the deep web

288
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,960
 And someone gets the bright idea. What if we took this

289
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:11,120
 Program that's used to crack these near indecipherable codes that terrorists are using to plan attacks across the world

290
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:17,040
 What if we use this program to decipher this letter from 1676?

291
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,240
 What do you have to lose right?

292
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:27,440
 It really would prove if the letter if you're using this advanced cryptography program and the letters gibberish

293
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,080
 Then the letter is gibberish

294
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,360
 But what could happen if you ran this program?

295
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,160
 Now i'm about to read you this translation because this actually worked

296
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:43,280
 There is a bit of a little asterisk to this so so there's a listener named neo

297
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:49,040
 He sent me a bunch of stuff recently a lot of it involved the region where he's from which is in italy the

298
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:55,520
 Friuli region because we did an episode a while back on the the benedonte witches

299
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,160
 And warlocks. He's from that area. He's not a witch or a warlock at least that i know of but

300
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,800
 He sent me a bunch of stuff

301
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:07,120
 I found this story on a website. He said he didn't directly send me the story

302
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:12,480
 But he turned me onto this italian paranormal website. So thank you for that. I'm about to read you an english

303
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,640
 a google english translation of an italian website

304
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,320
 That's trying to translate something from ancient greek or classical greek and

305
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
 Cyrillic

306
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,000
 I think that's how he ran it actually Cyrillic alphabets run through

307
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,960
 A turkish design program to crack

308
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,600
 Isis codes, okay?

309
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:39,200
 But i'm going to read you the quote that i have and then i'll read you what people think this means

310
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:46,720
 So this is trippy letter written in 1676 here we go of symbols that i who claws live go

311
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,080
 No source a misfortune perhaps

312
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,880
 Now certain sticks

313
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,960
 And then there's two words that are unpronounceable

314
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,680
 Since i christ Zerosto

315
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,880
 Follow the ancient ways or seamstresses sewn by men

316
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,680
 Oh me

317
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,680
 Restore me to serve nobody

318
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:13,680
 This is ballast system are the three a god that i feel free mortals

319
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,600
 Z this is why they are always

320
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,840
 The fact that you're even able to get that much

321
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,440
 That is comprehensible real words

322
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:33,680
 From gibberish written in classical greek and that other language that no one was able to translate because

323
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,840
 And i should say this they could look at the letters and go those letters make sense

324
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,720
 But they're not say spelling out words

325
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,640
 So they look at the greek letter for alpha and they go well we know what alpha is

326
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,680
 But that word that it's in it doesn't make any sense. It was written in a code

327
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,120
 And you go but jason that's just a string of words. This is what people

328
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,000
 Think the letter is is meaning i got this quote from another article

329
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,960
 God thinks he can free mortals

330
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,920
 This system works for no one

331
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:10,320
 And it also says that that's just one part of it. They're also saying that there are words like when it's talking about christ

332
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:17,680
 It's talking about god. It's talking about zorostar, which is another ancient deity old old world

333
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:22,240
 Deity when it talks about the river sticks when it makes the reference to sticks

334
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:30,160
 When it talks about the seamstresses sown by men people believe the letter is making a reference that god and when it talks about the

335
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,280
 Three a god that i feel free mortals

336
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,200
 That god and the trinity are made up by man

337
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,080
 seamstresses sown by men

338
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,800
 And that's when she writes. Oh me

339
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,360
 Like that's when she interjects this letter is basically saying god is made up

340
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,840
 The trinity is made up

341
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,840
 I find it absolutely bizarre

342
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,000
 That anything came out of the letter and it's funny when I was reading the article

343
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,520
 I thought well, this is interesting. You know a nun had a nervous breakdown and wrote this

344
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,080
 But then when you jump ahead

345
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,080
 for what four or five hundred years

346
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,960
 Run a computer program and something decipher not only does something come up

347
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,760
 Something comes up that makes sense in the context of the history of the letter

348
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,920
 It's not alphabet soup. Yum. Yum. Yum. It's

349
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:24,320
 A nun saying she got this letter from the devil and the letter is in code saying

350
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,360
 God doesn't exist

351
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,360
 It's all a joke

352
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,520
 now I've

353
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,280
 Now it's pot this story really does sound

354
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:42,800
 Too good to be true. It's been reported. It's it's a pretty obscure story, but it's been reported in a lot of

355
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,680
 places

356
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:50,880
 The actual letter being translated that was reported in the mirror, which is a british newspaper

357
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,840
 And um life science actually did an article

358
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:59,840
 About the translation. So it's not a movie hoax that I know of it's not like the

359
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,240
 Mountain devils that we covered or you know the bigfoot beating people up and then getting shot

360
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,640
 Which turned out to be fake as well

361
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:14,880
 Lone pine devils that was a story that ended up being a viral marketing thing which we covered on this show

362
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,680
 This story appears to be true

363
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:22,080
 Let me say this let me back up the story the elements of the story appear to be true

364
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:29,040
 There was a letter that for four or five hundred years was indecipherable that was recently run through a

365
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,080
 anti-intelligence

366
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,000
 Cryptography code breaking software and it came out with a message that is

367
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,160
 Related to the story of it being written those elements are true

368
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:47,120
 Your mileage may vary on whether or not the devil showed up at this young nun's room and forced her to write this letter

369
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,960
 But I think it's highly possible. That's what happened

370
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,680
 Highly possible

371
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:59,920
 Is it possible that the people running the program had an interest in getting a certain message out? Sure

372
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,200
 possible

373
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,200
 But it feels

374
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,520
 True

375
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,720
 The devil saying god doesn't exist. That's nothing new

376
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,320
 The devil trying to tempt humans

377
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,280
 Nothing new break their will

378
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,680
 distort their faith in god

379
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,680
 Nothing new

380
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,680
 But the devil's showing up

381
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,520
 Forcing a woman to write a coded letter

382
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:33,520
 Even him knowing full well unless she revealed the contents of the letter it would be indecipherable

383
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,520
 That's all new ground

384
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:44,720
 The devil putting out a message that no one would know about for hundreds of years

385
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,240
 Until technology had advanced to the point where it could decipher

386
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,680
 Ink on ancient parchment

387
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:59,200
 There's a couple questions that come up obviously one why maria

388
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,440
 Two why this message

389
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,280
 Three

390
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:12,400
 What were the other messages that maria refused to relay?

391
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:17,200
 But the most important question I feel is this

392
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,680
 Could it happen again today?

393
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,880
 Is it possible the next time that you're home alone?

394
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,160
 Sitting in your room all by yourself

395
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,680
 The ink well is long gone

396
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:40,660
 But your laptop your tablet your phone is always accessible

397
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:45,040
 And when you're alone in the dark

398
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,640
 You feel that presence

399
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,000
 Just outside of your field of view

400
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:58,640
 It has a message it wants you to deliver to the world

401
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,240
 A message that will destroy the faith

402
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,560
 Of all around you

403
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,640
 Will you have the willpower

404
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,120
 To fight the urge to write that letter or will you be

405
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,000
 Convinced by the darkness

406
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,880
 Will you just become a tool?

407
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,840
 Of the prince of lies

408
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,400
