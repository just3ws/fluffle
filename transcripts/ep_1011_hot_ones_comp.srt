1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,740
 A new drug has hit the streets of America, with side effects that are so horrifying.

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,240
 It's like something out of Robocop.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,360
 But without the Robocop it'd be fine if there was a cyborg walking around, but it's not.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,720
 It's just people suffering.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,720
 It's so crazy.

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,960
 And then we look at one of the hottest true crime stories taking place this month, but

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,760
 this one may have a paranormal twist.

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:30,280
 When four college students are brutally murdered, police quickly apprehend a suspect.

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,840
 But is it possible they have the wrong man?

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,800
 Is it possible the real killer was Bigfoot?

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,080
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:50,760
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,920
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a good day.

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,320
 I hope you guys are having a good day too.

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,480
 I'm having a good day because this is the first episode I'm recording since my COVID

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,480
 diagnosis.

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,160
 The last two episodes are actually pre-recorded, but man that COVID really knocked me for

18
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,160
 a loop.

19
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,880
 But I'm feeling really good now.

20
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,600
 I'm feeling a lot better.

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,600
 I'd say I'm 90%.

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,920
 I'm still a little sleepy.

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,400
 I just woke up from a nap right now to record this episode.

24
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,840
 It's due in like two hours.

25
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,680
 I gotta have this episode out for you guys.

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,360
 And I just want to thank you guys for your warm wishes and the get well soon and everything

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,560
 that I got over the course of my sickness.

28
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,160
 But someone who always has warm wishes for me, whether I'm sick or not, walking into

29
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:34,280
 Dead Rabbit Command right now, everyone give it up for one of our newest Patreon supporters,

30
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,280
 Steve.

31
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,280
 Woohoo!

32
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,280
 Yeah Steve!

33
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,280
 Come on in buddy!

34
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,440
 I don't want to be here on the COVID episode.

35
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,040
 I got one more day of being contagious.

36
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,440
 Come here and give me a big old hug.

37
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,680
 Steve you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

38
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,640
 If you guys can't support the show financially, I totally get it.

39
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,800
 I really do.

40
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,000
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,160
 That really helps out so much.

42
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,240
 And very quick, I have some awesome news.

43
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,240
 This is so cool.

44
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,640
 This is another thing I've been so excited to tell you guys about.

45
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,240
 In March, in the city of Seaside, Oregon, there is the Oregon Ghost Conference.

46
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,320
 It's an annual convention they've had going on now for 10 years.

47
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,800
 This will be the 11th annual Oregon Ghost Conference.

48
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,880
 I'm going to be a speaker there.

49
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:26,680
 I will be giving a presentation live at the Oregon Ghost Conference in Seaside, Oregon

50
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,680
 this year.

51
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,840
 I will give you guys more details as it comes closer.

52
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,440
 The Oregon Ghost Conference runs from March 24th to March 26th.

53
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,680
 I don't know what day I'm speaking on or what time I'm speaking on or anything like

54
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,680
 that.

55
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,720
 I probably could have waited until I had that information but I couldn't wait to tell you.

56
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,320
 I will be a speaker at the Oregon Ghost Conference.

57
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,960
 It's a 50 minute long presentation.

58
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,160
 I can't wait.

59
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,560
 That's going to be awesome.

60
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,400
 I'm so excited about it.

61
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,600
 And this excitement, I hope you guys can feel it.

62
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,320
 And thank you guys.

63
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,760
 Thank you for putting me at this point where I can be a speaker at the Ghost Conference.

64
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,680
 When I was doing the UFO Festival, I remember my friend Sabine came out.

65
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,680
 She helped me there.

66
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,920
 She helped set everything up.

67
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,320
 She hung out with me while I had this haunted museum at the UFO Festival.

68
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,160
 I remember I turned to her and I go, "Next time I want to be a speaker at one of these."

69
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,800
 The rain is falling down on my head.

70
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,000
 And the line for the bathroom was half hour long.

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,920
 I said, "I'm going to push people out of the way and be like, "Get out of the way, guys.

72
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,920
 I'm a speaker."

73
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,280
 I'm so excited about this.

74
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,280
 I think you guys can tell.

75
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,640
 It's going to be really cool.

76
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,920
 If you guys can come out to see it, it would be really, really cool.

77
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,480
 Steve, let's go ahead and start off by tossing you the hair hang glider.

78
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,760
 Let's jump off the highest point of Dead Ravica Man and glide all the way out to Philadelphia.

79
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:55,440
 We're not headed to Philly, though, to run up the famous stairs, the Rocky Stairs.

80
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,440
 I don't know what they're actually called.

81
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,120
 It's probably like, actually, historical landmark that was made before Rocky.

82
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,080
 I don't think they built them for Rocky to run up.

83
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,240
 We're not there for that.

84
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,840
 We're not there to check out Patty's pub.

85
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,840
 No.

86
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,320
 We should stop by those places anyways, right?

87
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,200
 Let's go for a run up the Rocky Stairs and let's grab a drink at a fictional pub.

88
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,760
 I don't even think it exists, but someone I'm sure is using that name in that city, Patty's

89
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,760
 pub.

90
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,440
 But after we've hung out at those two places, I go, "Hey, let's go here.

91
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,200
 I've got another tourist attraction for you.

92
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,200
 Come on.

93
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,200
 Let's go over this way."

94
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,200
 You're like, "Oh, what could it be?

95
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,200
 Could it be the Liberty Bell?"

96
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,120
 You ask yourself as we are walking deeper into the city.

97
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,720
 And eventually I go, "Here is the number one tourist destination of Philadelphia."

98
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:46,280
 And you look out on this open street and you're like, "Jason, I don't think this is part of

99
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,280
 the tour.

100
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,080
 Not only that, but someone just took my wallet and you see a guy running past us and he's

101
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,080
 like, "I got it.

102
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,080
 I got all the money, guys.

103
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,080
 Give me drugs."

104
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,080
 You're like, "What?"

105
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,240
 We're currently standing.

106
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,240
 Now we have no clothes on.

107
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,560
 We're just standing there in our underwear.

108
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,000
 Everything else has been stolen.

109
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,880
 We're currently standing in one of the biggest open-air drug markets in America.

110
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,120
 It's not like a farmer's market.

111
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,680
 It's not like some guys are like, "Get your heroin here.

112
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,680
 Come on."

113
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,360
 He has big bushels of heroin.

114
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,160
 People are walking up there like, "Is it organic?"

115
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,640
 And he's like, "Oh."

116
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,920
 It's just where people sell drugs.

117
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,240
 It's where people, the crime situation is so bad that people openly sell drugs and the

118
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,440
 police are like, "We got other stuff to do, plus we don't want our clothes stolen."

119
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,760
 This giant open-air drug market in Philadelphia, and there's currently, this has been the past

120
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,680
 couple of months, this has been growing, but I recently read an article that was published

121
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:49,960
 in The New York Times about how, not how bad the drug problem has become in Philadelphia

122
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,280
 because again, they're just selling this stuff openly in the middle of the street.

123
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,080
 It's been bad for a while.

124
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,400
 But how bad the drugs have become.

125
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,780
 Heroin is now one of the hardest drugs to find in America.

126
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:11,080
 Not only are the drug addicts kind of shocked by this, the people who steady drugs, the

127
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:16,200
 people who look at the science of addiction and all of this stuff, they're like, "This

128
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,440
 is so weird.

129
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,800
 Heroin is now one of the hardest drugs to find in the United States."

130
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,560
 Now you can walk into an open-air drug market and you can buy heroin, and you can get heroin,

131
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,040
 but it's not heroin anymore.

132
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:36,680
 What happened is basically you had such a crackdown on the opioid market.

133
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,020
 So it's even hard to get prescription painkillers nowadays.

134
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,000
 If you get them from your doctor, you're lucky, you can turn around and sell them for like

135
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 $5 a pill.

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,920
 I'm not endorsing you doing that.

137
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,560
 But prescription opioids, there's been such a crackdown on prescribing them, they're very

138
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,560
 hard to get.

139
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:58,840
 Now you can go and buy a bottle of hydrocodone or a bottle of OxyContin, but it's not that

140
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,640
 anymore and the heroin is not that anymore either.

141
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,640
 It's fentanyl.

142
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,880
 It used to be that you would get a little bit of heroin when you went to go buy heroin

143
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,520
 from your dealer, you'd get a little bit of heroin.

144
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,160
 You get a little bit of heroin mixed with a little bit of fentanyl, which is a synthetic

145
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,560
 opioid.

146
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:21,080
 So you would still feel the effects of a painkiller.

147
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,880
 And it got to the point where dealers started going, "Okay, well, we can get this heroin,

148
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,460
 put a little bit of fentanyl in it, and it'll still be super potent and people will get

149
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,880
 addicted to the fentanyl in the heroin that we're selling."

150
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,760
 So if you went and just did normal heroin, it's not going to give you a full fix anymore

151
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,000
 because now you've become addicted to the fentanyl.

152
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,320
 What's happened to the heroin market is a one-two punch.

153
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,880
 First off, heroin was becoming more rare anyways.

154
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:54,600
 When the US withdrew their forces from Afghanistan, the Taliban, who then took the country back

155
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,240
 over, they had owned it previously, the Taliban has never been a fan of opioids.

156
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:05,240
 And Afghanistan would have fields, just as fields as far as I can see of poppies, just

157
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,840
 where you get opium from.

158
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,800
 Well, the Taliban, after the US pulled out, the Taliban told the poppy farmers, "You

159
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,640
 get one more season.

160
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,880
 We'll let you harvest the poppies you have right now.

161
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,560
 But after that, you're going to have to start growing wheat or pickles or something else

162
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,960
 because we're not going to allow you to grow more poppies.

163
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,200
 We're not going to allow you to produce opium.

164
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,680
 It's against what we stand for."

165
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:36,760
 It is pretty weird when the Taliban, I think, has a better state of mind than the US government

166
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,000
 who came in and was like, "Oh, just grow whatever you want.

167
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,240
 People have CIA funded planes to fly it out on the regular.

168
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,240
 Just grow the opium."

169
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,240
 The Taliban came in.

170
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,640
 I don't agree with the Taliban on much.

171
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,440
 Probably just this one thing, honestly.

172
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,200
 It shouldn't be growing mass amounts of poppies.

173
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,320
 So all of a sudden, you have a huge...

174
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,640
 It goes from having just a little bit of heroin to no heroin.

175
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,440
 This was one of the most popular street drugs for decades.

176
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,080
 And now it's going back to no heroin.

177
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,200
 You just can't get it in the United States.

178
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,800
 So now we're just getting fentanyl and people are selling it as heroin.

179
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,840
 A lot of drug addicts go, "Kids nowadays have never done heroin."

180
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,720
 And they never will.

181
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,080
 They're addicted to fentanyl.

182
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,080
 It's called heroin on the street.

183
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,800
 It looks like it.

184
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,240
 But it's not the heroin high that we grew up with.

185
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,680
 And they also said that was another thing.

186
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,400
 Before you would have an old heroin user.

187
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,680
 You could have people who did heroin like Philip Seymour Hoffman.

188
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,440
 They go, "That doesn't exist anymore."

189
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,640
 Neither does he, unfortunately.

190
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,760
 He passed away from heroin overdose.

191
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,160
 They go, "You could used to have people who could be on heroin for a long time.

192
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,720
 Maybe they get clean and get back on it.

193
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,280
 Maybe they never try to get clean and they just stay on it for a long time."

194
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,840
 They go, "Fentanyl's not like that.

195
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,920
 People die young when they're addicted to fentanyl."

196
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,440
 But that's not what we're talking about.

197
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,200
 Because now an even worse drug...

198
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,040
 I mean, this...

199
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,240
 What I'm about to talk about is so dystopian.

200
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,040
 I was shocked.

201
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,880
 I read this article and then I started watching documentaries and things on this.

202
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,000
 It's been around for a couple months in the United States, probably a little bit longer.

203
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,640
 But now it's becoming a public health emergency.

204
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,840
 This is so insane.

205
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,080
 There's a brand new drug on the market.

206
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,720
 Because fentanyl has now become hard to source.

207
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,480
 The number one importer of fentanyl to the United States, it's synthetic.

208
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,760
 You can just make it in the laboratory.

209
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,880
 It was China.

210
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:33,040
 And President Trump said, "You can't ship this stuff over to America anymore.

211
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,840
 It's killing people.

212
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,880
 It's wiping out an entire generation.

213
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,800
 A hundred thousand people died last year of drug overdoses.

214
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,720
 That's the biggest amount.

215
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,240
 And I think that was primarily opioids.

216
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,120
 A hundred thousand Americans died last year due to drug overdoses.

217
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,520
 And that's wartime numbers.

218
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,600
 So China, to their credit, it took a while.

219
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,440
 It took a while.

220
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,280
 They're kind of himminin' on.

221
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:04,800
 But China eventually said, "Okay, we're going to declare in China that fentanyl is a controlled substance."

222
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,240
 So now you just can't produce it in the laboratory and put it on a plane and ship it over.

223
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,720
 We're not going to allow that anymore.

224
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,320
 Now, is there some seepage?

225
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,320
 Yeah, is this stuff still being produced over there?

226
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,280
 Yeah, but at a much smaller amount than it was before, this slack's kind of been picked up in Mexico.

227
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:24,880
 They'll have some fentanyl labs down there, but it's nowhere near the amount of fentanyl that was previously just coming over.

228
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,000
 So what do the drug addicts do?

229
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,840
 What do the drug dealers do, right?

230
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,120
 You need to create a drug that people are going to have.

231
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,040
 And that is where we now have Trank.

232
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:46,880
 Trank, T-R-A-N-Q, is the stuff of nightmares.

233
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,480
 We've heard stories before about Crocodile.

234
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,440
 That was a drug that we would see pop up in Russia and Eastern Europe.

235
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,280
 It was for people who were so desperate to get high that they would take basically Coding Cough syrup.

236
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,480
 Because a lot of opioids you can openly buy in other countries.

237
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,600
 You can buy Coding Cough syrup over the counter in most of Europe.

238
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,240
 America has a serious drug problem.

239
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,280
 I can't figure out why it's us.

240
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,960
 We cannot have Coding Cough syrup sold over the counter.

241
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:25,360
 But they do, and in Russia, people were desperate to get high, and they were looking for a cheap high.

242
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,320
 And they began to take Coding Cough syrup and run all these chemicals through it to make it more potent.

243
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:39,440
 And when you injected it into your body, over time, the wound that you were injecting into would start to necrotize.

244
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,320
 And your skin would start to look like a crocodile.

245
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,160
 It would become black and leathery right at the ejection site.

246
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,120
 And if you didn't stop, you would start to show the effects as if you had a flesh eating virus.

247
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,640
 You would start to lose skin and muscle tissue around the ejection site.

248
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,400
 Trank is far worse than that.

249
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,680
 This stuff is brutal.

250
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,560
 What it is, it is fentanyl.

251
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,080
 There's no heroin left, right?

252
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,680
 It is just fentanyl mixed with a drug called xylazine.

253
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:24,720
 It is a legal, uncontrolled substance that is used to tranquilize cows and horses.

254
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,080
 Vets use xylazine as a tranquilizing drug.

255
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,880
 Super, super sedative effects.

256
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,080
 Trank is fentanyl, which is already so dangerous, mixed with xylazine.

257
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,080
 You can't snort it.

258
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,240
 It's way too painful.

259
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,320
 You have to inject it into your body.

260
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,080
 And what happens is, give yourself an injection and you immediately pass out.

261
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,960
 Because the xylazine is that strong.

262
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,360
 You're just like, I need to get high.

263
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,600
 You inject yourself, you immediately pass out.

264
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,400
 You wake up eight hours later.

265
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:06,320
 And you're already sick from fentanyl withdrawal.

266
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,200
 You've gone through withdrawal while you were high on Trank.

267
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:17,520
 So when you come to, you immediately need more drugs.

268
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,520
 You don't even get the people go, I inject myself with this,

269
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,320
 like I was a heroin addict and then I just started using fentanyl.

270
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,600
 But now when I use Trank, which is all I can find,

271
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,880
 now when I use Trank, I immediately pass out.

272
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,600
 And then when I wake up hours later, I'm already sweating and pooping my pants

273
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,200
 because I'm going through fentanyl withdrawal.

274
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,800
 And you're lucky if that's all that happens, people.

275
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,240
 They call it the robbery drug because people, you're hanging out.

276
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,560
 A lot of people, drug use is a social activity.

277
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,160
 You inject yourself with Trank.

278
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,960
 You wake up eight hours later, all your stuff's gone.

279
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,760
 This isn't even the worst part, by the way.

280
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,960
 This right here would just be a bad drug.

281
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,840
 Trank, super addictive, because what happens is you get addicted

282
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,000
 to the tranquilizing effects as well.

283
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,720
 So then ordinary fentanyl doesn't do it anymore.

284
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,920
 You need more Trank.

285
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,560
 That's not the worst part.

286
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,600
 The worst part is this chemical is so toxic to the human body.

287
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,880
 People's limbs, limbs, not just their skin.

288
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:28,320
 People are losing arms and legs because they are addicted to Trank.

289
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:35,440
 It's something that you would see in some sci-fi horror movie like Robocop

290
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,120
 or Repo, the genetic opera.

291
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,480
 Something that if you saw in a book or in a cyberpunk novel,

292
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,520
 you'd be like, wow, that's a little extreme.

293
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:50,560
 No one would be addicted to a drug that makes their legs fall off.

294
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,440
 This is what the drug does.

295
00:15:53,440 --> 00:16:01,040
 You inject it into your arm and you'll lose a leg.

296
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,200
 That doesn't happen immediately.

297
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,520
 It's not like you're like, oh man, I can't wait to get high

298
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,920
 and then you wake up, you're like, ah, my leg.

299
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,280
 But it does happen.

300
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:18,240
 It has this weird reaction to the human body that it appears that their skin has a huge

301
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,280
 chemical burn on it.

302
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,880
 Like there's a lot of footage and a lot of photos of these people.

303
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,880
 And it looks like their arms have been dipped in acid.

304
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,960
 Like even crocodile was localized to where you injected it.

305
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,840
 You inject it into your arm and you start to have this reaction over time.

306
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,440
 It's not a long period of time either.

307
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,400
 Where you start to develop this massive chemical burn on your leg.

308
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,240
 It's totally random.

309
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,760
 You don't know where it's going to appear.

310
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,920
 And you keep doing the trink.

311
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:54,160
 People keep losing skin and then muscle tissue and then tendons and it becomes infected.

312
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,160
 And eventually the doctors are like, we're going to have to amputate your leg.

313
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,360
 And people are so addicted to trink that even after they've had limbs chopped off,

314
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,720
 they're continuing to use.

315
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,520
 Here's a quote from the New York Times article.

316
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,040
 They interviewed this woman named Brooke Peter.

317
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,880
 She's 38 years old and here's this quote from her experience quote.

318
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,720
 She unrolled a bandage from elbow to palm.

319
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:30,000
 Beneath patches of blackened tissue, exposed white tendons and pus, the sheared flesh was hot and

320
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,320
 red.

321
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,240
 To stave off xylosanes excruciating withdrawal, she said.

322
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,720
 She injects a trank dope several times a day.

323
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,280
 Fearful that injecting in a fresh site could create a new wound,

324
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,040
 she reluctantly shoots into her festering forearm.

325
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:51,520
 The trank dope literally eats your flesh, she said.

326
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,880
 It's self-destruction at its finest.

327
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,280
 But it doesn't matter where you shoot it up.

328
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,200
 It really doesn't.

329
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,640
 They don't know why.

330
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,840
 This is so new.

331
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,840
 These effects are so new.

332
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,880
 They don't know why if you shoot up in the arm you'll lose a leg.

333
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,040
 But you can watch video after video.

334
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,440
 I'll put some in the show notes and you can look up the photos.

335
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,920
 People are losing legs.

336
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,200
 People are losing arms.

337
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,640
 People are dying obviously.

338
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,320
 That's the end result of having such a horrid drug addiction.

339
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,920
 It's insane.

340
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,480
 It's insane.

341
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,120
 It really does feel so dystopian.

342
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,680
 I mean there is a little bit of ethnocentrism here because when I read about what was going on

343
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,920
 in Eastern Europe with the crocodile,

344
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,680
 you go "Wow, that's insane.

345
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,880
 That's so awful."

346
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,040
 But it was also so far away.

347
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,200
 And I know that crocodile had hit America,

348
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,840
 but it was such a garbage drug.

349
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,400
 And there were so many other drugs available, heroin for one.

350
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:54,880
 The people weren't really using crocodile like we were seeing over in Russia and Eastern Europe.

351
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,280
 But this is an American phenomenon.

352
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,720
 This is an American drug.

353
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,040
 It's absolutely hellish.

354
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,600
 And people are using these drugs.

355
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,080
 The New York Times, they were saying that when they were doing these interviews with people,

356
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,080
 at one point there was a guy sitting on the street who was injecting

357
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,800
 Trank into his leg stump.

358
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,040
 He was just sitting there in a wheelchair in Philadelphia,

359
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,320
 lost his leg at some point due to Trank use,

360
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,440
 and now he's injecting his stump with more Trank.

361
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,240
 They've said 90% of the "Heroine"

362
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,440
 in Philly is now Trank.

363
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,880
 And it will spread to the rest of the United States.

364
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,160
 This will become a main drug of choice,

365
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,800
 because you can't get the opioids like we used to.

366
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,760
 It's terrifying, right?

367
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,520
 It really, really is scary.

368
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,960
 We can't tell China to stop shipping it in.

369
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,520
 We can't put troops along the border to keep it from coming in from Mexico.

370
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,960
 Xylazine is legal to have today.

371
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,760
 You could drive around with a truckload full of it.

372
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,960
 There's not against the law.

373
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,120
 Again, that is not a recommendation, okay?

374
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,600
 I'm not saying, you know, get into this business.

375
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,560
 But they'll make it illegal at some point, but

376
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,280
 Trank.

377
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,720
 I mean, again, like if somebody told you there was a drug on the streets today that

378
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,120
 thousands of people are using today, probably tens of thousands,

379
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,280
 that makes their limbs fall off, and they know that.

380
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,320
 You'd be like, that's not true.

381
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,080
 Nobody is that desperate.

382
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,600
 Heroin can make you addicted and you need to lose in your house and your job,

383
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,240
 and you're sleeping in a gut or somewhere, but that's so far off.

384
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,440
 That's so abstract.

385
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,080
 You go, no, I only use on the weekends.

386
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,160
 You can't really tell someone who's using heroin that, you know,

387
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,960
 this could happen to you.

388
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,000
 You could lose all this stuff.

389
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,040
 But I mean, Trank, this is the new drug.

390
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,480
 This is the new fentanyl heroin.

391
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,600
 You can't get it now.

392
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,120
 Well, you can in some parts of the country.

393
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,160
 You can still get it without Trank, but it's so strong.

394
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,880
 That how long will you be able to even buy fentanyl?

395
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,680
 Will fentanyl eventually also become a distant memory?

396
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,600
 And before we would go good.

397
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,440
 There's no heroin in America.

398
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,480
 That's awesome.

399
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,560
 There's no heroin addiction anymore.

400
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,440
 That's great.

401
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,480
 There's no fentanyl.

402
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,280
 That's even better.

403
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,720
 That was even worse than heroin.

404
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,600
 But this is what is coming to replace it.

405
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,480
 Something that is straight out of Robocop with their nuke.

406
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,880
 That's what it was reminding me of the whole time in Robocop too.

407
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,920
 They had, this is nuke.

408
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,440
 This is the most powerful street drug.

409
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,200
 And then that didn't make you fall apart.

410
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,600
 It was just a super powerful addictive drug

411
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,720
 that only a cyborg could stop distribution of it.

412
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,800
 I spent a lot of time talking about that.

413
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,320
 So I'm going to do a switch up.

414
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,120
 We are going to save the Moscow, Idaho story for tomorrow.

415
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,120
 But I got a short but crazy one.

416
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,120
 This is another super crazy conspiracy theory.

417
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,360
 Steve, I'm going to touch you the keys of the carbonicopter.

418
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,160
 We are leaving behind Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

419
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,760
 I really hope that the addicts there are able to get the help they need

420
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,440
 because definitely they don't need more drink.

421
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,480
 I think I've ruined your guys' day enough.

422
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,440
 You guys are eating spaghetti.

423
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,640
 You're like, oh man.

424
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,080
 Steve, get that spaghetti out of your mouth.

425
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,920
 Steve, I'm touching the keys of the carbonicopter.

426
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,600
 We are leaving behind Philadelphia.

427
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,440
 Fly us all the way out to a pitch black room.

428
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:27,200
 Actually, this is kind of a gross segue.

429
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,680
 We're walking into this pitch black room.

430
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,320
 But it's not completely pitch black.

431
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,520
 You do see in the middle of the room, there is a table that's lit up.

432
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:45,040
 And on the table is 10 sauces.

433
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,920
 10 sauces.

434
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,600
 I don't know why I'm building up the suspense.

435
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,800
 I changed what the story is.

436
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,520
 So I'm obviously changing the title of the episode.

437
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,320
 I can do that much.

438
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,960
 I'm not willing to go back to rerecord the intro.

439
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,680
 But we're on the set of Hot Ones.

440
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,560
 You guys know what Hot Ones is?

441
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:09,680
 You're like, Jason, what possible conspiracy theory could there be about

442
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:14,000
 one of YouTube's most beloved shows?

443
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,600
 I don't know if that's true.

444
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,280
 I don't know if what it's ranked.

445
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,920
 I used to watch Hot Ones when I was in that phase

446
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,000
 or I was playing a lot of Minecraft.

447
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,440
 And I was looking for stuff to watch.

448
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:26,800
 This was before I got on my police interrogation binge.

449
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,200
 I just like to have something going on in the background.

450
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,760
 I know a lot of you guys like listening to this podcast

451
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,840
 while you guys game or do your homework or cook up a meal,

452
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,200
 cook up a delicious meal.

453
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,600
 That happens to look like an open wound on a drug user.

454
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,520
 Lasagna, for example.

455
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,240
 Hot Ones, if you don't know, it is a interview show

456
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:53,520
 where you sit down with this dude and he asks questions while you eat spicy hot wings.

457
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,840
 I watched it a bit.

458
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,720
 I watched, you know, you go through and you look for the celebrities you like.

459
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,600
 It's not just ordinary people, it's not just a garbage man.

460
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,560
 It's some drug addict.

461
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,040
 They're like, so tell me how did you get that festering wound?

462
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,600
 They're like, oh, I don't know if I put hot sauce on this wing

463
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,040
 or just juice shot out of my wound, but I'm going to eat it no matter what.

464
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,280
 The way it's set up is that Sean Evans is the host and he'll sit there

465
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:20,880
 and he'll interview these celebrities while they eat progressively hotter

466
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,320
 sauces.

467
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,040
 So you have the 10 wings and the 10 hot sauces

468
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,280
 and they're like, so what was your reason for becoming a celebrity?

469
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,880
 And like Bobby Brown will be there and he'll be like, well, I just want to make music.

470
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,400
 I want to make music for the world.

471
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,120
 Is there a crack?

472
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,000
 Is there any crack here?

473
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,200
 They're like, no, Bobby Brown.

474
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,560
 First off, how did you get in the studio?

475
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,480
 Will Ferrell was supposed to be on this episode.

476
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,040
 I don't even know.

477
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,080
 You were still a celebrity.

478
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,920
 I don't even know if he's still alive actually, but Bobby Brown, no, no, no, no, no.

479
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,200
 There's no crack here, but they'll ask celebrities,

480
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,520
 living celebrities questions and then you eat the wings.

481
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,840
 You eat them and then you're all sweating and they get progressively hotter.

482
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,520
 It's an okay show.

483
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,040
 It is actually super popular.

484
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,840
 I went through and I looked at the celebrities I wanted to.

485
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,920
 Like I think I watched like Shia LaBeouf's one

486
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,600
 and I don't even remember who the other people were that I watched.

487
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,320
 And then I was like, okay, that's done.

488
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,080
 I mean, I get the appeal to it.

489
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,040
 You get to see celebrities kind of in an uncomfortable state and it's very off the cuff.

490
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,960
 It's actually pretty scripted.

491
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,320
 The questions are scripted, not the answers, but you know what I mean?

492
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,160
 Like it does, it's different than say like Jay Leno.

493
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,840
 You're chasing how old are you?

494
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,840
 These people don't even exist anymore.

495
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,320
 Jay Leno burned his face the other day.

496
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,200
 I wonder how he's doing.

497
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:44,320
 But anyways, really what I'm getting at it, it is a completely innocuous, harmless YouTube show.

498
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,960
 I guess there's a game show version of it now.

499
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,600
 Bobby Brown, Bobby Brown keeps running out there like, what did I win?

500
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,320
 Did I win crack?

501
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,840
 They're like, dude, leave, please.

502
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,720
 Totally harmless internet interview show.

503
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:02,800
 People eating little chicken wings, like the stuff you get at Hooters with a little bit of hot sauce.

504
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:08,000
 And the hot sauces do get progressively hotter until eventually like the top one is like 2 million Scoville units.

505
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,320
 But then we take a look at a conspiracy theory that's recently popped up online.

506
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,760
 This person online, they post under the name lighter than a feather.

507
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,960
 They believe, and it's interesting the way they use a lot of Wiggles.

508
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,600
 Wiggles words.

509
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:39,440
 They never specifically say, I believe this, but they go, quote, is it too much to assume the show may not be serving chicken?

510
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,240
 Now he's not saying maybe they're serving veggie bites, because they do.

511
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,800
 They actually, if you're a vegetarian, they'll have you eat some soy compressed into the shape of a chicken.

512
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,320
 But he's not worried about that.

513
00:26:52,320 --> 00:27:01,600
 He's arguing that is it possible, well, you know, again, he doesn't specifically say this.

514
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:08,720
 But he's implying, I think if someone goes, what if they're not eating chicken?

515
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,560
 You're not thinking, well, what is it then?

516
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,440
 Is it roast beef?

517
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,360
 Is it possible that what they're eating is human meat?

518
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,920
 Human meat in the shape of a chicken, with a little chicken bone in it?

519
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,120
 I don't know how they do it, but the elite share is powerful.

520
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,120
 What if it's possible that they're eating humans?

521
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:33,440
 They're eating human meat on the set of hot ones?

522
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:44,720
 Because he goes, what if this is a way for the elite to prove to each other what they are doing?

523
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,320
 Let me actually, I'm trying to make sense of this.

524
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,280
 Let me read you this.

525
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,240
 Let me read you this quote.

526
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,760
 I can't put it any better than he does.

527
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:59,680
 Quote, "Can we guess what the elite might have each other do in order to prove their loyalty

528
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:10,240
 and reserve a hot seat?"

529
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,280
 This is what I'm pausing all wrong here, like Jason who's reading this William Shanner.

530
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:24,160
 "And reserve a hot seat for them in hell. After all, the elite are satanic."

531
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,760
 So I know I paused this.

532
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:33,040
 I know I paused in some really weird places there, but basically this is them.

533
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:37,440
 If I go on hot ones, if I go on this YouTube show that most people don't even know exist,

534
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,000
 I guess now it is a game show, so it's slightly more popular.

535
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:48,160
 But if I am Shia LaBeouf and I want to prove to Will Ferrell that I am also equally satanic,

536
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:54,800
 I will go on hot ones and eat what may be human flesh to prove how satanic I am.

537
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,080
 This is so bizarre to me.

538
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:07,680
 It's fascinating to think that I can watch hot ones while I'm playing Minecraft and

539
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:13,440
 they just get bored of it after I've watched maybe six or seven episodes over the course of a week or two.

540
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:19,280
 Watched in the most generous terms while I was playing video games.

541
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:23,040
 And I could be like, "Oh, that's kind of an interesting insight. It's so funny. I don't

542
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:27,280
 remember a single story any of those celebrities talked about." But I watch it as like, "Okay,

543
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:32,400
 it's disposable YouTube content." Just like this podcast, right? It's just something to have.

544
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,400
 I love it, and I'm sure the people who make hot ones loves their show, but you kind of understand

545
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,200
 that for a lot of people it's just background noise, and that's totally fine.

546
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:47,120
 But it's so weird, right? It's just such a basic show. It's people eating chicken on camera

547
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:52,400
 and answering questions. And because, but this guy, you know, who's free to have his opinion,

548
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,240
 right? This is fairly harmless. It's not hurting anyone. It's not hurting anyone to say Shia LaBeouf

549
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,800
 is uncannable. It's so fascinating to me. You can have someone who can view the same thing millions

550
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:06,080
 of other people do and see something so different. And the reason why is because they're really what

551
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:14,400
 they're seeing is they're seeing famous people eat meat. That's it. They're seeing the same thing

552
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:20,320
 everyone else is seeing, but because they look at the elite, they look at these people, and there's

553
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,640
 something that you always got to remember. They are not special people. They are not extraordinary

554
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:33,120
 people. They simply have extraordinary jobs. I've always found it so interesting when people

555
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:39,840
 look at celebrities as something else, as gods among men, even as demons or devils among men.

556
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,720
 There are people who are like, "No, I hate celebrities. They're the worst. They're just

557
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:49,120
 satanic worshiping people. You're giving them power that they don't have over you."

558
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,840
 I'm sure there are Saint worshiping celebrities. I'm sure there are powerful people. I've said

559
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,880
 this before. I'm sure there are powerful people in the world over who do engage in horrific stuff,

560
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,280
 pizza gate type stuff, cannibalism. I do believe that happens when you reach a certain level of

561
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:08,720
 power. I think it's more out of boredom and more out of seeing what you can get away with.

562
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:15,040
 I do believe that happens. I don't think it's all of them, but I definitely don't think it's none of

563
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:23,360
 them. But I don't think it's Shaquille O'Neal or Will Ferrell or Shia LaBeouf or most of the people

564
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,800
 who have ever been on Hot Ones. I think that when we look at celebrities and we see them as the

565
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:34,480
 elite. I'll tell you right now, dude, in the amount of time you've been listening to this podcast,

566
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:41,600
 Bill Gates has pooped in the toilet. He is a totally ordinary person who has all the same fears

567
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:49,440
 and wants and hidden secrets and weird thoughts in his head that every other person does.

568
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,720
 He's simply famous because he's rich and he helped develop a technology that changed the world.

569
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,960
 And there are a lot of people who are rich and develop technology that changed the world,

570
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,720
 that we have no idea who they are. He made himself the face of the company and then the media went

571
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,640
 along with it. He's a totally biologically normal human person who does everything else everyone

572
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:15,520
 else does. He simply has an extraordinary job. He created an extraordinary or is part of creating

573
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:21,280
 an extraordinary company. That's it. It's such an interesting thing. But when you see a celebrity,

574
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:28,480
 when you see someone that you feel is so different from you on a show eating chicken wings, your

575
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:35,280
 brain goes to, I think they're eating babies. And really the only proof he has of this is

576
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:40,480
 it shouldn't be a shocker. It's none. People said, "Hey, do you have anything to back this up? Do you

577
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:46,640
 have anything to back this up?" And he goes, "If you watch the Will Ferrell episode around the 16

578
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,960
 minute mark, you'll see something." Well, this is what he said. He goes, "If you watch it on the

579
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:57,200
 16 minute marks, you'll notice that they quote, 'Poke fun at it,' the idea of like the rich hiding

580
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,640
 something or the elite hiding something before our eyes. They will quote, 'Poke fun at it around the

581
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:13,600
 16 minute mark if you have eyes to see.'" Will Ferrell's appeared on two episodes of Hot Ones. I watched

582
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:19,600
 them both around that 16 minute mark. One episode I watched the whole thing and then the other one

583
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,080
 was like some Christmas special or some donation thing, whatever it was. I watched for the Will

584
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,920
 Ferrell around a 16 minute mark. I saw him at a different time in the episode. There's nothing

585
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:32,320
 there. There's nothing there. He's not even joking. Like I expected him to be like, "Yeah, you know,

586
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:38,080
 who knows what we eat, right? Or are you making some sort of veiled reference?" Nothing. Nothing.

587
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:45,200
 He's watching the same stuff we're watching and coming up with this conspiracy theory about it,

588
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:51,840
 because he's seeing someone that is so divorced from who he is, from what his reality is, that if

589
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:58,000
 he sees a rich and famous person eating meat, he thinks he's eating babies. And not only is he

590
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,200
 eating babies, it's a worldwide conspiracy. So eventually Justin Bieber can be watching Hot Ones

591
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:09,200
 and be like, "No! How come I don't have my seat in hell? Agent, get the phone, get Lucifer on the

592
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,760
 phone. I want to have that seat in hell." And then he goes on Hot Ones, "I'll eat all the babies right

593
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,200
 now." And the host is like, "Dude, what are you talking about? I just had a newborn baby."

594
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,600
 Justin Bieber is attacking the crib. That's the other thing. We'll wrap it up like this. Like I said,

595
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,600
 I don't think the number is zero of people who engage, of powerful people who engage in sick and

596
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:30,400
 perverted things. I don't think it's all of them by any means. And really what would come down to

597
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:37,040
 this? To pull off, when you're watching a YouTube show and you're watching this guy, this host,

598
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:44,560
 Seth Evans. Ooh, Seth, like Seth, like this demon from Egypt. I think I've cracked the code, good

599
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:50,960
 sir. You have Seth Evans. And then you have a world famous celebrity on there as well. You have

600
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:57,440
 Gordon Ramsay. You have Gordon Ramsay on the show as well. That's all you see. So you could say they're

601
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,760
 eating human babies. Gordon Ramsay is all criticizing. It was like, "I've cooked a lot of babies in my

602
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:07,840
 life and this sir is too dry." You have celebrity and then you have the host. And then you have these

603
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:14,720
 10 pieces of cooked baby in front of you that you're putting the hot sauce on. To have that set up,

604
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,080
 you need to have a dozen people behind the scenes. You have to have not the elite. You would have

605
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:24,720
 people that you only know the name of them because you know them personally in real life or you read

606
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,000
 the credits at the end of each episode. You have to have transportation people and set designers

607
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,760
 and the lighting crew, person working the mic, all of that stuff plus your marketing agent,

608
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,440
 your person talking to YouTube, everyone on the back end. It's more than 12.

609
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:46,720
 And they would all have to be in on it. They would all have to be on it because if the lighting guy

610
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:52,320
 is the only person who's not in on it but the microphone guy sitting there, the makeup team,

611
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,840
 everyone knows that Gordon Ramsay is about to chow down on 10 different baby arms.

612
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,440
 And you're the lighting guy and you don't know. You may start to dawn on you after a while. You

613
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:12,800
 know, it's super weird. I've never seen a box of chicken wings come in to the studio. We're located

614
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:18,640
 right next to a nursery. We're located right next to this daycare center in Utah, this green building.

615
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:25,120
 And then three, there's missing person flyers everywhere. There's missing person flyers everywhere

616
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:28,400
 when it's like, "Hey guys, I'm going to go take my break and I go down to local Starbucks." There's

617
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:34,560
 flyers everywhere for missing children. Now you could go Jason. Jason, maybe the children are

618
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:40,720
 being killed in another country and being shipped over here. Okay, you suck out. We'll accept that

619
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,800
 argument because yeah, you could say that it's just a bunch of orphan children. Jason, wow, this

620
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,080
 got dark really quick. After the losing the limbs, I thought that was bad enough. You're just shipping

621
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:56,640
 over orphan arms from somewhere else to America. So you're not going to see missing person flying

622
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:02,800
 fires everywhere. My key point of evidence would be they're clearly not baby arms that they're eating.

623
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,320
 They're clearly chicken wings. And you would have, now you have to have a whole distribution

624
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:14,320
 network of people moving baby parts across the border and all sorts of things. All for the purpose

625
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:21,600
 of doing some YouTube show where people are eating hot wings. It's such a bizarre take. It's,

626
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:27,120
 I would have to wonder like what type of enjoyment you would find in any media at a certain point

627
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:33,520
 if you thought all media was created by infernal forces. Like how could you enjoy music? How could

628
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:39,920
 you enjoy movies or television if you thought they were all bad guys? I wonder what goes through

629
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:45,760
 his head when any television show comes on or he listens to any music. It's just such a fascinating

630
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:51,600
 view of the world. It really is. I don't have a, my battery's about to die actually. I didn't

631
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,840
 plug in my laptop. I don't have another way to wrap this episode up, but it is my first post COVID

632
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:00,080
