 We've talked before about haunted video games or how open world games are becoming too smart
 This time we're gonna talk about it again
 And I've brought proof
 And then we finish insanity week by taking a look at the story of Mike Madman
 Markham, is it possible that a young man goofing off on his porch with a few scraps of electronics?
 Actually built a working time machine today on Dead Rabbit Radio
 *Movie about to be played*
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. We got a ton of stuff to cover so first off
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command in his own personal Pope Mobile. It's all decked out has the bulletproof dome. I'm testing it
 I'm shooting at it. It's Father Dovey everyone give a round of applause to Father Dovey
 He's waving from his Pope Mobile
 Father Dovey step on out of that step on out of that protection even though I still have a gun aimed at you
 You're gonna be our captain art pilot this episode if you guys can't support the patreon or if you don't have a pimped out car
 Like the Pope that's fine too. Just helps spread the word about the show really really helps out a lot
 And look at this cool fan art Friday. We got something different today for fan art Friday
 I got this from the patreon discord server
 This is from little graze destiny to clan the Dead Rabbit Society
 Isn't that dope look at that little flag that he made oh?
 I want to see what you do is running in a battle with that logo and
 Oddly enough he posted this on discord. I don't know if he was planning this look how many members are currently in the clan
 Spooky 30 if you're driving you're like you're driving and you can't look at the cover art. It's 13
 There's 13 people currently in the clan. He's playing on Xbox
 So if you're into destiny - he's like - and my clan's gonna get over on if you're into destiny - and you're playing on the Xbox
 I think clans are I don't play destiny - I
 Don't get to play anything
 But if you do maybe little gray, maybe you'll be part of this clan with that dope look at that
 That's dope. Those are the battle flags apparently. I don't know if like on they're on the shoulders or something like that
 I don't know anything about destiny - other than that. I'm now in it. So thank you little gray
 Father doobie, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the oars to the dead rabbit robo. We're leaving behind dead rabbit command
 We are headed out to a little coastline in the middle of
 Minecraft splash
 Splash
 I don't have time to play video games anymore. I really really like them, but I just don't have time to play them
 So I'll read a lot of video game websites video game magazines
 Because I like the culture and I watch video game streamers. I watch home record do dead by daylight
 I watch a lot of Minecraft streamers dream bad boy. Halo George not found. I really like fruit berries. I think he's the most clever
 Minecraft player and recently he was taken on alumina who is arguably the best Minecraft player in the world
 Don't let your eyes glaze over yet
 I know this is like your nephew is cornered you at Thanksgiving and it's telling you about Minecraft unlike him
 I have a point this this story actually goes somewhere. I
 Was recently watching this really bizarre video clip
 It's gonna be in the show notes and I know most of you guys can't stop you're doing like driving or working
 To watch a Minecraft stream, but it's queued up. It's in the show notes. You click on it
 It'll take you right to where it's going on. This is a server
 This is a private server the only people in the game are alumina and fruit berries
 Illumina is digging for treasure and he's afraid at any point because this is competitive Minecraft that fruit berries is gonna sneak up behind
 Them and kill him so he's looking around. He's trying to watch the six while he's digging for this treasure
 He turns he sees fruit berries in full enchanted iron armor again
 Do not let your eyes glaze over just yet
 He sees fruit berries in full enchanted iron armor jump into the water behind them and this is gonna be bad news for alumina
 He's not ready to take on full enchanted, but then the video cuts to fruit berries. He's underground
 Mining iron and the camera actually because you can change the camera angle in Minecraft
 We see a view of fruit berries. He has no armor at all. He's wearing his default skin
 Now alumina goes, uh, did you just jump in the water because they're playing like this game basically of hide-and-go-seek and
 Fruit berries is like what no not me and it's kind of coy
 But we as the audience saw someone jump into the water
 Alumina saw someone jump into the water
 This is a private server with two players on it
 There was a third player in full enchanted iron armor
 jumping into the water
 I've watched this video over and over and over again. I've done the slow motion
 I actually was taking screenshots of it and magnifying it this
 Person this character should not be here. It is not fruit berries
 There was a third player there
 There was no third player on the server
 Someone in fully enchanted iron armor
 jumped into the water just as
 alumina turned around and
 It's not like they go at the end of the video. Whoa, who was that was this some sort of spooky thing?
 They talk about it briefly because again, it's like hide-and-go-seek so fruit berries is thinking if alumina is confused. That's totally fine
 But it definitely was not alumina and it definitely wasn't fruit berries who or what was this thing?
 If it was a lark they would have kept bringing it up
 They would have mentioned it in another video
 The that's halfway through the video. They never bring it back up because so much of the game is to do misdirection
 But we see it too
 You might think it's some sort of glitch you might think it's a minor thing and maybe it is maybe it is
 But if you guys are if you guys are familiar with Minecraft at all
 I definitely recommend you checking out the video and see if you can identify it because it is not one of the two players
 It doesn't make sense and this is what creeps me out about games like Minecraft. They are vast infinite worlds
 And when you're walking over the hills, who knows who knows what's going on underneath the ground
 And when you're underground
 Who knows if another lone wanderer is traveling the world above you and you'll never meet them
 They're not supposed to be there though. You don't want to meet them
 So check out this video if you're familiar with Minecraft. I want you to check it out
 You're not familiar with Minecraft. Ask your nephew. They'll talk to you about it for three hours straight and then watch this video
 It is creepy simply because it shouldn't exist. It shouldn't be there in the video
 There's another thing I want to share with you this one this one actually works for our podcast your driver your car
 You're doing your homework like Jason. I can't watch the video right now
 It is queued up and it'll be ready to go when you watch it
 But I do play video games when I get my two week vacation from the show and last vacation
 I played state of decay - that's all I did. I played
 50 60 hours of stated decay - and two weeks that I had off
 I got really used to the zombies and the maps and the AI of the characters the AI of the zombies
 When you really dig into a game for 60 hours over a short period of time like that you really know the game
 But it is an open-world game
 Stuff can always throw you a bizarre curveball, but not like this
 Was on the state of decay - subreddit and it's you
 posted a question
 Does anyone recognize this sound and I'm gonna play it for you right now
 *Birds chirping*
 That is not a sound that any of the zombie characters make in that game
 At all
 The scene is his character at their home base. It's nighttime
 And you hear that bizarre creature sound now
 I want to be playing that sound if I go hey that sound plays all the time. That's the sound of a barrel
 That's the sound of a screamer
 That's that is not a sound that is played at any point in the game state of decay one or two
 What is that
 Now the obvious answer is some sort of unused audio file that got triggered
 No one on the reddit knew what it was no one posted no one recognized the sound on the reddit either
 But it could be some unused audio file that got triggered in this one person's game
 When we have video games when we have these sound even though they're monster characters in state of decay
 It's a zombie open-world game
 Those zombies have recognized the sounds and the reason why they have recognized sounds and recognize silhouettes
 They don't do things that are too unpredictable. So the player knows they're in the area every time a feral shows up a certain sound is given
 Makes it scary, but it also gives the player an edge
 If the feral's may know noise if you're just walking through a department store and then something one of the most powerful zombies was on top
 Of you it wouldn't seem fair
 So you have these recognizable sound this is not a sound in the game
 This is not a sound that I experienced at any point in the 60 hours that I played no one else on the subreddit recognized it in
 Real life you can say this is the sound of a dog. This is the sound of a horse
 Ha ha ha ha and that's true. Those are the stereotypical sounds that a horse makes
 But a dog in an event like a dog on a ferris wheel is not gonna make stereotypical barking noises a
 Dog going down the slide is gonna sound different than a dog on a trampoline. You know what I mean in real life
 There's so many variables that'll change the way we make noises
 But in video games everything is programmed a feral coming at you in the middle of a field
 It makes the same sound as a feral in close combat at your home base. It is programmed that way. What is this noise?
 Was there something else in the darkness?
 surrounding the space
 Making that noise
 What I'm getting at is that what if this sound isn't part of the program the language? It's a new sound
 It's developed this new creature type in the darkness
 You're running this game
 Thousands to tens of thousands to twenty thousand hundreds of thousands of times all these different players starting it playing it
 Stopping it over and over and over again. It's almost like a fluke in evolution in
 This particular game at this particular time. There was a new creature type
 outside the fort
 One the programmers didn't create but it formed itself and
 made that noise and
 Then when the game was shut off this evolutionary fluke
 Was deleted with it as well and when you bring the game back up it is back to its normal programming
 Open-world games are so fascinating to me and I think with the computer processing power we have and the more
 Complicated these games get the more realistic these games get we're going to see more and more of these
 Paranormal events
 Inside our video games. There's also the chance
 There's also the chance that someone is going to come along and explain both of these very very easily to me someone goes
 Oh, no, no, that is this audio file. It was on this form and stuff like that
 That's very possible. It's interesting when we're talking about
 computer-based mysteries
 They are easier to find answers to so I don't like you guys to kind of dig into these and see if you can figure out an
 Answer for them, but as far as I can tell these are both stories. I've sat on for a while. I
 Had I found the state of decay thing weeks ago. It's pretty much right right after my vacation ended
 So I've been waiting to tell these stories, but yeah, and it's you thanks for letting me use the sound clip as well
 Check these out see if you guys can figure out an answer for him because I think it's just terrifying
 And I think we're gonna see more and more paranormal events in open-world games
 People are always talking about San Andreas GTA San Andreas having Bigfoot having these UFOs having these events and they were urban legends
 We may be moving past the point where they're urban legends and becoming reality
 Father do be put down that controller. I'm gonna toss you the keys to the Carpenter copter
 We're gonna leave behind this Minecraft world
 I guess technically went to state of decay - after that, but we're leaving behind both of those
 We are headed out to
 Standbury, Missouri
 Father do be land that Carpenter copter at Standbury, Missouri. It is 1995
 The gin blossoms are pumping out great music third-eye blind is doot-doot doing its way around America
 I think is that too early for both those fans? I say link Pearl Jam was still the lead band doesn't matter
 Doesn't matter we have our flannel shirts tied around our waist our ripped jeans and our long hair
 We're walking through Standbury, Missouri. We're about to meet Mike Madman Markham
 Mike is currently in school. He's getting his degree in electrical studies electrical engineering
 You're like, there's no such thing as electrical studies. He's not a super villain. He's doing something with electricity
 He's also a rogue inventor
 So he's taking his two passions putting them together and he's building all these things at home
 And one of the devices he puts together is what's known as a Jacobs ladder. You've seen them most likely in movies
 There's two metal rods and you have a little bit of electricity
 Go and it goes up the rod you guys have seen this a hundred times in horror movies
 So he builds one of these on his porch
 but what he what he's using to actually make the electricity to power it he's using a
 laser from a CD player and
 He's running this little test and he's just watching the electricity
 And he notices something different he's obviously had experience with Jacobs ladders before
 He notices it's producing a bizarre haze as well
 He said it's like when there's a hot day and you see the sidewalk kind of shimmer from the heat waves
 He's looking at that the Jacobs ladder has formed this little vortex
 He picks up a metal screw
 He throws it through the vortex
 And it would disappear for just a half second a blink in time
 But then it would reappear sitting on the ground a few feet away
 He looks at that and he goes that I must have not seen something right that breaks all the laws of physics
 He picks up another metal screw and he throws it through the vortex disappears for half a second and then reappears on the ground
 He thinks I need to grab my camera
 Go grab a camera to document this get a camcorder, but the CD player at that point catches on fire
 So he had to shut down the whole experiment
 What he thinks he's done is invent a time machine
 He thinks what's happening is he's throwing the metal screws through the vortex and the reason why they're disappearing is they're moving forward in time
 And then teleporting as well to another location. He goes. Okay. This is dope, right? I broke the laws of physics
 I've invented a time machine what I need to do now is make it more powerful
 So he starts looking for ways to increase the voltage of this thing
 I mean he's using a laser from a CD player. He decides he actually needs some transformers some giant electrical transformers
 There are 13 thousand dollars each though. He can't afford to get these
 Transformers so he actually starts scoping out a local power plant and sees
 You know just laying around just laying around six transformers
 They're each about 300 pounds and he realizes well, maybe I'll only need three of them
 But when he's putting his plan together when he goes to the power plant he realizes I'm just gonna steal all six of them
 Let's just take all six of them and let's make this machine as powerful as possible
 He takes these transformers back home sets them up
 He's getting ready to run this experiment. He basically wants to build a bigger version of this thing
 But he doesn't have a lot of money. He doesn't have a lot of resources
 He doesn't have enough money to throw parties
 So one night him and his buddies are over there. They're drinking beer. They're wild and out as the kids said in 1996
 One of his friends is jumping up and down on his couch and goes hey Mike go get me another beer
 Mike goes, oh, you know, okay fine. Just get off my couch, right? He goes into the kitchen
 He gets him a beer and then when he's coming back
 The couch is gone
 Mike's like, where's my couch at?
 They're like, what do you mean? He goes you were just standing on the couch. Where's my couch? Where did my couch go?
 The friends had no idea what he's talking about and Mike goes dude
 She was just jumping up and down on my couch my couch. Well, didn't you guys realize that I didn't have a couch and
 None of his friends know what he's talking about
 Mike thinks this is some sort of practical joke
 But he realizes that one the couch is nowhere in the house to the back door the place where you could really sneak the couch out
 Is blocked by six stolen transformers and three they never find the couch
 He ends up hooking these transformers up to this invention and while he's powering it up
 Of course something goes wrong, but not deadly wrong just kind of funny wrong
 He ends out knocking out the power to the entire neighborhood
 The police are already looking for someone who broke in who stole these transformers the fact that the whole neighborhood went dark
 It's a pretty good idea that the perpetrator is there and Standberry is not a big town to begin with so the police very quickly
 Zone in on Mike madman Markham. They arrest them for theft
 At this point it goes from being a local crime story to major newspapers are picking it up
 The New York Times are at an article about this guy a young man who stalled
 Transformers to build a time machine. There's a goofy slice of life person of interest story
 People loved it and it actually came to the attention of Art Bell host of coast to coast a.m.
 The granddaddy of all paranormal radio podcasts. Everyone will always be in debt. It's a good old art Bell
 Art Bell invites
 Mike to call into the show he wants to talk to him wants to talk to this young kid who claims that he invented a time machine
 And Mike tells the story that I just told you
 And it's funny because it's a small town Mike's arresting officer the cop who caught him that day
 Also called into the art Bell show and was talking to him
 It was a really fun story this young kid claims that he invented a time machine
 Knocks out the power to the city that sounds great. It's a great prologue to any fun movie
 And people really get behind the story of Mike people recognize something of
 Themselves in Mike just a guy who has a dream but doesn't have the resources
 To make that dream happen because he's on the art Bell show people he gives that he's like
 Here's my phone number guys call me. I want to hear all your ideas scientists are calling them and saying this isn't a good idea
 This is why I wouldn't work, but he knows what he saw but people believe in him
 They begin donating money to him. They begin donating equipment to him
 And he's actually able to start working on a larger
 Time machine
 He calls back in about a year later in 1996. He calls back into the art Bell show and
 Tells art listen. I'm about 30 days away from getting this machine working 100%
 It's far bigger. Thank you so much to all the listeners who made this happen. I was able to afford a machine
 That will allow me to walk inside of
 I'm gonna try the time travel thing myself and he said he actually changed it up a bit now
 It works on rotating magnetic fields. I'll be able to time travel myself. He goes. I'm gonna bring my phone with me, too
 So I'll still be able to contact you guys and our bell goes
 Let me know before you go in the machine because I want to be able to document the experience
 I think it would just be a once in a lifetime thing or if the time machine works several times in one lifetime
 Because you just keep going back and forth
 At this point Mike gives out his address as well. Come on down and visit
 Let's chat. He's very open guy
 He's giving out his phone number. He's giving out his address
 He wants to kind of make this a community driven thing
 But around 1997 people start to notice that Mike is
 Gone
 He's not responding to any correspondence. No one can get ahold of him
 No one's heard from him
 He's vanished off the face of the earth
 The story goes that to this day Mike madman Markham is still missing
 but after all of this happened a listener called into the art Bell Show and
 Told this story. He was going through old newspaper accounts and he found a mysterious death in the 1930s in California a
 Man was found crushed in a metal tube
 It was unknown who the man was or how he ended up in this metal tube squished
 But the officers found an odd device
 Laying next to the man
 They didn't know what it was but a modern-day person reading that article would identify what they were describing
 as a cell phone
 Very very interesting story
 About a man who was trying to invent something and I found out about this from a new website
 They might have been around for a while, but they recently come on my radar called Planet Today
 They posted this story. Thanks for posting that I read it and I go very very interesting story
 But I could already taste that there was something missing from the story
 The ending I go that's not the true ending to the story
 It's interesting because we have all this documentation. He was on art Bell twice. There are recordings of him on art Bell
 You have to be a coast-to-coast AM plus member to listen to them
 They've been taking a lot of their stuff off of YouTube lately, but
 He's not a completely made-up figure for the internet. He actually did exist
 We actually have documentation that he's working on this stuff. There's news articles about him working on this stuff
 And then you think well he went missing but that could be anything did he actually go back in time?
 I immediately dismissed the whole 1930s thing and for from a narrative standpoint if you guys are going to fake something
 It would have been more interesting if before
 We even knew about mad Mike Markham if they had said it's weird in the year
 1989 someone called into art Bell and said there was a man squished in a tube and he had a cell phone because if time travels involved
 Why would the call take place after?
 Mike had disappeared so just from a narrative standpoint if you guys are ever trying to pull a hoax
 It's better to add that layer of
 Confusion to it because it makes it more legit, but I
 Didn't buy that at all. It's not that I didn't buy the fact that he built a working time machine. I actually was still
 willing to suspend disbelief for that
 But that was just too clean of an ending so I really started digging into this story
 When you look up Mike Markham online
 You see a lot of forum posts about this and there's a lot of theories about what happened to him because he actually did disappear
 That is true
 Theories are that it was all a hoax to begin with none of this story was real which we know isn't because there was versions of it in the newspaper on
 Coast to coast a m all that the government kidnapped him because they wanted possession of the time machine the government had him killed because he knew too much
 They actually did time travel and he died or he did time travel and he was successful
 There's a kind of the most common theories going around on my journeys looking into the story. I found a website called paranormalists
 There was a poster named Himalayan hermit who said I don't know why this is such a big mystery
 Nexus magazine did a write-up on this guy. They found them. They know what happened to him
 so I had to find this Nexus magazine article I can't post it in the show notes because
 You have to pay for it. It cost me a dollar twenty-two. It was one of the best dollar twenty twos
 I've spent doing the show. I'll put the link in the show notes so you can buy the article
 But we have an answer to this for years for years
 People had not heard of this guy since
 1997 and that is where the story ended and to this day that Planet Today article was brand new. That's how they ended it
 We don't know what happened to him. He was in this tube
 Nexus magazine solved the story of what happened to Mike
 Madman Markham and it's it's awesome. Let's move on
 This article is written by Jason Offit and I'm pretty sure we've covered him before because he's written about shadow people
 He's written about black-eyed children. I tried going through my notes. I couldn't verify it
 But I'm sure we've covered Jason stuff before he wrote this article in Nexus magazine. It was volume 18 number five
 It'll be in the show notes the to buy the article if you'd like to and again, I suggested it's a really well-written article
 Here's what happened
 After that first interview with Art Bell he moved away. He moved to Kansas City, Missouri
 So all of his friends everyone he knew in school. He'd moved away from them
 So right there that would explain one of the reasons why you could disappear so easily if I went missing in my hometown
 Hundreds of people would wonder right away. They wouldn't have no I they would immediately realize that something was off
 But if I moved away
 It could be weeks before it filters back to all my friends and family
 What happened?
 But he moves to Kansas City, Missouri
 The other articles that were saying that he was getting donations to help build his time machine
 This Nexus article goes into great detail. Someone gave him warehouse space
 He got ten thousand dollars in financial
 Contributions and he according to him he was interviewed in this article. He is alive and well
 He got millions of dollars worth of equipment from people
 So he ends up building this massive machine in this warehouse
 It's over 60 feet high
 And he has everything he needs to power it
 He turns it on and he creates this vortex there's this tube and
 It's five feet in diameter and he's up on this cherry picker and he's watching this machine activate
 This is a life-size
 Time travel machine, but he still has to test it
 He's thrown metal screws through it. He's throwing items through it now. He has to test it on
 guinea pigs
 So he begins dropping guinea pigs out of a cherry picker
 into this vortex
 Doesn't hit the ground that just disappears
 Throws another one in doesn't hit the ground it just disappears
 But he doesn't see him walking around the warehouse floor he doesn't know where they're going or when they're going he hopes
 They're not just getting vaporized
 But he does start to notice
 Out in the parking lot around the warehouse
 Guinea pigs guinea pigs walking around the parking lot
 So he's realizing that he's dropping them in and they're appearing outside of the warehouse
 It's successful
 This time machine works
 I would say at this point
 I don't know if you've necessarily invented a time machine, but you may have simply invented a teleportation device either one would be revolutionary
 But he still thinks that when he's throwing these things into the vortex
 That there is a period of time passing and it seems to be relative to the size of the thing that that kind of is what his thought processes
 And he's also thinking sure this works on metal screws in organic stuff. It works on tiny things like guinea pigs
 But what about me and is it painful?
 But he realizes he has to test this on himself
 So one day he gets in that cherry picker
 He goes up
 It's a 60 foot drop from the top of that cherry picker to the warehouse floor and
 He has to fall in a five foot in diameter
 Cylinder and he is thinking okay. I'm not afraid of heights. I love roller coasters. I'm a big adrenaline junkie
 however
 If I panic and I hit the side of this thing
 Who knows what's gonna happen?
 It's now the year 1998 and he's up in this cherry picker. It is time to test the machine on
 himself
 There's no camera set up. There's no friends. There's no observers
 Just a man and even if there was you think someone would try to stop him, but there's a man in this cherry picker and he
 leaps out and
 Falls in towards the vortex of this massive machine that he has built
 There's a bright flash a
 loud crack a
 Thudding sensation that almost knocks him back. He says it's like a flashbang grenade going off right in your face
 It took him a long time to remember what happened Mike is standing in the middle of a farm
 He doesn't know where he's at. He doesn't know how he got here. He doesn't know who he is
 Mike is standing in this farm with no memory whatsoever
 He just kind of looks around
 Just can't figure it out
 He's in Fairfield, Ohio the year is
 2000
 He is two years later and hundreds of miles away from where he started
 Mike's time travel machine is successful
 But he doesn't know it. He doesn't even know who he is
 And because he has no memory of anything he ends up making his way into the city of Cincinnati
 Barely scraping by he ends up staying at a homeless shelter
 Taking on odd jobs trying to make ends meet and trying to remember who he is
 And he starts piecing things together over time. He begins to remember who he is
 He remembers a warehouse in Kansas City. He remembers what he was working on now two years have passed
 Since he jumped out of that cherry picker. He makes his way back to Kansas City, Missouri. The warehouse is empty
 He said millions of dollars of equipment were gone all of his logbooks all of his notes
 gone
 He says even without the notes I could rebuild the machine, but you don't understand this machine
 Costs I wouldn't have been able to do it without all the generous donations of this equipment and
 I don't remember who gave it to me. I cannot for the life of me remember who donated
 This equipment it wasn't all from one person several people were sending stuff over and I can't remember who it was his memory never fully
 returned
 He went back to Ohio where he continued to work odd jobs just kind of scrape by he would also Google himself
 Look up articles and he said one of the funniest things that he saw regarding this story
 Was that some man was found dead in California crushed in a metal tube with a cell phone? He goes that wasn't me
 I don't know who that was
 But it wasn't me
 When this article was written in 2011 Mike was alive and well continuing to work jobs in Ohio scraping by
 And he would love to rebuild this machine sometime, but he is just worried on paying rent and keeping himself fed
 And he ends the article by saying listen, I would love to rebuild this machine. I remember how to do it
 But right now I'm just struggling to pay rent keep food on the table
 It's a lofty dream
 Maybe someday I'll be able to rebuild it but for now I have more pressing matters in the present day to deal with
 Then to look into the future and see
 What may be you didn't say that eloquently you didn't say that eloquently, but he said that
 That is the whole story of Mike madman Markham
 And
 It sucks that this version isn't out there
 I think part of the reason why it's not is because of the paywall
 Everything about that ending is better than the time travel one it turns out to not be a hoax
 Like if we trust him out his word right he totally made up this last version of the story
 He's the only witness to any of it, but the one where he goes back in time and ends up in the crushed tube at the cell phone
 It doesn't really I guess on a sci-fi level it kind of makes sense
 But this version's better isn't this version one because it's a definitive answer
 It's from the man himself telling the story and it still has the elements of sci-fi it still works and all that stuff
 I think it's a better ending. I still have some questions about it though
 Why didn't he just call art bell again?
 That's what I don't understand when I was reading the story. I thought well, okay, this is interesting
 It's very fascinating story. Thanks for sharing it Mike
 But how come you didn't call art bell when you came back two years later?
 Even if it had been two years later imagine like the melee airheart showed back up and she's like oh
 They don't want to hear about me sure I've been gone for a hundred years and I like just as good as the day I left
 But I don't want to bug anybody like he should he should call art bell or if he's still alive now
 This article is from 2011 he was 22 back in 96, so he's gonna be that much older than me
 Why doesn't he contact coast to coast a and why doesn't he contact me actually?
 Well, he doesn't know I exist yet. Maybe he'll Google this
 But I mean he could contact these people now and clear this up. It could just be that he's kind of over it
 It could be that there's a little bit more to the story that we're not we don't know about
 Who knows but that was my thing when I was reading the story after I got done
 I go he could even though he doesn't remember the people who donated the equipment to him fair. That's fair enough
 He knows art bell
 And because he references them several times in the article
 So why doesn't he call him up again?
 But that is a personal decision that Mike is making and it could just be that he does want to build the machine again
 But all the attention may have just been a little too much who knows
 But for me this was a perfect way to wrap up insanity week because we've talked about a lot of insane stories and insane people
 This week. This is insanity that becomes
 Creativity this is that type of insanity that borders on the line of world-changing genius
 It takes an insane man to jump out of a cherry picker
 60 feet off the ground
 believing they will be safe and sound in a
 Time machine that they invented out of donated parts
 But that's the type of insanity that helps people
 That's the type of insanity that can actually change things
 So I wanted to end insanity week on a high note
 Wanted to cover someone who yes, we buy all definition of the word would say they were insane
 But this is that type of insanity that the world needs that drives the world forward
 But you're also probably wondering what happened to all the parts all the logs all the notes that were in that warehouse
 Well, someone cleared it out. It's possible the person who was leasing the warehouse hadn't heard from Mike and
 Stopped paying the lease and it was all taken off to the city dump
 Or it's possible that a government agency was observing Mike's progress
 They watched him jump into the portal and they realized this
 thing worked
 So with his notes they carefully disassembled this device and took possession of it
 It's possible that they rebuilt it, but they needed to test it for themselves a
 Government agent got in that cherry picker
 Sweat dripping from his brow
 They all saw that Mike disappeared into the vortex, but they don't know what happened
 Was it successful or he was he vaporized into a billion atoms
 this agent jumps and
 As he's falling towards the vortex he panics he hits the side of the metal tube and
 Both him and the cylinder that holds the vortex
 Disappears in an instant
 The government agents carefully disassembled the machine and lock it away
 Maybe they can figure out its secrets some other time, but for now
 It's too dangerous to even test
 And what happened to that special agent?
 well in the
 1930s
 There was a crushed cylinder with a man inside of it
 Maybe that wasn't Mike
 Maybe it was one of the men
 Who stole his time machine?
