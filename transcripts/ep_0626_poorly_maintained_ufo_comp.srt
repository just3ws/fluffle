1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 What if I could promise you your very own sea monster?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,400
 And then we go on a road trip with the Falcon family.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,720
 As they're driving through Georgia one night, they see a UFO flying behind them.

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:20,000
 After they are abducted, they realize this UFO has its own problems.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Today on Dead Rapper 8.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 I'm going to be a little psychic here.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 I'm going to see into the past or the future.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 I don't know that after yesterday's episode you ate tacos.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 After yesterday's episode you had tacos or at least taco flavored something.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Maybe you just got them back in a taco seasoning and poured it into your mouth.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Delicious episode yesterday.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 The first story.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 The second story is pretty gruesome.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 And speaking of delicious, let's give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreon supporters,

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Mikael Kaui.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Mikael Kaui and we give a round of applause to him.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 He is on a plate.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 We imagine him as a giant cartoon taco with eyes.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 He's like, "Hey, what are you guys looking at?"

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 We're so hungry for tacos.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Everyone shake your head.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Quit imagining Mikael as a taco, as a delicious, scrumptious taco.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 And Mikael, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon or if you guys aren't edible, that's fine.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Our army hammer would disagree, but that's fine too.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Just help spread the word about the show.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Really, really helps out a lot.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 We have a merch store and we have flyers you can print out in the show notes.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 That will allow you to post them up all over town.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Mikael, I'm going to toss you the oars to the Dead Rabbit Robo.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 We are going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 And we are headed out to Sweden.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Splash oars in the water.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Splash oars in the water.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 I forgot how I do that sound effect, so that was kind of it, right?

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 We're rowing all the way out to Sweden.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Very long trip. We might eat you. We might eat you, Mikael.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 I didn't bring any food.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 This story is actually, in a way, a request from Alexander,

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 one of the Patreon supporters.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 He greets us there. He's like, "Hey guys, what's up?"

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 "Where'd Mikael go?"

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 We're like, "Burp."

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 We're getting off the Dead Rabbit Robo.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Mikael is reincarnated. He's back to us now.

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Alexander emailed me to recently let me know that in Oribro, Sweden,

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 a lake beast was spotted.

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 A giant creature was filmed in a lake.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Now, it was actually filmed, and it wasn't like a blurry image way off.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 It was like super close up. It was actually so close up,

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 you couldn't tell how big it was, which should actually kind of be a red flag.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 But it's a video of this massive thing.

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 I mean, it had to be like six, seven feet long swimming next to a boat.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Now, it's not like some massive monster, like,

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 kraken creature destroying boats and things like that, which would be cool.

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 I mean, not if you're on the boat, not if you're filming it.

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Till my wife I love her, as the tentacle crushes the phone, I'm like, "Yeah, now this is a story."

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 It actually turned out like it is sizable, and they're not normally in this lake,

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 but it was most likely a giant eel.

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 And there are eels in Europe. The European conger eel gets up to seven feet long.

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 So that's what it was. It really wasn't a sea--

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 I mean, I guess it was a sea beast if you were a trout, or you were a little.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 You had like a little sewing needle for sword and a little button for a shield.

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 It's a pretty sizable beast, but for us it's just maybe something delicious.

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 You chop up and put in your taco.

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 But while I was researching this-- thanks, Alexander, for sending that over--

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 I started looking at Swedish sea monsters.

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Swedish sea monsters. I have a love-hate relationship with sea monsters, mostly hate.

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 I find them quite boring, because it's basically just a lump.

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 At least bigfoot, like, talks, and he has psychic powers, and sometimes he's on UFOs,

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 sometimes he's wearing clothes. Sea monsters do none of those things.

76
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 I've never seen one in jeans. Usually just a lump in the water.

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 But I'll research them. I still research them from time to time, hoping I will find something.

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 I did that cool episode about a year ago about the one in Nevada that was, like, flying around.

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 It was a sea monster that could fly, and I think it breathed fire.

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 It was killing sheep and some basket dude, like, punched it in the face.

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 I'll see if I can find that episode better in the show notes.

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 That's a sea monster. But anyway, so I'm kind of looking around at Swedish sea monsters.

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 And I found another one that is just kind of a lump in the water, but this one has an interesting twist.

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 Mikael, fire up that did rabble robo. Once again, we're going to Jamptland in Sweden.

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Specifically, we're going to Lake Storzen.

86
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 And in Lake Storzen, there is the Storzjojurit, which literally means "Great Lake Monk."

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 It doesn't literally mean that, but in a sense it means that.

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 It metaphorically means that. Great lake monster.

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 We'll call her Storzy, because a lot of people do call her Storzy like Nessie for the Loch Ness monster.

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 People have claimed to see it for a long time.

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 Oh no, look at that bump in the water. That's Storzy.

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 And then you just go about your day because you just saw a weird bump.

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 But this one does have that twist I was talking about.

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 There's an island in the middle of Lake Storzen. It's called Frosen.

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 And on the island is this big slab of rock with all these carvings in it.

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Now they believe it was carved between 1030 AD and 1050 AD.

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 And it tells the story about a bridge being built in the area and how the area was undergoing Christianization.

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 It talks about, so this dude showed up and everything's changing and we're building this bridge.

99
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 And we're moving into a Christian era. It's kind of like a historical marker.

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 You can tell that it's been broken in half as well. It's been repaired.

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 The photo of it does show that it's repaired, but at some point it was snapped in half.

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Now the story it tells on the runestone is, like I said, it's basically a historical marker.

103
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 But surrounding the runestone, illustrating the edges of the runestone, is the image of a giant sea monster.

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 It literally takes up the entire edge of the stone. It encircles the message.

105
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 In 1635 there was a manuscript printed. And this is the first time there's a written record of a lake monster in that lake.

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 This is the first time we have a historical record of people saying there was a monster in this lake.

107
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 And they tell this story that that runestone was actually forged by Kattel Runski.

108
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 He was basically a Prometheus figure, but instead of bringing down fire he brought down runes.

109
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 He brought down the written language from Odin.

110
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 He was the one who actually made this stone and carved this in.

111
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 And he carved a magical spell into the stone itself.

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 And in 1635 they're telling the story and they said, "There is a monster in the lake."

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 And the stone slab, the runestone, keeps it at bay.

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 However, once the stone was broken and chaos broke loose,

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 giant monster is swimming around. I mean this thing is massive. This thing is super huge.

116
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 And people can't row across the lake, it's just like punching boats.

117
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 It's evolving hands and punching them, ripping them in half.

118
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 People couldn't figure out how to have any commerce in the area.

119
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 This giant dude is showing up, he's loitering outside of the store.

120
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 People don't want to go to the store because he looks like a hoodlum, he's smoking a little cigarette, a little leather jacket.

121
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 They come to the conclusion that the only way to recapture the sea monster is to repair the stone.

122
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 So that's what they do and the creature is once again put into a slumbering state.

123
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 It's an interesting story and it was one that seems to have been lost to history.

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Like you had this written back in 1635 but that wasn't an ongoing legend because we know who carved the stone.

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 There's actually like historical documents of who actually, in the stone itself it says who carved it.

126
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 It doesn't mention Ruteli, the rune master.

127
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 It seems like historians have gone back and found this manuscript.

128
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 So it's not like it was made up after the fact, it's not like someone in 2017 looked at the broken slab and told their little brother,

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 "Hey, you know what happens if you break it?" The sea monster pops up.

130
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 There might have been a combination of it breaking and then really bad weather events, a really, really harsh winter.

131
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 And that made the combination and they're like, "When should we repair it?"

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 They're like, "Repair it in spring, good sir!"

133
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Or it could be that all of these sightings that they have nowadays of a sea monster are just tricks of the eye.

134
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Or eels.

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Because the real sea monster is slumbering.

136
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 That that rune was put there and it was etched with the snake.

137
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Or maybe the rune was put there with the original writing and the rune master comes down and he basically banksy.

138
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 He goes, "Ah, nah, I'm gonna spice this one up."

139
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 But the rune stone actually does prevent the true sea monster from coming out.

140
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Everything else that they see nowadays is a floating log or an eel or a bored eye.

141
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 But if you went to where this rune stone is at, they've moved it since,

142
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 because I guess they've built a bridge in the area, but I believe it's still on the island.

143
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 It's still currently there, it's somewhere around there.

144
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 So you might want to grab a map before you try this next step.

145
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 If you go there and you break it, you smash this thousand year old monument,

146
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 you might actually be able to call forth a lake monster.

147
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 You know, I'm not advising you going around and breaking ancient monuments.

148
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 But if breaking that ancient monument would prove that sea monsters are real, would you do it?

149
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 I would. I would totally destroy a mammoth skull if it meant that a ghost mammoth would show up on CNN.

150
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 He's all just walking through the control room, knocking over cameraman.

151
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 I believe a lot of things I would destroy that would make Bigfoot appear or like a UFO to just show up.

152
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 And they're like, "Hey dude, why did you destroy that pyramid man? We built that!"

153
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 I would probably kick over a slab of rock, because they repaired it once.

154
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 You can repair it back in 1635, I'm sure we can repair it nowadays.

155
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 "Mackayle, I'm going to toss you the keys to the carbonicopter. We are leaving behind Sweden.

156
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 We got a tow line, we got a cable wrapped around the rune stone.

157
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Go, go, go, go, go!" As the carbonicopter is taking off, it cheers the rune stone right in half.

158
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 We see the water's bubble.

159
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 We see Alexander running as the sea monster emerges.

160
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 "Hey, bye Alexander! Thanks for supporting the show!"

161
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 We are going to head on out to Georgia in the United States, not the other place.

162
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 [Making a noise]

163
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 I don't think we've ever covered a story in Georgia.

164
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 I think it's too dangerous for cryptids and ghosts to hang out in the Georgia over in Eastern Europe.

165
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Ghosts are like, "No way!"

166
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 As we're flying out there, I want to do Dead Rabbit Recommends.

167
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 I can't believe I haven't done this Dead Rabbit Recommends yet, and I think it's great, because it plays into the 90 Days Challenge.

168
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 It's just a great--it's one of my favorite documentaries.

169
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 I have two of my favorite documentaries I've watched multiple times.

170
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 It's called Overnight.

171
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 It's the story of the making of the movie Boondock Saints.

172
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 And you're like, "What? That's weird. That's a weird choice for one of your favorite documentaries."

173
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 It might be one of my favorite films.

174
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 I actually didn't even like Boondock Saints that much.

175
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 I remember I watched it with Jenny Stoltz, and we are both bored.

176
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 We heard all of this hype about Boondock Saints.

177
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 We're watching it, and I was like, "Dude, are you into this?"

178
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 And she's like, "Mmm-mm-mm."

179
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Actually, that makes it sound like she was. She's like, "Mmm-mm-mm."

180
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 So I'm patching. Flannery's yummy.

181
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 No, we're watching. I was like, "What's the hype? What's the hype?"

182
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 But Overnight is the story of the making of Boondock Saints.

183
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 So I'm telling that story, because even if you don't like Boondock Saints, you should watch this movie.

184
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Troy Duffy was a man who worked at a bar who gets a movie contract.

185
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 He wrote a spec script called Boondock Saints, and he all of a sudden, overnight,

186
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 goes from being a bartender to being the toast of Hollywood.

187
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 And then a self-made destruction all the way down.

188
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 It's a fascinating look at ego and talent and drive and luck and self-sabotage.

189
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 And it's always that inverse side of success.

190
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 It's fascinating. How often do you get to watch somebody rise and fall in real time,

191
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 partially because of their own making and partially because of external influences?

192
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Really, really, really good documentary.

193
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 The people who were making the documentary were just two of his friends,

194
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 who said, "Hey, while you're making that movie, we'll make a movie about you making that movie."

195
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 And also it's interesting behind the scenes about making a movie.

196
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 And what's so funny, I remember watching it, I've seen it multiple times,

197
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 there is a villain in the background of the movie that Troy Duffy is like,

198
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 "Oh, this guy is such a jerk, he's sabotaging the project, he doesn't know who he's messing with.

199
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 I'll take him down, I'll take him down."

200
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 People are like, "Dude, I don't think he's that bad."

201
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 And I remember watching the documentary and I kept rolling my eyes.

202
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 I'm like, "Dude, he's not, dude, you're like totally making this guy out to be some sort of cartoon villain.

203
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 Troy, you're losing control of your project and you're blaming this.

204
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 He's not doing anything wrong."

205
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 The villain's name is Harvey Weinstein.

206
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 The whole movie, the whole movie, Troy Duffy, knows Harvey Weinstein is a total piece of human garbage.

207
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 But it's framed in such a way that you're like, "What? Uncle Harvey?"

208
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Which I think they might even call him at some point in the movie.

209
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 "Harvey, he's helping you out, Troy."

210
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Fascinating movie because again in hindsight, that guy is a piece of garbage.

211
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 So it makes you look at the movie differently than when I watched it as well.

212
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 When you're like, "What?" He was like, "He's helped Quentin Tarantino out.

213
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 He's helped all of these filmmakers out. It must be you, Troy."

214
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 But part of it was him.

215
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 It's a very fascinating look at the creative process, a self-destruction of ego and talent combining.

216
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 You need both of them to succeed, but sometimes it's just such a volatile mixture.

217
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Check it out overnight. It's a great documentary.

218
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 I'll put it in the show notes.

219
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 I'm sure it's available for streaming all over the place.

220
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 And it's one of those things when we're doing that 90 days to a better you, we also want to look at the dark side of success.

221
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 And I watch movies like that to avoid those pitfalls, to keep my ego in check.

222
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 So I do recommend that. Let's go ahead.

223
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Mikhail, we are leaving behind the Did Rev Recommends video store and we are headed out to Georgia.

224
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 The year is 1968.

225
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Now the Carbonercopter is in stealth mode.

226
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 We're following a bunch of cars driving down this road in Georgia.

227
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 I believe it's nighttime.

228
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 And this is where we run into the first roadblock with this story.

229
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 There's not a lot of specifics with this story.

230
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Now I got this story from UFOinsight.com, which is a great website.

231
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 I used to go to them all the time. This is the first time returning to them in a while.

232
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 This is written by Marcus Loth.

233
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 We've covered stories written by Marcus as well.

234
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 They seem to be pretty good as far as authentic stories or as far as we can tell authentic stories.

235
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 The person themselves may be lying, but it doesn't seem like it's a bunch of creepypasta.

236
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 This one's interesting because we don't have a lot of initial information.

237
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 We don't know the exact location. We don't know the exact date.

238
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 We have 1968. We don't even know if it's taking place at day or night.

239
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 These things make big differences or little differences, really, depending on the narrative.

240
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 This one, we really only have the name of one person involved in the story.

241
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 A young boy named Celestian Falcon. He's four.

242
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 So, she was suspicious, right?

243
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 The name, I could not verify this person exists.

244
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 Celestian apparently is a character in Greyhawk and some D&D thing.

245
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Four years old is really young to be the only witness of a UFO story.

246
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 I'm already second guessing this.

247
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 When I looked back over and saw the age, I was like, "Really? You're about to tell a story from a four-year-old's point of view?"

248
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Well, yes, because I do think it's an interesting story, but we're missing a bunch of information in the beginning.

249
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 But we will go ahead and continue here.

250
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Celestian Falcon and his family are driving down this road.

251
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 And there's other cars on the road. It's not like whether it's day or night.

252
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 There's a bunch of other cars on the road. And as they're driving down this road...

253
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 [Mumble]

254
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 In broad daylight or in broad nightlight,

255
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 there is a UFO trailing the Falcon car.

256
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 It's only about 200 yards away, so fairly close.

257
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 There's another car behind the Falcon car, but Celestian gets the impression that it's their car that's being followed.

258
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 Other cars are seeing this and they are speeding away.

259
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 Traffic coming towards the UFO, Celestian says he can actually see cars bust U-turns in the middle of the road and head off in other directions.

260
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 People are seeing this UFO and scattering from the area.

261
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 The only two cars that can't get away are the two cars that are being trailed by the UFO.

262
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 Celestian's car and the car behind them.

263
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 He sees the car behind them pull over to the side of the road.

264
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 And at that point, Celestian's car also stops.

265
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 [Mumble]

266
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Celestian realizes his dad kind of fiddling with the steering wheel and trying to hit the gas.

267
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 He's like, "It won't work, honey. It won't work."

268
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 And also, that's when Celestian realizes...

269
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 He left a detail out. Celestian realizes his dad is in the military.

270
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 His dad turns and he goes, "Honey, I'm in the military. I should totally know how to work a car."

271
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 But it won't work. So Celestian's like, "Okay, that is another detail. My dad works for the military."

272
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 He's now floating over the car that's behind them.

273
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 And Celestian's dad doesn't have any time for this. He's a military man.

274
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 He actually pulls out a gun, tells his wife, "Wait here, honey."

275
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 Which I'm sure was her totally her idea to begin with.

276
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 He gets out of the car and at that point, the UFO begins to move towards Celestian's car.

277
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 By the dad getting out with a weapon, he actually drew attention to them.

278
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 The dad jumps back in the car.

279
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 He gets on his dirt bike and leaves the family.

280
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 "Bye, guys!"

281
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 He's trying to start the car. It's what that sound effect is supposed to be.

282
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 It won't start.

283
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Celestian looks out the back window and he sees in the car behind them

284
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 a young man jump out of the car, run to the passenger side, and get a young woman out.

285
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 He then begins to try to throw her in the trunk to hide her from these aliens

286
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 in a reversed, intergalactic space and time.

287
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 They apparently can't see through the trunk of a Ford Mustang.

288
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 As he's trying to throw this woman into the trunk,

289
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 [imitates drum sounds]

290
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 Celestian sees five gray aliens standing around this young man.

291
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 He reaches into the trunk and pulls out a crowbar and begins to swing it at one of the grays.

292
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 But the grays pull out a shock stick.

293
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 [imitates shock stick sound]

294
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 There's a whole bunch of sound effects in this one.

295
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 And the man freezes in place.

296
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 The aliens throw silver blankets over the man and they drag the woman out of the trunk.

297
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 And then the man and the woman float up into the UFO above them.

298
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Celestian says then he remembers a pinkish light enveloped the entire car.

299
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 He's blinded by this bright light.

300
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 As he's sitting in the light itself, he hears the car door open.

301
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 [imitates car door opening sound]

302
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 And a hand reach out of the light and grab him.

303
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Next thing that Celestian says is I appeared in a weird room

304
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 and I saw my mom and dad in the corner of this room.

305
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 And my mom's like, "My son, my son!"

306
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 And there's alien guards standing in front of the mom pushing her back.

307
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 Get back, get back.

308
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 A reptilian shows up.

309
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 [imitates reptilian sound]

310
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 Hi, Celestian.

311
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 That's the only time I'll do that.

312
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 But he makes the snake noise.

313
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 He shows up and he takes Celestian out of that room

314
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 and begins to give him a tour of the UFO.

315
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 He first takes him to--this should always be your first stop on every tour.

316
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 If you ever go to a museum, you're like, "May I see this room first?"

317
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 He takes Celestian into a room and it's full of jars of human fetuses.

318
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 And he's like, "What? This is kind of weird."

319
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 You know, we've been abducted by UFO. It's kind of weird, too.

320
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 At that point, he watches his mom and his dad brought into the fetus room.

321
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 The fetus foie, as you may say.

322
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 And then his mom is strapped down to a table and she's screaming at this point.

323
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 She's totally flipping out.

324
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 And an alien injects her with something and she immediately just goes limp.

325
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 And the reptilian grabs Celestian's arm and leads him out of the room.

326
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 The next room seemed to be a control room and there was like gray aliens and reptilians just kind of hitting buttons.

327
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 [imitates button sound]

328
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 Which is kind of a relief.

329
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 You just saw your mom get attacked in a room full of human fetuses.

330
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 And now she's basically on the bridge of a starship.

331
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 Nothing spooky here, but then all of a sudden he hears a woman screaming coming from another room.

332
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 You'll learn very quickly in this story that although aliens have been able to traverse the galaxy or the known universe,

333
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 they have really, really bad soundproofing in their UFOs.

334
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 Because he's sitting in the control room and in another room he hears a woman screaming.

335
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 It's not his mom screaming.

336
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 It's a woman going "Noooooo!" "Ahhhh!" Screaming.

337
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 And then he says, "What was actually more chilling than that is a man screaming."

338
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Which, I've talked about this on the show before, too. That's much scarier.

339
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 When you hear a man let out a blood curdling scream, it's terrifying.

340
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 You hear women do it all the time in horror movies or when someone's like pinching them.

341
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 Like, I hear it all the time like you're at parks or something.

342
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Apparently there's a big pinching bandit in Tam.

343
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 But you know what I mean? Like, girls screaming, it's super common.

344
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 But when a man screams, it's so rare in the culture or even it's blood curdling.

345
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 It's so scary if you've ever heard a man scream in real life.

346
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 He hears this man screaming from in the other room, which really terrifies Celestian.

347
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 And he hears the man go "Help us! Help us! We're being attacked by monsters!"

348
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 And then he hears what sounds like a fight breakout in the room next to him.

349
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 At this point all the aliens at the control panels are also looking to see like,

350
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 "What is going on in that room?" and just looking at the wall.

351
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 And they hear like the sounds of a fist fight.

352
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 At that point, a door opens up and two aliens run out of the room and shut the door.

353
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 And then they hit a button, "WOWER! WOWER! WOWER!"

354
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 UFO alarm goes off and a bunch of aliens come from yet another room

355
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 and they all go into that room and we can presume beat the crap out of this person who is resisting.

356
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 Celestian's like, "What is going on?"

357
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 So apparently this guy did get a couple of good punches in on these aliens.

358
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 They had to go get back up.

359
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 But the room goes quiet and he's sitting in the control room

360
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 and then all of a sudden another person enters the control room.

361
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 Celestian turns around and this guy is a Spaniard.

362
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 This is a Spanish dude in a space suit.

363
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 He walks on board and he's like, "How's everything going? You guys good?"

364
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 "Uh-huh. Okay, what's this little kid doing here? What's this little four-year-old kid doing?"

365
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 I'll talk about that later.

366
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 This Spanish guy shows up in a space suit with a triangular shaped hat.

367
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 You're like, "Jesus, is this just some kid's dream? Is this some four-year-old dream?"

368
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Hold on.

369
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 So the Spaceman, the Spanish Spaceman who has a triangle shaped hat

370
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 and a space suit on with patches.

371
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 Not like Raggedy Ann. He's like, "I can't afford a real space suit."

372
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 You know, like military patches.

373
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 He shows up and he's like, "How was the mission progressing?"

374
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 See, Celestian's hearing all this stuff telepathically.

375
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 The guy getting beat up, the human beating of the aliens.

376
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 He heard that with his ears, but all the language stuff, he's hearing telepathically.

377
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 The Spanish dude shows up and he's like, "How are the... How's the mission progressing?"

378
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 And he begins to hear something of that.

379
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 A device was broken in half and fell out of a UFO.

380
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 This is a really, really poorly maintained UFO.

381
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Soundproofing doesn't work.

382
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 Stuff falls off.

383
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 Apparently, a device fell out of the UFO, broke in half and fell into a Georgia swamp.

384
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 And that's why they're here.

385
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 They've already retrieved half of it.

386
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 Now they have to retrieve the other half.

387
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 They're just abducting these people.

388
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 You know why not? Because we're already here, right?

389
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 "How was the sweep come with the swamp?" the Spaniard says.

390
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Say that three times fast.

391
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 And the gray aliens are like, "We're still looking for it, sir."

392
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 The gray aliens, "We're still looking for it, sir. Look faster!"

393
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 "We have to find that device before the Joes, before G.I. Joe catches up to us."

394
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 Apparently.

395
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 So he has then led, once he's gotten the plot, once he got the exposition,

396
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 Celestine has led out of the control room.

397
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 And he's walking down this corridor and the two aliens are talking to each other,

398
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 and they're talking telepathically, but he can hear them.

399
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 And the aliens are like, "Dude, did you hear what happened in cell block A?"

400
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 "Oh yeah, that was nuts."

401
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 "But that's not all."

402
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 And the other alien's like, "What are you talking about?"

403
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 He's like, "Apparently."

404
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 "Don't tell anyone. Don't tell anyone."

405
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 "Shh, just between you and me and everyone else who has a sentient brain, you can pick up telepathic thoughts."

406
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 "The humans are uprising. The humans are fighting back."

407
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 "All the human captives we have on this ship, more than the protagonists have been introduced to already,

408
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 are fighting back. They've learned our weakness."

409
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 "Getting punched in the face. They've learned the galactic weakness is just forming a fist and punching us."

410
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 And the other alien's like, "Oh my God, our plans of conquering are done. We can't fight back against the fist."

411
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 At this point, Celestine's being led down this hallway, he's looking through doorways.

412
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 He looks down one doorway and he actually sees the guy who had been in the car behind them, hooked up to all these tubes and devices laying on a table motionless.

413
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 Then all of a sudden he hears another message in his head from the aliens.

414
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 "Oh no, things are going really bad."

415
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 "Don't know if they're using both fists now."

416
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 "No, no, no, worse, worse."

417
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 "We're actually picking up that someone is on their way."

418
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 And at that point Celestine says an image appeared on a wall of two US fighter jets

419
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 and the impression he got was these jets were headed towards this UFO.

420
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 That impression was verified when the aliens talking telepathically said those aircraft had been scrambled, they're on their way.

421
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 They'll be here in 12 minutes and if we're found here, they're gonna blow us up.

422
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 And the ship's already falling apart. The ship really doesn't have a chance in battle against these guys.

423
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 At that point Celestine says aliens are just running down the hallway.

424
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 There's alarms going off, everyone's freaking out, they don't know what to do.

425
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 A bunch of them have big bruises, big black eyes.

426
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 This mission is not going well. They wanted to find half of a box, they ended up getting boxed, and now a bunch of jets are coming.

427
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 Celestine says then, as all this is going on, he looks into another room and he sees a bunch of grey aliens sitting there with black hoods on.

428
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 Totally calm, they're not running around, they're not freaking out, they haven't been punched yet.

429
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 But he said the impression that he got was these were the oldest of the old. These aliens were far, far more advanced than the other greys on the ship.

430
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 He also got a sense of arrogance, absolute arrogance from them.

431
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 That they seem not only above humanity, but above everything. They're just sitting in a room.

432
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 At that point Celestine is taken, they're like get away, get away from the old people room, that's our rest home.

433
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 Get away from there. They take him, they strap him down to a metal table.

434
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 And as they're prepping all this stuff, they got a needle ready, he still is hearing them talk telepathically and they go, "You doing it Barry? You got it?"

435
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 And Barry's like, "Yes, three, two, one."

436
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 And then everyone stops panicking, the alarm goes off, and the grey alien standing there with the hypodermic needle is getting ready to inject Celestine.

437
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 And he hears that the US fighter jets were successfully evaded.

438
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 All the UFO did was go 40 minutes back in time before they were discovered.

439
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 He is injected and he blacks out.

440
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 Celestine wakes up and he still strapped, he thought he was going to wake up in bed, he thought he was going to wake him in bed.

441
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 He wakes up, he's strapped to this metal table still, and the alien, he feels like all the procedures that they were going to do on him have been done.

442
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 He feels a little bit at ease. The aliens are still keeping him there.

443
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 And then appearing in the room is a man. He's not a Spanish man, he's just a dude, another human.

444
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 And the aliens kind of are startled by this man.

445
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 And Celestine says that this man, for lack of a better term, was angelic.

446
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 Maybe a faint glow, maybe a cartoon halo and a little harp and wings.

447
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 Celestine had the idea that this man was angelic and this human is standing there and he goes, "You gotta put him back.

448
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 You alien reptilian dudes, you gotta put him back on earth. Him and his whole family.

449
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 That boy is a child of God."

450
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 And the reptilian looks at this dude and goes, "I don't know who you are or where you came from.

451
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 I'm actually curious about both those things, but yeah, we're gonna put him back. We're almost done here."

452
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 And at that point the angelic figure gets mad and he says, "You need to put him back now or you will all be destroyed."

453
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 And then he disappears.

454
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 Now Celestine's laying there on the table and he's thinking, "Did I just imagine that?

455
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Like everything else was real? The fetus foyer, the fighting aliens, all that stuff is real."

456
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 But that seemed out of place even for a UFO.

457
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 An angel showed up? He thinks it might just be his imagination and then one of the reptilians looks at one of the other scientists in the room and goes, "Did you see that? What was that?"

458
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 The reptilian then turns to Celestine and goes, "What are you?"

459
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 The reptilian then says, "I don't know what you are or what that thing was, but we are not going to find out."

460
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 He then telepathically sends orders.

461
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 He had yet another problem on the UFO. Some dude magically appeared in the operating room and said they were all going to be killed if he didn't let the family go.

462
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 Stuff's falling off this UFO. Soundproofing sucks.

463
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 Human uprising. Now you have interdimensional invaders.

464
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 Next thing Celestine knows, he's sitting in his car and his mom and dad are in the front seat.

465
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 And he says there's a moment where they're all kind of groggy. It's almost like they're waking up and he goes, "I remember sitting in the back seat and everyone was just kind of drowsy."

466
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 And he goes a few seconds past and then all of a sudden his mom started screaming and the dad turned on the car, hit the gas, and sped away from the scene.

467
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 He turns around and sees the UFO shoot off into the night sky.

468
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 He says that his parents would never confirm this story happened. They never wanted to talk about it.

469
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 However, throughout the rest of his time growing up, he would see a cat-like alien.

470
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 Not like a little cat alien, but like a humanoid cat walking through his house sometimes, walking through the walls.

471
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 He felt like there was always alien visitors at home as well, but his parents would never confirm these stories.

472
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 It's an interesting story and obviously there's a lot of issues with it.

473
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 The main one being the main person who experienced it all was four years old.

474
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 He wasn't even telling the story when he was four. He wasn't like, "And then I got a lollipop."

475
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 He was an adult or young man telling the story of this happened when he was four.

476
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 But even if you were telling the story at like 18, 14 years is a long time. Details are going to change.

477
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 Maybe it wasn't a room full of fetuses. Maybe it was only three.

478
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 But I mean like, it wouldn't matter. It wouldn't matter. But you know what I mean? Details could change.

479
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 It could get exaggerated. First off, it could totally be made up. I could find no existence of this person outside of this article.

480
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 UFO Insights, a great resource. So I don't think they made it up, but I don't know where he got the story from.

481
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 I did find someone going by the name Celestian Falcon on Above Top Secret, which is a conspiracy board, a conspiracy forum.

482
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 They had two posts. One was talking about anti-gravity and the other one was talking about the New World Order and aliens, the draconian menace.

483
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 So I would think that would fit, but I was reading through the post and they don't ever mention this story, which would be the first thing you would mention.

484
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 If you're going to post on a conspiracy board, you'd be like, "Hey, let me introduce myself."

485
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 "I'm this," and you would tell this story that I just told you. I don't think it's the same person. It could be.

486
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 It's such a bizarre name that could be the same person, or it could be someone who read this story and took that name.

487
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 Celestian Falcon is a very evocative name. It's so evocative it sounds fake. That's the thing. It sounds like a fake name.

488
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 Celestian is not a real word, but it reminds you of heavenly and falcons fly.

489
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 So the story may be totally made up, and we should address that when we're discussing this type of stuff.

490
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 But if it's not fake, it reveals two things. One, there's this idea, and this come across a lot in UFO lore, that if you pray, if you mention Jesus Christ's name, great aliens leave you alone.

491
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 I think I've covered it once or twice, but that's pretty, pretty well known that if you say Jesus's name, great aliens show up.

492
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 They'll like, "No, not him!" and they disappear. I've never really known how to take that.

493
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 I've never really known how to work that into the lore. There's a conspiracy theory that great aliens are actually demons, so that would make sense.

494
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 But I mean, that would be a really short intergalactic war, right? All the UFOs show up. We got all of our fighter jets, then we just get a megaphone, we go, "Jesus Christ!" and all the UFOs fly away.

495
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 They're like, "No!" I mean, it wouldn't make for an exciting sci-fi movie. I've never really been able to work that out.

496
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 So you have that. You have the idea of an angel showing up being able to penetrate alien defenses, order the child, let go, and they do let him go.

497
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 It doesn't mention if the other people in the car behind them were let go, or what happened to the human uprising or anything like that.

498
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 But I think the angel showing up is an interesting story. It's very convenient that an angel shows up for a boy named Celestian, but, you know, again, it could just be a coincidence.

499
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 But the other takeaway from this story is something that I think is very notable, and that is aliens are absolutely incompetent, and that makes sense.

500
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 That totally makes sense. Anyone who's ever worked for any organization knows that stuff is run super, super incompetently.

501
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 You could have a state-of-the-art warship manned by dummies.

502
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 You might have a couple smart people on there, and then a bunch of people just doing their job, and then lazy, lazy bums who are making everything fall apart.

503
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 A battleship can come straight off of the assembly line, and within a week, stuff is falling off of it through shoddy workmanship, really bad maintenance, and incompetence.

504
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 And that would make sense that that would translate across the stars, right?

505
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 They're building these crafts that can break the laws of physics, but whether the radiator leaks, that makes sense.

506
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 This UFO was an estate of chaos from the second he got on board, and I find that fascinating, because it shows that incompetence and mismanagement is a trait that every intelligent species shares.

507
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 And I do believe that's true. I think that's a very, very fascinating part of the story.

508
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 Alien incompetence. They may be able to break the laws of the universe, they may be able to abduct humans, they may be able to evade our defenses, they may be able to go back in time,

509
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:46,000
 but humanity should have hope, if we ever do go to war with the aliens, that they are just as dumb as we are.

510
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 I say let them abduct us.

511
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 And the second that beam wraps around our body, we just start swinging.

512
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 Ooh, ooh, that's the noise you make, right, when you punch people?

513
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 Ooh, ooh, just start swinging. Now you might hit another couple of ducties, but it's okay, we're humans.

514
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 We can take a punch, and then we start walking through the UFO and we'll just start punching.

515
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 Ooh, ooh, and the aliens are confused by the strange noises, and the feeling of ape knuckles pushing into their alien brains.

516
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 Ooh, ooh, everyone fan out, just start punching, kicking. Oh, that's a new thing, they didn't expect to kick, knocking over display panels, oh, I'm supposed to display stuff on there.

517
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 We can easily beat these aliens up, and then we take control of that UFO.

518
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 We, as one people, fly that UFO back to Earth, a captured alien spacecraft.

519
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 We will be greeted by throngs of fellow humans.

520
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 We will be heroes of the resistance against our alien captors.

521
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 That is, if the UFO and the UFO is able to make the journey back home.

522
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 It may break up in space around Alpha Centauri, but as our bodies freeze in the cold vacuum of space, I'm gonna look at you, you're gonna look at me,

523
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 and I'm gonna give you a big thumbs up.

524
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 My knuckles may be bloody from punching your reptilian multiple times in the face, but with that thumbs up for eternity as I fall through space, I get to say, Earth first, now, and forever.
