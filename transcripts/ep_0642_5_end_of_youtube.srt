1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
 Here I am.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,500
 It's rocking me like a hurricane.

3
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,500
 Is that not the song?

4
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,500
 Wait, no, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,500
 This is supposed to be somber.

6
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,500
 [singing]

7
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,000
 That's Enya music playing.

8
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 [singing]

9
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,500
 Enya sitting in the darkness.

10
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,000
 We're in the pitch darkness of Dead Rabbit Command.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,700
 I have a special announcement for all of you.

12
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,900
 I wasn't originally going to include this on the opening of an episode, but it was kind

13
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,500
 of bringing the mood down for the episode.

14
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,000
 I knew this was going to happen, and I've been predicting it for hundreds of episodes

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,500
 on Dead Rabbit Radio.

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,100
 We're sitting in a pitch black room in Dead Rabbit Command, and there's like a lump in

17
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,500
 the middle of the room.

18
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,000
 And you're sitting on it, and I'm like, "No, no, get off that lump.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 It's sacred.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 It's sacred.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Come sit by me."

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 I knew this was going to happen.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,500
 The YouTube channel is done.

24
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,200
 Dead Rabbit Radio YouTube channel is absolutely done.

25
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,000
 I'm including this as a separate feature, because some people want to know this, and

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,500
 I think it's important to know for just the future of conspiracy content and paranormal

27
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,500
 content on YouTube.

28
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,800
 But if you don't want to know about it and just want to hear goofy stories, I totally

29
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,700
 respect that.

30
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:10,740
 What is going on was last Sunday, I was just, I don't remember what the episode was, and

31
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:18,620
 I got hit with a content warning for an episode I did 200 episodes ago.

32
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,500
 I got hit with promoting harmful or misleading information.

33
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,320
 I was like, "What could possibly, what was it?"

34
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,640
 It was nothing I said.

35
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,040
 I included a link into YouTube, because I included my show notes, because I think when

36
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,680
 you make crazy, it would be really easy for me to say, "You won't believe what this guy

37
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,840
 over here says, and just make a bunch of stuff up."

38
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,120
 And I'm lambasting this guy.

39
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,920
 I'm lambasting this person who says they're a super soldier or whatever, some stupid belief.

40
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,880
 We're just making it about a whole cloth, and you'd be like, "Oh, that is crazy, and

41
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,060
 there's no way to check my work."

42
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,460
 And it's also important, because I considered this paranormal research for other people

43
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,140
 to continue from the research.

44
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,820
 So I include the show notes.

45
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,940
 It was the episode about Civil War of the Worlds.

46
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:09,020
 It was the episode, this guy had a website, it was a Civil War fan website, and he had

47
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,220
 an April Fool's article about space aliens invading during the Civil War.

48
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,700
 And I covered it, because I was like, "What?

49
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,300
 I've never heard of this story before."

50
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,720
 The Mysterious Universe covered it, I covered it off of them, and then it turns out that

51
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,240
 it was an April Fool's joke, which made the story even better.

52
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,800
 And I got to talk to the author of the article.

53
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,920
 It was a great way to end the whole saga.

54
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,960
 But now we are 200 episodes later, which is 40 weeks, which is almost a year later.

55
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:38,000
 And I get hit with promoting harmful or misleading information, and I thought, "What in the world?"

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 I thought, "What?

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 A tarnation?"

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,480
 I turned into a cartoon character.

59
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,320
 You know, Sam and Sam says that right now.

60
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
 I don't know.

61
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,800
 It has nothing to do with the somber mood.

62
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,340
 The point is that I filed an appeal.

63
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,180
 I got that warning last week that said, "Hey, this is content warning.

64
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,180
 You're promoting this stuff."

65
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,980
 I filed an appeal, and I was kind of flabbergasted.

66
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,500
 I guess I am a cartoon character.

67
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,500
 I'm flabbergasted.

68
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,220
 I said, "Hey, it's a..."

69
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,340
 You know, I covered the story.

70
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,340
 It's in the show notes.

71
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,620
 I go, "It's an April Fool's joke."

72
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,220
 Like, sure, it didn't really happen, but it's an April Fool's joke.

73
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,380
 But I found that...

74
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:15,260
 My thing was that 90% of the stuff that we covered could be considered harmful or misleading.

75
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,520
 In some way.

76
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,720
 Someone goes, "Ghosts don't exist.

77
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,160
 It's very misleading that this guy's talking about ghosts exist."

78
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,760
 He labeled this as a cult.

79
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,760
 That's not a cult.

80
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,920
 It's just 12 people who hang in a barn who just like murdering people.

81
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,800
 That's not a cult, though.

82
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,880
 Don't infer they're a cult.

83
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,760
 You can call them a bunch of killers.

84
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,040
 That's harmful to that religion.

85
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,320
 So you could do that with pretty much everything we talk about on this show.

86
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,800
 It's harmful or it's misleading.

87
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,760
 I was like, "Okay, this must be some sort of glitch."

88
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,860
 I filed the appeal and then one week later, exactly one week later, I just recorded and

89
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,340
 uploaded yesterday's episode, which would have been the Orangevale episode, which I

90
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,340
 really enjoyed.

91
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,540
 It was a slog.

92
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,540
 I recorded an episode.

93
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,060
 I had to re-record it.

94
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:01,100
 I recorded the Orangevale episode and at the end of it was the episode, the segment about

95
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:06,660
 the man who built a hidey hole in a men's restroom and he stuck his head underneath the urinal

96
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,940
 and people were peeing on him.

97
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:15,200
 Now I got, the first one was a warning because of that story, I got another content strike.

98
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,160
 But it wasn't because of what I said.

99
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:24,120
 It was because of the link to the Vice News article, which was listed as nudity or sexual,

100
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,120
 is what it said.

101
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,720
 And I thought, "Well, listen, the person who's flagging on YouTube might really find it sexy

102
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,120
 when people get peed on.

103
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,440
 There's definitely no nudity in there."

104
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,320
 And if you read the article, there is no explicit, like, "Oh, he must have been doing this and

105
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,260
 it must have filled this good."

106
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,540
 It's a guy telling a story to the reporter.

107
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,860
 It's very like, "Hey, you won't believe what happened.

108
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,900
 I worked at a pub and pretty much the same narrative I told you."

109
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,940
 So it's nothing I'm saying, it's my links.

110
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:59,140
 But at this point, I cannot upload or comment or post anything, livestream or anything to

111
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,900
 YouTube for the next week.

112
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,660
 So I'm done.

113
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,780
 Because I'm not gonna, I tried for the past couple of episodes, if you look at YouTube,

114
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:13,920
 I started going into the document and making it so goes, if you wanna see the show notes,

115
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,480
 go to this page on my DeadRabbit.com website.

116
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,960
 I'm gonna show you the show notes for that episode.

117
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,940
 I started doing that, but this one happened within 10 minutes.

118
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,740
 This one happened before I could, and I didn't think it was gonna happen, but within 10 minutes

119
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,160
 of me uploading the episode, I got a content strike.

120
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,880
 The fact of the matter is, if I'm getting hit for a website that I posted 200 episodes

121
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:42,940
 ago, there's 642 time bombs out there on my channel that the algorithm or someone at YouTube

122
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:46,060
 is personally going through and going harmful, misleading.

123
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,380
 So I'm not going to play that game.

124
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,020
 I am making a decision to stop uploading to YouTube.

125
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:59,260
 The YouTube episodes are going to end at 642, and we're gonna go ahead in other 600, 800,

126
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,260
 1000 episodes.

127
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,460
 They're not gonna be available on YouTube.

128
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:07,800
 I am making the decision that I'm, the main reason, because I could basically just burn

129
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,320
 it to the ground and just keep putting out content until it gets copyrighted, striked

130
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,720
 into existence, or content striked into existence.

131
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,880
 I could do that.

132
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,520
 I kinda like the fact that I have a platform for, I can hit a button and I can start live

133
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,760
 streaming to a channel where I have a bunch of subscribers.

134
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:29,480
 I'm still thinking in the future I may live stream to advertise for the podcast.

135
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,080
 Maybe once a month pop in and go, "Hey, this is what you guys have been missing if you

136
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,420
 haven't been watching the podcast."

137
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,420
 I might do that.

138
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,900
 I don't know.

139
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,300
 I like having the opportunity of live streaming.

140
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,380
 Definitely like the opportunity of live streaming, but I have to kind of weigh the pros and

141
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,780
 the cons of that.

142
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,380
 But definitely no new content on DeadRabbit Radio outside maybe live streaming.

143
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:51,660
 And really that will only exist until I figure out a way that I can make a Twitch thing.

144
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,660
 What do you kids call that?

145
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,660
 A Twitch account?

146
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,660
 No, I have a Twitch account.

147
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,460
 But until I can know that if I hit a button that you guys will be notified.

148
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,860
 Because a lot of you guys would jump, when I start a live stream, I'd get 40 people

149
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,240
 watching right away, which was really good on YouTube.

150
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,240
 So I want to keep it for that.

151
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,880
 And I can advertise the show as that.

152
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,360
 And all that content and all the community that we've built, all those comments, all

153
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,760
 that interaction I've had with you guys.

154
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,640
 If I just nuke the channel, if I just start keep putting the stuff out and don't let this

155
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,040
 get-- And even if they resolve this in my favor, I'm still done.

156
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,040
 I'm still done.

157
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,720
 I'm total-- Because they're both still in appeal.

158
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,520
 Both of these things are both still in appeal.

159
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,020
 The first one, I go, dude, you didn't even let the first appeal play out.

160
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,180
 And I'm getting hit with this other one.

161
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,700
 I go, it's a vice.com article.

162
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,460
 There's nothing sexual about it.

163
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,860
 There's nothing nude about it.

164
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,380
 And then, you know, but I do think it's fitting.

165
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,820
 I thought it was funny as when I saw that that happened, I thought, great, the last

166
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,980
 episode that I post on YouTube is the episode where I say, you know, it'd be really cool

167
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,780
 if everyone could just forget their differences.

168
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,740
 Not forget their differences, but acknowledge their differences, but work towards a better

169
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,460
 and brighter future for everybody.

170
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,080
 I said it's a very childish way of looking at the world, but it's something I've never

171
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,080
 grown out of.

172
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:12,240
 I think eventually we can all work together as one human race and still have our differences.

173
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,080
 YouTube's like, nope, nope, this is the type of content this guy's putting out.

174
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,840
 Let's hit him with this nudity strike a week after his first one.

175
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,000
 We're not going to let this appeal process play out.

176
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,320
 We're not going to let him upload for a week.

177
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,800
 YouTube's like, nah, we don't want this content on here.

178
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
 We don't want this stuff.

179
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,320
 We don't want someone disputing conspiracy theories.

180
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,820
 Nah, nah, we want 6 hour videos on flat earth.

181
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,780
 You know, to be okay, that's not fair.

182
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,780
 That's not fair.

183
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,340
 I don't want to have a persecution complex.

184
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,140
 My actual fear about this isn't so fine.

185
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,380
 I'd been predicting this for years.

186
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,380
 I've had backup plans.

187
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,180
 I mean, I thought, you know, we'll eventually move to Twitch.

188
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,500
 I knew YouTube was pretty shaky.

189
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,380
 I've been saying it for a long time.

190
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,460
 I'm showing people are saying, you're paranoid, you're paranoid.

191
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:56,420
 My concern is that I am, and I think, I hit the peel button a week ago and haven't heard

192
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,420
 back.

193
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,660
 I've been doing this everywhere and I bet you they're getting hit with tons of appeals

194
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,040
 and I think a lot of channels are going to get shut down.

195
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,520
 I think a lot of channels doing stuff like this, but they're coming for Wendigoon.

196
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,460
 They're coming for all of this content.

197
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,200
 They're coming for that chapter.

198
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,600
 They're coming for Nexpo.

199
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,480
 I think they're really going to start just sweeping all of this stuff up.

200
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,800
 I'm not going to bit shoot.

201
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
 I don't think that that's the right format.

202
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,160
 Also, it's extra work.

203
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,120
 YouTube, I just hit a button and it automatically uploaded to YouTube with a static image.

204
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,620
 I'd have to do video processing again like I did in the early days.

205
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,940
 I think that this is a harbinger for things to come.

206
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,260
 I think that, and I knew it was going to happen.

207
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,700
 I 100% knew it was going to happen when I saw, and I would joke about it, I go, that's

208
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,420
 why Hans Wormhatt's channels are getting shut down all the time.

209
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,580
 Even though I talk about stuff in a way that I'm like, I don't believe this.

210
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,060
 It doesn't make sense.

211
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:54,780
 The algorithm I knew would eventually start just real life thinking that I was part of

212
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,780
 the conspiracy promoters.

213
00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:00,200
 There's some, even the stuff right at the end, let's put on our conspiracy caps.

214
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,400
 Let's look at it this way.

215
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,720
 I knew that it was coming.

216
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,640
 I knew that it was coming.

217
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,720
 We are sitting in a dark and dead rabbit command and I throw a torch.

218
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,240
 I was holding the torch this whole time.

219
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,240
 You didn't know it.

220
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,240
 You just didn't right next to me.

221
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,240
 You had a torch in your face.

222
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,800
 You're like, "Ah, I throw the torch onto the lump in the middle of the room."

223
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,200
 It is the YouTube channel in effigy.

224
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,820
 It's burning and we're just standing there in your music playing.

225
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,660
 It's still burning.

226
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,660
 It's still burning.

227
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,660
 We're just standing there.

228
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,260
 Forgot we're doing this indoors.

229
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,260
 Smoke inhalation.

230
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,900
 We go outside a dead rabbit command.

231
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,220
 We're looking through a window as we're watching the YouTube channel burn.

232
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,660
 I'm no longer going to upload on YouTube.

233
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,140
 Keep it around for the live streams.

234
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,260
 I think it would be really cool to figure out a way.

235
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,060
 I couldn't do it weekly because it's too much work, but figure out a way that we could all

236
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,440
 get together and talk on YouTube.

237
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,440
 I don't know.

238
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,440
 I don't know.

239
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,440
 I don't know.

240
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,760
 We're just going to stop posting new content on there.

241
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,440
 Also, if you do listen to the show, obviously you're hearing this.

242
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,160
 There's a lot of people who listen to it on YouTube who don't know what's going on.

243
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,520
 They're going to spend a whole week going like, "What?"

244
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,280
 If you do happen to see them online or in real life, you have a buddy who just always

245
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:19,760
 watches YouTube and be like, "Hey, Jason is now primary only on podcast channels and

246
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,760
 dead rabbit.com."

247
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,900
 So that's how you will be able to listen to him from now on.

248
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,100
 Fire is burning.

249
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,140
 It's just the end of a chapter.

250
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,220
 It's not the end of the show.

251
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,660
 It is something that I expected.

252
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,980
 If I can figure out a way to alert everyone when I'm doing a Twitch live stream, we will

253
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,460
 just do that as well because I just don't want...

254
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:41,460
 Right now, I'm having to download as much content as I can because for all I know the

255
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:45,060
 channel's gone while I've been recording this.

256
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,460
 I could be racking up strikes from past content.

257
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,460
 We're just doing that.

258
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,460
 That would be not...

259
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,880
 I'm not going to do bit shoot.

260
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,760
 But yeah, maybe we'll see about Twitch.

261
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,020
 I got some other tricks up my sleeve.

262
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,120
 Some other tricks up my sleeve.

263
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,840
 But the show is not going anywhere.

264
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,240
 The podcast is completely safe.

265
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,560
 Spotify doesn't work like a certain episode of mine, but that's fair.

266
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,560
 The same thing.

267
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,560
 YouTube is a private...

268
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,120
 It's a private business.

269
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,200
 If they want to get rid of all conspiracy and all paranormal content and all true crime

270
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,660
 content and clear it up and just have makeup channels, that's their right.

271
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,720
 That's their right to do that.

272
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,140
 But we will not be a part of that anymore.

273
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,220
 To all the friends that I made on YouTube, you guys are still around.

274
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,620
 You guys are still going to be able to talk and I'd like to figure out a way that we could

275
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,620
 still meet up.

276
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,540
 And that's why we may still do a live stream every now and then.

277
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,820
 But that...

278
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,780
 We will decide on later.

279
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,780
 So let the Ineon Music play us out.

280
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,980
 And I'll have an episode coming out in a couple hours, guys.

281
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,980
 I love you.

282
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,540
 Thanks for sticking around and I will see you soon.
