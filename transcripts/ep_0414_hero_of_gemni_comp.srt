1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
 Can a man's nose be so big you want to turn his nipples into shoes?

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,800
 What?

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:14,600
 And then we take a look at two stories about UFO abductions that didn't happen.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:19,640
 Why is it that sometimes aliens abduct someone and go "Nah, never mind.

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,320
 We'll find out today on Dead Ravva Radio."

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:32,920
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Ravva Radio.

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,880
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,720
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,680
 We got a lot of stuff to cover so there's not much of a preamble.

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,800
 However, I do want to give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreon supporters, someone

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,360
 who's been supporting the show for a long time, Mason Nordbeck.

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,000
 Really really appreciate that you still support the show.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,720
 We're giving you the keys of the carpenter copter this time.

14
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,560
 First off, we're headed out to Powder River in Wyoming and we're actually also going

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,560
 back in time.

16
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,280
 So fire up that time machine.

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,040
 It's the year 1878, it's August 16th.

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,240
 And notorious bandit George Parrot is hiding in the bushes with his gang of rascals.

19
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,360
 Hey guys, we got our guns ready.

20
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,080
 We're going to shoot some train people.

21
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,960
 We're going to steal whatever on the train because we're bad guys.

22
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,720
 Now George Parrot, that's a pretty good name.

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,520
 That's not his like thief name, right?

24
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,040
 Because you got to have a thief name.

25
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,240
 George Parrot, he could be like the talking, I wonder if Parrots were popular actually

26
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,240
 back then.

27
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,600
 I wonder when Parrots became popular because if you think about it, in 1878 you wouldn't

28
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,280
 know about a parrot unless you like met a parrot or saw one.

29
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,320
 If you read about it in a book you would assume it was made up.

30
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,480
 You're like what?

31
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,480
 Talking birds.

32
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,880
 I wonder if they knew about Parrots back then.

33
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,960
 We didn't even know dinosaurs really existed until like the 1880s.

34
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,560
 Like until we started digging for oil and coal and digging deep and started finding

35
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,680
 giant bones.

36
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,560
 Some cultures had uncovered monster heads.

37
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,320
 I was not going to subpoena about this the other day.

38
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,160
 She said that the story of the Cyclops is because they'd find these mammoth skulls with

39
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,080
 a giant eye hole in the middle of it.

40
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,120
 So you'd have stuff like that but dinosaurs as a species, nobody knew what they were until

41
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,360
 we were digging deep enough for coal and oil to discover them.

42
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,520
 And dinosaurs and birds are related so possibly people in Wyoming didn't know what a parrot

43
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,520
 was.

44
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,520
 No.

45
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,520
 They just thought he had a weird last name.

46
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,520
 No.

47
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,200
 His name wasn't the talking bird or the talking criminal or any parrot related thing.

48
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,600
 The foliage felon or anything like that.

49
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,600
 Wait that's grass.

50
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
 Isn't it foliage?

51
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,640
 Anyways, it doesn't matter.

52
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,040
 Point is that nothing to do with this nickname and that was like a three minute ramble.

53
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,160
 His name was Big Nose George.

54
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,560
 Now you'd think how big of a nose do you have to have that not only do other criminals

55
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,640
 call you Big Nose George but the population at large calls you Big Nose George.

56
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,520
 This guy's nose was so huge.

57
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,760
 Plays an important factor later on in this story.

58
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,960
 It has to be massive.

59
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,080
 It has to be the size of a parrot basically is what I'm saying.

60
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,740
 Big Nose George, he has an extra bush just to cover up his giant nose and his other bad

61
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:12,000
 guys are sitting in the bushes and he's waiting for this Union Pacific train to come by.

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,520
 What happens is like a work crew is walking by and they see a little bit of a nose.

63
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,160
 They see no matter how many bushes are there, they see a little bit of a nose sticking out

64
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,160
 of a bush.

65
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,160
 They go and they get the cops.

66
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,080
 The cops show up at the scene.

67
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,360
 Big Nose George and you banned wrestlers.

68
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,680
 Hop on out of them bushes.

69
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,760
 Big Nose George and his gang hopped out of the bushes and killed everybody.

70
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,120
 Killed all the lawmen that were there.

71
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,500
 Hopped their bodies up and just threw them away.

72
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,340
 Now that's not good.

73
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,860
 I mean you first you think oh these guys are like maincroppers and they have like a mask

74
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,420
 and like Big Nose George is like four masks tied together to hide his nose.

75
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,980
 But it's not like a fun thing hop on a train and it's not like a train robbery that you

76
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,900
 go on like a themed dinner with your girlfriend.

77
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,140
 They're chopping up police officers.

78
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,580
 Obviously they are on the run definitely now.

79
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,520
 Whatever they wanted to get from the train now they're on the run.

80
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,080
 Ten thousand dollar reward if you can imagine that back then.

81
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,900
 That's like Bill Gates money.

82
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,840
 That's Bill Gates money in 1878.

83
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,840
 They're on the run.

84
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,480
 They get caught though so the story wouldn't be, the story's not he just goes on the run.

85
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,480
 He gets caught.

86
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,520
 They're ready to lynch him and he's like no no no no no I have a bunch of secrets I can

87
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,520
 tell you.

88
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,520
 A bunch of really cool secrets.

89
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,920
 I'll show you how to do these magic tricks.

90
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,720
 Whatever he does he's able to convince them not to hang him right then.

91
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,060
 They take him to jail.

92
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,700
 And then while he's in jail he figures out a way to break out.

93
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,160
 He has like a lock pick thing.

94
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,860
 Hit up his giant nose.

95
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,860
 He unlocks the door.

96
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,860
 He beats a dude up.

97
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,860
 He runs out of the jail right into the arms of a lynch mom.

98
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,080
 And then despite his pleas, oh no no I got all these awesome secrets dude.

99
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,160
 They hang him and it takes some three different times for him to die.

100
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,160
 So I don't know if they built like a gallows and then it fell apart and then they're like

101
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,160
 let's hang him from a tree.

102
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,120
 Like I don't know if they just kept raising the same rope over again or what.

103
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,780
 They had so many mishaps it took three times for this dude to die.

104
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,020
 Big Nose George is dead.

105
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,020
 The town celebrates.

106
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,060
 Yeah he's just a lifeless body hanging there.

107
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,060
 They're like yeah yeah.

108
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,780
 What do you do with this dead body?

109
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,140
 Nobody really wants to do much with it.

110
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,860
 I mean they've had their fun.

111
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,860
 They killed this guy.

112
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:19,900
 Two local doctors, Thomas Maghe and John Osborne decided they say we'll take the body.

113
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,060
 We'll take the body right?

114
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,860
 Now before they take possession of the body this is what's confusing about it because

115
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,860
 the doctors are start messing around with the body but before they do that they do put

116
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,800
 him in a coffin and this is why we get to how big this guy's nose is.

117
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,720
 So I guess they hang him, they put him in a coffin and then the doctors after all the

118
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,360
 trouble they go through to get him in the coffin the doctors are like no no no no we

119
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,000
 want the body we want the body.

120
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,920
 They were late to the party apparently.

121
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:49,920
 They take Big Nose George, they put him in the coffin and they can't get the lid on.

122
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,560
 Here's a quote from this article about this Big Nose George.

123
00:05:53,560 --> 00:06:00,540
 The nose of the dead man was so large that it interfered with the lid of the coffin.

124
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,540
 Come on.

125
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:06,740
 An excess pressure had to be exerted to close it and nail it down.

126
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,020
 How that's impossible right?

127
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,700
 How big does your nose- I used to work in a mortuary, crematory.

128
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,740
 You guys have all seen coffins either on television or in real life or whatever.

129
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,700
 Your vampire you live in one you're like oh that's impossible.

130
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:26,000
 How your nose would have to be like a foot long for a coffin lid the only way that's

131
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,540
 not his nose being big that's you making a crummy coffin.

132
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,320
 You did not measure that coffin right?

133
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,560
 Although I guess if they're lynching him it's not like they had a pre-made coffin they

134
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:42,160
 planned on killing him but still like a normal man's coffin should be able to account for

135
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,160
 a normal sized schnauz.

136
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,600
 Even at one of a large, come on you can't it's like when you're sitting on a suitcase

137
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,740
 so you can close it.

138
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,740
 That's impossible.

139
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,900
 Well you can sit on a suitcase close it but there's no way his nose was that big right?

140
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,420
 But apparently it was and they're like ugh!

141
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,060
 Jake, Jimmy come over here jump on this coffin!

142
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,700
 They hear the breaking of the cartilage.

143
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,620
 They're finally able to get the coffin nail down.

144
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:10,220
 But then the two doctors Thomas McGee and John Osborne show up and go whoa whoa whoa

145
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,660
 wait wait we want to steady this body for science.

146
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,660
 Oh dang it.

147
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,340
 You could have told us ten minutes ago before we broke this dude's nose.

148
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,760
 They open it up.

149
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,120
 The doctors take his brain out to measure it because this guy was so evil he's chopping

150
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,000
 up police officers and juggling their body parts and all sorts of horrible stuff.

151
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,360
 Brain is just a normal brain obviously.

152
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,880
 They then go okay well that's part of the science thing done but we still have access

153
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,000
 to this notorious man's body.

154
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,520
 We just can't like bury this right?

155
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,280
 The two doctors look at each other and they're like ka-ching!

156
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,120
 Little money signs in their eyeballs.

157
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,220
 And they saw, well they already saw his head off to get his brain.

158
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:55,980
 So now they have a skullcap and they actually give that to their fifteen year old assistant.

159
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,980
 Lillian Heath.

160
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,380
 It's this young teenage girl.

161
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,500
 They're like she's sitting there throwing up in the corner and they're like here you

162
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,580
 go here's someone to throw over and blah.

163
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,100
 She looks down to human hair on it.

164
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,100
 Ah!

165
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,100
 Throws up even more.

166
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,300
 They give her the skullcap of this notorious villain.

167
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,220
 Dr. Osborne begins cutting the skin off the dude.

168
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,720
 He takes skin off the thigh, the chest and specifically takes to the nipple area.

169
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,040
 And he's like what are you doing?

170
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,360
 He's like I am going to have some things made.

171
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,920
 I'm going to send these things off and get these made.

172
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,920
 And he contacts a guy who does leather work and he's like this is 100% true.

173
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,320
 This is a true story.

174
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,560
 We can track this stuff down through history.

175
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:41,480
 He goes I would like you to make me a pair of shoes and a leather doctor's bag so when

176
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,780
 I go to visit patients in the little house on the prairie when I go out to their little

177
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:50,940
 house in the middle of nowhere I can set down my leather bag and I can look at little Darla's

178
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,540
 knee and make sure that that little scrape has put some old timey neosporin on it and

179
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,420
 the whole time they're dead human flesh sitting in this house.

180
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,500
 Isn't that a great idea?

181
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,500
 So he does.

182
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,140
 The leatherman's like yeah sure give me money I'll do whatever.

183
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,820
 He gets the shoes back.

184
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:09,220
 Now he's disappointed.

185
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,280
 Because what he expected and I'm sure I don't know if he's specifically implied this or

186
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,920
 if he just assumed the leather worker would know.

187
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,380
 He expected no joke to have a nipple on each shoe.

188
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,080
 So when he was walking around you'd be like hey Dr. Oswarn how you doing?

189
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,760
 And he'd be like um notice anything different about me huh?

190
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,800
 You notice he put his feet up in the air.

191
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,800
 He's doing high kicks.

192
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,800
 Like what are you doing that?

193
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,720
 Why are you jumping ropes so you're as high as me with each jump?

194
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,080
 He wanted a nipple.

195
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,080
 That's gross.

196
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:44,340
 What I bet happened was when they were curing the flesh it all shrank down and like the

197
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,340
 nipple was on the wrong side.

198
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,300
 But anyway so he did get human shoes.

199
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,300
 Not human shoes.

200
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,740
 He did get shoes made of human flesh but the nipples were not.

201
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,580
 He wanted them like right on the front.

202
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,580
 Right where you could see them.

203
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,740
 There's no point having like a nipple on the inside.

204
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,300
 That would actually probably not be good for your foot.

205
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,100
 And then he did get a bag of human flesh though.

206
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,620
 Not a bag full of human flesh.

207
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,780
 He probably had that already because this guy sounds kind of nuts.

208
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:12,600
 But he had like a medical bag made out of big nose George's flesh.

209
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:18,280
 Now they also took a death mask which was kind of the trend of the time.

210
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,720
 So they had that but that was kind of nothing.

211
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,800
 I mean who would know?

212
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,680
 Not many people have human shoes.

213
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,920
 And they took what was left of his body.

214
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,240
 The skinless brainless corpse.

215
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,080
 And they just threw it in a barrel of brine and salt.

216
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,520
 Just let it sit there for a while.

217
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,360
 Now flash forward.

218
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,020
 This is where the story gets really weird because it's possible that big nose George,

219
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,740
 he's possible that he was a good luck charm.

220
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,180
 He was basically a living four leaf clover.

221
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:50,020
 Lily and Heath who got the skullcap became the first female doctor in Wyoming.

222
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,580
 So that's a big accomplishment right?

223
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,900
 And you were talking about like 1870s.

224
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,380
 So there was she's probably the first female doctor within like the next 10 states next

225
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,480
 to her.

226
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,700
 She kept that skullcap the entire time and eventually turned it into an ashtray holder.

227
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,880
 And then eventually she turned it into a doorstop.

228
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,360
 So you'd walk into her office and she'd be like, "Hey guys come on, sit in my office.

229
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,080
 I want to talk to you about your latest tuberculosis results, i.e. you have it."

230
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,760
 And the door would be propped open.

231
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,720
 The little skullcap of big nose George.

232
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:30,040
 Dr. Osborne who wore these shoes everywhere became the first Democrat governor of Wyoming.

233
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,960
 He wore them to his inaugural ball.

234
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,920
 Like I said he was showing these off everywhere.

235
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,500
 And eventually he became assistant secretary of state to Woodrow Wilson.

236
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,420
 So they, I don't know what happened to McGee.

237
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,420
 He's probably like gross.

238
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,580
 I don't want any body parts.

239
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,180
 And then he just kind of disappeared into obscurity.

240
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:50,500
 They did though eventually find in the backyard one of these doctors a big barrel like buried

241
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,840
 in the backyard with a skeleton in it.

242
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,060
 So they just basically, they let the body just kind of float around in liquid for a while.

243
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,940
 And eventually it all liquefied and dissolved and they're like, "Ah, whatever.

244
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,340
 Just buried in the backyard."

245
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:07,840
 You can go to this local museum out there, the Carbon County Museum, and you can see

246
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,120
 the shoes and the skullcap.

247
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,960
 No one knows what happened to the bag.

248
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,480
 But I will say this, based on the pedigree of the skullcap and the shoes, if you find

249
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,600
 that bag, I can almost guarantee you'll have nothing but good luck or be haunted by the

250
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,440
 ghost of a man with a massive nose who dismembers law enforcement.

251
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,640
 So either or, you know, pick your poison with that one.

252
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,680
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

253
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,200
 Our next story is actually two stories.

254
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,180
 And it's kind of what I said in the intro.

255
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,260
 People who get abducted, but things don't really work out.

256
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,620
 Now both of these stories take place in the year 1989.

257
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,280
 Both of these stories I got from that website.

258
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,100
 Think about it, docs.com.

259
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,180
 Both of these stories happened in the Soviet Union.

260
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:51,620
 Like I said, in 1989, there was a huge explosion of UFO reports and alien reports coming out

261
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,620
 of the Soviet Union.

262
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,940
 It's a very, very odd phenomenon.

263
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,100
 I think it's just news was finally getting out to the West.

264
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:02,200
 First off, we're headed to a place called Subotino in the Perm region in Russia.

265
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,520
 So mason fire back up that carbon helicopter.

266
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,800
 Take us to your 1989 and fly us out.

267
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,720
 We're going to have to be in stealth mode because we currently are in a Cold War with

268
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,720
 the Soviet Union.

269
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,840
 And this is an American helicopter.

270
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,360
 So stealth mode coming over the area.

271
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,840
 July 29th, 1989.

272
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,360
 There's a journalist named Pavel Merkotov.

273
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,220
 Which is what that cat always said, "Heavens to Merkotov!"

274
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,100
 Okay, I'm sorry.

275
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,100
 That joke was bad.

276
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,460
 Anyway, so Pavel, and I apologize to you Pavel.

277
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:39,500
 He's walking down by this river called the Silva River or the River Silva, because sometimes

278
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,140
 they say stuff backwards over there.

279
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:46,780
 And a UFO appears.

280
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:53,380
 And then he sees these tall, glowing the dark aliens hop out of the UFO.

281
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:58,880
 So not the typical greys, they're actually taller and they're luminescent, bioluminescent.

282
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,100
 Now Pavel is a journalist.

283
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,100
 He's like, "Whoa!"

284
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,560
 Like, this is the scoop of a century.

285
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,780
 Scoop of the millennium.

286
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,440
 We have alien life.

287
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,600
 It's actually true.

288
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,780
 He begins talking to them and the aliens are communicating to him telepathically.

289
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,920
 And he's asking them questions, he's getting this info from them.

290
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,600
 So he's having this telepathic conversation with these aliens.

291
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,240
 We don't get a lot of information on what the conversation's about.

292
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,960
 We just get two little nuggets.

293
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,860
 And they're from the Libra constellation, which is cool because that's my horoscope

294
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,860
 sign.

295
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,860
 So what's up aliens?

296
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,060
 I get a tall bioluminescent one.

297
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,580
 You get those lame gray ones, loser.

298
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,580
 Bam!

299
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,580
 October babies in the house.

300
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,580
 Anyways, he's talking to these aliens.

301
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,340
 They tell them they're from the Libra constellation.

302
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,420
 Now he says, "I want to go with you."

303
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,540
 He's a journalist.

304
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:49,020
 Journalists will go into war zones, they'll go into narco factories, they'll go to all

305
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,020
 these weirdo places.

306
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,280
 Because they want the scoop, they want the truth.

307
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,480
 He says, "Take me back with you."

308
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:03,080
 And they tell him, "No, we will not abduct you because we believe you will bring, quote,

309
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,080
 thought bacteria."

310
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,080
 Unquote.

311
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,960
 The aliens leave.

312
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:12,080
 Now this is an interesting story because we have some specifics, which is stuff we always

313
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,200
 want to look at in these stories.

314
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,920
 We have a date, we have an exact date, July 29th, 1989.

315
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,920
 We have a name.

316
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,720
 Those can still be faked.

317
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,420
 But it's more liable to be faked when it's like sometime in the 80s.

318
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,620
 A guy named Joe, not his real name, you're like, "Come on, dude."

319
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,540
 I get it why people don't want to be super forthcoming, but the more information that

320
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,540
 we have, the easier it is to...

321
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:40,540
 I don't want to say believe it, but it's a little less unbelievable, if that makes

322
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,940
 sense.

323
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:47,220
 This was reported in a magazine back in the day.

324
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,840
 But again, it was a Soviet Union magazine that was looking at all this stuff.

325
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:55,040
 So we have this guy saying this, and that's really the whole story there, the aliens leave,

326
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,760
 and he's like, "What the bacteria?"

327
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:02,520
 But it's interesting because we always think of actual bacteria, right?

328
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,080
 Like if aliens came here, would they all get sick and die?

329
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,960
 If we went up there, would we get sick and die?

330
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,040
 What would go on?

331
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,520
 But the idea of somebody coming from Earth, going to an alien planet, I think it would

332
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:19,580
 be... you can easily decontaminate someone for biological entities.

333
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,980
 You can put someone on a ship and they go into that chamber and it's all "psshh" and

334
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:27,180
 the smoke's coming out, and you come out and you're just in your underwear and you're getting

335
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,180
 deloused and all.

336
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,180
 You can take care...

337
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,180
 We can do that when you get arrested.

338
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,540
 When you get arrested, the first thing they have to do is delouse you because they don't

339
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,580
 know if they arrested you from a mansion or from the slums.

340
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:40,820
 Well, they know because that's where the cops don't just drop you off and go figure it out,

341
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,820
 but they need to make sure you don't have lice, you don't have skabies, none of that

342
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,820
 stuff.

343
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,000
 They gotta delouse you.

344
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,720
 So you would do that on a spaceship.

345
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,440
 But could you... you couldn't stop BOT bacteria.

346
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,920
 You couldn't stop him going up there and being like "Man, this sure is an awesome place."

347
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,880
 But you know what would be more awesome?

348
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,120
 If everyone had of... like every single one of you had one vote.

349
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,920
 And that's the way you guys decided stuff and the aliens are like "What?

350
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,080
 Because we don't know what they would be like."

351
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,520
 And that's very kind of an interesting thing.

352
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,860
 I don't want to go too up on a segue because I have another story here, but if it had been

353
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:22,220
 for like the fall, if Greece had fallen early on, like if you had the early examples of

354
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:29,540
 democracy fall, it's possible that we would have no concept of democracy now.

355
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:34,300
 Like it might be somewhere in the back of our head that one person, one vote, or a house

356
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,860
 of representatives.

357
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:40,220
 But it's quite possible that you would have had a culture be like "Hey, let's do this

358
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,320
 representative thing."

359
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,160
 And then they just totally get wiped out and then you just have monarchs and kings and

360
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,800
 monarchs and kings and then religious empires and stuff like that.

361
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:56,280
 And you may in the back of your mind go "Well, maybe, but I don't... it would... you would

362
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,240
 need to figure out a way to clamp down on that stuff."

363
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,240
 Not democracy.

364
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,240
 Democracy is awesome.

365
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,080
 But what I'm saying is that if you had an alien race that was 10,000 years more advanced

366
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:15,460
 than us, but had never thought of capitalism or communism or democracy or free speech,

367
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:20,220
 none of those concepts ever came about their evolutionary path and you'd have these aliens

368
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,620
 come down and they'd be like "This is a really cool place to visit because there's this intelligent

369
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:29,340
 life, but they have some really wacky ideas about like society and the way things work."

370
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:34,780
 So we'll send down our strongest willed people and then when they come back they have to

371
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,280
 be basically debriefed and told how stupid those things are.

372
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,960
 But if we take one of these people back with us, the chances of everyone on our planet

373
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,160
 wanting to meet this guy and him blurting out something like "Oh yeah, I just kind of

374
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,640
 say what I want and then like you kind of have to deal with it.

375
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,080
 You can't stop me from saying it."

376
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,400
 He'll be like "What?

377
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,400
 What?"

378
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,200
 So it's interesting for the aliens to not be worried about a biological hazard, but

379
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,560
 a thought hazard.

380
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:05,300
 That something this guy could say could actually infest their entire species.

381
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,300
 Interesting thought.

382
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:12,340
 But we have another story of a guy who didn't get abducted.

383
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,340
 Or did he?

384
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,020
 This is an interesting one.

385
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:19,340
 Let's hop on over to Siberia, West Siberia.

386
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,780
 We're in the Aktaş region.

387
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,180
 This is where the Klingons originated from apparently.

388
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,540
 The year is 1989.

389
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:35,080
 And this is according to a retired major, IA, Samaylenko.

390
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,800
 So Major Samaylenko told this story far after it had taken place.

391
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,960
 Apparently he was working at this base in West Siberia.

392
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:51,480
 There was a young soldier there who was working guard one night at this base.

393
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,560
 Don't mess around with guard duty.

394
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,080
 You don't mess around with guard duty.

395
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,300
 That's the one thing you can't mess around with.

396
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,300
 Well, you know that.

397
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,540
 And don't shoot any of the good guys.

398
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,220
 But you can't mess around with guard duty.

399
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,980
 Because you're putting everyone else in risk.

400
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,900
 So when this young dude, we'll call him Pavel, because that's one of the few Russian names

401
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,900
 I know.

402
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,380
 Pavel goes missing, because we don't have his actual name.

403
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,940
 Pavel goes missing.

404
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,700
 Everyone's like, "First off, you're going to assume the worst.

405
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,100
 You're going to assume something is going on."

406
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,920
 And then after a couple hours when there hasn't been a massive raid from rogue Mongolians

407
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,240
 or the CIA is not going in, cutting people's throats in the middle of the night, you're

408
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,480
 going to go, "He must have deserted."

409
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,720
 So now you're not afraid and tense.

410
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,040
 Now you're just really mad.

411
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,080
 Because this guy's supposed to be at his post.

412
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,760
 First off, you're thinking, "You probably got assassinated.

413
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,280
 Some ninja crawled up, stuck him in the brain."

414
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:50,800
 Three days later, five kilometers from the base, they find him terrified in the wilderness.

415
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:58,460
 He's just cowering by a tree and the soldiers are like, "Bro, dude, where have you been,

416
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,460
 man?

417
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,460
 We thought you were dead.

418
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,460
 Then we thought you ran away and now you're cowering.

419
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,460
 What's going on?

420
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,860
 I don't remember.

421
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:09,780
 I don't remember."

422
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:13,020
 Now obviously everyone, now you're back to being nervous.

423
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:18,020
 You probably didn't run away, but something happened to this guy.

424
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,560
 Now they have to figure out what happened to him, right?

425
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,520
 So it's 1989, Soviet Union.

426
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,400
 You have a guy who's deserted his post, doesn't remember where he's at.

427
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,760
 How do you get the information from this guy?

428
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,040
 There's only one answer to this.

429
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,000
 The worst possible answer, the KGB.

430
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:43,600
 They're a Soviet Union, brutal, brutal, secret police shows up at the base and they go, "Pavel,

431
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
 where were you?

432
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,480
 He really wants to remember at this point.

433
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,220
 He really, really wants to remember at this point, but he can't."

434
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:56,920
 So the KGB is like, "Okay, well, young Pavel, we will help you remember.

435
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:04,180
 We will spend as long as it takes to help you remember."

436
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,580
 Now eventually he does.

437
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:11,020
 I love this quote from this article, "After a long rehabilitation period and therapy

438
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:18,440
 on him conducted by officers of a special military KGB detachment, yeah, the long therapy

439
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,200
 is then basically, what do you know, punch?

440
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,680
 I don't remember.

441
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,680
 What do you know?"

442
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,360
 I mean, so many of these other stories are just like, it's weird.

443
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,360
 I don't remember what happened.

444
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,160
 Oh, I will just go to this hypnotist and be like, you're getting sleepy and then they'll

445
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,880
 remember flashes.

446
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:39,480
 This guy goes through quote, "therapy conducted on him by the officers of the KGB."

447
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,440
 Finally, he remembers what's going on.

448
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:47,460
 He's at the guard post and blinding light.

449
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:52,700
 And the next thing he knows, he's in a room with walls that had no lights on them, but

450
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,780
 they emitted a bluish light themselves.

451
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,300
 He hears the voice of what he says as either a female or a child.

452
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:03,140
 He couldn't place the voice, but he hears a voice.

453
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,220
 "Greetings.

454
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:13,100
 You are going to go on a long journey and we are going to test you.

455
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:18,280
 We are from the Gemini Constellation and we need a hero.

456
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:25,320
 We need to choose someone for an honorable mission that will help a great civilization

457
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,360
 across the stars.

458
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:34,200
 You will be tested and if you pass, you will be that hero."

459
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,380
 He falls unconscious after this message.

460
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:43,380
 And the next thing he knows, he's on what is typical UFO, lore, a medical bed.

461
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:49,400
 And all of a sudden, there are these humanoid standing around him, no faces.

462
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,500
 And they begin poking and prodding and looking at him, discussing him.

463
00:23:53,500 --> 00:24:01,040
 And each press and push and pull unbearable pain throughout his body.

464
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:10,400
 And then in the final moment, nothing but pure angelic bliss.

465
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:19,120
 And then he's in the woods, cowering, waiting to be found.

466
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,060
 The KGB heard this story and they diagnosed him to be insane.

467
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:28,480
 They believed that he simply left his post, that this is an impossible story and he's

468
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,480
 gone insane.

469
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,160
 One, he's gone insane because he left his post knowing full well what would happen to

470
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,160
 him.

471
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,440
 Two, this is not true.

472
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,440
 This story is impossible.

473
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,280
 This is not a true story.

474
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,120
 He was diagnosed with insanity.

475
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,960
 He was thrown into a mental hospital.

476
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,440
 Shortly afterwards, he contracted what they don't know what it was.

477
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,920
 It was discussed as a fulminating disease.

478
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,080
 So radiation sickness, whatever.

479
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,320
 He was a disease where he was basically dissolving.

480
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,000
 He was going downhill very, very quickly.

481
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,960
 And within a month and a half after being found in the woods, he was dead of this unknown

482
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,360
 disease.

483
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,560
 So there's two ways to read this story.

484
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:18,160
 One is that this alien race, well one is that the story is fake, but let's assume that it's

485
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,320
 real.

486
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:24,920
 One is that an alien race was flying around looking for a hero.

487
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:29,480
 And they picked up this young man and tested him and found him not to be what they were

488
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:36,000
 looking for, dropped him back off in the middle of the woods, left him to die.

489
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,040
 Alone and considered insane.

490
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,760
 However, I actually don't have that read on this story.

491
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,880
 I don't have this read on that story.

492
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,840
 When I first read this, and this has been the impression that sat with me, I've read

493
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,040
 this story a couple of weeks ago and I've been thinking about it a lot.

494
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:56,400
 I think that they did test him and I think he passed.

495
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:03,440
 But like all heroes' journeys, there's a series of transformation.

496
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,680
 I think the fulminating illness, the mysterious disease that killed him incredibly quickly,

497
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,480
 was part of that transformation.

498
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,480
 I don't know why.

499
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,160
 I don't really have anything to bite into that.

500
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,400
 I don't know why I have that impression, but I do.

501
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:27,080
 Like maybe it was the obelisk that enveloped him to let him know that he was selected.

502
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,840
 Maybe it was the fact that he was dropped back on Earth.

503
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,400
 Like you figure the aliens would have a little more consideration for him than going, "You

504
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,800
 might be our champion, no you're not, your garbage kick you out."

505
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,720
 If they thought he had the qualities to be picked out of 7 billion people to be a champion

506
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,880
 in the first place, you think they would then put him back on Earth and let him live his

507
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,880
 life.

508
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,440
 Because obviously they didn't seem as some sort of guinea pig.

509
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,120
 They wanted him to be that hero.

510
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:58,800
 I believe that he was selected, but he had to transform.

511
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,360
 His death on this planet was not the end.

512
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:07,000
 It was the caterpillar turning into the butterfly.

513
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,440
 So although the KGB may have considered him crazy and his fellow soldiers may have considered

514
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:17,600
 him a deserter, and most UFO researchers, if they stumble across this story, may consider

515
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:26,360
 it a cautionary tale of alien abduction and refusal, I believe that this young man did

516
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,960
 become that hero, did become that warrior.

517
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:37,200
 He went through that transformation on Earth and in his last moments was brought back aboard

518
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:44,080
 that alien craft, new and reborn, to save the galactic civilization.

519
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:52,800
 So to pavle that man out there somewhere in the stars, I hope your journey was a good

520
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,800
 one.

521
00:27:53,800 --> 00:28:01,080
 I hope you accomplished your mission, and I hope you found a home that accepts you.

522
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:07,760
 Because while your mortal body may lie here on Earth, to countless billions across the

523
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:16,280
 stars, you are the hero of Gemini.

524
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,200
