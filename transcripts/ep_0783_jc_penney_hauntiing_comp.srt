1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
 put down that bowl of stewed tomatoes because today we're gonna take a look at

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,640
 a Chinese artist who did whatever it took to make a point or so I don't even

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,840
 know what the point of his thing was but he did something super gross and then

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,560
 we travel to the bedroom of a young boy who's trying to catch some peaceful

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,840
 sleep instead he finds himself thrust into a world of the afterlife where

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,880
 nothing is as it seems today on Dead Rabbit Radio

 China there is a little restaurant actually sorry about to get a lot of

23
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,680
 trouble actually we could get about to get in a lot of trouble with various

24
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,000
 governments over the world we're actually starting off the story by heading to

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,480
 Taiwan

26
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:10,360
 Durchable kind of turns a little bit right we're headed to Taiwan in Taiwan in

27
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,880
 Chaiye City in Taiwan there's a little restaurant and we walk into the

28
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,040
 restaurant ding ding ding little door little doorbell and we sit down at the

29
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,520
 tables and the cook comes up to us and he goes I know what you guys are here for

30
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,760
 you guys are here for the special you guys look like a bunch of disgusting

31
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,600
 human beings you guys are here for the most special food I have and he goes to

32
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:38,600
 orders of yin yang fish that was the sound that was the sound of a couple

33
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,760
 people shutting off the podcast because they know exactly where this one's going

34
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,360
 the yin yang fish it's this real delicacy and this is how you perform it so

35
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,560
 now we're back in the kitchen we're watching him cook this and he goes and

36
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,440
 he reaches into a big bucket of water and he pulls out a fish like a carp like a

37
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,160
 big old fish right and it's like breathing if it's not breathing that's

38
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,640
 the thing it's a fish he pulls it out of the water it's trying to breathe but it

39
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,400
 can't it's just breathing in oxygen and so then he goes guys you guys are gonna

40
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,240
 love you guys you guys are sick you guys are sick individuals right you guys

41
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,040
 are gonna love this he then takes the yin yang fish and he starts to scale it

42
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,280
 descale it while it's still alive and we're like looking at each other like

43
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,680
 oh it's kind of messed up like does that hurt he's like oh fish I don't know does

44
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,280
 anything hurt does anything hurt he has no nerve any since he was born without

45
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,800
 the ability to feel pain he starts descaling himself he's like look it I'm

46
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,920
 not feeling anything he's bleeding all over the kitchen we're like oh he

47
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:43,880
 descales the fish while it's still alive and he's like and then he takes out

48
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:49,480
 like a filet knife and we're like oh no and he starts to gut the fish while it's

49
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,160
 still alive and we're just looking at his little mouth going ah mama then he

50
00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:02,120
 takes the fish and he holds it up by its head and he dips it into boiling oil

51
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:08,360
 all the way up to its head and it pulls it out this guy has now been completely

52
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,680
 burned but you can still eat it if you still have an appetite and the yin yang

53
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,440
 fish also known as the dead or alive fish is served to you and it's been

54
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:24,440
 cooked alive gutted alive descaled alive and while you're eating it its head is

55
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:34,240
 looking at you and its mouth is moving there's videos of this which I'm

56
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,760
 unfortunate enough that I was reading the article but then I was like well I

57
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,840
 gotta see I gotta see a video of this and sure enough it's exactly how I

58
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,760
 described it so let me describe it to you again in graphic detail I'm gonna

59
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,520
 watch the video and talk along with it so here's the thing so this video came

60
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,200
 out and it went viral and people were really really upset the fact that you

61
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,840
 were eating this fish while it was still alive which I don't know what's more

62
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:04,720
 horrific being cooked alive or being cooked half alive and then like you're

63
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,160
 sitting there you're like remember that old Tom Petty music video this video

64
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,640
 terrified me as a kid that old Tom Petty video where Alice in Wonderland is

65
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,320
 trying to run away from Tom Petty and then he turns her into a cake and then

66
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,920
 they eat her that I that movie that oh my god that terrified me as a kid but

67
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,680
 anyways and she's looking she's like no no they're eating me no I need my thighs

68
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,280
 what would be worse to be cooked alive or to be cooked just enough that you can

69
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,560
 watch yourself be eaten I guess actually that's not even the one where you're

70
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,280
 watching yourself be eaten is the worst but these people are eating this fish and

71
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,000
 he's like looking at them imagine I don't know why he tried to put you into this

72
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,240
 hellish position but someone takes a spoonful of you and then you see the

73
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,120
 spoonful of you move past your eyes into someone's mouth that's what I'm trying

74
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,640
 to get at that's what this fish is seeing absolutely despicable now the chef

75
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:02,800
 says listen he's saying this from behind bars they get ready to execute him no

76
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,120
 no he actually had a little bit of blowback from this but apparently they

77
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,160
 still sell it he goes listen you idiots you guys are morons the fish is

78
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:17,160
 obviously dead the fish died when I removed its guts right it died it

79
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,920
 suffocated from not being able to breathe what you're seeing is simply the

80
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,520
 synapses what you're seeing is the nerve endings you see it's just simulating

81
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,400
 that it's an undying agony it's actually been dead for a while that's his

82
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,600
 defense now again imagine you were corpse I was joking imagine you were a corpse

83
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,960
 and someone is pretending you were alive we did that episode a long time ago I

84
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,200
 don't even remember what it was where people were putting soy sauce in the

85
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,240
 octopus brains and would make the octopus dance around on your plate and I

86
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,240
 thought what if you could put a soy sauce helmet on a captured soldier and

87
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,440
 you'd turn him into a zombie and have him run across the battlefield like what

88
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,800
 a psychological weapon that would be it would be super convainting you have the

89
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,480
 special forces they're bringing along all their gear and then they also have this

90
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,800
 giant industrial sized soy sauce packet they're like trying to tear the tip off

91
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,200
 and just squeeze into some dude's brain but what it work the point is is like

92
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,360
 whether or not the fish is alive the fish the fish it looks like it's an

93
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,960
 agony it's a horrible all around so I read about this yin-yang fish and it's

94
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,400
 just gross and there's a video of people eating it and it's looking at him and

95
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,640
 maybe he's still alive maybe he's not but then that led me to look at more

96
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:37,320
 disgusting stuff so now we're headed to mainland China so hop back in this

97
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:45,080
 dead rabbit dirgeable we're going to Beijing to meet a man known as Zhu Yu in

98
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,600
 the 90s he became super popular and you know like there's different types of

99
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,520
 art schools like there's like hi I'm a cubist so like I draw pictures and

100
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,720
 everyone looks like Minecraft or I'm like gothic so it's like I make pillars

101
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,840
 and hide-and-sme-clothes and like gothic art everything super spooky in the

102
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,520
 candles or like you just walk around candles through spooky houses and then

103
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:13,080
 there's like modern art which is like here's some dust you walk into the

104
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,640
 exhibit they just throw dust in your eyes that'll be $500 please that's art

105
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:21,760
 you have all these different schools of arts Picasso did something I think he

106
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:28,840
 was like cube cube I think he was a cubist as well I did take an art history

107
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,440
 class in college technically I took a heart is art history class I never went

108
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,200
 though it's super boring there weren't enough hot girls in the class to keep me

109
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,080
 interested but anyways so all of that has led up to that monologue there's

110
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,880
 different types of art but there is a school of art known as the cadaver school

111
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:56,560
 and that is where your milieu your genre of art is body part stuff there's

112
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,680
 enough of these people that they have their own school it's not like Hogwarts

113
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,960
 it's not like there's like a physical school you can go to or is there but you

114
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,360
 go to a mortuary and you walk in between the fourth and fifth body and then you

115
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,720
 end up in the cadaver school it's enough artists worldwide that they use that as

116
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,920
 their template they use that as their canvas the blood is my paint in the

117
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,760
 sin you'd flesh is where I put stuff it's not just one sicko there's enough of

118
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,720
 these lunatics out there that they formed their own school and so Zhu Yu in

119
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,160
 China is one of these guys and he had here let's look at some of his art

120
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,120
 because I've learned from doing the show that I love going through performance

121
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,240
 art I would never attend one in real life I think it's super boring but I love

122
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,040
 reading about them because they're super lame so anyways here's this guy he'd

123
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:50,360
 made a art one of his art pieces was called skin graft where he had skin

124
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:58,200
 cut from himself and put on a giant flank a giant cut of pork he could chase

125
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,000
 this awesome you're telling me I can go to an art show and watch a man get his

126
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,320
 skin cut off no I don't think so I think he just brought the most interesting

127
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,640
 part is him screaming in agony he's like this is all for the cadaver school as

128
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,960
 he's cutting out this piece of skin no he just shows up with a big piece of

129
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:18,400
 pork and goes that's my skin on there that's super lame dude then he has this

130
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,960
 thing this is better this is better I might go to this one go to this one just

131
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:29,560
 to pull pranks he had a thing called pocket theology in 1999 he had got this

132
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,760
 room and he had a long coiling rope pretty much covering every inch of the

133
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,840
 floor so there's just a rope everywhere and then the rope is hanging so it's like

134
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:45,280
 all this rope on the ground and then the rope is hanging from a severed arm a

135
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:51,720
 severed human arm is holding onto this rope and the arm is stuck on a meat hook

136
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:58,800
 that's hanging from the ceiling so it's this decayed rotting arm holding this

137
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,440
 rope and the art exhibit is you have to walk over the rope as the viewer it's

138
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,080
 like in the middle of this museum so basically you're walking you get to

139
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,880
 this room and the only way to continue on to the dinosaur exhibit the only way

140
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,120
 to get to the gift shop you have to walk over this rope now and when I first

141
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,320
 read that I got laughing to the thought of this smelly human arm hanging I

142
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,240
 thought that would be creepy because you're not just walking over any rope

143
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,000
 you're basically walking over an extension of this rotting arm it's an

144
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,720
 interesting trick it was just a rope on the ground some other lesser lame or

145
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,840
 artist out there right would be like oh this is called rope it's called the

146
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,680
 tangled of the masses pay me ten thousand dollars and I'll throw this rope in

147
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,960
 your museum like I don't have a lot of appreciation for modern art and it's so

148
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,800
 funny because I happen to run in circles of people who've loved this type of

149
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,640
 garbage and it's just a miracle of sociology that I can get along a lot of

150
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,800
 my friends would be like oh my god tangled of the masses is coming to

151
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:05,400
 Portland I can't wait anyways it doesn't involve body parts or

152
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:11,240
 Optimus Prime I am not there so zoo you also have this this is what he's most

153
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,600
 famous for and if you didn't shut off when I said ying ying fish I'm sure a

154
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,280
 lot of people shut off when I said zoo you this is what he's most famous for in

155
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:25,000
 the East Link gallery back in 2000 in Shanghai China there's this art

156
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,600
 exposition it's supposed to be all of this like outsider art like really in

157
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:36,000
 your face art at the East Link gallery in 2000 and zoo you shows up with a set of

158
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:44,200
 photographs but what the photographs were were disgusting and really I think

159
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,400
 disgusting is probably underselling it zoo you have this exhibit it was called

160
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:54,280
 eating people and what he did a lot of people have tried disputing this but he

161
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:59,000
 has never disputed it people have tried changing and saying oh no no he later in

162
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,720
 life he said that it wasn't true I could find no record that he ever denied this

163
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,000
 snopes ran a big article about saying oh no no it's not true it's not true he

164
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,040
 has never denied it and even in the snopes article they were saying well

165
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,000
 well what he did might have been true but we think it was this like people have

166
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,920
 been going out of their way to dispute something that he has never denied doing

167
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,800
 eating people is zoo you it's a series of photographs of him sitting there

168
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:33,200
 eating a six-month-old human fetus these photos went viral and what it became was

169
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,000
 this thing and you might have seen these photos back in the early 2000s they were

170
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 saying this huge thing like look at what they're eating in China they're eating

171
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,960
 babies here's a photo of just a normal Chinese guy sitting down for a delicious

172
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,800
 breakfast and so people were debunking that and that's where snopes came in and

173
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,600
 they're like normal Chinese people are not eating babies this is a photo that's

174
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,520
 attributed to a performance artist and snopes goes on to say we don't even

175
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,720
 believe he's eating the baby we think they took a duck and put a doll's head on

176
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,680
 it I don't know much about human anatomy but I know it doesn't look a lot like duck

177
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,400
 anatomy anyways he does not deny it he came out and said there's nothing wrong

178
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,800
 with cannibalism and he's he puts it out like this there's another wrong with

179
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:23,360
 cannibalism as long as it can be done in a way with that does not end in a crime

180
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,080
 being committed so if someone is willingly giving their body in his mind I

181
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,880
 think it's disgusting right I'm not giving him any wiggle room but he's

182
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,400
 saying as long as you can not commit a crime while committing cannibalism is

183
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,520
 there anything wrong with cannibalism he said that he said it's not forbidden by

184
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:49,600
 any laws or religion which I'm pretty here's the thing I don't know if that's

185
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,840
 true it may is it against a lot of eat people I know they have things like

186
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:01,760
 abuse of a corpse is a law so you and they could classify cannibalism of that

187
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,560
 if you someone dies of natural means but then you turn them into a marionette

188
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,880
 puppet that's a crime right if you eat them and there there's no survival

189
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:18,120
 situation that would be a crime as well I don't know honestly if in the Bible

190
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,840
 they talk about cannibalism and it's weird because they were constantly

191
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,320
 starving to death back then I think people were eating each other I do

192
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,000
 remember reading books about ancient warfare ancient Hebrew warfare is real

193
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,640
 Israeli warfare and there would be sieges and people would eat each other

194
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,800
 back then but I don't know if in the Bible it specifically says don't eat

195
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:44,280
 people what's so bizarre is he views his artwork as a protest he's protesting

196
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:50,040
 people he's protesting people who don't like cannibalism so he's basically

197
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,960
 protesting everyone here I'll tell you exactly what happened with this dude so

198
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,360
 you exactly what happened to this dude he says he he almost threw up a couple

199
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,920
 times all he's getting ready to eat this baby but he finally was able to eat it

200
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,920
 and he's never denied it nowadays he's like painting pebbles and rocks and he's

201
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,680
 doing like art art he's doing Jason art he's doing art and Jason would consider

202
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,480
 art I think he just wanted some attention I think there is my two scenarios

203
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,160
 here's my three scenarios one he's a groundbreaking artist who would stop at

204
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,040
 nothing no matter what taboos were in front of him could have been doing that

205
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,520
 to he could just have been an attention seeker I think that a lot of

206
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,200
 performance artists are comedians who stand up comedians who have stage fright

207
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,200
 so they just do wacky stuff and they do stuff out of the sight of others and

208
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:41,960
 take photographs and things like that of it or this was some sicko sex thing as

209
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,360
 well right we can't discount that he's just always wanted to eat somebody when

210
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,440
 he was a young kid he saw that movie alive about the Brazilian soccer players

211
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:55,400
 crashing into the mountain and he's like that's me I want to do that someday in

212
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,360
 his entire life he was going to enter any job possible that would allow him to eat

213
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,000
 people first off he tried playing soccer that didn't pan out and then he tried

214
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,400
 becoming like an adventurer hoping he'd get stranded with a bunch of people in

215
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,920
 a cave and then maybe eat them but people got a little worried because he never

216
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,240
 brought like survival gear he just brought a fork and knife everywhere and

217
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,800
 then he goes you know what I'll do I'll just be a performance artist then I'll

218
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:21,320
 eat a baby like okay that last one might be the most convoluted of the three he

219
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:25,680
 probably sees himself as the taboo breaking artist but I so weird and

220
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:32,120
 gross right eating the baby eating the baby if it's a little more intense than

221
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,600
 just listening to an M&M song so when you're talking about art and pushing

222
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:42,040
 buttons that just seems too much I have since we're here no let's go on to the

223
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,840
 next segment let's go ahead hop in that dead rabbit durable let's head to London

224
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,360
 England because I'll cover this guy as well he's another performance artist he

225
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:55,360
 actually beat out a zoo you by a couple years he'd been doing this stuff before

226
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:02,880
 his name is Rick Gibson and he back in 1984 made a set of earrings that don't

227
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,840
 tell me I don't know why all this stuff I really don't know why I found all this

228
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,080
 stuff in the same two or three days the Google algorithm must be doing my job

229
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:19,560
 for me or it just must be possessed by MOLOC Rick Gibson decided to start wearing

230
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,280
 these earrings I don't know if he wore him around town I don't know I might for

231
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,080
 all I know he made him and took a photograph of him and show that the

232
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:33,520
 museum it was matching earrings and each one was a 10-week-old fetus so it's

233
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,200
 like hey he's dancing he's like hey ladies what's going on they're like oh

234
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,240
 my god it's the most disgusting thing ever so then he's like I shouldn't wear

235
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,320
 these out to pick up women or women who do go home with them that's just wrong

236
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,080
 right they're like oh I really love your earrings in that then he had this weird

237
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,280
 down slide he had this weird down slide he did that that's a big show stuff right

238
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,760
 like how do you where do you go from wearing fetus earrings in 1986 he stood

239
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,600
 in front of government buildings in England holding a rat he had this rat

240
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,760
 and he would hold it up in front of the doors because get it like government

241
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,000
 officials are rats oh that's lame dude I'm not saying I'm not saying go harder into

242
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,920
 the fetus stuff but what a come down he's holding up the rat get it they're

243
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:24,160
 rats but then he came back he came back swinging hard July 23rd 1988 he's in

244
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,840
 London everyone's like oh great he's doing the rat thing again boring he's like

245
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,440
 oh no I need something super crazy he cannibalism he goes the cannibalism

246
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,080
 route he's eating a canape you know what a canape is I didn't it's a crack it's a

247
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,400
 cheese and cracker right it's that's what we would just call it hey can I have

248
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,440
 some cheese and crackers but I guess I guess if you want to spend $50 on a

249
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,800
 cracker after you've gone seen the tangle of the masses you take a cracker you put

250
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:54,160
 some cheese on it maybe like a tomato or some basil or something like that he is

251
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,880
 standing in the middle of London and he has one of those and he's like doodododo

252
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,920
 and he puts on top of it this is so gross this to me is grosser than the fetus

253
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,640
 because I can't really comprehend that right like I have seen pictures of fetus

254
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,720
 I've seen the photos of this guy eating the fetus the zoo you guy but it's all

255
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,160
 alien it's an abstract thought to me I've never held a baby I've seen them from

256
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:20,600
 afar they terrify me what I do know I do know a lot about because I'm constantly

257
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:25,960
 looking at my throat because I always have sore throats is tonsils so this

258
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:37,760
 dude has this cracker and on top of it he has human tonsils and he eats it now

259
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:43,480
 that's hard that's relatable no one likes tonsils right there everywhere

260
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,640
 they're constantly coming out of mouths you can eat that I would have been I

261
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:52,400
 would have been Bravo Bravo then he had to updo that right you your performance

262
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,160
 artist you're an artist you have to keep doing better and better April 15th a

263
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:03,080
 year later 1989 this time he shows up and the police are ready for him because

264
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,620
 the fetus earings were gross but it's like 1984 and people are like what

265
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:12,920
 huh it's just super bizarre and then the rat thing was so lame but now he's just

266
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,240
 ate some human tonsils the previous year it was this huge uproar the police

267
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,120
 are looking for this guy they're looking for him he's like constantly hanging

268
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:25,560
 outside a dentist office he's like more delicious tonsils this time he shows up

269
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:31,760
 and he eats so he has two of these to eat he has two of this segment is going

270
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,240
 on way too long but I'm getting way too much enjoyment he has two of these to

271
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:41,580
 eat so start thinking about body parts that you can eat two of and you can put

272
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:47,180
 in your pocket we'll say so it's not feet which have really big pockets he

273
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:51,260
 sits there and he has two of these and he eats the first one and people are just

274
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:56,180
 sickened they're outraged what it's so gross and the police move in and they

275
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:01,420
 arrest this guy and during the scuffle he drops the second one and rolling around

276
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:08,380
 the truth story rolling around in the streets of London falls out of his hand

277
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:15,480
 a human testicle so it ain't the first one no problem you can always eat at

278
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,600
 least one testicle no one can stop that first swallow but when they saw him go

279
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,240
 oh and then they saw him reach into his pocket to pull out the other milky white

280
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,480
 I imagine they're like giant wall I imagine it's like oh if you took a wall

281
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,060
 nut and dipped it in milk maybe white paint maybe for a little more viscosity

282
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:37,940
 but they have this we have this walnut size thing and it's rolling around the

283
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,940
 ground and I can just imagine as the cops are cuffing him he's like no lefty

284
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,540
 no he's watching this left testicle kind of roll down the streets getting close

285
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:50,580
 to the sewer will it fall in no it doesn't actually apparently one of his

286
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:54,780
 supporters can you believe this guy has fans one of his supporters must have

287
00:22:54,780 --> 00:23:00,480
 scooped up the testicle good old lefty because this dude I don't remember his

288
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,040
 name it's too busy talking about what he's eating Rick Gibson gets taken gets

289
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,640
 arrested gets taken to jail gets released right with not a big deal the judge goes

290
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,200
 there's really not a crime against eating human testicles we're assuming

291
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,760
 it's from a willing donor and then a year later he shows up that exact same

292
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:26,500
 spot he has that other testicle all he eats that one as well what's worse

293
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:33,460
 what's really worth eating a human testicle or eating a testicle that's

294
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:41,460
 been sitting out for a year right that's discovered makes it even worse I

295
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:45,220
 don't think he was just sitting in his cupboard next to his top rom and it's

296
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:48,800
 like slowly getting moldy and it's like getting harder and harder he's like oh

297
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:53,080
 now really is like a walnut yes he's a nutcracker to get to the juicy goodness I

298
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,640
 don't know I don't I'm so he put it in the fridge then you got to worry like

299
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,200
 did he get freezer burn did it ruin the flavor did he really get the full

300
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,160
 flavor of the testicle a year later Nigel let's go ahead and toss you the

301
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:10,840
 keys to the carbonicopter we are leaving behind all of this madness in London we

302
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:15,580
 are headed all the way out to a tiny little house in the middle of the

303
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:24,820
 suburbs to the story online very very interesting story with really bizarre

304
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:29,020
 implications let's kind of dig into this real quick here there's this young boy

305
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:35,100
 young 12 year old boy let's call him Robbie Robbie has a best friend named

306
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:41,840
 Devin who's about to turn 10 years old but shortly before Devin's 10th birthday

307
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,240
 he's killed in a car accident little Devin little nine-year-old Devin is

308
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:53,560
 walking down the street there's a driver has a seizure she loses control of the

309
00:24:53,560 --> 00:25:01,320
 car it jumps the curb and runs him over now Robbie didn't know that this had

310
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:09,780
 happened the day that it all took place he wasn't there and his parents didn't

311
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:15,060
 know how to tell him like this is the first real loss as a child is losing

312
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:18,660
 one of your friends like that they didn't know what to do so they actually

313
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:24,460
 asked his aunt hey would you mind taking Robbie for a couple days we need to get

314
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:29,260
 some stuff settled here yeah yeah sure of course and that day when he gets home

315
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:32,040
 from school he actually packs up and goes to stay at his aunt's house for a

316
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:37,440
 couple days he has no idea what's happened to Devin and that night that

317
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:45,320
 very first night after Devin had passed away Robbie has a dream he dreams he's

318
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:52,760
 in a department store like a JC Penney's so you got the linoleum floors that give

319
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,600
 you a guided pathway through the store and then the carpeted areas where all of

320
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:02,140
 the fixtures are at you have racks and racks of clothes the perfume counter

321
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:07,540
 those pillars that kind of dot the landscape and then you have the clothes

322
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:15,060
 on the circular racks you'd always see a sea of those as well you would just sit

323
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,740
 there and you kind of flip through the clothes like you're looking through a

324
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:24,500
 magazine page by page and they'd be on these circular racks and these racks if

325
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,200
 you've ever been in a malls which I kind of have to say because not everyone

326
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,240
 gets the opportunity to go in a malls or department stores anymore that they

327
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,200
 exist less and less but there was all I mean shopping is super boring rather go

328
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,140
 see performance art and go shopping but I was always dragged going shopping with

329
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:45,640
 my mom standing there and those circular racks were always creepy to me

330
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:51,200
 because they were child height and you never saw was on the other side of them

331
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,160
 now it was kind of that mixed bag like sometimes we like to hide in them it was

332
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,540
 funny for us to go in there as children and be like who wonder where I'm at play

333
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:05,120
 hide-and-seek and in a crowded department store we did that back in the day but

334
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,660
 it's also creepy because they're the perfect size for a kid to get lost in

335
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,860
 their perfect size for a kid to get pulled into who knows what's in there

336
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,600
 so there's this weird fascination I think that you have with those circular

337
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,120
 racks in this dream Robbie is seeing these circular racks and out of one of

338
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:28,960
 the racks Devin pops out sticks a little head out of the rack of clothes

339
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,400
 Robbie goes hey Devin what's going on hey how's it going and Devin snuck back

340
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:40,720
 into the rack what Robbie's looking here and he's looking in this department

341
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,800
 store and people are just kind of shuffling around shopping and he sees

342
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:50,920
 Devin poke his head out of another rack of clothes just kind of looking at Robbie

343
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:55,280
 Devin what's going on hey man how's it going we play hide-and-go-seek who's it

344
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:01,960
 I'm assuming I am since you're the one he ducked back into the rack of clothes and

345
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,760
 so Robbie begins to walk through the department store and every time he gets

346
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:13,000
 to a circular rack he sees Devin's head pop out of it but as he gets closer

347
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,880
 Devin disappears back into the circular rack and appears at a farther off one so

348
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,880
 no matter how far Robbie's moving through the store he's always not able to

349
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,880
 catch up to Devin and this happens Devin keeps getting farther and farther away

350
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,840
 in these racks of clothes he's popping out farther and farther away and then for

351
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:47,400
 the first time in this dream Devin speaks he says I have to go

352
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:57,960
 Robbie wakes up later later that week Robbie is told that Devin had passed

353
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:04,200
 away Devin was killed in that accident and so that dream kind of sat on Robbie

354
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,320
 was obviously a difficult dream and when he found out that that was the night

355
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:15,520
 that Devin had died made it even more impactful six months after this whole

356
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:21,000
 thing he's visiting Devin's house for the first time since the accident he went

357
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,880
 there and he's talking to the stepmom and he's talking to Devin siblings and

358
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:30,120
 they're just kind of reminiscing and when I'll detail this whole thing that

359
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:36,520
 Robbie was saying was so weird was that the stepmom Devin stepmom showed him a

360
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:43,560
 little container full of teeth and she said I got these from the accident scene

361
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:49,400
 when Devin got hit by the car and knocked out some of his teeth I saved

362
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:56,840
 him she's holding out this little container for Robbie to see so just an

363
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:02,480
 odd a detail to it a grief you know the grieving process so Robbie was really

364
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,640
 creeped out by that but he was even more creeped out by the fact that he's

365
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,440
 talking to the stepmom and the stepmom goes you want you want to know the

366
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,680
 weirdest thing about all of this I'm you know other than the teeth I'm collecting

367
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:24,880
 I had a dream about Devin after he died I had a dream I was in this big

368
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:31,160
 department store you know normal typical department store the clothing on those

369
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:38,080
 circular racks and I'm standing in this department store and Devin popped out of

370
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:45,440
 one of the racks and no matter how close I got to him he was always just out of

371
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,760
 reach

372
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:56,960
 it's an interesting creepy story it makes you wonder about what the natures of

373
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,880
 dreams are are they a way for spirits to communicate with us what's really going

374
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,240
 on the fact that he didn't know that that's pretty standard in ghost lore and

375
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,880
 dream lore people having no news of an event that has happened and then in

376
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,320
 their dream being alerted to someone who had died earlier that day a long time

377
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,720
 listener of the show Beatrice sent me in a story that's very similar to this about

378
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:24,120
 her grandmother who passed away came to her in a dream and she wasn't aware that

379
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:28,180
 the grandmother had died in the sleep so and it's very standard for good thanks

380
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:32,880
 for sharing the story Beatrice as well it's very standard for ghost lore stuff

381
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,440
 so a standard interesting ghost story it correlates with the lore the things that

382
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,320
 we know about ghosts what when I was reading this story though what I was

383
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,960
 thinking was like we all got the imagery right when I described it you could

384
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,640
 almost you can imagine the lighting the right lighting for this JC pennies you

385
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,440
 can imagine exactly how it's laid out here's my question I've been thinking

386
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,560
 about this a lot kid poking his head out from the turnstile of the clothing the

387
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:05,640
 rolling racks that's creepy right no one liked being around those things because

388
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,560
 they were creepy you would always think someone would get out and get you I told

389
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:13,480
 the story about Beatrice's grandmother who came back to say it's okay honey I

390
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,560
 love you after the grandmother had passed away and Beatrice didn't know

391
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:22,200
 about that I left out the part where Beatrice's grandma is floating is like

392
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:28,200
 floating down the hallway here's my question do ghosts know they're being

393
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:35,480
 creepy do ghosts understand because he used to be alive they should be fully

394
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:41,080
 aware that floating floating down the hallway doing inhuman things is going

395
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:47,120
 to scare us appearing to us late at night popping out of the turnstiles of

396
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,320
 clothing just until your friend gets a little bit closer and then you disappear

397
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:55,320
 and then do it out another one not only is that terrifying you're kind of a

398
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:02,480
 jerk do ghosts understand they're being creepy now sure we could say the

399
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,840
 malevolent ghosts the demons things like that that's their goal what about the

400
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,360
 time so little little little Robbie I think his name was recording this way

401
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:18,800
 recording this hours later the original ending went on for a long time and it

402
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,440
 wasn't that good this is my second take what do we call I think it was Robbie or

403
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,360
 is that that's the kid from the first story from Mexico he's like hey for

404
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:30,960
 yesterday's episode is the factory still haunted anyways the point is is that

405
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,120
 imagine imagine you were the narrator of that story and how distraught you you

406
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,480
 don't even know your friends dead yet and how to start you would feel you know

407
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:44,040
 something's off and you're trying to just say hi you're being led in your dream

408
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:49,640
 and he gets disappearing why would Devon's ghost choose to do that twice he

409
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:54,360
 did it to his stepmom too he's like that was so funny what I did that other kid I

410
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,520
 totally forgot his name that lame oh he's still alive I don't even remember who

411
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:03,200
 he is I had so much fun doing that I'm gonna do it to my stepmom and give me my

412
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,640
 teeth back you weirdo that's so weird that's like it's just a sad detail about

413
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:14,380
 collecting the teeth having the teeth but anyways I mean that that's how real

414
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:20,280
 people in real life are creepy but let's talk about how people in the world of

415
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,600
 the dead could be creepy and I don't know if I've given them credit yet this all

416
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:29,080
 came from an online post written by couple technical 16 795 so couple

417
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,400
 technical if I haven't given you a shot out yet I apologize but yeah just to

418
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,960
 wrap it up like when I'm reading the storm thing and does Devon know how

419
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:42,960
 creepy this is do ghosts choose to do creepy things or do ghosts live in a

420
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,000
 since they're in the afterlife and they live in this different dimension is it

421
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,880
 so irrational like they think they're things when he's doing is totally normal

422
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:58,480
 he's in a brand new reality thinking about like floating a couple inches off

423
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,960
 the floor of the hallway at night coming through the doors being like I love

424
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,640
 you I'm just gonna tear anyone I mean it was a beautiful story of a grandmother's

425
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:14,640
 love piercing the veil but would you choose to do that if one if you passed

426
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,200
 away and you had to greet one of your loved ones we're like what's the heaviest

427
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:22,520
 chains I can borrow what's the spookiest time I can't appear no you would show

428
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,840
 what like I would show up right and I'd show up how everyone always remembered

429
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:33,920
 me unwashed jeans and a t-shirt and I would walk and I would sit there they'd

430
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,720
 be like do it'd be like in the middle of lunch or something like that they're

431
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,280
 trying to work they're on their commute to work and I'm like hey guys what's up

432
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:44,960
 sit in the fast food seat ah I would show up and I'd be like hey remember me it

433
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,600
 was of course you remember me I'm totally awesome and they're like they're

434
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,720
 holding their noses they're like uh you just don't wash your jeans in the

435
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,080
 afterlife either I was like listen hey man I really loved you and I wish I

436
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:58,240
 could have told you one last time how cool you were but I died horrible

437
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:04,680
 harpoon accident so here I am I just have this giant harpoon sticking through my

438
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:09,760
 heart I'm dripping ectoplasm all over your staking eggs here I am I just

439
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,520
 came to give you hug and I chased you around the house trying to take you

440
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,680
 with me that's probably what I would do that's probably what I would do if I was

441
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,720
 a ghost I guess that answers the questions ghosts know they're doing

442
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,960
 creepy things and it's hilarious
