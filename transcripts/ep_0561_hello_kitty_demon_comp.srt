1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,400
 First off, we celebrate the life and times of Alex Trebek as I tell you the story of

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,280
 how I met him and his bodyguard almost beat me up.

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,680
 And then we travel to a pizza hut, cause we're hungry after running away from Alex Trebek's

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,400
 bodyguard.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,000
 We're going there for the pizza and maybe play a couple video games.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,840
 Little do we know this pizza hut is haunted.

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:33,040
 And then we travel to Japan, home of Hello Kitty, everyone's favorite white cat.

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,360
 But did you know that Hello Kitty may not be an adorable icon.

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,880
 It may actually be a gateway to hell.

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,600
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:53,560
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,560
 I'm your host Jason Garvin, and I'm having a great day.

13
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,880
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,280
 My back's doing better for you long time listeners.

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,280
 If this is your first episode, you're like, I don't care how your back is doing.

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,320
 I actually hate podcasts where people have good backs.

17
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,840
 Let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Cindy Pereira.

18
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,320
 Cindy Pereira now.

19
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,400
 I actually looked that up under a Google pronunciation thing.

20
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,200
 I can't even say the word pronunciation.

21
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,800
 Cindy Pereira.

22
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,800
 So I hope that's correct.

23
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,400
 If it's not, I apologize, send me the correct pronunciation.

24
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,760
 Cindy, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

25
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,960
 Just help spread the word about the show.

27
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,280
 Really, really helps out a lot.

28
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,480
 Cindy, I'm going to toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

29
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,520
 We're going up, up and away, and back in time to the early 2000s.

30
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,040
 Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.

31
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,800
 We're listening to NSYNC.

32
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,480
 Those are flying through the time for it.

33
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,840
 It lasts forever.

34
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,360
 We listened to bye, bye, bye for 400 years.

35
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,200
 And eventually, end up in the early 2000s and we land at Sunrise Mall, we're in Citrus

36
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,200
 Heights, California.

37
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,400
 So we're walking around Sunrise Mall, dude.

38
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,600
 If you weren't alive during the 2000s or you weren't old enough to remember how awesome

39
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,360
 the 2000s were, yes, we were in a constant state of war.

40
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,600
 It was a lot better than it is today.

41
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,640
 Like the late 90s, early 2000s was dope.

42
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,920
 But anyways, we're walking around, we're flexing on all the fetuses that haven't been

43
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,920
 born yet.

44
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,920
 Hey, what's up?

45
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,920
 We're yelling at women's ovaries.

46
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,920
 What's up, dude?

47
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,920
 You can enjoy this.

48
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,760
 And people are like, what are you doing?

49
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,120
 What we're doing at Citrus Heights Sunrise Mall is, I remember one day I was sitting

50
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,360
 there, I was reading the newspaper, and they had a little article, it was a little blurb,

51
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,040
 and it said they were doing tryouts for two game shows.

52
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,360
 Wheel of Fortune.

53
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,240
 So basically the denies were empty that day as every elderly person in town scuttled to

54
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,880
 the local mall.

55
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,760
 And Jeopardy, they were doing Jeopardy tryouts.

56
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,720
 Now I don't want to say I'm the best at Jeopardy, but I'm pretty good.

57
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,000
 Now I knew, though, there's a difference between sitting in the break room at work and yelling

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,800
 out the answers before they can answer them.

59
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,760
 Like I'm in a relaxed environment, drinking a soda, eating a sandwich out of a vending

60
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,760
 machine.

61
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,360
 I know that the stakes are much higher when you're on the show, so they're not dummies.

62
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,400
 Sometimes they'll make mistakes and things like that.

63
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,160
 But I'm really good with sitting at home playing Jeopardy.

64
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,280
 So when Jeopardy tryouts were coming to town, I was like, "Haha, now I can prove to everyone

65
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,120
 that I buckle under pressure?"

66
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,080
 I'm okay yelling it across the living room, but in person it's going to be a lot harder.

67
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,200
 So I show up very, very early for Jeopardy tryouts.

68
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,320
 And I'm going to backtrack the story a bit right now.

69
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,400
 I should have told this part first, because this isn't terrible to the rest of the story.

70
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
 I'm a hat guy.

71
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,360
 I don't wear them all the time, but I do like collecting hats.

72
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,240
 I like getting hats that do one of two things.

73
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,840
 They're very unique hats, not like Jamerikwai furry hats, nothing like that.

74
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,960
 Like I have an Ninja Turtle hat.

75
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,280
 I wore that on the Halloween Patreon live stream part of my costume.

76
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,280
 I was a Leonardo.

77
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,200
 I have a bunch of other weird hats.

78
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,120
 Then I also have a collection of hats specifically to rile people up.

79
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,720
 I'm the guy, and it's funny, because some people go, "Well, they probably just think

80
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,120
 you're a hipster because you're doing that."

81
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,120
 And I'm like, "Oh, maybe."

82
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,120
 A little do they know.

83
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,640
 I'm actually trying to revoke them.

84
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,440
 I'm not doing this ironically.

85
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,640
 I'm the type of guy who have a couple of National Rifle Association hats, NRA hats, and I'll

86
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,880
 wear them to events where I know people hate the NRA.

87
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,840
 I'll go to Hop's Fest.

88
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,960
 And I don't dress like a hillbilly or anything.

89
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,240
 I don't have a full cosplay to go with it.

90
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,480
 I'll dress like a normal individual.

91
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,120
 Shoe shirts, you know what normal people wear.

92
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,120
 And I'll just wear an NRA hat.

93
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,560
 And I'll just walk in on the Hop's Fest or the Grape Festival or the Apple Fair or

94
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
 whatever.

95
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,880
 A place where generally people of the NRA are looked down on.

96
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,480
 And I'll just walk around wearing a hat.

97
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,720
 I do it specifically to make people feel uncomfortable.

98
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,280
 And my little brother a long time ago said, he goes, "Jason, you were a troll before that

99
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,920
 was even a thing.

100
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,600
 Before there were all were troll like you're a real life troll.

101
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,880
 You don't do it online.

102
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,520
 You will straight up troll people in the most dangerous of situations.

103
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,880
 Now, what are they going to do to me at the Hop's Fest, right?

104
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,880
 They're going to throw beer in my face.

105
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,880
 I'm like, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,

106
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,880

272
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:50,880
 used to be a morgue. Maybe, probably not. Morgues aren't normally built outside of strip

273
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:58,880
 malls. So like, "Hey honey, I'm going to go cremate the dog and why don't you go shopping?"

274
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,880
 Like usually morgues are on the outskirts of town. But anyway, so that is a rumor. One

275
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:09,880
 review said, "I walked into the restroom once and the water turned on by itself." So that

276
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,880
 complements the official narrative. That review also said, "That restroom is disgusting. The

277
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,880
 restroom at that Pizza Hut is super gross." That was actually the first. And then how gross

278
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:25,880
 does a restroom have to be? If you walk in, it's haunted. And the very first thing you say in

279
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,880
 your review is, "I walked into that gross restroom once and the water turned on by itself." That's

280
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,880
 pretty disgusting. But what I thought the most interesting comment was, was this one. This

281
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:41,880
 one really sent chills at my spine. There's a guy named Jeremy. And he said in the comment

282
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:46,880
 said he was actually a manager at that Pizza Hut 10 years ago. He goes, "Listen dude, we

283
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,880
 got tons of complaints about the place." Restrooms were super disgusting. But he said the

284
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,880
 employees would talk about hauntings and stuff like that. He goes, "The water would turn on

285
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,880
 by itself." He goes, "One day we came in, our lobby was flooded. So we did have problems

286
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,880
 with the water turning on by itself. We came in, the water was running." And then again,

287
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,880
 almost as an afterthought, he talks about the scariest thing you can think of at this Pizza Hut.

288
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:16,880
 Oh really, any restaurant? What's the darkest part of a restaurant? I'll give you a hint. As

289
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,880
 we're sitting at this Pizza Hut, eating pizza, our legs are in the darkest part of a restaurant.

290
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:29,880
 It's underneath the tables. And Jeremy told this story. They would see a little girl run

291
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:37,880
 through the Pizza Hut and then crawl underneath one of the tables and just hide there, laughing.

292
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:45,880
 She was seeing multiple times. And one customer, he goes, "One customer was standing there."

293
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:51,880
 And he saw a little girl run across the floor, go down, crawl underneath the table and just

294
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:58,880
 was there, laughing. And you look under the table, the girl's gone. Customers are like,

295
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:06,880
 "Dude, you can keep my two medium pizzas for $12.99. I'm out. I don't need. I'm not that hungry for pizza."

296
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,880
 That's creepy. That's Dead Rabbit Radio creepy to me. You can hear the disembodied voices.

297
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,880
 You can kind of rationalize stuff like that. The pipes, you can rationalize stuff like that.

298
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,880
 And even if you couldn't rationalize stuff like that, they're like, if you go in the corner

299
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,880
 or if you go in the storage room, if you go into the walk-in freezer, you hear a baby crying

300
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,880
 and you go, "Well, that's your job. I don't go to any of those places." You deal with it.

301
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:36,880
 But to think that when you're sitting in a booth at a restaurant, having a good time talking to someone,

302
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:44,880
 there is something under there. Like that's creepy. That's about as creepy as walking down the stairs

303
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,880
 into a basement. There are those stairs where you think someone can reach out and grab your ankles

304
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,880
 at any given time. But I actually think it's more creepy because when's the last time you walked down

305
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,880
 to a horror movie basement versus the last time you went into a restaurant and just sat there

306
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,880
 in the booth. And you think about all the times you see kids actually playing like that.

307
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,880
 And it makes it even more creepy that even in death, this little girl is still running

308
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,880
 and hiding underneath the booths. And then you think about how many times you're sitting there

309
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:18,880
 in a booth talking to someone, having a good time, and you feel something brush up against your leg.

310
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,880
 You know you do that thing where you look under the booth and you go, "Well, that wasn't their feet."

311
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:28,880
 And you figure out maybe you brushed your leg up against something else or they moved their foot away.

312
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,880
 But we've all done that, haven't we? You feel something brush up against your leg and you kind of look under the booth

313
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:39,880
 and you're, "That is Dead Rabbit Radio Creepy for me." That's that, Jeremy. Thanks for that comment

314
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:47,880
 because that made it extra spooky. Cindy Kahl in that Carbner copter, we are headed out to Japan.

315
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,880
 [imitates car engine]

316
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:56,880
 Helicopters leave me, I am in Glendale, Arizona. It's a long trip. Thankfully, I brought a bunch of pizza.

317
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,880
 We're headed out to Japan. But this story's curious because it doesn't start in Japan.

318
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:07,880
 I found this story on a website I talked about, I think it was yesterday, called Quatro Cantos.

319
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,880
 It means four corners. It's a Brazilian urban legend folklore mystery site.

320
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,880
 Now, there's translation errors. It's written in Portuguese, but then it was trans-- I had to Google translate this.

321
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:25,880
 So there's a little bit of translation barrier. But really, the headline is the headline, which is "Hello Kitty."

322
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:31,880
 The charming billion dollar kitten is the product of a pact with the devil?

323
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:37,880
 Question mark? Very, very good question mark. I normally put exclamation points like I'll probably put as the title of this episode.

324
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:44,880
 The story's pretty simple, but I wanted to cover it because I actually talked about it 100, 200 episodes ago.

325
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,880
 I had never heard this version of it, but thought this was interesting.

326
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:54,880
 We're walking around downtown Japan. It's November 1, 1974, and there's a young woman.

327
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:03,880
 She works for a company called-- I didn't write it down, but we'll pretend that I know the name of the company.

328
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:10,880
 So this woman's sitting there and she's drawing something. She's like, "I wish I knew who I worked for having unpaid in months.

329
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,880
 I don't know who to call to get paycheck." She's drawing stuff.

330
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:20,880
 What they did was this company made sandals, and they started putting really cute designs on the sandals, and they started selling more.

331
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,880
 Other than those disgusting sandals, they called them Pizza Hut sandals.

332
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,880
 They came out with a new line of sandals that looked beautiful and cute.

333
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:33,880
 So they started having their artists try to figure out cute designs, and this young woman, she draws Hello Kitty.

334
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,880
 And they put it-- her very first item was on a coin purse, and it flew off the shelves.

335
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,880
 People were buying Hello Kitty stuff left and right.

336
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,880
 To this point, it is a billion-dollar phenomenon.

337
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,880
 And she created that on November 1, 1974.

338
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:52,880
 But in 2008, we started to see emails travel around the world.

339
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,880
 A lot of them were written in Spanish. This conspiracy theory started in South America.

340
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:08,880
 The idea is this. In South America, there was a young couple, and their 12-year-old daughter had cancer of the mouth.

341
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:16,880
 She had mouth cancer. And the parents are like, "We don't know what to do. I'll do anything it takes to cure my daughter's mouth cancer."

342
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:31,880
 So no one knows for sure if it was the father or the wife, but one of them made a pact with the devil and said, "If you cure my daughter's mouth cancer, I will create an icon the world will worship. Please help my daughter."

343
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:37,880
 And so the devil took that deal. He cured the daughter's mouth cancer.

344
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:43,880
 And that husband or wife, the story isn't clear, designs Hello Kitty.

345
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:48,880
 Now what's interesting is we know who created Hello Kitty. I didn't write it down in my notes.

346
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:56,880
 But we know the date it was created. It was created in Japan. But this email purports that it was actually created by a South American couple.

347
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:08,880
 And the reason why this story spread around was even though basic facts are wrong, the word "kitty" in Chinese means "demon."

348
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:16,880
 It doesn't. It doesn't. There's nothing even close to that. But it's interesting because with language barriers, maybe they could work that out some way.

349
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:23,880
 But anyways, according to a Spanish email, the word "kitty" means "demon" in Chinese.

350
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:29,880
 And the curious case of why the kitty has no mouth is solved by this story.

351
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:42,880
 When the person who was creating Hello Kitty to save their daughter, they didn't create a mouth specifically because they didn't want any reminder of their daughter's mouth cancer.

352
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,880
 Now I don't know what they did with the daughter herself. They're like, "You've been cured. Now wear duct tape on your face forever."

353
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,880
 But that's why Hello Kitty doesn't have a mouth. The official reason why Hello Kitty doesn't have a mouth, I was up till 2 a.m.

354
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:02,880
 This was a late story that I was researching. I know so much about Hello Kitty except the company that makes her and who designed her.

355
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,880
 But the reason why Hello Kitty doesn't have a mouth, this is really interesting. It's a psychological trick.

356
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:13,880
 The company that made it said, "We want Hello Kitty to have whatever emotion you're having."

357
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,880
 If Hello Kitty's always smiling but you're sad, that's a distance.

358
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:27,880
 And we're not going to make a doll with a bunch of sad faces. It's all frowny and mad. Without the mouth, Hello Kitty is experiencing whatever emotion you're experiencing.

359
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:33,880
 So if you're sad, she's sad, you're happy, she's happy. It's fascinating. A little quirk of human psychology.

360
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:40,880
 But the story of Hello Kitty being a satanic icon is something I talked about a long time ago.

361
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,880
 I actually put forth a theory, a total conspiracy theory. I have no proof of it.

362
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,880
 I don't remember what I was talking about at the time, but I don't want to spend a whole bunch of time talking about it again.

363
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:57,880
 I said, "What's an object that people around the world know and they, I wouldn't say they worship, but they know and they treasure it?"

364
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:03,880
 And when you step back and just look at the silhouette of it, it looks horrific.

365
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,880
 It's Mickey Mouse, but it doesn't look anything like a mouse. It looks like an abomination.

366
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,880
 He's the most boring animated character possible.

367
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,880
 I remember I had this conspiracy theory a long time ago that Walt Disney made a pact with the devil,

368
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:25,880
 and that or some sort of demon and that creature is the best representation you can draw of what that demon would look like.

369
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:31,880
 So the big ears are actually like eyes or certain appendages, and the nose was something, was a nose? I don't know.

370
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:38,880
 But the point is, it was the same thing. It's so funny because I came up with that conspiracy theory years ago, probably right after I met Alex Trebek.

371
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,880
 It was back in the early 2000s, I thought of that, and here we have one that Hello Kitty is that same thing.

372
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:51,880
 So not only does this kind of validate my made of conspiracy theory, I wanted to talk about this too, and we're going to wrap it up like this.

373
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,880
 We talk a lot about people making deals with the devil to be successful.

374
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,880
 Now, I don't think you have to make a deal with the devil to become successful.

375
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:06,880
 I do think it is possible. I think you can do it literally, and I think you can do it metaphorically.

376
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:13,880
 But I do think you can literally, I don't know if you can sell your soul so much, but I think you can be tricked into thinking you've sold your soul

377
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:22,880
 and doing horrific things to maintain your fame when it wasn't yours to sell in the first place, but if you thought you had actually sold it.

378
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:31,880
 I've heard, I've read, I've read a lot about people selling their souls to the devil and things like that, and one of the things that happens to them,

379
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:39,880
 you sell your soul to the devil and then you get this fame and this success and then they say you got to do this horrific thing or the gravy train ends.

380
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:48,880
 They're like, I love gravy and I love trains, I can't let this end. So you do something horrific, but the key always is, well, I'll just sell my soul and I'll live my life

381
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,880
 and then right before I die, I'll become a Christian and God will get my soul back.

382
00:34:52,880 --> 00:35:00,880
 But when you start to think of that, you start to have these horrific nightmares and you're given this vision that God no longer wants you.

383
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:07,880
 Like people have talked about who have sold their souls or said they've sold their souls that they were becoming overwhelmed with these visions,

384
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:14,880
 with these nightmares that God had abandoned them because they were doing horrific stuff. It wasn't something they had to do every single day,

385
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,880
 but they would do something horrific and they'd think, how could God ever forgive me for that?

386
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:28,880
 And the point is having to ask God for forgiveness for doing that thing, but you've done something so horrible you can't ask for forgiveness and it's this spiral-leaning thing.

387
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:34,880
 There's always that story that Bob Dylan sold his soul to the devil. He's kind of made comments about that as well.

388
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:41,880
 And he got in a horrible motorcycle accident, broke his neck, almost died, and since then he's been a Christian, he's been a devout Christian.

389
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:49,880
 That's a story that a lot of time gets lost in the saga of Bob Dylan through his art, but there is some weird paranormal stuff going on there.

390
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,880
 I don't think you have to sell your soul to become successful. I think it is a path.

391
00:35:53,880 --> 00:36:00,880
 But this story about Hello Kitty, which isn't true, but it does offer us a weird way to kind of look at art.

392
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:12,880
 If an artist sells their soul to the devil for fame, right, you have Marshall Mathers trying to make it in the world of rap, and he does.

393
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,880
 And he starts to move up in the ranks, but not fast enough. So he sells- this is just an example, this is just off the top of head of him,

394
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,880
 and listen to a lot of Eminem lately, he sells his soul to the devil.

395
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:34,880
 Would his creations, which are being bolstered by the powers of darkness, are they gateways for us to fall into the devil's clutches?

396
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:42,880
 And I know that's the whole thing with like, in the 1980s they had that huge thing like heavy metal music makes you more demonic and stuff like that.

397
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,880
 Don't listen to that Twisted Sister album, you won't respect your teachers. But that's the easy route.

398
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:56,880
 Like people listen to Eminem and then they go, you know, beat their girlfriend up or something like that, or start using drugs, do this stuff.

399
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:04,880
 You can make those connections, that's dark music. I personally have always liked the thing, I actually heard this on Ned's Declassified School Guide.

400
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:11,880
 People who listen to dark music, people who listen to like, you know, stuff like Eminem's, you know, gangster rap stuff like that.

401
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:17,880
 They kind of explain it like this. Positive plus a positive equals a positive. They're talking about electrons, but they're saying how it works in real life.

402
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,880
 Positive plus a positive equals a positive. Positive plus a negative equals a negative.

403
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:33,880
 So if you are moody and you like darker stuff and someone's trying to get you to watch Mickey Mouse cartoons and trying to get you to listen to opera or pop music or whatever,

404
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:42,880
 it's a negative, it gives you a negative reaction, but somebody who, they're not bad people, but somebody who already feels kind of angry at the world and alone and stuff like that.

405
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:50,880
 When they listen to Tech Nine or Eminem or Disturbed or whatever, Cannibal Corpse, that actually gives them positive feelings.

406
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,880
 A negative plus a negative equals a positive. So it doesn't mean that they're actually going to go out and do those things,

407
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:06,880
 but it actually can have a positive effect on their mental state because they want to go "I don't feel alone anymore. I didn't know there were other people out there like me who could rock as hard as Disturbed."

408
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:14,880
 But you know what I mean? Again, that's the thing. Like if someone's putting out dark music and it's causing their fans to do dark things and it turns out that musician sold their soul to the devil, that all makes sense.

409
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,880
 But what happens to the opera singer or the pop star?

410
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:26,880
 Let's forget the pop star. People already say Rihanna sold her soul to the devil in her music. Her song Umbrella is about Satan possessing people.

411
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:34,880
 Let's take like a world famous opera star where they're just singing other people's music. They don't write their own music, they're just like "La la la."

412
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,880
 They're just writing "La" all over the paper. "La la la la la." They're singing other people's music.

413
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:46,880
 What happens when you take music that's created by someone who didn't sell their soul to the devil and give it to an opera singer who sells their soul to the devil?

414
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,880
 At what point does the music become perverted to become a gateway?

415
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:58,880
 What happens if someone designed Hello Kitty and it was totally normal? Their daughter was fine? They didn't even have a daughter?

416
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:06,880
 They didn't even have a daughter? And they sell it to a company and that company's CFO got to that position because they sold their soul to the devil.

417
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:13,880
 That's pretty low. They're like "You can have my soul. I just want to be a chief financial officer of a fortune 10,000 company."

418
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:19,880
 And you sell that and then at what point does the corruption begin? Or does the corruption ever begin?

419
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:27,880
 Is it enough for the dark forces to simply take your soul or do they want to use these icons to steal the souls of millions?

420
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:33,880
 I don't know. I mean, I basically just asked a bunch of questions, but I thought it was an interesting story.

421
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,880
 There are a bunch of doorways that we can look down and see all these alternatives.

422
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:45,880
 And if it's true, if this is true, that at any point along the production chain, if someone sold their soul to the devil, the item gets infused,

423
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:53,880
 then at this point everything would be infected. Your Hello Kitty nightlight, your Marshall Mathers LP,

424
00:39:53,880 --> 00:40:00,880
 but it would also be your dish soap, the raw hamburger meat sitting in your freezer, your shoes.

425
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:08,880
 Everything could be tainted by dark forces sprinkled throughout the production line.

426
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:19,880
 That sounds a lot less like a packed with the devil and more like the seeds of a full-on demonic invasion.
