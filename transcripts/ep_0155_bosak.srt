1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Was a man

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 murdered by the police or by the dark entities that plagued him on his final day?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 And then we take a look at the interesting story known as the Bosak Accountor.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Did a lonely farmer run into a UFO piloted by Bigfoot?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Or is it even weirder than that, today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 I'm a big doll, actually I'm a rock big doll.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 [Music]

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, and that's a lot of the official sound like I was trying out for a job on the radio.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, and I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 I hope you're having a great day too.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 So you know, one thing I want to talk about real quick, I don't think it deserves its own full segment,

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 but something I have to address, again it happened during the break, it was another thing that kind of happened during the break.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 YouTube says that they are going to, they're going to stop recommending conspiracy videos.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Now, you may think, well Jason, this video you talk about conspiracy theories, but you kind of like poo poo most of them.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 I still get caught up in that net.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 I'll do videos where I'm like, Sandy Hook was obviously, it obviously happened.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 It wasn't fate, I don't think it was an inside job or false flag or anything like that.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Those videos get flagged by YouTube, even when I'm disputing it.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 And I don't put any of that in my tags, I don't tag it like that.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 But when I upload the videos, they do an auto caption, so basically the computer algorithm reads my video.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 It's kind of interesting, because it'll have the subtitles, you probably about like 95% correct.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 And it picks up that I say, you know, Sandy Hook or whatever.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Even though I'm saying that did happen, that it is not, all that stuff is conspiracy theory, it's not true.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 I still get flagged.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 And you can see videos, they'll have a disclaimer on them saying, this is what really happened during Sandy Hook.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 And I was like, yeah, that's what I said.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 You're posting a disclaimer saying what I said, and I'm fine.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 It's YouTube's place, whatever.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Like, I get that they have those algorithms in place.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 So there, that decision may affect the YouTube side of the show.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 It's obviously not going to affect the podcast side.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 However, a lot of listeners have discovered the podcast through YouTube.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 We'll see how that plays out.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Now, I was talking to Mitchum about it, and I said, you know, because he's like, yeah, it's the end of an era.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 I said, yeah, you know, that's where most people get their conspiracy theory information from is YouTube.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 They're still going to allow those videos.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 They're just not going to recommend them.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 So now when I type in, great, now this video is going to get, get put on there.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 But when I type in Adam Lanza or Sandy Hook or whatever, it's no longer going to recommend any conspiracy videos.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 It's only going to be official stuff.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 And that from a business side, that makes sense. Again, I'm not faulty in YouTube for that at all.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Because now if you type in Adam Lanza or 9/11, most of the stuff you're going to get is going to be conspiracy theory.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 I don't know about right now, but definitely a week ago, that was the case.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 So, but we are talking and this is an interesting thing.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 At what point does something stop becoming a conspiracy theory?

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Obviously, if you type in 9/11, you type in Sandy Hook, you're going to get all the conspiracy videos.

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 What if I type in our vaccines healthy?

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 And Mitchum goes, well, at what point, that was his question, at what point does it become a conspiracy theory versus just a weird medical practice?

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 And vaccines is actually a good one to look at because that, people on both sides of the aisle, you have left-wingers and right-wingers who will not vaccinate their kids.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 It's one of the few conspiracy theories that goes across both political, across the political spectrum.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Sandy Hook tends to be people, oh, they're trying to grab our guns, that's why it's fake and stuff like that.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 That tends to be a more conservative conspiracy theory.

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 And then, Mitchum was like, what about, at what point do we look at religions like Scientology and say, no, no, no, no, we're not going to,

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 if you put in I'm feeling depressed or tips for depression, will a Scientology video pop up?

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Or is that a conspiracy theory? And those are interesting questions.

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 And again, we're just kind of chatting on Messenger about this stuff.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 And YouTube has to deal with all that stuff now.

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 And my thing is, if, and this is what I told him too, if Robert Mueller's report comes back, saying Donald Trump did not collude with the Russians,

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 does that mean if I ever type in Donald Trump Russians, is that all a conspiracy theory now?

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Because it was proven false.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 So it'll be an interesting thing to see how YouTube deals with this and how they define a conspiracy theory.

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 I imagine they're just going to take the big ones first, 9/11, Sandy Hook, the Aurora shooting.

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 You know, like the Boston bombing. I think they're going to take on those first,

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 but eventually people will say, hey, why are you letting anti-vaxxers?

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Why did I type in this video about, I want to know about the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 and everything that popped up with some weird conspiracy theory.

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 They're really going to have to drill down on this if this is the path they want.

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Because they'll get taken to task for still recommending certain conspiracy theories.

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 It's a slippery slope for them.

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 But yeah, that was another bit of news that happened while I was on vacation.

73
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 I'm actually not even going to upload that part to YouTube. Ah, jokes on you, giant conglomerate.

74
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 You're not getting any ad money for my six minute video.

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Haha! See, I beat the filter.

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 If you want to hear that juicy detail, you should listen to the podcast.

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Let's go ahead and get started with our first story.

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 First story is kind of tragic and you may go, Jason, it's quite insensitive.

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 You're trying to turn this into something that it may not be.

80
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 And I'm very aware of that.

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 So I'm going to try to tread lightly in a sense.

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 I do think it's a very interesting story and I think the way it's being reported is very interesting.

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 January 2019, it happened probably right before my vacation started.

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 There was a dude in Paterson, New Jersey named Jameek Lowry.

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Now Jameek Lowry calls up 911 and is like, I took a bunch of ecstasy.

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 I'm totally freaking out.

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 There are these shadow people on the walls.

88
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 They're haunting me, man. They're haunting me.

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 He ends up being taken to the hospital because he's just totally out of it.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 And they're trying to treat him for it.

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 He's having basically an ecstasy overdose and he's seeing these shadowy figures all around him.

92
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 This is a true story, by the way. This isn't creepypasta.

93
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 I should have started off like that.

94
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 And he gets freaked out and he leaves the hospital.

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 He leaves the hospital. They're going to kill me, man. They're going to kill me.

96
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 And this is what I mean.

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 It's interesting because when the news article, when he's saying they,

98
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 they'll put in parentheses what they think he means.

99
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 But anyway, so he leaves the hospital.

100
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 A while later, he walks into a police station.

101
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 And when he gets into the police station, this is a quote from the article.

102
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 At one point, Lowry seems to be hallucinating, saying, I saw them by the wall.

103
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 I see them. I see them.

104
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Yo, they're trying to kill me.

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 An officer then shines his flashlight at the wall and calmly says, Ain't nobody there.

106
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 Lowry replies, he's right there. Walk over there.

107
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 The police are trying to kill me. They think I'm a witness.

108
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 They think I'm fucking with the FBI.

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 He alternates between ranting, pleading for help, and admitting I'm just paranoid.

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 That's it.

111
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 So first he talks about these shadowy people on the wall.

112
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Cops are trying to reassure him there's nothing there.

113
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 When he says the police are trying to kill me because they think I'm fucking with the FBI,

114
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 it's his family after he, spoiler alert, he doesn't live through the night.

115
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 But after he passes away, his family says that there was an FBI investigation going on in the area

116
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 and he got it in his head that he was somehow a suspect, even though he had nothing to do with what was going on.

117
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 So I think he probably had some paranoid delusions before this happened.

118
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 But so he goes to the police station and he pulls out his phone and he's videotaping himself.

119
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 That's why we have all these quotes.

120
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 He goes to the police station and he's totally freaking out and he's talking about creatures on the wall

121
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 and then he switched to the cops are going to kill me because the FBI and all this stuff.

122
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 And the whole time he's asking for water. He goes, I'm so dehydrated, I just need water.

123
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 Now there's about five or six cops standing around him at this point because you have this totally erratic guy in your police station.

124
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 And the cops are like, they say, I can't give you water. I can't give you any water.

125
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 And people are like, why can't the cops give him water? And they're actually, it's protocol because they said,

126
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 we don't know what he was on and we don't know if water will make it worse because there are some toxins that you need to get out of your system.

127
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 And if you put water in, it'll make it worse. So until he gets taken to the hospital, they don't know what he's on.

128
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Now what's interesting is that here he says the police are trying to kill me. They think I'm a witness.

129
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 Blah, blah, blah. Later on, he leaves another video or he says in a different point in the video,

130
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 he says, if I'm dead by the next hour or two, they did it. I didn't touch them at all.

131
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 And the article puts in that they means the police. This is my theory. Again, maybe a little insensitive.

132
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 But could they be the things that were on the wall? Was he really being plagued, was doing the drug and having this psychotic breakdown,

133
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 letting him see these creatures that had been stalking him and giving him paranoid delusions?

134
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 And you think, Jason, that's quite insensitive and 100% not true. But here's where the mystery lies.

135
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 The cops end up saying, you got to go to the hospital, dude. Like, you're totally freaking out. You need water.

136
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 We can't give you water. We don't know what you took. Let's put you in the hospital.

137
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 The cops call an ambulance. The ambulance shows up. The cops have to take him and they put him in the ambulance.

138
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 And the ambulance people are like, okay, this guy's obviously on something. We're going to take him to the hospital. Everything's going to be fine.

139
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 They get to the hospital. The dude is bashed up. It's a 5-12 minute ride to the hospital.

140
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 By the time they get to the hospital, he's completely unconscious, placed in a life support, dies two days later, broken cheekbone, fractured eye socket.

141
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Somebody kicked the crap out of him. The ambulance staff is like, whatever happened, it did not happen in our ambulance at all.

142
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 Didn't happen. There weren't a bunch of cops back there beating him up. When the cops put him in, they did have to restrain him to put him in the ambulance, but the ambulance drivers were watching it.

143
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Now, you could say maybe everyone's covering for each other, but the ambulance drivers really don't have any reason to cover for these cops.

144
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 The ambulance drivers are being held responsible. They're like, why did this guy get picked up? And then when he comes out, his face is bashed in.

145
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 And the ambulance drivers are like, we don't know. It makes them look suspicious. They could have been like, well, the cops were treating him a little rough.

146
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Cops put him in the back of the ambulance. The ambulance drives to the hospital. The dude arrives completely unconscious, beat up.

147
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 The cops are like, we put him in the ambulance. We had nothing to do with it. He dies two days later.

148
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 The cops are on administrative leave. They're investigating the ambulance drivers and nobody's pointing the finger at each other.

149
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 They're both saying, we don't know. That's what makes the story weird. Now, it's possible that he gave the, obviously the most logical explanations are.

150
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 He was roughed up by the police and the ambulance drivers are covering for it. He was roughed up by the ambulance personnel and the police are covering for them.

151
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 He inflicted the injuries himself and his psychotic delusion. Those are the more likely scenarios.

152
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 But this is a paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast. And when I read this article, I was like, that's kind of creepy.

153
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 He's hallucinating these things. He thinks they're going to kill him. Then he thinks the cops are going to kill him.

154
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 And then he thinks the FBI is going to kill him and he dies. Was something else in that ambulance with that young man?

155
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 Creepy. Creepy story. Okay, so for our next story, which is still, it's creepy on a different angle.

156
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 Now, our next story is actually a recommendation because it is recommendation week. This is from an email from Bennett.

157
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 He actually requested or recommended quite a few Bigfoot stories. It's funny. One of them, he was like, have you ever heard about vanishing Bigfoot?

158
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 A couple of people have referenced that to me as well. And I was like, oh no, I'll look into it. There's like 300 sightings of vanishing Bigfeet.

159
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 And I'm like, okay, it's going to take me a while, but I'll get around to it. But this story is fairly simple.

160
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 So the implications are quite creepy, but it involves a lonely farmer, a dark foggy night, and a close encounter of the furred kind.

161
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 It's winter, 1974, and we are in Polk County, Wisconsin, home of four touchdowns in a single game. There's a dude, he's 68 years old, named William Bosak.

162
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 Now, generally, UFO sightings, when people are like, dude, I dropped like eight tabs of acid and saw God last night.

163
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 I'm obviously going to dismiss that. But there is something with people, like older people who see UFOs, you're like, you know, what does that guy have to like?

164
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 That guy's probably not making that up. Most UFO sightings I actually don't think are made up. I don't think most ghost sightings are made up either.

165
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 I think people are either mistaken, or it's their imagination, and some of them are real. But it's funny, because whenever you see UFO stories from people who seem to be like, salts of the earth people,

166
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 you're like, I imagine my grandpa like seeing a UFO. If my grandpa saw a UFO, he'd never tell anybody. He'd be like, oh, that was weird.

167
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 Because some people, like the people who go looking for the stuff, of course, they're going to tell everyone they know.

168
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 They're going to be in line at the grocery store, and they'll be like, guess what? They saw a UFO fly by, and people are like, you know, plastic or paper.

169
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 They'll tell everybody, but whenever you meet someone who's basically just like a farmer, a middle-aged or over-the-hill farmer out in the middle of nowhere who experiences some sort of paranormal phenomenon,

170
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 it does add a little weight to it. You may think that's a little agist, but I actually know it's not, because I'd say the same thing.

171
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 If there was like a 20-year-old guy working at the oil drill factory, and that's all he did, he was just like a salt of the earth guy, or he was a rodeo dude.

172
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Like, there are just some people that seem more serious.

173
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 I've talked to a lot of hunters up here. Whenever I meet somebody who's hunting, we'll talk a bit, and I will ask them, have you ever seen a Bigfoot?

174
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 And a lot of times, they'll be like, nah, nah, I don't believe in it.

175
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 But every so often, I'll be talking to some dude, young or old, and I'll be like, have you ever seen Bigfoot?

176
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 And they're like, maybe. And they'll tell him his story.

177
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 And so, you know, because again, there are people who are out in the woods all the time.

178
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 They're not like out there with their camcorders, and they're night vision goggles.

179
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 They're just out there trying to hunt deer, and one day they'll be like, yeah.

180
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 I've actually heard quite a few stories, but they're like, I didn't see one, but I smelled one.

181
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 I grew up in the woods. I used to hunt. I've been hunting since I was six with my dad.

182
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 I go there every season, deer season.

183
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 And one day I came across something, and I didn't get a glimpse of it, but I heard it, and I smelled it, and I knew immediately to get out of the area.

184
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 It wasn't a bear. It wasn't a dead animal. It was something big and smelly.

185
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 It basically instilled in with fear, and they left.

186
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 I've heard that story a couple times. I haven't seen it, but I've smelled it.

187
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 And Bigfoot generally do have a very pungent smell.

188
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 You know Britney Spears has like, she makes most of her money from perfume sales now?

189
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 I think she makes like 60 million a year from perfume. Just a little side note.

190
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 She's retired. That's kind of sad. Her dad's sick, so she's like, I'm done. I'm done performing.

191
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Okay, so let me get back to the Bigfoot story, because I'm wandering off on my Britney Spears.

192
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 So we're going all the way back to this.

193
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 So it is winter 1974. It's Polk County, Wisconsin.

194
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 William Bosak driving on the road late at night.

195
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Driving home. Not just driving down the road, because you know it's fun.

196
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 He's driving home. Thick fog bank rolls in.

197
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 William looks around. He's like, I didn't know fog made noise, but apparently it does.

198
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Starts driving through the fog.

199
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Now, again, he's like, oh whatever, it's fog. I live in the middle of nowhere. Whatever.

200
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 I would be creeped out. I hate fog.

201
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 I, less than I hate snow, but I don't like fog. But anyways, he's just driving through it, because it's no big deal.

202
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 He lives out in the middle of nowhere.

203
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 But through the fog, he sees a cone. Not a traffic cone, but a cone shaped metal object hovering above the road.

204
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Now, it's through the fog. So of course, your brain is going to be like, I'm not seeing that right.

205
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 That's impossible. Why was there a metal cone? And at first, he thought it was like a structure.

206
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 He stops, and he thinks it's like a metal structure that he's seeing wrong.

207
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 But then he notices that there's nothing holding it up. It's basically hovering.

208
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 It's a UFO, very, very close to the ground. He described it. It was 10 feet by 3 feet.

209
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 So quite small. It's about the size of my bedroom. But I was not there.

210
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 It was my bedroom, as far as I know. And it's hovering there.

211
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 Now, this UFO, again, quite small. And this UFO has a unique shape to it.

212
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 A unique feature, I should say. There's a curved window on the front. We presume it's the front.

213
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 There's a curved window on the hovering cone. And William can see inside of it.

214
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 We have his quote. I can remember it just as if it were yesterday.

215
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 It was a little taller than a tall man. I could see a figure with its arms raised above its head.

216
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 He was looking out the window, and it was a kind of different character than you'd see on this Earth.

217
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 It looked a good deal like a man, but it had a different looking face than you'd see. It had a kind of cow looking face.

218
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 Dark tan fur, except for its face and chin. It had a square face with hair sticking straight out from the sides.

219
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 The ears stuck out from the head about 3 inches, and the eyes were large and protruding. The ears were calf-like.

220
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 So, he's looking at this thing, and his first thing that pops in his head, other than there's a calf looking dude, a cow looking dude looking at me,

221
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 was first, because, again, whenever you look at something weird, something that doesn't fit into the reality, your brain will try to make sense of it.

222
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 And his first thing, he sees the cone, hovering cone, that's weird, he sees the curved glass and the creature inside.

223
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 His first sense is that's not fur, he's wearing a suit. His brain tried making sense, because he's like, there's nobody that has fur.

224
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 So, his brain tried making sense of any part of it, and he goes, "Oh, that guy just must be wearing a suit."

225
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Even though he's in a floating cone with a flattened cow face.

226
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 He says that whatever was in there looked frightened, looked scared.

227
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 And that scared William even more. He hits the gas, drives away from the thing.

228
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 And at that point, he says that he felt like dark as he's leaving the area.

229
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 He says he felt like darkness was starting to envelop the car.

230
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 Like, he just felt this surrounding darkness. The car seemed to not want to drive anymore.

231
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 And then he hears scraping on the top of his vehicle, like branches as you're driving underneath a low-hanging tree.

232
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 And at that point, he completely panics, floors it even more, if that's possible, but he does get away.

233
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 He drives home, and from his house, he was close enough to his house, from his house, he could see the fog bank.

234
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 He could see where the cone was, or should be, but the fog obscured it. Absolutely terrified.

235
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Doesn't tell his wife and his son. Can't sleep. The next day, he goes out to where the cone was hovering.

236
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 And because it was kind of to the side of the road, there was just flattened grass in that area.

237
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 Now, he doesn't mention it to his wife and son. I think about two or three weeks passed, and may have even been longer,

238
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 before he mentions it to his wife and son. And it's one point, I think he goes to a friend who works for the newspaper or something like that.

239
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 Like, there was a period of time, he either went to the newspaper or he went to the military first.

240
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 It was one of the two, but eventually, like, he ended up getting interviewed about the story and things like that.

241
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 Now, obviously, that makes you think it could be made up. He just may want some publicity or some fame or stuff like that.

242
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 But again, in 1974, you're just a big ol' crackpot. This is before Project Blue Book, you know, broke open.

243
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 This is back in that time where, if you believed in UFOs at all, people go, "What, little green men?"

244
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 So to come forward, nowadays, people go on the news and say, "I'm pregnant with a ghost baby."

245
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Like, people are looking for that fame, but back then, you were really ridiculed now, but you were ridiculed even more back then.

246
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 There's some interesting things about this story. One, when you read his description, when I think of that story,

247
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 and he said, you know, the creature had its hands in the airs, there's some drawings, and he says, you know, the drawings, like the crime scene,

248
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 not crime scene drawings, but you know, they'll have, like, the forensic artists come out. He goes, "It's actually pretty close to what I saw."

249
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 He goes, "The airs could be a little bit different, but basically, they look like a cow without, like, the snout."

250
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Big furry body. So there have been comparisons to Bigfoot that maybe it was a Bigfoot in the ship.

251
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 Bigfoot's and UFOs have been linked a lot. It's a theory called high strangeness.

252
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 There are certain areas where it's just a pantheon or pantheon. It's a pantheon of weirdness.

253
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 You'll get Bigfoot sightings and UFO sightings and disappearances and all this stuff in a unique area.

254
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 It's called high strangeness. Nothing weird, paranormal kind of exists in a vacuum.

255
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 So the idea is it's possibly Bigfoot piloting the ship, that Bigfoot is an alien. That was one of the theories that came out.

256
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 I think it seems Bigfoot-esque because it's so tall and it has the hair, the ears, and it looking like a cow

257
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 don't really jive with descriptions of Bigfoot. So I don't really buy the Bigfoot theory.

258
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 It could be a creature that is also just very tall and very hairy. It could be an ugly Bigfoot.

259
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 It could be the Bigfoot that is ostracized from Bigfoot communities because he has those ears and those features.

260
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 It could have just been, oh, obviously it could have just been his imagination, too.

261
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 The fact that this guy sees a cow look in shape and he lives out where a bunch of cows are,

262
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 I mean, it could just been his imagination kind of in a late night.

263
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 But it could have been an alien similar to a Bigfoot.

264
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 But whether or not it's Bigfoot or just a furry cow alien or made up or anything like that,

265
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 I think a more interesting question is this.

266
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 He said afterwards, he had this quote, he believes, like, later on in his life,

267
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 he said, "I should have stopped and tried to show it I was friendly.

268
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 I wish I could meet up with it again."

269
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 So he has this idea that he startled it as much as it startled him.

270
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 And he took off and it freaked that creature out as well.

271
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 And it's almost like this regret, like, he should have got out and made first contact with this thing.

272
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 I don't think it was the pilot of that ship.

273
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 This is just, from reading a couple articles about this thing, and I wasn't there,

274
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 obviously William Bowsack knows more about this than I do, but...

275
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 The fact that it had its arms up almost is in a submissive pose.

276
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 Like, the arms weren't like, wasn't like punching his fist, like his arms were up,

277
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 that if I drew handcuffs on it, it would look perfect.

278
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 The fact that the ship was so small, 10 feet by 3 feet, I mean, like I said, that's the size of an apartment, bedroom.

279
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 But that's probably the size of my tiny kitchen, honestly.

280
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 10 feet by 3 feet is like a cell.

281
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 And it had its arms up kind of over its head.

282
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Again, not like in an aggressive posture, you can look at the picture, but it's basically like 50 shades of grays.

283
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Like, it's a UFO submissive posture.

284
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 They just put on some laser handcuffs, you could see an alien walking in there with a whip.

285
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 I don't think it was the pilot.

286
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 I think it was a prisoner.

287
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 Is it possible that it was some sort of Bigfoot creature or some sort of cryptid

288
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 that wasn't the pilot of this ship in the middle of nowhere, but it's captive.

289
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 And the reason why it was scared wasn't because it was seeing a human.

290
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 It may have been a Bigfoot creature that is used to seeing humans, that knows it exists on the same planet as humans,

291
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 but it was as terrified to see the UFO as William Bosak was.

292
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 If you have a creature that's taller than a tall man, so let's say 7, 8 feet tall,

293
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 and the ship is only 10 feet tall, that's a tiny ship.

294
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 Was he a prisoner?

295
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Are aliens also abducting Bigfoots and other cryptids from our planet?

296
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 And, more chilling, if that ship was there and it hadn't abducted the creature that it did,

297
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 would William Bosak instead, would it have been him to forever disappear into that fog bank?

298
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
