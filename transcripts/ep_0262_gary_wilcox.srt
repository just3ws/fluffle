1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
 A voyeur is checking out a woman on a beach, and then the unthinkable happens.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,900
 And then we take a look at the story of Gary Wilcox, a 27-year-old farmer tending his plot

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,280
 of land in 1964, Newark Valley.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:23,440
 What started off as a normal workday turned into an interesting case of interplanetary

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,440
 trade.

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:31,440
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,960
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,960
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, and I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,960
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,720
 We're going to go ahead and get started with this, jump right into it, both feet down the

11
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,720
 whole of story.

12
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,720
 I don't know where I'm going with that.

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,720
 Anyways, anyways.

14
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:53,120
 The year is 1995.

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,120
 It's August 26th.

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,640
 It is a hot day in Newburg Beach, Kentucky.

17
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,400
 A perfect day to go sunbathing.

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:09,400
 And on this day, there is a man watching a woman with a telescope.

19
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,080
 So he's quite a ways away.

20
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,520
 His motives may seem a little weird.

21
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,920
 Well, okay, let's call a spade a spade.

22
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,960
 It's definitely not something you should be doing.

23
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:25,120
 There's a dude with a telescope watching this woman sunbathing.

24
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,080
 Doesn't know the woman, never met her before in her life.

25
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,720
 Just sees an attractive woman catching some rays on the sand from the sun.

26
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,720
 Okay, you're setting the mood.

27
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,280
 Seagulls flying around, crabs.

28
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,880
 Those are the little, you're not typing.

29
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,600
 Those are the little, what are those claws?

30
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,360
 Those are the little claws.

31
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,320
 And Heather Teague is sunbathing.

32
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,560
 Just another young woman looking for a tan.

33
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,560
 You get it.

34
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,560
 You get it.

35
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,560
 It's been set up.

36
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,560
 Okay.

37
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,960
 A man sitting there in his house on his patio with his telescope watching this hot young

38
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,960
 woman catch rays.

39
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,960
 Okay.

40
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,960
 I don't know why.

41
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,960
 The scene is set up.

42
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,960
 The scene is set up.

43
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,960
 The sun was setting.

44
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,960
 No, just joking.

45
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,960
 Okay.

46
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,200
 But he's watching her with the telescope.

47
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,320
 And then he sees come out of the bushes.

48
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,320
 So she's the beach.

49
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,640
 I guess I should have built the scene up some more.

50
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,960
 There's the beach, right?

51
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,960
 And then on one side of the beach is the water.

52
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,440
 How beaches normally work.

53
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,720
 And on the other side of the beach is like a forested area.

54
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,880
 And this dude, this unnamed dude, his name is not reported in any of these stories.

55
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
 And this is a true story.

56
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,600
 This involves the cops very, very quickly.

57
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,540
 This guy's watching this woman through his telescope.

58
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:43,440
 And he sees the kind of the, the brushes start to rustle.

59
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,160
 And he notices a man walk out of the forest behind her.

60
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,880
 Now that wouldn't be anything too suspicious because it's a public beach.

61
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,800
 You don't get suspicious every time someone walks into a public beach.

62
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,300
 You're like, oh no, a couple of cops.

63
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,560
 People every time a car parks, you're like, oh no.

64
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,560
 You see someone come out of the forest coming onto the beach.

65
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,800
 Not super suspicious.

66
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,960
 This guy though, was had no shirt on.

67
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,680
 Again, that's not a red flag.

68
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,480
 It's not a red flag for a beach.

69
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,480
 He's wearing jeans.

70
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,640
 And he was also wearing a mosquito net over his face and a wig.

71
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,320
 And the guy in the telescope's watching this and now he's really suspicious because he's

72
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,680
 like, what in the world?

73
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,680
 And he watches.

74
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,680
 Now he has his telescope on this guy.

75
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:30,960
 He just walks down the beach very calmly, walks up behind Heather, pulls a gun out, grabs

76
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,920
 her by the hair, drags her off into the woods.

77
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,320
 Now this isn't, I actually had a story idea similar to this real life event because what

78
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,640
 happened, my story idea was this.

79
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,840
 A guy was breaking into women's houses to videotape them while they were sleeping because

80
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,340
 he's a voyeur.

81
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,840
 And he breaks into one woman's house.

82
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,840
 And that's all he does.

83
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,360
 He just videotapes them while they're sleeping.

84
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,960
 And he breaks into one woman's house.

85
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,840
 And while he's videotaping her while she's sleeping, he sees like this demonic figure

86
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,160
 kind of crawl up on the other side of the bed and he runs away.

87
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,520
 And the next day the woman is found murdered.

88
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,400
 Now he has a dilemma because he's a criminal.

89
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,520
 He's committing a criminal act, but then he saw something.

90
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,360
 And plus since he had broken to her apartment, he's kind of a suspect.

91
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,360
 They're like looking for his fingerprints.

92
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,080
 Like they have fingerprints and stuff like that.

93
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:22,760
 But he's trying to convince this other girl that he also did this too because he doesn't

94
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,760
 stop doing it.

95
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,320
 He still keeps breaking into women's rooms trying to convince her that she's also in

96
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,760
 trouble because he also saw the demon.

97
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,000
 So in her room.

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,660
 So it's one of those things where he had a problem and his problem led him to discovering

99
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,840
 like a worse problem.

100
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,000
 And then it just kind of goes on from there.

101
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,800
 So the dilemma is if you're a criminal, if you're committing a criminal act and in the

102
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,720
 commission of a criminal act, do you see a worse criminal act?

103
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,280
 How do you go about reporting that?

104
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,520
 This guy, he could probably say, "Hey, I was just looking at the beach with my telescope.

105
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,520
 I wasn't peeping.

106
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,000
 I wasn't doing anything inappropriate.

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,400
 Both hands are on the telescope."

108
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,320
 And the officer is probably like, "What, everybody?

109
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,680
 We just want to know what this suspect looked like."

110
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,740
 Because she went missing, completely missing.

111
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,260
 And what was interesting, again, this took place back in 1995.

112
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,460
 This crime gets spotted because you have a peeping tom with a telescope and the police

113
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,980
 start searching the area.

114
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:21,700
 They end up finding out that another guy was videotaping crop vandalism.

115
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,500
 He was having problems with crop vandalism, which I think might actually be a code word

116
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,500
 for crop circles.

117
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,860
 He's getting straight up signs aliens walking around.

118
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,320
 But he was videotaping the area for crop vandalism.

119
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,680
 Actually, he was probably just videotaping sunbathers, but that was his excuse.

120
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,160
 But he caught footage of a car parked next to Heather's car.

121
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,240
 And the cop said, "Listen, that's a long shot, but we'll start looking into that."

122
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,440
 They started looking for that car that was parked next to Heather's car that day on

123
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,440
 the beach.

124
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,680
 They end up pulling this man over who had a matching car.

125
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,280
 It was a routine traffic stop.

126
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,320
 His name was Marvin Dill.

127
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,320
 Marvin Dill.

128
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,300
 And when they start searching his car, routine traffic stop, but they were keeping a lookout

129
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,300
 for this red on white Ford Bronco.

130
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,940
 They find two guns, two knives, duct tape, rubber gloves, rope, and they found some hair

131
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,220
 that looked like Heather's.

132
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,260
 So they go, "Okay, this might be our guy."

133
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,340
 They actually end up letting him go because they don't have enough to hold him.

134
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,660
 And then when they go back to his house, he tells his wife, he sees the cops walking to

135
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,700
 the driveway and he tells his wife, "Hey, why don't you leave me alone for a while?"

136
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,180
 And I got some business to take care of and he shot himself.

137
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,840
 And that was it.

138
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,840
 That's it.

139
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,280
 No one's ever found Heather's body.

140
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,560
 No one has ever found who did it.

141
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,960
 It was, you know, most likely Marvin Dill.

142
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:43,760
 But weird story, but I think the most interesting part of it is how when you are in the commission

143
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:49,400
 of a crime, how can you rep-- I shouldn't be so harsh on the guy with the telescope.

144
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,000
 He might not have been as perverted as I'm making him out to be.

145
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,280
 He may have been an upstanding citizen who just wanted to see what the soil of a beach

146
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,000
 looked like with the telescope.

147
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,540
 But the point of the matter is at a certain point he had to make a phone call and say,

148
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,780
 "Hey, officer, I was watching the beach.

149
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,780
 I had my telescope on backwards.

150
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,940
 I was trying to look at boats, but I don't know how to use it.

151
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,580
 It was my first day and I saw this horrible adduction."

152
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,740
 And it's also interesting to think because you would think if something bad was happening

153
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,380
 to you, if someone could like, if you were being assaulted or something, you would hope

154
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,260
 that someone was watching, someone could intervene.

155
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,380
 And nowadays that's pretty much the case.

156
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:30,040
 You're surrounded by video cameras pretty much everywhere.

157
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:35,400
 But even when someone's watching the action live, you may still disappear off the face

158
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,680
 of the earth.

159
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:43,400
 Someone's looking at a crime committed against you and you get dragged off into the woods

160
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,840
 and never seen again.

161
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,240
 It's just weird because you think that as long as someone can see me, as long as someone

162
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,760
 can see me, maybe I can get help, but you can still disappear off the face of the planet

163
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,980
 while someone is watching you through a telescope.

164
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,940
 Disappearing in the middle of the woods, that's one thing.

165
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:04,620
 Disappearing on a lonely trail is one thing.

166
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:10,980
 But disappearing in full view of somebody is quite, quite chilling.

167
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,260
 So let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

168
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,740
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story here.

169
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,700
 Now our next story is an interesting one.

170
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,580
 It's one that is actually dismissed for the most part in UFOology.

171
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:27,920
 So one of those stories that has some of the similarities of what you hear from a UFO story,

172
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,840
 but it's not very widely talked about, it's kind of considered a hoax.

173
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,840
 And I'll tell you why.

174
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,640
 I'll tell you why it's considered a hoax.

175
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,420
 I have some mixed feelings about it, but I don't think it's the out and out hoax that

176
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,160
 mainstream UFOology says it is.

177
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,320
 Maybe I'm just being a contrarian.

178
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,600
 Let's go ahead and dig into the story of Gary Wilcox.

179
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,880
 The year is 1964.

180
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,960
 We're leaving Kentucky.

181
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,960
 We're leaving the beach.

182
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:58,180
 We're leaving the sunny, sunny beaches for the sunny, sunny farms of New York City.

183
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,180
 There are farms in New York.

184
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,040
 Well, the farms, I'm sorry, not New York City, New York State.

185
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,440
 We're in Newark Valley.

186
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,780
 That's the place we're at.

187
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,340
 It's 1964.

188
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,660
 It's April 24th.

189
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:15,260
 It's 10 a.m. in the morning and Gary Wilcox is driving his tractor around his farm.

190
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,640
 He actually has it attached to a manure spreader.

191
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,460
 So it's just like, just shoot manure out everywhere, not everywhere.

192
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,400
 And shoot it out in organized columns to help the crops grow.

193
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,600
 It's not like going on the neighbors.

194
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,400
 Dennis the Menace didn't invent it, but he has this manure spreader hooked to his tractor.

195
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,920
 He's driving around his property, spread a manure.

196
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,080
 And he sees off in the distance a shiny metallic object.

197
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,400
 It's quite big.

198
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,280
 20 feet long, 4 feet high, 15 feet wide.

199
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,680
 It looked like just a big object.

200
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,640
 And it firstly thinks, is that a fuel tank?

201
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,320
 Or did a plane land in my field?

202
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,840
 Like he couldn't really make out what it was.

203
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:56,140
 So he drives over his manure spreading tractor over to this object.

204
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,540
 Pulls up, doesn't skid.

205
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,620
 There's nothing to skid on its dirt.

206
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,540
 He hops out and he notices that it's not a fuel tank.

207
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,060
 It's not an airplane.

208
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,020
 It's something he's never seen before.

209
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:10,940
 He said that it looked like a metallic egg, a shiny aluminum colored metallic egg, with

210
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,100
 no rivets, no seams in it, just one thing.

211
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,060
 Now that's a very common in UFOology.

212
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:21,840
 It's funny that because Earth technology is even our most advanced stuff, like you can

213
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,160
 see seams in it.

214
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,560
 There are, because where the pieces of metal have to fit together, it always, people always

215
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:33,000
 note when they discover this alien technology that it seems like it's just one piece of

216
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 metal.

217
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,160
 Which I personally don't find that, I don't find that impressive.

218
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,760
 Like maybe it's because I'm not like a metal worker man.

219
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,720
 But the fact that something's made out of one thing of metal, I would, that wouldn't

220
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,880
 be what shocked me.

221
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,880
 What would shock me?

222
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,420
 I wouldn't really look into that detail.

223
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,220
 It was hovering, it was hovering off the ground.

224
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:55,980
 That would be my first giveaway that it was a UFO, not that I couldn't see any rivets.

225
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,740
 I will say this though.

226
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:03,780
 Gary, 27 year old Gary Wilcox, did something that I have not seen in any of my UFO stories

227
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:08,660
 that I've been doing for this show, or really any that I've read ever.

228
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,100
 He sees the ship, it's hovering slightly off the ground.

229
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,340
 He notices there's no rivets, there's no seams.

230
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,420
 It's this perfectly molded piece of metal.

231
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,480
 It's most likely from either another planet or the dimension something like that.

232
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,640
 It is not of this world.

233
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,040
 And Gary Wilcox walks up to it and kicks it.

234
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,080
 Which is something that I think a farmer would do.

235
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,920
 But I think, I've never read that before.

236
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,720
 I've never read someone seeing a UFO and walking up and giving it a good kick.

237
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,280
 Like it was a tractor tire.

238
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,880
 Like he was trying to figure out what the air pressure was in it.

239
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,360
 He kicks the ship and that causes two aliens to come out of it.

240
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,720
 So now you're like, oh this is dope.

241
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,580
 Like imagine if you were walking through the city and you saw a nice car and you're like,

242
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,580
 that's weird.

243
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,580
 You've never seen this make a model of a car.

244
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,580
 It has no seams.

245
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,620
 And you just kick the side of the car and a bunch of metallic gangbangers crawl out of

246
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,620
 it.

247
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,460
 That's where I thought this story was going.

248
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,500
 But no, something weirder happens than that.

249
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,300
 So these two aliens hop out.

250
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,380
 And they're described as four feet tall.

251
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,940
 So that's kind of the size of a gray alien.

252
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,700
 But he said they were covered in head to toe metal.

253
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,700
 They weren't robots.

254
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,860
 He never classified them as robots.

255
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,000
 But he said from foot to head, they were wearing a space suit.

256
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,520
 I couldn't see their faces.

257
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,760
 They just looked like these people who are wrapped in aluminum foil, soft aluminum foil.

258
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,040
 Very shiny metal people, but not metal.

259
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,480
 Like he assumes that there were aliens inside these suits.

260
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,480
 They hop out of the UFO and they're carrying a tray of material.

261
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,040
 Space material, you ask?

262
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,440
 No, actually.

263
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,760
 On this tray, I wouldn't recognize these things.

264
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,300
 People may be the last four, but the first one, the aliens jump out of the UFO.

265
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,500
 They're holding a tray that has alfalfa on it.

266
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,660
 I wouldn't know that if I was eating it.

267
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,300
 It also had roots, soil, leaves, and brush.

268
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:57,180
 So it was a collection of earthly materials on this tray.

269
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,940
 And he says we just stood there staring at each other for a couple minutes.

270
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,940
 And he was terrified.

271
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,500
 He was absolutely terrified of what was going on.

272
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,780
 Now these aliens are watching him and he's watching these aliens and he's looking down

273
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,940
 at the tray they're holding.

274
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,200
 And most likely they got this stuff from his farm.

275
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,880
 They're basically stealing stuff from his property.

276
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,200
 He's terrified to death.

277
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,120
 He said the first thing the aliens say to him on this warm April 24th, is it warm in

278
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,360
 April in New York?

279
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,720
 On this regular April 24th day, 10 a.m.

280
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,960
 Right now it's probably like 10, 10.

281
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:31,680
 But anyways, the aliens look at him and they go, "Don't be alarmed.

282
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,360
 We have spoken to people before."

283
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,240
 And I'd be thinking, I don't care how many people you've spoken to.

284
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,460
 I don't care if you do in Tony Robbins seminars.

285
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,460
 I'm terrified.

286
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,860
 You're right in front of me.

287
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,860
 You guys are four feet tall.

288
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,740
 You jumped out of a spaceship and I can't see your faces.

289
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,820
 I don't care how many people you've talked to.

290
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,540
 But for whatever reason, this actually calms Gary Wilcox down.

291
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,580
 And he says, he goes, "This is the weird thing."

292
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,580
 This was an actual quote.

293
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,660
 I'll read his quote.

294
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,700
 Their voices did not sound like a voice I could describe.

295
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:02,460
 I could understand what was said but cannot tell whether they were speaking English or

296
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,660
 not.

297
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,900
 So that's kind of an interesting thing.

298
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:11,040
 It could be some sort of language, assuming any of this is real, but with modern translators

299
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,600
 that we use, you'll hear the person speak in their native language and then you'll hear

300
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
 them speak in English.

301
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,600
 I think.

302
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
 I think those have been invented, right?

303
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,440
 Those exist, right?

304
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,400
 It could be also some sort of telepathy or something like that, which is really common

305
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,400
 with it.

306
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,920
 It's another common theme with UFO stories.

307
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,440
 We have the ship with no seams.

308
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,720
 We have the possible telepathy.

309
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,600
 They can easily communicate with us.

310
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,780
 But then we start to get to a couple things that really deviate from normal, quote unquote,

311
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,100
 "normal" UFO stories.

312
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:48,180
 But there's one particular fact that makes people go, "This story is 100% a hoax or 99%

313
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,180
 a hoax."

314
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,380
 And that's why it's not really talked about in UFOology.

315
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:56,340
 He starts, the aliens start a conversation with him and they ask him, "So what are you

316
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,340
 doing here?"

317
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,980
 And he's like, "I'm a farmer.

318
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,980
 This is my farm."

319
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,980
 And they go, "What's that thing there?"

320
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,980
 And he goes, "This?

321
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,980
 This right here?

322
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,480
 That's my John Deere tractor."

323
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,480
 And they're like, "Oh, interesting.

324
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,480
 What's that thing on the back?"

325
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,200
 He's like, "Oh, that spreads out manure."

326
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,920
 And the two aliens look at each other, they go, "What is this manure you speak of?"

327
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,440
 And he's like, "Oh, I mean, do you want the Cliff Notes version?

328
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,640
 You want me to really tell you what it is?

329
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,200
 It's a big old pile of poop.

330
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,680
 It's a pile of poop mixed in with some nutrients.

331
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,880
 And then I put it in this fancy dainty machine and it just shoots it out everywhere.

332
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,880
 Dennis the Mennist style.

333
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,120
 And the aliens are like, "Oh, that explains the smell."

334
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,820
 And they discussed his job for quite a while.

335
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,260
 They talked for a total of two hours, according to Gary Wilcox.

336
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,300
 He talked to these aliens for about two hours.

337
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,020
 Didn't get any farm work done talking to these two aliens.

338
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:50,340
 And one interesting fact is that usually it's the person saying, "Where do you come from?

339
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,820
 Are you here to declare war?

340
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,260
 Are you here to help our environment?"

341
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,260
 Stuff like that.

342
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,300
 The aliens were asking the human questions.

343
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,540
 So that's one thing that you don't normally get in these stories.

344
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:05,200
 The aliens are actually more curious about him verbally than he's asking them questions.

345
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,360
 They do offer some information.

346
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,960
 They say, "The reason why we're asking you all these questions about farming, the reason

347
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:15,920
 why we have this tray of stolen alfalfa, soil, roots, stuff like that, is because on our planet

348
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,520
 we live on a rocky planet where organic substances don't really exist.

349
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,760
 We can't grow anything on our planet."

350
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,160
 So we're fascinated by the fact that Earth has these just minerals lying about.

351
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,020
 These organic materials lying about.

352
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,980
 So we're going to take these back, run a bunch of experiments on them.

353
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,700
 He's like, "That's fascinating."

354
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:38,580
 They also gave an interesting, this is a really, really interesting comment.

355
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,220
 And it explains a lot about UFOs.

356
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,420
 And again, it's a shame that the story isn't more widely accepted.

357
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:50,460
 The aliens say, "You know, we have a real problem with your guy's environment.

358
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:55,540
 Our ships cannot operate where there's pollution, where there's a lot of automobiles, where

359
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,880
 there's a lot of exhaust in the air.

360
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,400
 Our ships can't fly."

361
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,240
 That's why we fly in rural areas.

362
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,280
 That's why we're mostly sighted out in farmlands.

363
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,720
 Now that's so interesting because it answers two questions.

364
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,640
 It answers two big questions about modern UFO stories.

365
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,760
 One, why do UFOs always sighted by country bumpkins and middle of nowhere?

366
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,480
 Because their ships can only fly out there.

367
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,920
 If you fly over LA City, like the Battle of Los Angeles, that wasn't a hoax.

368
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,240
 It was just a mass hysteria event.

369
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,400
 It would explain why they're mostly seen in farmland areas is because that's where

370
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,340
 their ships are able to fly without any interference.

371
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,380
 Two, and I've been harping on this forever.

372
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,180
 It explains the idea of aliens coming down and telling us we got to change the environment

373
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,180
 and stuff like that.

374
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,780
 If we keep doing stuff to the environment, it's going to doom us.

375
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,500
 And we've gotten this huge wave of hippie aliens showing up for the past 30 years talking

376
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,540
 about the ozone layer and nonsense like that.

377
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,060
 This could be why.

378
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,780
 It's nothing to do with the fact like, "Oh no, humanity, if you keep putting carbon

379
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,080
 in the atmosphere, you'll die off."

380
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,080
 It's not that.

381
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,280
 It's that their ships won't work.

382
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:05,040
 If we keep polluting the planet, they can't keep coming down here to get our resources.

383
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:11,160
 Or eventually, if they ever do decide to do a full scale colonization invasion, if their

384
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,520
 ships can't fly, there's going to be a very short term invasion.

385
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,240
 So it answers those two questions, why they're always seen in middle of nowhere, why aliens

386
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,160
 would care anything for our environment at all.

387
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,700
 Because if you can build a spaceship to fly around, you could easily build artificial environments,

388
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,700
 Dyson spheres, whatever.

389
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:32,180
 If you can build a spaceship, you can build a desalination plant.

390
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:36,300
 If you can build a spaceship that can bend the rules of the universe, you could easily

391
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:40,940
 go, "Oh, here's this two by two box that you press it, it cleans your atmosphere."

392
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:44,780
 But if their ships can't even get here because the pollution gets so bad, that makes more

393
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,780
 sense.

394
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,900
 So it answers those two questions.

395
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,620
 He goes, eventually he goes, "Hey, can I go, can I hitch a ride with you guys?"

396
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:58,560
 Which is, again, this kid is quite bold, walks up, kicks a UFO, and then asks for a ride

397
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,120
 on said UFO.

398
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,720
 And the aliens, I mean, they've been talking for two hours, they got to know each other,

399
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,800
 probably exchanged phone numbers, maybe a little flirting was going on there.

400
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,040
 But the aliens said, "You know what, dude?

401
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,040
 That'd be cool."

402
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,920
 But where we come from, the atmosphere is really, really thin, so you wouldn't be able

403
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,920
 to breathe.

404
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,920
 Basically, like, sure, you could come hang out on a spaceship, but once we land, you

405
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,160
 will die.

406
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,160
 So they said they couldn't do that.

407
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,860
 And they went on and on, and then he finally said at the end, he goes, "Hey, you know what?

408
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,420
 You guys are really interested in manure, right?"

409
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,700
 And they're like, "Oh, that's a nice way to wrap up this conversation."

410
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,740
 "Yes, we are interested in your earth manure."

411
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,340
 He goes, "I can go get you a bag.

412
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,340
 I can get you a bag of manure.

413
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,940
 Give it to you, you'll take it back to your spaceship."

414
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,660
 And the aliens go, "We don't have time.

415
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,180
 Like, if you, by the time you get back to your farmhouse and get back here, because it

416
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,580
 was like a 300 acre farm."

417
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,700
 He goes, "We got to go, dude."

418
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,160
 Which seems weird that they talked for two hours, and then when he said he just needed

419
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,280
 to go get some manure, all of a sudden they had to leave.

420
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,920
 Which to be fair, if I was hanging out at someone's house and I was having a good time

421
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,760
 when we were talking, and then he goes, "Hey, man, you want to take some manure home with

422
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,760
 you?"

423
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,080
 I would be like, "Uh, it's time to go."

424
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,920
 But anyway, so the aliens get on their ship and it goes, "Oh, oh, oh, actually, they get

425
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,920
 back off the ship.

426
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,360
 They got to get live or one more message."

427
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,960
 They jump off the ship and they say, "Hey, we're going to tell you something.

428
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,880
 We're going to tell you something."

429
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,060
 John Glenn, you know astronaut John Glenn and Gary's like, "Yeah, yeah, totally, totally

430
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,060
 no."

431
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,060
 They're like, "Okay, that was weird."

432
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,500
 You know John Glenn?

433
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,940
 There's also an astronaut named Virgil Grissom.

434
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,980
 He's a U.S. astronaut and Gary Wilcox, yeah, I kind of know him.

435
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,020
 And then they said two Russian astronauts.

436
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:35,980
 They don't say the names in the reports, but so John Glenn, Virgil Grissom and two Russian

437
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:41,900
 astronauts, the aliens say they're going to die within a year due to exposure from, quote,

438
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,980
 the elements of space.

439
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:48,160
 And then they get back on their spaceship and Gary Wilcox is like, "Oh, that was creepy."

440
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,920
 And the ship goes, "Whew."

441
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,560
 It just disappears, flies off so fast you can't see it.

442
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,000
 Now Gary has just wasted two hours, I guess it's not a waste to have interstellar communication,

443
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,440
 but Gary has spent two hours of his day in the middle of the field talking to either aliens

444
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,640
 or figments of his imagination.

445
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,640
 But he says, "You know what?

446
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,080
 I'm going to get them that bag of fertilizer."

447
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,600
 So he goes back to his farmhouse.

448
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,500
 He actually continues to do his duties.

449
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:20,020
 He ends up loading a 75 pound bag of manure, drives it back to the spot where the spaceship

450
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:24,380
 landed and throws it down and goes home.

451
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,940
 And he says the next day that bag of manure was gone.

452
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,300
 Dun, dun, dun.

453
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:34,300
 Now the reason why we know about this is because he did call the police afterwards.

454
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:38,580
 He said, "Wait, which is, it's funny because who would you call?"

455
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,300
 Like it definitely, you would think, "Oh, that was kind of cool, hung out with some dope

456
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,960
 aliens, you know, talked about alfalfa and manure for a while."

457
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,600
 Told me a couple astronauts were going to die.

458
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,720
 That might be a national security problem.

459
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,800
 But you also figure at the end of the day it would be the same thing if any foreign government

460
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,160
 just happened to land in your yard, talk to you for a while.

461
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,360
 Eventually you would probably want to alert the authorities.

462
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,640
 He alerted the authorities, then it got, then the UFO community got wind of it.

463
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,680
 And apparently he was offered a bunch of money for exclusive rights to a story and he turned

464
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,680
 it down.

465
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,860
 So people have said he probably wasn't a financial motive in this.

466
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:16,340
 But the reason why, let me talk about the prophecy here real quick because that's not

467
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,940
 why UFOologists disregard this story.

468
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,940
 So let's look at that prophecy.

469
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,500
 The story took place in 1964.

470
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,900
 The aliens said within a year, John Glenn, Virgil Grissom and two Russian astronauts

471
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,900
 were going to die due to exposure from space.

472
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,980
 Within three years, John Glenn didn't die then.

473
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,980
 John Glenn was still around.

474
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:41,400
 But within three years, Virgil died in a Apollo, I think it was the, it was some Apollo mission

475
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,240
 where the capsule burnt up.

476
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:48,440
 Him and two other American astronauts were cooked to a crisp in this reentry capsule.

477
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,520
 Or maybe it was on launch.

478
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,020
 But anyways, they died.

479
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:55,760
 And then there was a Russian astronaut named Vladimir, of course.

480
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,160
 He died in 1967.

481
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:02,120
 He died on the exact date, April 24, 1967, three years to the day.

482
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:06,260
 Now, so their prophecy was not true.

483
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:10,820
 Which if we want to be skeptical and say none of it was true, then of course, that was just

484
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:15,700
 statistical that people in a high risk business were going to die doing that.

485
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,260
 So you could just write that off.

486
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,660
 I would say if you believe this story, the reason why the prophecy could be wrong, and

487
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:25,780
 I don't really know if it's a prophecy as much as a warning, but it could be wrong because

488
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:31,500
 our spacesuit technology at this stage in development was better than that alien's race.

489
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,680
 So when they first started shooting people off to their moons, they were dying of exposure

490
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,200
 to space, but we had a better system.

491
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,160
 So we weren't dying because of all those elements up there.

492
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:45,040
 If we're assuming the story is true, that is a way to work around the prophecy.

493
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:50,880
 So if it's a hoax, you should never include prophecies in your hoaxes ever.

494
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,320
 Unless it's a thousand years from now.

495
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,040
 If you're ever planning on pulling a hoax, if you're ever planning on having like a vision

496
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,440
 or something like that, never set a date, never set a date.

497
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,340
 It will always backfire, even if you think it's 100%.

498
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:07,460
 But that's not the false warning, the warning that turned out not to be true.

499
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,540
 It's not the reason why UFOologists don't believe this, because people still believe

500
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,820
 in no stromus, even though his dates constantly change.

501
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,060
 There's a particular fact that I left out of this story.

502
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,940
 So let's say you were listening to the story this whole time and you thought, "This is

503
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,460
 fascinating," and I do think it's fascinating, even with this particular fact.

504
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,220
 But I'm telling you this story, I left out a key detail.

505
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:31,720
 And it's the reason why UFOologists don't believe this story, and it is the dumbest

506
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,200
 reason to not believe this story.

507
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,720
 The aliens said that they come from a planet where organic matter doesn't grow.

508
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:45,960
 They come from a planet with a thin atmosphere, they come from a rocky planet, and they told

509
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:53,400
 Gary Wilcox the name of that planet, that planet's name is Mars.

510
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:58,140
 Because this story takes place on the planet closest to us.

511
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,420
 It has pretty much been dismissed by modern UFOologists, because they say, "Well, there

512
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,380
 are no aliens on Mars."

513
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:10,640
 If he had said they came from the global GLOP system, if he had said they had come from

514
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:17,300
 nine planets beyond the eighth veil, this story would be more entrenched in the lore.

515
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:22,820
 The first documented case of voluntarily trading with an alien species, well, they didn't

516
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,640
 give us anything, but we gave them earthly materials.

517
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,120
 This would have been one of those stories that went around.

518
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:33,040
 But because he named it as Mars, and people go, "Well, there are no aliens on Mars."

519
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,120
 It's impossible.

520
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,600
 It gets brushed to the side.

521
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,920
 And I find that fascinating, because one, if you believe in things like faster than

522
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,760
 light travel and the government's covering up, why wouldn't you believe the government

523
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,600
 is covering up life on Mars?

524
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,400
 If you look at Mars and say that's a dead planet, you could say, "Well, maybe there's

525
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,940
 aliens in the middle of it.

526
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,340
 Maybe there's aliens in the cave system."

527
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,140
 Because if you're going to believe in something as…

528
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,700
 I mean, let's just say, if you're going to believe in something as ludicrous as aliens

529
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,180
 to begin with, why stop there?

530
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,460
 It's so bizarre to me.

531
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,460
 I believe in aliens.

532
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,580
 I don't think they come from other star systems.

533
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:13,100
 I would find it far more likely that there were aliens inside a cave system in Mars or

534
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,140
 some other place in our solar system.

535
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,580
 I would find that infinitesimally more…

536
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,140
 Is that a word?

537
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,140
 Infantesimal?

538
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:27,080
 I would find that far, far more likely than them coming from Alpha Centauri or the Draco

539
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,520
 Star Cluster or whatever.

540
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,520
 That is just ridiculous.

541
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,520
 Absolutely ridiculous.

542
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,880
 If you're going to expend the fuel to get from all the way from there to come here,

543
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,360
 you're not picking Alpha.

544
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,160
 You're not picking up cows.

545
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,160
 Okay?

546
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,120
 I don't think they come from that far away.

547
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,120
 I've said this before.

548
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,120
 I think they're already here.

549
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,800
 I think they're coming from another dimension or they're with our local star system, i.e.,

550
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,260
 our solar system.

551
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,700
 That just makes more sense.

552
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:58,920
 But because the idea of aliens from Mars is such a joke that people just disregard it

553
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,000
 out of hand.

554
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,540
 And his story has really been considered a hoax for decades because of that one word,

555
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,540
 Mars.

556
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:13,580
 If aliens were going to come from anywhere, in outer space they would come from some place,

557
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,300
 relatively close to us.

558
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,500
 If they're breaking the laws of physics, then they're fairies and they're angels

559
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,500
 or whatever.

560
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,720
 I mean, you just have to look at it realistically like that.

561
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:30,280
 And to me, that actually makes it more exciting to think that aliens are already here.

562
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:34,560
 They traveled here four million years ago and they're right underneath us or they're

563
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,680
 just shifting from one dimension to another and they can pop up anywhere.

564
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:43,760
 I find that's far more intriguing than a space empire across the galaxy because who cares

565
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,040
 about that?

566
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,660
 To think that there are next door neighbors and they're picking our vegetables and taking

567
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:52,240
 them home, I find far, far more interesting.

568
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,420
 But modern ufology disagrees with me.

569
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:57,860
 They really have, it's the same thing with bigfoot people.

570
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:03,720
 They have this rigid ideology that anything, they don't like to be contested.

571
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,340
 It has to fit that ideology.

572
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:11,300
 If he had said any other planet, this story would be regarded in a different way.

573
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,780
 You have to wonder how many other stories out there are likely.

574
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:20,920
 Stories that are intriguing have these interesting little tidbits of alien life and the motives

575
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,200
 of why aliens do the things they do.

576
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,000
 Because this story really explains a lot about why aliens do the things they do.

577
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:35,840
 And they just get buried because they don't fit the dogma of the UFO community.

578
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:41,640
 Researchers going over reams and reams of data and they come across these stories that

579
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,160
 just don't fit.

580
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,860
 Like a religious text.

581
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:48,300
 This is what the UFO lore is.

582
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:54,260
 And anything that doesn't contribute to the overall arc that the people, the powers that

583
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:59,100
 be in the UFO community want it to be, they get pulled out.

584
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,420
 Like the Council of Nicaea putting the Bible together.

585
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:05,260
 We do the same thing with UFOology.

586
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:08,220
 This story doesn't fit the overall narrative, tear it out.

587
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,540
 This story doesn't fit the overall narrative, tear it out.

588
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,960
 These five do put them in.

589
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,120
 Even though they add nothing to what we know about why UFOs and aliens work.

590
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,120
 They add nothing.

591
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,240
 They only reinforce what you want us to think about that.

592
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:28,560
 UFOology has long been rumored to not be a collection of crackpots, ex-military officials,

593
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,560
 politicians, and people gazing up at the sky.

594
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,000
 It's long been rumored to not be controlled by those people.

595
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,960
 The Bigfoot community, bunch of weirdos.

596
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,260
 The Paranormal community, a bunch of weirdos.

597
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,180
 And I'm including myself in those groups.

598
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:49,260
 But the UFOologists, there's always been a rumor that it is not being controlled top

599
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:55,180
 down by the weirdos with a passion for an identified flying object.

600
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:59,180
 That it is being dictated by the governments of the world.

601
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,100
 Who use weirdos?

602
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,380
 Who use ex-military officials?

603
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,820
 Who use whistleblowing politicians?

604
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,160
 They're all part of this power structure.

605
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,160
 You don't ever hear that.

606
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:15,360
 You don't ever hear that the government is interfering with Bigfoot investigations.

607
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,120
 But you often hear that they're interfering with UFO investigations.

608
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:26,800
 And you'll also hear some of the top names in UFOology being named by others as disinfo

609
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,880
 agents, as shills.

610
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,080
 As people who are put into power either have their books pushed more or their personal

611
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:41,780
 UFO organizations pushed more by an overseen body by a controlling hand.

612
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:45,140
 And when that happens, and I don't know if that's true.

613
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,140
 I don't know if that's true.

614
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:52,400
 It's just long been a rumor that the top weirdos, the top weirdos of the UFO community are

615
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,780
 disinfo agents, the gatekeepers of UFO law.

616
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:03,540
 The most likely explanation is there is no rumored group controlling UFO mythology because

617
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,980
 there are no UFOs.

618
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,380
 That it's all optical illusions.

619
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:11,520
 And what people are seeing is something, but they're not aliens from another planet or

620
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,880
 another dimension or anything like that.

621
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,520
 It's another phenomenon.

622
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:18,400
 That's the most skeptical, rational answer.

623
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,960
 But to people who see UFOs and people who have seen aliens and things like that, that

624
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,780
 answer doesn't wash.

625
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,720
 And then we have people like Gary Wilcox.

626
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,340
 People who tell their story and it becomes a hoax.

627
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:33,120
 It becomes a joke.

628
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:39,820
 It becomes disregarded because everyone knows there are no aliens on Mars.

629
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:43,780
 If it was a hoax, it was a very costly one for Gary Wilcox.

630
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:51,100
 His farm ended up going out of business because large stretches of land would no longer grow

631
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,060
 vegetables.

632
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,820
 He also had to get treated reportedly, reportedly.

633
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,180
 He also had to get cut.

634
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:02,260
 He also had to get treated for radiation burns because of his close contact to whatever it

635
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,800
 was that was out in his field that day.

636
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:10,320
 In the end, though, he did leave the farm and became an accomplished mechanic.

637
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,520
 And there's been rumors that his mechanical abilities were given to him by his contact

638
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,520
 with the aliens.

639
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,720
 I don't know if that's true.

640
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,060
 He may have always been a gifted mechanic.

641
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,960
 But his story ends on a high note.

642
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:27,680
 Yes, he did have the radiation burns and yes, his business had failed, but he did much better

643
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,960
 in his later years.

644
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,820
 But his story didn't.

645
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:39,140
 While his personal life may have had a happy ending, his story has been relegated to being

646
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:43,740
 another joke, another little hoax.

647
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:49,780
 And it's time to move on and look towards the "legitimate" alien stories, the stories

648
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:56,540
 that match the narrative that somebody wants us to believe.

649
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:01,080
 The saying never was, "I want to believe."

650
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:08,080
 The saying actually is, "I will tell you what to believe and you will believe nothing else."
