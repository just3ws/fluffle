1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
 What would you do if your best friend asked you to write him a letter?

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,560
 A letter which could change his life.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:16,260
 And then we travel to Santiago, Chile, to meet a young man who's riding his bike home one

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,980
 afternoon.

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:25,320
 When a car slams into him and he flies off of his bicycle, he thinks this is the end.

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:33,240
 But as he suddenly realizes his soul is leaving his physical form, he has no idea of the adventure.

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,680
 He's about to go on TODAY on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:49,040
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,040
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:58,040
 I hope you guys are having a great day too and we'll do a little dance in each area.

11
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,760
 It's nice that you're dancing Jason, but maybe focus on the audio quality.

12
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,240
 We have a lot of stuff to cover so first off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command, give it

13
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:10,880
 up for longtime supporters of the show, Nick and Helena Buston.

14
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,880
 Woohoo!

15
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,880
 Yeah!

16
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,880
 Come on in!

17
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,320
 Nick and Helena Buston into Dead Rabbit Radio.

18
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,040
 They are longtime supporters of the show.

19
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:25,040
 They always stop by for the live episodes we do on Sundays and they sent me a birthday

20
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,120
 present.

21
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,280
 They sent me a birthday present because my birthday is next Tuesday.

22
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:36,800
 If you're listening to this episode in time, October 4th is my birthday and they sent me

23
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,160
 a present off of my Amazon wish list.

24
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:44,360
 They sent me the book Humanoid Encounters, the others amongst us.

25
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,360
 Woo!

26
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,600
 Spooky title and timely.

27
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,800
 It's a meme.

28
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,760
 This is actually as much as I'm making fun of the book.

29
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,760
 I love this book.

30
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,320
 This is by Albert Rosales.

31
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,720
 We've covered a lot of stuff from his Humanoid Encounters books over the years.

32
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,680
 What I like about it is not just UFO stuff.

33
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,040
 It's not just like, "Oh, I saw a light in the sky."

34
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,360
 Well, thanks for telling me that.

35
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,800
 That doesn't edify my life in any sort of way.

36
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,520
 This is all humanoids and it's for the time period, 1900 to 1929.

37
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,240
 So a lot of old school stuff.

38
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,840
 I'm imagining there's going to be a bunch of fairies and there's going to be a ton of

39
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,520
 fairy sightings, all this stuff.

40
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,440
 It's like, "Whoa, dude, this is super awesome."

41
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,760
 Then I get to the end and they're like, "And they are only nine.

42
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,760
 It's just tall."

43
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,040
 I'm like, "Oh, dang it, man!"

44
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,680
 Nick and Helena, thank you so much for giving me this book for my birthday.

45
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,960
 You guys are going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

46
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,320
 If you guys can't swear to Patreon, if you guys can't buy me birthday presents, that's

47
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,320
 fine too.

48
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,680
 Just helps spread the word about the show that really, really, really helps out a lot.

49
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,520
 Now Nick and Helena, I'm going to toss the keys up into the air.

50
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,760
 You guys fight over who actually can grab them first.

51
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,120
 Let's hop into Jason Jalopy.

52
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,160
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

53
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,120
 Take us on out to Florida.

54
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,440
 As we're driving out to Florida, we're going to stop off first at North Carolina, specifically

55
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,800
 Winston Salem, North Carolina.

56
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:13,160
 On June 28, 2022 in Winston Salem, at a Target store, there was a confrontation.

57
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,920
 There was four people involved in this.

58
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:21,080
 You had a guy walking through the store and he was confronted by three other dudes.

59
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,480
 You know, words were exchanged.

60
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,480
 The guy, he fell.

61
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,480
 He was, "I'm a danger, man.

62
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,480
 I'm a danger from my life."

63
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,320
 He starts slapping at the three dudes.

64
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,720
 It's like one on three.

65
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
 Three dudes keep coming.

66
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,720
 This is in the store, by the way.

67
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,560
 This is like by the toothbrush aisle.

68
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,720
 The dudes are like, "Oh no, I'm so scared."

69
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:43,840
 He pulled the gun out and he shot one of these three dudes.

70
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,720
 Then they took the gun from him.

71
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,240
 They did a little like, "Ah, give me the gun."

72
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,280
 They took it from the dude and the three guys took off running.

73
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,860
 You're like, "Man, how scary would that be?"

74
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,120
 You're just walking through Target and then three dudes confront you and you're like, "Oh,

75
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,160
 dude, I better start shooting."

76
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,480
 Now, you totally get that right.

77
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,480
 Three on one.

78
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,480
 You can fear for your life.

79
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,600
 What happened?

80
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,880
 And that was pretty much the tone of a lot of articles covering this crime.

81
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,440
 But let's look at what really happened.

82
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,400
 We'll see which side you pick now, you pervert.

83
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,760
 You thought that the guy being assaulted was the victim?

84
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,000
 Oh, you're sick.

85
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,120
 Oh, quit listening to my podcast.

86
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,280
 That is the way a lot of news articles report to this story.

87
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,280
 What happened?

88
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:37,480
 There's a group called "Dads Against Predators" and it was these three dudes who lure...

89
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,040
 I have a hard time saying that word, so it's gonna make it sound like I have some head

90
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,280
 injury/french accent.

91
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,960
 They would lure men generally.

92
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,480
 Every show I've done they catch a woman, but I don't know if this group did, but these

93
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,480
 types of groups.

94
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,760
 Anyways, "Dads Against Predators."

95
00:04:52,760 --> 00:05:00,720
 They go online and they pretend to be underage girls and then they say, "Hey, you wanna meet

96
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,720
 up?"

97
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,840
 And the dude's like, "Oh yeah, dude, I'm told scummo dude, I'll totally do that."

98
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,360
 And then when they meet up, generally at Walmart, I watch a lot of these channels on YouTube.

99
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,360
 I'll be sitting there eating dinner and they'll be like, "What?

100
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,360
 I'm not a pervert.

101
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,480
 Let me show you these chat logs."

102
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:22,320
 What it is is they lure them to a public place and videotape them and go, "You're a child

103
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,880
 predator, you're so sick, you're a big ol' gross dude."

104
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:32,080
 And videotape them and they post it on YouTube for me to watch while I'm eating chili beans.

105
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,680
 That was this group, "Dads Against Predators."

106
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,520
 And there's a ton of these groups out there.

107
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,120
 There's dozens at least that are active.

108
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,520
 "Dads Against Predators" were talking to a 25-year-old man and they got him to come to

109
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,840
 this target and when they confronted him, he slapped the...because they were filming

110
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,840
 him.

111
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,840
 They're like, "What's up, pervert?

112
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,840
 What's up?

113
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,840
 You're here to meet this little girl?"

114
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,120
 He slapped the camera, slapped the camera phone, out of the guy's hand, a scuffle broke

115
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,400
 out and so then this dude pulled the gun out and shot the guy.

116
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,040
 He's referred to, the 25-year-old guy's referred to as the victim multiple times even by the

117
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,520
 police and I'm like, "Yeah, okay."

118
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,520
 He did get roughed up by three dudes.

119
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,080
 He was the first guy to slap.

120
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,520
 He's also a dude trying to meet up with a little girl.

121
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,600
 Right?

122
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,640
 Like it's so weird to read these articles and yes, I guess you might...actually he didn't

123
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,360
...he didn't get shot.

124
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,920
 The only thing he did was get harassed and then he hit somebody and they started beating

125
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,640
 him up and then he shot somebody and he's the victim.

126
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,880
 This is...and you know what's so funny?

127
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,640
 So you can find a lot of articles about this and we're missing some key details.

128
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,080
 We don't know how old the fake girl was.

129
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:48,440
 Usually it's a teenager, generally it's not like "I'm six" type of thing.

130
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,280
 Normally it's like between the ages of 12 and 16.

131
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,200
 That's the ones that I mostly see online.

132
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:58,080
 The girls don't actually exist, but we don't know how old the girl was, right?

133
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,880
 Which is weird.

134
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:04,400
 The news article...I have a couple articles in the show notes.

135
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,200
 You'll start to see the first ones are like, "Dad is against predators.

136
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,720
 We're luring this dude."

137
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,360
 I'm assuming the news reporter could pronounce the word correctly.

138
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,280
 So then you'll see other articles where it's like, have her through the article, they set

139
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,160
 it up and they're like, "Yeah, this guy, this poor guy was at Target and he got jumped."

140
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,200
 And then have her through the article, they're like, "Yeah, the people who jumped him were

141
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,640
 from a group called Dad's Against Predators."

142
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,440
 So they'll build it up like, "Look at this poor guy.

143
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,240
 This could happen to you, right?

144
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,240
 The reporter is a big pervert too.

145
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,040
 He's like, "This could happen to any of us."

146
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,600
 And everyone else is like, "No, it would only happen...I mean sure, I guess anyone could

147
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,160
 beat up at a Target, but this guy specifically got roughed up."

148
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,080
 Oh, and they were like...articles would be like, "We don't know if they're gonna charge

149
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,400
 them in with robbery for stealing that gun."

150
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,320
 You're like, "What are you talking about?"

151
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,200
 This dude was here to meet up with a kid, right?

152
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,000
 Now, listen, I understand.

153
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,160
 There are people who go, "These people aren't legal professionals.

154
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,680
 The group's called Dad's Against Predators or Creep Catchers.

155
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,040
 There's a group called Creep Catchers.

156
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,920
 They're not legal professionals.

157
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,400
 They're not law enforcement.

158
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,400
 Nothing like that."

159
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,400
 I totally get that.

160
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,400
 And they say, "Well, they can falsely accuse people of doing things."

161
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,400
 Yeah, they could.

162
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,120
 Like, I could totally see that ruining somebody's life, right?

163
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:32,200
 They can say that they're actually endangering active police investigations into these pedophiles.

164
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,640
 I don't believe that.

165
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:39,840
 Because I don't think that the police are...obviously, these YouTube...I mean, it is catch after

166
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,840
 catch after catch.

167
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:48,880
 If you're gonna have a YouTube channel with 140 videos and you're just in your hometown,

168
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,600
 the police are not doing anything about this.

169
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,120
 And that's what all of these groups say.

170
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,920
 They're like, "We're doing this, one, because we really love that Chris Hansen show to

171
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,560
 catch a predator, but two, like, obviously if we can catch these many people, then law

172
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,840
 enforcement is...what active investigations am I interfering with?

173
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,840
 You're not doing it.

174
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,840
 I shouldn't be catching anybody.

175
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,920
 I shouldn't be catching anybody."

176
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,240
 Now, when I watch these channels, I prefer to watch the ones.

177
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,080
 And it's boring, and I'm not saying that I watch the first five minutes.

178
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,480
 Sometimes I'll skip past it.

179
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,960
 But you need to post the chat logs.

180
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:29,360
 Because otherwise, I'm taking you at your word that this guy is as creepy as you say.

181
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,720
 There are some channels where this dude will just walk up to an Arby's restaurant and be

182
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,720
 like, "Hey, bro, you're a pedophile."

183
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,720
 And they'll be like, "What?"

184
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,160
 And they're like, "You were trying to meet up with this 14-year-old girl, and he's like,

185
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,160
 "What?

186
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,160
 Oh, no, I wasn't.

187
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,160
 I was just trying to be friends with her and stuff."

188
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,160
 Which is still gross, right?

189
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,160
 It's still gross.

190
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,640
 It's still gross, but I'm thinking, like, if they're the chat...some of them will show

191
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,320
 screen shots of the chat log so you can see how gross they are.

192
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,960
 I would be taking you at your word when you go, "You're trying to meet up with this girl

193
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,040
 and she said this and you were being all perverted and stuff like that."

194
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,360
 There's a lot of groups like Perverted Justice that will put all of the chat logs online

195
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,560
 so you can see how gross they are.

196
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,560
 I don't want to get all the details.

197
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,920
 You can even blur out the grossest stuff.

198
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,280
 But show me you've done some investigations.

199
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,720
 But anyways, you have a bunch of these groups and they're actually starting to get taken

200
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,720
 down.

201
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,840
 Like, I actually was looking forward this video because they post this stuff up.

202
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,680
 This group called Dads Against Predators were putting on their YouTube channel.

203
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,120
 The video of them and the target, I couldn't find it.

204
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,360
 Apparently they took their...this is always a bad, bad thing.

205
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,520
 They took their spiciest videos and put them behind a Patreon paywall.

206
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,800
 So join our Patreon and then you get access to all this additional content and apparently

207
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,320
 it looks like Patreon shut them down.

208
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,560
 So all that content's gone.

209
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,560
 They didn't back it up.

210
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,520
 It's all gone.

211
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,200
 Their YouTube channel is no longer any of this stuff.

212
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,440
 They have a podcast where they sit on a couch and talk about...I don't know if this is all

213
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,440
 they talk about.

214
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,840
 It looks like they have guests and stuff like that.

215
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,840
 They're bringing on pedophiles.

216
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,120
 They're like, "Yes, meet me at my house.

217
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,240
 Come and talk to my two big brothers."

218
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,240
 I don't know.

219
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,240
 I don't know what they're talking about.

220
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,240
 All of their catches.

221
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,120
 I couldn't find them on YouTube anymore.

222
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,480
 Creepcatchers.ca was so big they had their own theme song.

223
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,640
 It's dope.

224
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,280
 You want to talk about a battle rap.

225
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,280
 You want to talk about a diss.

226
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,840
 Their theme song is amazing.

227
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,680
 I might play a little snippet for you depending on how much I want to go through the fight

228
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,960
 of copyright violations and stuff like that.

229
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,960
 But it's a good song.

230
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,960
 I mean it's all about catching creeps.

231
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,960
 Creepcatchers.

232
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,960

 Well we'll expose you to the world.

234
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,840

235
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,840
 Another community.

236
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
 Memorandum every day.

237
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,840
 Your skin is up now walking free on the street.

238
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,840
 So put them online for everybody to see.

239
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,840
 Hope you recognize where everyone you ever did meet.

240
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,840
 Hope it make you lose your job and all the love from your family.

241
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,840
 Hope it make you get addicted so you live on the street.

242
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,840
 Begging for change to go get something to eat.

243
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,840
 Then you feel it's helpless as that child would be.

244
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,840
 What you gonna get a lick it up and then advance with the D-9 sex with a drugged up

245
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,840
 routine.

246
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,840
 Casually.

247
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,840
 Fuck no.

248
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,840
 Socialy cash straight, humiliated since we can't depend on the law.

249
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,840
 They giving drug dealers more time than the pedophiles.

250
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
 Nobody has to be brave.

251
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840

 And Jerry kind of looked at me and kind of took a deep breath inside and he goes, he

929
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:10,600
 says, I just think he got into some really degenerate stuff, which is possible, right?

930
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,600
 There's two types of people who look at child pornography.

931
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,840
 There's people who are child molesters and that's the type of pornography they prefer.

932
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:27,240
 And then there are people who go down this pornography rabbit hole where they just can't

933
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,120
 get off unless this stuff gets more and more degenerate.

934
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,120
 It's a crime either way.

935
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,280
 It doesn't matter if you're robbing the bank to buy meth or to pay for your grandpa's funeral.

936
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,280
 It's still a crime.

937
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:45,480
 It doesn't matter if you're a child molesting freak or someone who's watched so much porn

938
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,560
 and becomes so degenerate you're watching it, but you're like, I would never actually

939
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,560
 do it.

940
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,560
 That's not the point.

941
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:56,360
 You're watching what you're watching is a criminal act.

942
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,040
 And I always have to take the time out to say this.

943
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,120
 I know a lot of people when they go, oh, child porn, what was it?

944
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,600
 Some 16 year old girl is pretending to be 18.

945
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,520
 That's not what this type of stuff is.

946
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:15,040
 I was always under that impression too that oh, it's some 15 year old girl who looks older.

947
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,040
 Right?

948
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,920
 It's like someone who looks like she's 18.

949
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,480
 No, this stuff is like nine and under.

950
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,320
 Generally, that's the type of stuff that's being viewed.

951
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:28,280
 I don't know exactly what this dude had, what Kamal had on his computer, but it was enough

952
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:32,920
 for the feds to bash down his door and take a minute, gunpoint.

953
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:37,600
 And I remember I'm sitting there.

954
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,440
 It wasn't, obviously wasn't the best meal anymore, right?

955
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,720
 It's like, now the food can take a while to get here.

956
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,600
 It's probably not going to taste that grand.

957
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,360
 Because my buddy Jerry was grappling with this, all of this still.

958
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,160
 If I remember correctly, it started all like in January, February of this year and now

959
00:25:54,160 --> 00:26:00,320
 we're in July and we're sitting here and he's still talking about it with the same pauses

960
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:08,240
 and the same emotional tug of war inside of him that I'm sure he was going through in

961
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,920
 February, March in April.

962
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:15,840
 I mean, you know, he's still coming to his best friend, got caught with these images

963
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,680
 on his computer.

964
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:22,840
 And it's interesting because there's two other ways to look at this.

965
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,680
 One is we're old men.

966
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,000
 Kamal is 50 years old.

967
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,960
 I don't know his last name, I can't pronounce it.

968
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,040
 Kamal is 50 years old.

969
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:39,120
 And federally, when you commit a federal crime when you're in possession of child porn, it's

970
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:45,120
 five years mandatory minimum per image.

971
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,760
 So I don't know if he had a hundred images.

972
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,200
 I don't know if he had 10.

973
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,400
 But unless you have a good lawyer that can really wrap it up and do a plea deal.

974
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,800
 And sometimes that happens, right?

975
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:00,080
 He's looking at a minimum of five years minimum.

976
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,840
 If he can get all of these combined into one crime.

977
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,920
 But see the thing is too is that's for possession.

978
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,000
 He also traded it.

979
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,960
 Apparently he was passing this stuff around.

980
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:17,240
 So it's another crime, right?

981
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:21,280
 I said earlier this season I go when you're a 20 year old man, right?

982
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,440
 When I was 20 years old stomping all over Sacramento getting fist fights.

983
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:29,040
 It was like I was a kid in a candy store fighting over candy.

984
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,040
 Whatever.

985
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,040
 10 years in prison, whatever.

986
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,040
 I'm 20.

987
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,720
 I'll be out when I'm 30.

988
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,480
 Like that's kind of your attitude, right?

989
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,000
 First of all, if you don't think you're ever going to get caught.

990
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,360
 But secondly, you think, yeah, I beat someone up and sure you don't really do 10 years unless

991
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,920
 it's like second degree manslaughter or something like that.

992
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,000
 But they beat someone up.

993
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,960
 I spend a couple of weeks in jail, year, whatever.

994
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,200
 It's really bad to couple of years in prison.

995
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,200
 It doesn't matter.

996
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,200
 I'm going to get out.

997
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,400
 I'll be fine.

998
00:27:52,400 --> 00:28:02,920
 When you're 50, the idea of spending five years in prison, there's no way, right?

999
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,480
 You're not institutionalized.

1000
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,200
 You didn't go in and out of juvie as a child and then in and out of prison when in your

1001
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,920
 20s you're totally living a civilian lifestyle.

1002
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,600
 Now you're in prison for five years.

1003
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,120
 And here's the thing.

1004
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,520
 Will he get five years?

1005
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:23,560
 Let's say he got, let's say he had five images on him, which I think would be the minimum

1006
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:27,160
 for the FBI to kick down your door.

1007
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:33,280
 Five to 25 years is the sentence you're looking at.

1008
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,280
 And here's the thing.

1009
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,200
 So he's not in jail right now.

1010
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:45,680
 He gets sentenced on my birthday.

1011
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:55,120
 October 4th is when he's going to find out how long he's going to have to spend in prison.

1012
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,280
 And it's funny because Kamal committed this crime, right?

1013
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,840
 He did commit this crime.

1014
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:10,960
 I feel bad for Jerry because he didn't commit this crime.

1015
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,480
 And Jerry has to watch his best friend go to prison.

1016
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,440
 He understands why he has to go to prison.

1017
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:25,040
 And I've been thinking as I'm looking forward to my birthday like I do every year, Kamal

1018
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:31,520
 will find out on my birthday how long he will spend in prison.

1019
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,560
 And this is where the letter comes in.

1020
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:44,080
 Kamal's dad called up Jerry over the summer and said, "I need you to write a letter to

1021
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:51,080
 the court telling them what a good man Kamal is."

1022
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:55,600
 They have those letters that you write that you were able to present to the judge and

1023
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,720
 say, "Listen, these are all the letters from community leaders.

1024
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,800
 These are letters from members of the church.

1025
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:07,840
 These are letters from friends and families and employers showing that my client is not

1026
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,600
 just these crimes."

1027
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,040
 Dad called up Jerry and said, "I need you to write one of these letters for Kamal."

1028
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:20,000
 I asked Jerry, "I go, did you write the letter?"

1029
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:27,640
 And he goes, "I don't know if I'm going to."

1030
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,680
 And he's struggling with this decision.

1031
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,400
 I don't know if I'm going to.

1032
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,920
 Do I write that letter?

1033
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:41,520
 What he did was inexcusable.

1034
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:48,240
 It's his best friend.

1035
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,800
 It's his best friend and his best friend's dad is calling him up and saying, "Can you

1036
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,280
 write my son your best friend?

1037
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:59,920
 Can you just write a letter saying that he's a good person because you've had experiences

1038
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:06,440
 with him for over two decades?"

1039
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:11,000
 But the crime is so awful.

1040
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,240
 If he had gotten into a bar fight and smashed a bottle over somebody's head and sliced their

1041
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:22,760
 face up and they lost vision in one of their eyes, you'd write the letter.

1042
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,840
 He's a good guy.

1043
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,840
 He has an out drinking problem, right?

1044
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,200
 These are all the other experiences I had with them.

1045
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:41,600
 He was driving down the road, drunk, slams into a Subaru in front of him, killing kids

1046
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,920
 sitting in the backseat on their way home from soccer practice.

1047
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,080
 He'd write the letter.

1048
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,400
 Horrible accident.

1049
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,760
 Horrible, horrible accident.

1050
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:59,520
 There's no way that he can give back the life that he took, but I've known him for over

1051
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,200
 20 years.

1052
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:07,120
 He's more than just that.

1053
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,000
 But when someone has a collection of images on their computer that they've obviously been

1054
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:18,240
 hoarding, collecting, and giving back out, trading, right?

1055
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,960
 Distributing.

1056
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,320
 How do you write that letter?

1057
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,120
 It's fascinating.

1058
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,600
 It's fascinating when we think about that.

1059
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:35,640
 If it was someone who snapped and killed people, if it was someone who was drinking or on drugs

1060
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:42,200
 and killed people, if it was someone who robbed a bank and killed people, I keep using that

1061
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:47,640
 as an example, you would write the letter.

1062
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:53,040
 This crime is so gross.

1063
00:32:53,040 --> 00:33:01,480
 Do you write the letter?

1064
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:06,800
 It's so fascinating because I hung out with Jerry a couple of times on my vacation.

1065
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:11,040
 Sometimes we would talk about this, and sometimes we wouldn't, right?

1066
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:18,520
 It was so fascinating because, so Kamal's father is in his 70s.

1067
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:23,240
 Imagine being 70 years old and everything going pretty according to plan, and then you

1068
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:28,880
 find out your son just got arrested for, I mean, it's the people on the sidelines that

1069
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,880
 I feel bad for.

1070
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:37,920
 Kamal did what he did, and he needs to pay for that.

1071
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,680
 And here's the thing, Jerry knew the stakes.

1072
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,680
 Jerry knew the stakes.

1073
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,000
 He thought about this a lot.

1074
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:52,520
 There's a big difference when you're 50 between five years and 20 years.

1075
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:56,640
 But I don't really, I understand it as a period of time.

1076
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,760
 This is the difference between me and Jerry.

1077
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:04,080
 This is the difference between somebody who has a family and somebody who, I have a family,

1078
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,200
 I don't have my own family, I don't have children and stuff like that.

1079
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:14,280
 When we're talking about the sentencing that's coming up, he said, "It's the difference five

1080
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,760
 and 20 years," right?

1081
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,760
 This time period.

1082
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,200
 To me, if five years in prison would suck, 20 years in prison would suck, you'd be getting

1083
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,120
 out when you're 70.

1084
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,480
 He saw it as a different way.

1085
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:28,440
 He goes, "It's the difference between whether or not you can attend your father's funeral."

1086
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:33,920
 I go, "Oh my God, that's true."

1087
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:38,320
 See, I'm not a family man.

1088
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,720
 I'm thinking of it that way.

1089
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,280
 Jerry is, see?

1090
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,160
 And to him, that was the big thing.

1091
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:51,240
 Kamal's dad is going to die in a very short time period, right?

1092
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,240
 It's not a threat.

1093
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:58,400
 It's not a threat, but if Kamal gets 20 years, then he'll never see his parents again.

1094
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,520
 When you go into a federal system, when you get arrested as a federal crime, they can

1095
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,400
 ship you anywhere in the United States.

1096
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,000
 But even if his parents do come to the prison that he's at and they get to visit him, he'll

1097
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,680
 never be able to hug him again.

1098
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,560
 He'll never get another kiss from his mother.

1099
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:20,760
 He'll never stand at the site of his father's death bed, holding his hand.

1100
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,800
 I didn't even think about that.

1101
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,200
 It didn't even occur to me.

1102
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,640
 And you may, in fact, if he got 20 years, never even be able to visit his father's grave

1103
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,640
 one day.

1104
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:38,880
 He dies in prison himself.

1105
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,160
 And that's a weighty decision, right?

1106
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,320
 Because Jerry's thinking, "Should I write this letter?"

1107
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:52,200
 Could be the difference between whether or not Kamal gets to go to his father's funeral.

1108
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:59,880
 I remember it was shortly before I left to end my vacation when I came back up here.

1109
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,880
 I was hanging out with Jerry.

1110
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,560
 I think I hung out with Jerry a total of four times, right?

1111
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:08,000
 We would go over to his house and stuff like that.

1112
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,080
 I asked him, "We're getting close to the end."

1113
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,400
 I go, "Did you write the letter?"

1114
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,400
 And I told him too.

1115
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,400
 I said, "Before I asked him."

1116
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,400
 Because again, I needed to know on a narrative level, right?

1117
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,960
 Because I already had established, I go, "I have to tell the story on the podcast."

1118
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:33,520
 So as my vacation was winding down, I asked him, "Did you write the letter?"

1119
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,640
 He couldn't even look me in the eyes.

1120
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,840
 And I looked down and he goes, "Nah."

1121
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,840
 Nah.

1122
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:43,920
 I don't think it would have done any good anyways.

1123
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,600
 And at this point, I'd actually done research on these types of letters.

1124
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,720
 I don't remember them, but they're called off the top of my head, but these letters

1125
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,360
 of reference or whatever it is.

1126
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:00,600
 Personal character, character letters, character witness letters.

1127
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,960
 And I go, "They actually can do some good.

1128
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,040
 They actually can help the judge see the defendant in a different light."

1129
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:18,880
 And he just kind of goes, "I didn't write it."

1130
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,760
 And so we wait.

1131
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,840
 We wait until October 4th.

1132
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:29,280
 On my birthday, Jerry's best friend is going to find out how long he's going to spend

1133
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,440
 in federal prison.

1134
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,640
 And that's a whole other psychological battle going on, right?

1135
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:41,600
 I was thinking, I was going, "Listen, if I'm out and I'm free, and I know on October 4th

1136
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:47,960
 I'm going to walk into a room surrounded by armed guards and someone is going to tell

1137
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:52,320
 me how I'm going to spend the rest of my life, whether it is five years in a federal prison,

1138
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:59,360
 20 years in a federal prison, 50 years in a federal prison."

1139
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,240
 Do you enter that room?

1140
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,360
 Because he pled guilty.

1141
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,800
 He has the files on him, all of that stuff.

1142
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,880
 Do you walk into that room knowing you're not walking back out for a minimum of five

1143
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,880
 years?

1144
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:20,240
 Do you go on the run?

1145
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,880
 They paid the bail, right?

1146
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,880
 That money would be gone.

1147
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,320
 You go for a run and hope they never find you.

1148
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,240
 Do you spend the life as a fugitive?

1149
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,760
 Do you just kill yourself?

1150
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,000
 Do you just end it there?

1151
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 The unknown, the...

1152
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,560
 I can't imagine being in that situation, right?

1153
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,560
 I cannot imagine being in that situation, right?

1154
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:46,120
 I was with my buddy Billy when he was in court, right?

1155
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,760
 My cousin Billy, when he went to court.

1156
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:53,000
 I sat there in the courtroom and they gave him 17 to life for murdering that guy.

1157
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,560
 He stabbed the guy to death with a stake.

1158
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,920
 I've only stabbed him once, but it just went right in his heart and he just killed the guy.

1159
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,280
 Over... they were having some sort of disagreement.

1160
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,000
 I mean, that was rough, right?

1161
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,600
 But again, you're like...

1162
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,600
 He murdered someone.

1163
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,040
 That totally sucks.

1164
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,960
 Whenever you have the L at the end of a sentence, he may never get out.

1165
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,560
 But at that point, he was already arrested.

1166
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,560
 He couldn't pay bail.

1167
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,280
 He was on trial for murder, so he didn't have any choice but to walk into that room.

1168
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,880
 But if you had a choice, if you're out free and you know, on October 4th, you're going

1169
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,920
 to walk into a room with armed guards and a judge is going to tell you how long you are

1170
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,360
 going to spend in prison.

1171
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:36,760
 There is no zero years.

1172
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,520
 Do you walk into that room?

1173
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,760
 Fascinating story, right?

1174
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,000
 It ends next week.

1175
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,680
 Well, ends in a way.

1176
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,160
 The sentencing will happen.

1177
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:59,680
 Kamal will find out how long he's spending in the federal prison system.

1178
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,280
 For a completely avoidable crime.

1179
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:08,800
 For something he did to himself.

1180
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,360
 There's so many moral questions involved.

1181
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:17,080
 I haven't even touched on how the parents must feel about this whole thing, right?

1182
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:22,840
 Imagine being in your 70s and getting that phone call from jail, your son.

1183
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,480
 It's insane, right?

1184
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,800
 It's insane.

1185
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,800
 And it happened.

1186
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,920
 I've learned about this this summer.

1187
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,120
 We've been recording all these episodes since I came back, right?

1188
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:38,880
 And I've been wanting to tell this story because it's such a close-up view of a true crime

1189
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,880
 story.

1190
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:44,120
 You know, I'm standing on the outside, I'm looking in, but I'm looking at one of my

1191
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:50,320
 really, really good friends struggling over simply putting pen to paper.

1192
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,440
 Because how do you defend this?

1193
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,080
 Can you even defend the man?

1194
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:59,360
 Can you even separate the man from the charges and something like this?

1195
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,360
 So fascinating.

1196
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,400
 I'm lucky I did not have to make any decisions like that.

1197
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,440
 I'm very, very lucky that I didn't have to spend the past couple months thinking about

1198
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:14,080
 whether or not I would write a letter to defend someone against such heinous acts.

1199
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,840
 Because your first thing, you know, a lot of people listening to this would be like,

1200
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,160
 "No, of course I want to write a letter."

1201
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,440
 That's disgusting.

1202
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,240
 But I've never been placed in that situation and I hope that I never am.

1203
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,480
 I'd be shocked, obviously, if I was.

1204
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,600
 Just like Jerry was shocked, but...

1205
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,440
 So just a fascinating story.

1206
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,000
 And yeah, on the day that I'm sitting there eating my cookie dough ice cream cake from

1207
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:45,160
 Dairy Queen, opening up my presence, he's going to be walking into a room full of armed

1208
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:53,320
 guards and finding out how his life is going to end.

1209
00:41:53,320 --> 00:42:03,880
 While I am celebrating my birthday, Kamal is going to be finding out if he can attend

1210
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:10,760
 his father's funeral.
