00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Even more demonic rap conspiracy news, and apparently Michigan can be the last place you'll ever be today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 [music]

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Hey everyone, this is Jason Carpenter for Dead Rabbit Radio on back.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 It's Monday the 25th, it's not Monday the 25th, it's June 25th.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 The weather is beautiful, so I don't need any fans, that's always good.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 I'm always happy about that.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Hope you guys had a good weekend, I had a great weekend, it was actually a lot of fun.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 But here I am back looking at the most ridiculous news possible to have an entertaining podcast.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 And you know, sometimes it's easier than others, sometimes I find some great topics, and other times it's a little rough.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 I did though, before we get started, I think I have stumbled upon the secret to evolution.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 I think that, I can't really phrase it correctly, but I think I've stumbled upon something that could change everything.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 It's almost like a glitch in the matrix, and that kind of leads into another story we're going to do.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 So I was thinking, and it's kind of weird, so we hunt, let's take deer for example.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 We hunt deer, because they're first pretty, and they have like big antlers.

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 And what if deer started to be ugly? What if they started to evolve to be like modeled fur, and busted like their antlers look all sucky and janky?

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 People would be like, "Yeah, I'm not hunting them anymore."

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 What would happen is you would go to shoot a deer, and you'd look at its fur, and it would be all disgusting, it would look like a hobo deer.

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 And you'd be like, "No, I'm not taking the shot. I'm not what am I going to do with that?"

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 And its antlers all busted up.

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 And so that deer would go home, and theoretically have more deer babies.

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 And those babies would be all like busted up.

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 And over time, the big beautiful deer would get shot, and I'd put their head on my wall, but the one that looked like it was all cracked out,

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 I wouldn't shoot, and it could have more babies over time.

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Now, I know what you're saying. Jason, that's really smart, but female deers wouldn't date a male deer or a buck.

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 I think it's the scientific term, does and bucks.

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 A doe would not date a buck if he looked like he was a meth addict.

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 And that is true. However, I think that they would if those were the only ones alive.

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 And I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

29
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 And so, I'm not eating like my species. I'm going to taste gross.

30
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 I'm going to start to evolve, so I'm gross. Groser.

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 So when a wolf bites me, he's like, "Ugh!"

32
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 And then runs away, and then I live to have other babies.

33
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 So you can have it both ways. You can have a busted up looking deer that no one wants to hunt,

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 or a beautiful deer that tastes disgusting, and then they wouldn't have to worry about natural predators.

35
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 I don't know if that either disproved evolution, why animals taste so good,

36
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 or actually proved that we can make evolution better. That's one of the two.

37
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 I was thinking about that the other day. I told my friend she didn't get it,

38
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 but she did have a headache, so I'm going to chalk it up.

39
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Not to any faults in the argument itself, but the fact that she had a headache.

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Because we were sitting in a really hot theater for a while.

41
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Okay, there was more to the story than that, but anyway, so she had a headache.

42
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 So, speaking of glitches in the matrix, which kind of is evolution.

43
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 So there is, like I said, I like to cover conspiracy theories that are fairly obscure.

44
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 There are the classics, the ones that I like. I like Bermuda Triangle.

45
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 I really like disappearing when conspiracy theories or paranormal events, stuff that disappears.

46
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Ghost stories are okay if they're out of the ordinary.

47
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Like I want to do one on ghosts that have murdered people. I find that fascinating.

48
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Just ghost sightings. I don't find necessarily that fascinating.

49
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 But when ghosts murder people, there's been a few cases where that may have happened.

50
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 But overall, I like to do conspiracy theories or paranormal events that people don't know about.

51
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 And one of them is, we did Dublin, Wisconsin.

52
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Another one is Michigan, Blue Hell.

53
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 So again, I saw it. They have this huge image, a graphic of conspiracy theories.

54
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 And we talked about this before. It's like an iceberg.

55
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 So like, the most common ones are at the top as you go farther down, they get more and more obscure.

56
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 Some of them are made up, obviously. Some of them, I mean, and when I say made up, a lot of them are made up.

57
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 They're not real. They didn't really happen. But people think they did.

58
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 There's ones at the bottom are stuff that people just spout it off like, let's put three words together and see, you know, like, John Tash Nipples.

59
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 And people will be like, oh man, what's John Tash Nipples? I got to look that.

60
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 And it's just, they just threw random words together.

61
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Michigan, Blue Hell. It may be one of those, but it's actually, because I've Googled a bunch of them to see if there's any credence to them.

62
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 And some of them, they have, you know, a couple pages dedicated to it. It's still being nonsense.

63
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 But Michigan, Blue Hell, I find fascinating.

64
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 So first off, what the term Blue Hell is, it's a video game term.

65
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 It's the Skybox. So when you're playing a game, and it looks like it's a 3D game where you're walking through, let's say you're playing Halo, whatever,

66
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 and you're kind of walking through the valley and there's mountains on either side, you can clip through the mountains.

67
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 So you can basically move through the mountains, through some sort of glitch in the game,

68
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 and then you pass through what you thought was a 3D object, but it's actually just like a graphic on either side of you.

69
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Now you're in what's called Blue Hell. It's basically like the Skybox.

70
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 It's the parameters of the game. So now you're outside of where the developers wanted you to be, and you're kind of just in this void.

71
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 It tends to be blue, because what happens is they paint the sky blue and they just basically program a big blue box,

72
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 and then they put the assets inside of it, and you're supposed to walk that path.

73
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 But most games, you can glitch out if you're persistent enough.

74
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 So the idea behind Michigan Blue Hell...

75
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Sorry, I'm a little parched.

76
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 The idea behind Michigan Blue Hell is there is a place in Michigan, in an abandoned building,

77
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 that you can clip out of our reality.

78
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Now there's the theory that we are living in a simulation, that everything we see is actually kind of like a matrix type simulation.

79
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 It's being programmed on the fly, and that's why things don't make sense when you look at a macro level and a micro level.

80
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 That's why the universe seems impossibly far.

81
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 It's just constantly rendering.

82
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 There's nothing... Once we start going out there, things will appear, but since we're here, nothing's ever showing there,

83
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 because we haven't really gone there yet.

84
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 But anyways, that's one of the theories.

85
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 The other theory is that the world is just how we see it.

86
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 But the Michigan Blue Hell works for either one, so basically you can fall out of our reality.

87
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 This is the main thing.

88
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 And you end up in basically the skybox.

89
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 It does fit more with the simulation theory, but...

90
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 However, so is that likely?

91
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Probably not.

92
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 I do always find it fascinating.

93
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 I find as much as creepy as I find caves and forests, and I find both of those very creepy.

94
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 There's also something very creepy about buildings.

95
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 You have a... You build a skyscraper, you build a... Even a small...

96
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 You build like a three-story building with ten offices, and knowing that some of those offices are just empty

97
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 and like the sun rising and the sun setting and just it being...

98
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 That's creepy too.

99
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 I think I find emptiness creepy, but I also find forests full of animals creepy.

100
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 No, I find forest full of animals dangerous, but an empty forest is terrifying.

101
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 So a building full of people, I'd be like, "I don't have any problem with these people."

102
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 But being in an office complex by myself, being in a library by myself, that's really, really spooky.

103
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 So, yeah, the idea that you can just... There's a random building in Michigan that you can walk into

104
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 and just kind of fall out of our reality by no... You know, you didn't mean to do it.

105
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 You know, there's talk that Michigan Blue Hell is related to the elevator game,

106
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 which is something we may go over in another episode, but we won't.

107
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 I'll just tell you right now. Elevator game, you can Google it, I'll link it, whatever.

108
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 It's a game where if you hit the... If you go in on elevator and hit the buttons in the right order,

109
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 you can end up in an alternate reality. Like, you step off the elevator and you're in this alternate reality.

110
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 They did a short film of version of it, I think, in VHS 2 or 3 or whatever.

111
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 But anyway, so that's the same thing. It's basically a way to leave our reality,

112
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 which, again, is another conspiracy theory or paranormal event that I find fascinating.

113
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 I'm going to do an episode. I'm going to do a story on a couple of people who have supposedly come from their realities to ours.

114
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 It also kind of plays a Mandel effect.

115
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Anyways, where I'm going with this is that apparently also in Michigan there is a story about a native...

116
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 Okay, I'm going to... Okay, no, no, no.

117
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 There apparently there is a story in Michigan that in their Native American history,

118
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 they had a evil snake god there and they actually trapped him in this Michigan blue hell area.

119
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 So it's one of those stories that one may have preceded the other.

120
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Either there was the old legend about the evil snake god that was causing trouble in the Michigan area

121
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 and was trapped into this void and then someone read that story and they said,

122
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 "Oh, that's a cool idea, but let me modernize it and call it Michigan blue hell."

123
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 There's the other possibility that the Michigan blue hell story was made up first

124
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 and then someone went back and made up a story about the tribes because I really don't know.

125
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 I'm just reading this on the internet.

126
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 The most fascinating answer, though, is that they're both true

127
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 and that is that there was a giant snake god thrown into a void in Michigan.

128
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 There's a lot of people sitting on it and they're still like a frayed area of reality

129
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 where you can walk into your office building and fall out of the skybox.

130
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 I mean, obviously two of those are far more likely than the third one,

131
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 but again, I think the third one is interesting.

132
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 I think that's kind of an interesting concept and it plays into my whole office buildings are creepy

133
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 if there's nobody in them.

134
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 Abandoned anything is creepy because you think,

135
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 "Why did people leave this whenever I read books or stories about like, you know,

136
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 like Mary Celeste or whatever where people go on to a boat and like it's totally empty

137
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 and you can't use anything but you're imagining."

138
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 You know what? Actually, let me do a side story right here because this kind of plays into it.

139
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 There's actually a story I was reading about the other day.

140
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 The Sarah Jo. The Sarah Jo was a little boat back in the 1970s.

141
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Okay, 1979. I'm not, I don't have a photographic memory.

142
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 I got the article pulled up here.

143
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 I'm sure you guys know how brilliant I am with me knowing, never mind, that joke failed.

144
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 So in 1979, these five dudes hopped on a fishing boat off of Hawaii and they said,

145
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 "I'm going to go fishing." And a huge storm came.

146
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 There's like 40 foot swells and people are like,

147
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 "Oh no, that boat totally like sucks. It wasn't built for any sort of inclement weather."

148
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 So of course, the boat goes missing.

149
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 They're like, send, they're like, people are walking along the beach looking for them.

150
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 They can't go out to the ocean to find them.

151
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 It's storms too big. They search for them for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks.

152
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 They never found them.

153
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Now, fast forward about, what was it, 10 years, 10 years later,

154
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 there are these nerds from Hawaii doing some sort of science thing.

155
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 They're from the Western Pacific.

156
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 This is, this totally sounds like a bunch of nerds hang out here.

157
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Western Pacific for the National Marine Fishery Service.

158
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 That sounds, that sounds pretty nerdy.

159
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 But anyways, so they're walking along this island and they find the boat.

160
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Oh, I should have said the boat was called the Sarah Jo.

161
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 I don't think I said that in the beginning.

162
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 So anyway, they're walking along this beach.

163
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 They find this little uninhabited island and it has like just like shrubs on it.

164
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Maybe some trees. I'm looking off in the distance here.

165
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 They find this boat. They find the Sarah Jo.

166
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 And they're like, oh, oh wait, no, they didn't know.

167
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 They didn't know about the boat. They're from something related.

168
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 But anyways, they see the boat and they're like, oh, it's from Hawaii,

169
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 according to its license plate or whatever is on a boat.

170
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 And then they saw a grave and the grave had like a mandible.

171
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 And it had a piece of paper and a little piece of tinfoil and a piece of paper

172
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 and a little piece of tinfoil, a piece of paper, a little piece of tinfoil.

173
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 And so they reported the findings and investigators came out to the island

174
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 and there was five people on the boat.

175
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 And the jawbone belonged to one of the guys.

176
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 So the question to me is, you know, well not just to me.

177
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Everyone was wondering where did the other four people go?

178
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Did they make it onto the island and die and like just kind of float away?

179
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Were they killed during the initial storm and this guy was in the boat by himself

180
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 for a month or two?

181
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And you know, it was floating around for 10 years, as far as they know,

182
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 because what happened was a previous team came onto the island before

183
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 and didn't record that there was a boat there.

184
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 So it's just weird and you think about like where, what happened to the other four?

185
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 The most likely thing is that they got thrown off the boat

186
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 and this dude was just floating on the boat for whatever reason.

187
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 He didn't get thrown off the boat and he crash landed.

188
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 I think it's possible that all five of them crashed on the island

189
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 and one of them died, who they buried.

190
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 And then the other four just went off and had like some jungle adventures

191
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 and just like, you know, died off one by one.

192
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 I would hate to die of old age in a cave, but if I was on an island

193
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 and there was like fruits and stuff, I wouldn't mind dying of old age on an island,

194
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 even a deserted island.

195
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 You know, as much as I hate abandoned stuff, I think it's different being abandoned on an island

196
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 because it's like half the worst stuff on an island is in the ocean.

197
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 It can't really get you.

198
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 But yeah, you know, and that always, whenever I think about people getting trapped on an island

199
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 or in a cave, all those miners got trapped in that cave,

200
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 you think, how long would you have to be trapped on an island

201
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 with three other guys before you started being gay with them?

202
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Like, I think that's the, that is a legitimate question.

203
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 Like, at what point do you say, we're gonna be, we're gonna start having sex with each other?

204
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Like, the answer is not never.

205
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Whatever the answer is, it's not never.

206
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 You could say, well, and here's, you know you're not getting rescued.

207
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 Like, maybe if you were only on an island for a week,

208
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 it's not like I'm gonna start hitting on you within a week.

209
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 And then like a rescue plane shows up.

210
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 But you know at a certain point you're not getting rescued.

211
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 It's been two years.

212
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 You're not getting rescued.

213
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 You're gonna start having gay sex.

214
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 That's just, you can't, people do it in prison?

215
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 There's consensual gay sex in prison?

216
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 I don't think it would be that long.

217
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 I'm, again, I'm saying don't go on a trip with me

218
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 because the car might break down and we have to wait for AAA.

219
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 I'm not saying that.

220
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 But I think any man would, you're not gonna say,

221
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 "Oh, I'm never gonna have sex again for the rest of my life."

222
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Think about it, mull it over, consider that.

223
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 And we're gonna move on to this last story, which I want to talk about quickly

224
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 because I don't want these episodes to be too long.

225
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 And so our friend from a couple episodes back

226
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 is continuing his conspiracy theory about XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

227
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 and we're gonna talk about the story of the murder of a man

228
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000

320
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 He was a black man.

321
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 He was a black man.

322
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 I can also picture this 16 year old kid

323
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 wearing his mom's

324
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 like big black trench coat.

325
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Why would the mom have a trench coat?

326
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 Basically, he's dressed

327
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 I just imagine him in clothes that are way too big

328
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 for his skinny little body

329
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 with a candle, a mirror

330
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 and something scribbled with lipstick

331
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 on his hand as he's

332
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 evoking the spirit.

333
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 Then he just imagines stuff.

334
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 I do not think that the grand architect

335
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 of hell

336
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 and Pontiff of hell is coming to this kid

337
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 so he can post on 4chan

338
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 of all places

339
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 that black dudes shot a rapper

340
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 in Florida.

341
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 This is ridiculous.

342
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 However, I will give him credit.

343
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 He's not asking for money right now

344
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 which is a lot different than a lot of the conspiracies

345
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 we do cover.

346
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 But this is ridiculous.

347
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 I do not think

348
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 that anything that this guy is saying

349
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 is legit.

350
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 I think that this guy is going to grow

351
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 into a real conspiracy.

352
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 That is weird.

353
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 That shows what's wrong

354
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 with the conspiracy theory community.

355
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 This is going to be just as legitimized

356
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 as

357
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 today it was just revealed that the NSA

358
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 has concrete

359
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 high rises in cities

360
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 where they funnel all their information

361
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 to process.

362
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 That is going to be that is a legitimate

363
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 conspiracy. That is a legitimate

364
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 conspiracy.

365
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 That is going to be what is going on

366
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 and right next to it is going to be

367
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 X was killed by Balbarath.

368
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 Ridiculous.

369
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Well, I think that is going to be it

370
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 for tonight's episode.

371
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 I don't think we ran. No, no, we did pretty good

372
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 on time.

373
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 I want to thank everyone for downloading the episodes.

374
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 We are actually exponentially getting bigger.

375
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 The show is just getting more and more downloads

376
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 each and every day.

377
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 I really appreciate that.

378
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 I'm going to be doing a podcast

379
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 on the podcast.

380
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 I'm going to be doing a podcast on the podcast

381
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 on the podcast.

382
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 I'm going to be doing a podcast on the podcast.

383
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 I'm going to be doing a podcast on the podcast.

384
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 I'm going to be doing a podcast on the podcast.

385
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 I'm going to be doing a podcast on the podcast.

386
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 I'm going to be doing a podcast on the podcast.

387
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 I'm going to be doing a podcast on the podcast.

388
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 I'm going to be doing a podcast on the podcast.

389
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 I'm going to be doing a podcast on the podcast.

390
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 I'm going to be doing a podcast on the podcast.

391
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 I'm going to be doing a podcast on the podcast.

392
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 I'm going to be doing a podcast on the podcast.

393
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 That's the main thing for me.

394
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 My computer can't really handle video processing right now,

395
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 so that's why we're not doing that.

396
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 But again, I love podcasting.

397
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 I think it's great.

398
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 I listen to it while I'm out walking and so on and so forth.

399
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 So, deadrabbitradio.com

400
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 I mean, sorry, deadrabbitradio@gmail.com

401
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 if you want to get ahold of me.

402
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 My Twitter handle is @symbol.

403
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 I don't know.

404
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 Jason O. Carpenter if you want to hit me up on Twitter.

405
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 That'd be great.

406
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 Thanks for all your support.

407
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 I'm having a ton of fun doing this.

408
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 I hope to see you tomorrow.

409
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 I still don't have a sign-off.

410
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 I'm afraid that my sign-off is going to become.

411
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 I still don't have a sign-off.

412
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 But we are through here today.

413
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 I will be back tomorrow with some brand new

414
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 crazy weird news out of this crazy weird world.

415
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 Have a great day.
