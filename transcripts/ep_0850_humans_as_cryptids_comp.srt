1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 A double agent of a world-ruling cabal has a message for all of us.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,500
 Prepare for a world of superheroes.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,480
 And then to finish off season 17 of Dead Rabbit Radio, we take a look at a bizarre and very

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,240
 interesting conspiracy theory.

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:28,800
 What if the cryptids of the world we see are actually humans from a breakaway civilization,

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,760
 disguising themselves to scare us away.

7
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,800
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:45,680
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode.

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,520
 It's not just another episode.

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,880
 This is the end of season 17 episode 850 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,880
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,680
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,400
 I hope you guys have lots of fun plans for the next couple weeks when I'm not doing content.

14
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,640
 You guys can keep yourselves busy.

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,640
 I'm not worried about it.

16
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,360
 I bought, I always buy a game when I take breaks.

17
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,520
 I bought Quorchlight 2, a Diablo game like that.

18
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,040
 So I'm looking at, you like to watch movies and play video games at the same time, put

19
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,000
 it in a little window mode, make my little elf dude walk around and stab skeletons.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,320
 I'm assuming that's what the game's like.

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,680
 I've literally not seen any footage of it, but I saw some pretty snazzy pictures, read

22
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,240
 some reviews, so we'll see how that goes.

23
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:35,160
 But someone who I can always count on to stab skeletons with me, walking into Dead Rabbit

24
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,400
 Command right now is our newest Patreon supporter.

25
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,400
 Give it up for Callum Frazier.

26
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,400
 Woohoo!

27
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,400
 Come on in buddy.

28
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,400
 Come on in.

29
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,400
 Yeah!

30
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,160
 He's so enthusiastic about stabbing skeletons he doesn't even wait until they're out of

31
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,160
 the bodies.

32
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,840
 Callum, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

33
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,120
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

34
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,480
 Trust me, I do.

35
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,960
 Just help spread the word about the show.

36
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,240
 Really, really appreciate it.

37
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,440
 And especially when I see people talking about the show online, that's always really, really

38
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,440
 cool.

39
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,520
 Callum, let's go ahead and toss you a shovel.

40
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,000
 Put you in a little engineer outfit and it'll give you a little wooden train whistle.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,560
 We're taking the carbon or caboose.

42
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,680
 We're gonna shovel us some coal into this engine and we are headed all the way out

43
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,840
 too.

44
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,600
 A super secret Colt's headquarters.

45
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,200
 Choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo

46
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,200
 choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo

47
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,200
 choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo

48
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,200
 choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo

49
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
 choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo

50
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,200
 choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo

51
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
 choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo

52
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,200
 But that is where we are going.

53
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,200
 So we are in the super secret cult headquarters.

54
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,200
 We're just walking around in street clothes.

55
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,200
 We're like, "Hey bro, what's up?"

56
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,200
 They got on those monk robes that are like purple.

57
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,200
 *Mongolian singing*

58
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,200
 They're like chanting and stuff like that.

59
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,200
 We're like, "Turn up the beat!"

60
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,200
 We got our boombox.

61
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,200
 So they pull out their little wiggly daggers, you know,

62
00:02:51,200 --> 00:03:02,200
 that you always see saint worshipers carry around in movies and they're like chasing us through the cult headquarters. Generally, generally when you do a story on a cult, you probably don't want to bring in the boombox playing and walking on sunshine.

63
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,200
 But that's what we did and no regrets.

64
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,200
 As they slaughter half of my audience, I'm like, "Oh no, no!"

65
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,200
 But I still got you guys and that's all that matters.

66
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,200
 We're in this cult headquarters.

67
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:20,200
 We're now fearing for our own lives, but I sit there and I'm sitting in this room talking, talking super loudly as they're trying to hide.

68
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,200
 I'm like, "Guys, you want to hear a story?"

69
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:34,200
 This super secret cult I found out about because this dude has decided to expose the machinations of this world dominating group.

70
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,200
 Here we go in a nutshell.

71
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:46,200
 On October 1st, 2021, this prophecy has been allowed to leave the hallowed halls of this nameless group

72
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,200
 and reach the ears of us mere mortals.

73
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:57,200
 An advanced quantum AI has been created.

74
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,200
 This quantum AI computer that sounds an awful lot like an adult man making noises with his mouth in a haunted closet

75
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,200
 has predicted a new leap in humanity.

76
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:15,200
 As the quantum AI is going through all of the internet, it becomes a gooner.

77
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,200
 It's just watching porn all the time and they're like, "Can we reprogram it so it can't access porn? Thank you."

78
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:27,200
 Now the artificial intelligence is like reading world texts, looking for pictures of boobs and National Geographic, a gooner till the end.

79
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:35,200
 This AI has realized the path of humanity where we are headed as a people.

80
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,200
 What you will see the AI tells this cult?

81
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,200
 I don't know if I'm playing that. The cult has the AI. The cult built this quantum AI.

82
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:50,200
 The AI tells the cult, "Listen, we are about to reach an age of humanity that will be a golden age.

83
00:04:50,200 --> 00:05:01,200
 It will be a world where wisdom rules, where there is no separation from the most lowly worker and the most mighty titan of industry.

84
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,200
 It will be a place where there's not a king or a prince.

85
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:12,200
 We realize that we're all, in a way, our own king or prince.

86
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:17,200
 It will be an age of equality. It will be an age of unity.

87
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,200
 It will be an age of super humans."

88
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:35,200
 I've expertly predicted using 1950s sound effects that we are on the cusp of this golden age.

89
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,200
 People will be flying around. That makes everyone equal, right?

90
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:48,200
 If you don't need a Ford Taurus or a Tesla, if you could just go off to work and you flew through the sky, that would make everyone equal.

91
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,200
 Pretty dope, the AI, I'm sure, said.

92
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,200
 You'll see humans that have the ability to shoot electricity out of their hands.

93
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,200
 That's how they're powering their Teslas.

94
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:06,200
 Super strength. You'll have humans out there just be able to pick up the Tesla and just throw it to work.

95
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,200
 Then they just walk to work and go, "Ah, the car pooling sure is nice nowadays."

96
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,200
 And then also a very common superpower that humans, all humans, right?

97
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:21,200
 Seven billion in counting. Invisibility!

98
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,200
 Then you just don't go to work at all. You just stay home.

99
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,200
 Then when your boss is like, "Hey, Johnson, where are you report?"

100
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:32,200
 You're like, "I was there. I was just invisible. You didn't see me."

101
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:37,200
 But I did show up there and also I'm sorry for throwing your car through the window last week.

102
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:44,200
 And the AI goes, "This is the future of humanity, but the problem is that the cabal doesn't want that."

103
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:51,200
 They want us living in misery. They want us not able to throw cars or fly around.

104
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:58,200
 How are you going to make money, you oil companies, if I have the ability to watch your YouTube?

105
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,200
 I've been the gas price since I go, "Eat!" But then you can shoot me with electricity too.

106
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,200
 And we could just turn invisible and run around each other super fast.

107
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,200
 That wasn't one of the superpowers, but I'm adding that.

108
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,200
 The point is, is like, I could go and give Elon Musk a nougi.

109
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,200
 Because what's he going to do? I mean, I guess he can use his super strength to throw me.

110
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:22,200
 The point is, is that Elon Musk doesn't want me to fly around, right?

111
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,200
 The president doesn't want me to shoot electricity out of my hands.

112
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,200
 Trust me, no one wants me to be able to do that.

113
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:33,200
 But you would have world leaders on par with the booger picker who hangs out on the street corner.

114
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,200
 Everyone would be equally powerful.

115
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:43,200
 Now the AI has no emotion. It's just seeing the future of humanity, and it looks pretty dope.

116
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:49,200
 The cabal doesn't want that. So what they have done is they have enacted a plan.

117
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,200
 So devious.

118
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,200
 Simply by talking about it on this podcast, I'm taking a huge risk.

119
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:00,200
 I'm making a gamble on this story.

120
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:05,200
 Find a very interesting, taking a bit of a gamble, Spotify, YouTube.

121
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,200
 I hope you know the tone I'm taking with this segment.

122
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,200
 The AI goes, this is going to be the future of humanity.

123
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:18,200
 And the cabal goes, no, we're not going to allow these peons, these little monkey humans,

124
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,200
 to be able to fly around and shoot electricity out of their hands.

125
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,200
 We don't want a world of unity and equality.

126
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,200
 We want a world of top-down control.

127
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,200
 We don't want a new world order.

128
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,200
 We want to maintain the old world order.

129
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:45,200
 So the cabal, they all snap their fingers at the same time, and in walked a scientist holding a box.

130
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,200
 And on the box, it said Moderna.

131
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,200
 And then he pulled out another box and it said Pfizer.

132
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:59,200
 Then he pulled out a Winn-Dixie bag, a little plastic shopping bag, and it said Johnson's and Johnson on the side with a Sharpie.

133
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,200
 And the scientist goes, here you go, evocable leaders.

134
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:10,200
 If you want to prevent people, you're like, Jason, please, please do not go in the direction we think you're going.

135
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:16,200
 The scientist goes, if you want to prevent humanity from getting superpowers,

136
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,200
 all you have to do is inject them with these.

137
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,200
 Okay, so technically I'm not going to tell you what it is.

138
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,200
 I think you can figure it out, right?

139
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,200
 Let's see how close I can fly to the sun on this story.

140
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:36,200
 The idea is this, this guy who's posted this insane ranting online,

141
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,200
 possibly crashing the podcast with no survivors at the same time,

142
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,200
 is that if you got the vaccine,

143
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,200
 that was actually the cabal's goal all along.

144
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,200
 They wanted you to be injected with this medicine,

145
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,200
 and that means you won't get superpowers.

146
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,200
 The whole plan was laid out like this.

147
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,200
 We know we can't get everyone to take the vaccine,

148
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,200
 but if we can get enough people to take this vaccine,

149
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,200
 then when this age of enlightenment comes,

150
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,200
 90% of the world will be vaccinated and they won't have superpowers.

151
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,200
 The 10% of the world that is not vaccinated,

152
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,200
 around 20, if you haven't been vaccinated, set your watch,

153
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,200
 because around the year 2023-2024, you might be able to fly.

154
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,200
 Don't test that. Please don't be like, "Oh, it's January 1st, 2023."

155
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,200
 I remember I heard a podcast a couple of years ago.

156
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,200
 "I can fly." Don't try it, right?

157
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
 Do not take my word on this.

158
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,200
 Don't take my word on any of this nonsense with this story,

159
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,200
 but, and then the cabal will succeed.

160
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
 They are not getting vaccinated, right?

161
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,200
 They know that this stuff is to suppress superpowers.

162
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,200
 So one day you're going to be sitting at home,

163
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
 watching television, or eating potato chips,

164
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,200
 and all of a sudden you see a bunch of elite world leaders

165
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,200
 flying around you like, "Ah, what's in these potato chips?

166
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,200
 Why am I hallucinating so badly?"

167
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,200
 You're like, "Oh, I did take all that LSD this morning,

168
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,200
 but still, this is insane."

169
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,200
 All of the cabal members, they'll be able to fly.

170
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,200
 Doesn't that sound like the worst world ever?

171
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,200
 Like, it's bad enough that these lunatics try to control

172
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,200
 every part of our lives, but imagine if they could also

173
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
 shoot electricity out of their hands.

174
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,200
 Imagine if the politicians you hate the most,

175
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
 whichever one you hate the most,

176
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,200
 imagine if that dude could fly around,

177
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,200
 shoot electricity out of his hands,

178
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,200
 turn invisible, and had super strength.

179
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,200
 Right? Then all of your Twitter posts,

180
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,200
 he would break through your wall like the Kool-Aid man

181
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,200
 and beat you up.

182
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,200
 And he'd probably be invisible while he was doing it.

183
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
 You wouldn't even know who it was.

184
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,200
 You're like, "Ugh, I probably should just stop using Twitter altogether."

185
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
 The cabals are not getting vaccinated.

186
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
 The 90% of the world who didn't get vaccinated,

187
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
 they will be flying around as well.

188
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,200
 So you go, "Okay, so I got vaccinated, big whoop."

189
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,200
 At least in the future, I'm eating potato chips, I'm doing fine.

190
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,200
 But now you're going to see 10% of the world being like,

191
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,200
 "We're here to fight for all those people who took the vaccines.

192
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,200
 We got superpowers."

193
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,200
 And the world leaders, the cabal, is going to be like,

194
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,200
 "Oh, no. Actually, this is part of the plan.

195
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,200
 We knew this was going to happen."

196
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,200
 They're going to fight each other, right?

197
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,200
 You're going to have all of these people who did get superpowers

198
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,200
 versus all these people who also got superpowers,

199
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,200
 but they were the ones who set up the plan in the first place.

200
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,200
 They'll rescue us.

201
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,200
 No, that's not the plan.

202
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,200
 Apparently, the cabal is going to invite them in.

203
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
 The cabal is going to go when everyone starts flying,

204
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
 or not everyone, when the unvaccinated people are

205
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
 start flying around.

206
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,200
 This is so insane and I swear, this is pretty risky talking about this.

207
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,200
 As the unvaccinated are flying over our heads,

208
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,200
 shooting electricity at each other, I swear.

209
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,200
 This might be my favorite conspiracy theory in a long time.

210
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,200
 As the unvaccinated are turning invisible and punching each other through buildings,

211
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,200
 the cabal will say, "Join us. Join us and we'll rule over these meat sacks."

212
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,200
 Like, look at them. They can't even fly.

213
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
 You know, join us.

214
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,200
 At least we have that in common, right?

215
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
 So join us.

216
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,200
 And apparently, the quantum AI or this insider is saying

217
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:12,200
 that most of the non-cabal unvaxxed will end up joining the cabal.

218
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,200
 They'll betray the vaccinated.

219
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,200
 And then there'll be a remaining maybe 2% of guys who are like,

220
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,200
 "No, we don't want to join the cabal. You guys are evil."

221
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,200
 And then they just want to get curb stomped

222
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,200
 because they're fighting a bunch of other super beings.

223
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,200
 So this conspiracy theory is nuts, right?

224
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,200
 The ability that in a couple of years you'll be able to fly if you're getting vaccinated.

225
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,200
 For what? This is why I don't understand conspiracy theories.

226
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,200
 I love conspiracy theorists and boy do I have a lot of my own.

227
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,200
 But even I know mine are pretty ridiculous.

228
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,200
 When people put a little bit of weight on them, sometimes they absolutely collapse.

229
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:52,200
 This one, the guy says, "Listen, you get vaccinated. You can't get superpowers."

230
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:58,200
 But it also says, "You can only get superpowers if you're unvaccinated

231
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:03,200
 and you're Caucasian or Asian."

232
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,200
 I don't know. And it said like people who are of mixed race,

233
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,200
 they'll get a little bit superpowers.

234
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,200
 I don't know what that means if only the top half of someone will be invisible

235
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,200
 or maybe they can just shoot electricity out of one finger,

236
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,200
 which would still be a marked improvement over no electricity from any fingers.

237
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:25,200
 People of mixed ethnicity will kind of have some super power,

238
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:30,200
 but you have to be Caucasian or Asian to have this.

239
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,200
 Why? I don't get it.

240
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:37,200
 I mean, I guess I am arguing with a quantum AI computer who also has a secret porn addiction.

241
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,200
 But that's so weird. When you're making up these conspiracy theories,

242
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,200
 what a weird detail to add.

243
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,200
 Like, there's not going to be a Jamaican superhero.

244
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
 There's not going to be a Demi-

245
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,200
 I mean, he's like, "Dude, I didn't get vaxed. Why are you guys flying above my head?"

246
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,200
 Weird. It's just such a weird...

247
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,200
 Jason, wait, that's the part you think is weird?

248
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,200
 It's just an odd detail to throw in there, because obviously, I don't believe this is real.

249
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,200
 I don't believe this is real at all.

250
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,200
 So if it's not real, that'd be like me going, "Here's a story of E.T."

251
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,200
 It's about a young boy named Elliot meets this alien from another planet

252
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,200
 and the alien hated Italians.

253
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,200
 You're like, "Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Why'd you add that last part?

254
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,200
 Why'd you add that last part over the alien hating Italians?"

255
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,200
 It's just such a weird detail to throw in there.

256
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,200
 That would actually make the movie E.T. way more interesting.

257
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,200
 Elliot keeps being like, "Oh, my favorite food's Italian food."

258
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,200
 And E.T. is walking in and he's like, "Ahh."

259
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,200
 E.T. floats a bicycle through the pizza shop's window.

260
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,200
 So yeah, there is my story. I really hope...

261
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,200
 Really hope... Again, I've taken a risk.

262
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,200
 I saw this the other day and I thought it was really insane.

263
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:50,200
 I don't know how hardcore the podcast and the YouTube is regulating.

264
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,200
 Anti-vax, COVID conspiracy stuff. I think that is over.

265
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:02,200
 But we will find out if this episode gets removed or if season 18 never commences.

266
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,200
 But what an insane conspiracy theory. I just wonder what...

267
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,200
 Is this like a creative writing exercise? Does this person actually believe it?

268
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,200
 Who knows? Such weird details.

269
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,200
 Although I can't keep complaining about his details

270
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:21,200
 when I added the fact that the computer was addicted to watching humans have sex.

271
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:26,200
 Calum, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonicopter for the last time this season.

272
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,200
 We are leaving behind this quantum A.I.'s goon cave.

273
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,200
 We are headed all the way out to...

274
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,200
 The Pacific Northwest.

275
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:44,200
 I saw this post the other day. I thought, "What a great way to wrap up the season."

276
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,200
 Just a really fun, cool story.

277
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:52,200
 It's one of those ones that makes you look at no one phenomenon differently.

278
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,200
 Sure, we will all look at the world differently when Bill Gates is floating around

279
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,200
 and being like, "Aha, trick to you shooting electricity at our feet making us dance."

280
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,200
 But right now, before that insane future never happens,

281
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:11,200
 right now, let's take a look at a post from a user known as 21837120.

282
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:17,200
 And this dude, we're going to call him Tyler, has a conspiracy theory of his own.

283
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,200
 Not really a conspiracy theory. Maybe that's not the right way to say it.

284
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,200
 An explanation of a phenomenon.

285
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,200
 Which actually is the definition of a conspiracy theory.

286
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,200
 But the thesis statement is this.

287
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:37,200
 What if certain cryptids are just other humans?

288
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:44,200
 Now, he's very clear to say, "I'm not talking about people today who dress up as Bigfoot as a joke or as a prank."

289
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,200
 Or to attract tourism to an area or something like that.

290
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,200
 And people do those things. People perform hoaxes all the time and make fake footprints and do all that stuff.

291
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,200
 That happens. That's not what he's talking about. The theory goes a little bit deeper than that.

292
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,200
 He says, "And we're going to talk about Bigfoot exclusively."

293
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,200
 I think that's where this works the best.

294
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,200
 And I think that's what Tyler was kind of zeroing in on as well.

295
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,200
 Because we've covered so many crazy cryptids on this show.

296
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,200
 We covered a horse in Brazil that had no head.

297
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,200
 It just had flames coming out of a stump.

298
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,200
 I don't think that's what I'm talking about.

299
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,200
 Let's stick with a hominid cryptid. A Bigfoot would be a perfect example of this.

300
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:34,200
 It's not a modern hunter out there. It's not a modern person trying to pull a scam or something like that.

301
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:40,200
 What he's talking about is it is a splinter group of humans.

302
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:48,200
 And not necessarily splinter group. We're going back hundreds of thousands of years and it's actually just Harry Wildman in the woods.

303
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,200
 No, it's something far more thought out than that.

304
00:18:52,200 --> 00:19:02,200
 You have a group, you have a culture that has remained completely isolated as society continued to move forward.

305
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:08,200
 By choice. They saw the way things were going and they're like, "Nope, we're out."

306
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,200
 So three or four families walk into the wilderness.

307
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:19,200
 Did this happen in the 1970s? Did it happen in the 1670s? Who knows.

308
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:26,200
 But what we see as Bigfoots are them.

309
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,200
 They're experts at camouflage, which is something that humans pick up on right away.

310
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:42,200
 We look at the earliest human cultures and one of the first things they do is they dress themselves, not just in animal skins, but as animals.

311
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:51,200
 And if you weren't aware of that, if you were coming into an area and you weren't aware that people used, even if you were aware that people would use to wear wolf skins.

312
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,200
 And had like the big wolf head on their head and just had to drape through their body.

313
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:05,200
 If you were hunting today and you saw a man in the wilderness completely draped in wolf skins and you just saw it at a glance, you saw him running through the treeline.

314
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:11,200
 You would think that was a werewolf. You're like, "No, Jason, I love the paranormal."

315
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:20,200
 But put words in my mouth, bro. I love the paranormal, but I would not think if I saw something run by really quickly.

316
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:26,200
 It looked like a man in a suit. Not a suit, but you know, like the wolf fur hanging off of you.

317
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,200
 I would not immediately think it was a werewolf. I might doubt.

318
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:37,200
 I might think it could be a werewolf, but I would first think that must be a guy wearing wolf skin.

319
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,200
 But so this dude is so funny because this guy laid it out really, really well.

320
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,200
 And now I'm going to butcher it, right? I'm going to put all this crazy stuff anyway.

321
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:53,200
 He goes, "Imagine this. A group of people at one point broke away from society and they have a portion of the world that they want."

322
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,200
 The Pacific Northwest, for example, which is where we see a ton of Bigfoot sightings.

323
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,200
 Let's say back in the 1800s, people are like, "You know what? We don't like this logging camp stuff.

324
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,200
 We came panning for gold and that didn't pan out."

325
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,200
 They're all nudging the guy next to him. He's like, "Get lost. Get out of here."

326
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,200
 So a group of these dudes take their families. They go out into the wilderness.

327
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:22,200
 And so their community doesn't get encroached on. They skir away people.

328
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,200
 Straight-up Scooby-Doo mentality with this thing, right?

329
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:32,200
 And so you dress up as a monster. It sounded so good when I read it.

330
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:38,200
 You would dress up as a creature of legend and then you would scare people off.

331
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,200
 You're dressed up as a Bigfoot and you're walking through the woods.

332
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:49,200
 And a hunter is like, "Oh no." And he runs away because he sees the guy in his suit going, "Rawr!"

333
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,200
 And then you run away. And if this one makes sense, this would totally make sense.

334
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,200
 You would have these cryptids. They're actually a breakaway human civilization.

335
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:03,200
 Not that advanced. Maybe just a human group, right? Doesn't have to be a full city out there.

336
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,200
 Buildings built of acorns and twigs. Let me go back to my notes.

337
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:15,200
 Humans are not only experts at camouflage. It's one of the first things we do because we had to do as hunters.

338
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:21,200
 But it's part of our culture, right? You can look back to the earliest civilizations and they draped these animal skins over themselves

339
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
 like they were becoming the animals themselves.

340
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,200
 And they use the fear of the unknown to keep people out.

341
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:35,200
 Now again, if you have a Bigfoot in an area, you go to Jason Bulle. I saw like AMC, like we'll send or A&E or whatever whoever does these shows.

342
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:41,200
 You send Bigfoot hunters out to these areas. If you're dressed up as Bigfoot, you're actually attracting more eyes to it.

343
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:52,200
 Well, the thing is, is you're not. If you're in the middle of nowhere, most people are never going to even know there's 60 people somewhere in this mountain range in the Pacific Northwest.

344
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,200
 You're just not going to know. And let's say there is a Bigfoot sighting. Most people don't believe in Bigfoot.

345
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:04,200
 Then people who do, casually, like myself, like I believe that the phenomenon, there's something to the phenomenon, but I don't know what it is.

346
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:11,200
 I'm never going to go out there. I'm never going to go out there. I'll talk about it on my podcast, but I'm not going to hike through the woods for 10 miles.

347
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,200
 Just to maybe see, maybe see a mythical monster.

348
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:24,200
 You might attract some Bigfoot hunters, but for the most part, you're actually pushing people away and it would have more effect the farther back you went.

349
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:31,200
 Like before A&E was putting out 10 Bigfoot shows a day, you definitely weren't having a lot of Bigfoot hunters out there.

350
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:39,200
 He says this type of activity is far better than a no trespassing sign or fence because it's terrifying.

351
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:46,200
 You're actually coming face to face with a beast. Think about that story I did yesterday. I'm not saying that happened to be two toddlers who attacked Emmy.

352
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:52,200
 They were just wearing fur, but it's scary. These creatures are scary.

353
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:58,200
 If you saw something that was 8 feet tall walking through the woods, you would be terrified.

354
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,200
 Don't ask me how they're 8 feet tall. I haven't figured that far out yet.

355
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:11,200
 Maybe that's an exaggeration. Maybe you just saw Harry Guion Stilts.

356
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,200
 Oh man, this sounded so good when I read it. I actually still really like it.

357
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,200
 But now that I'm saying it out loud, they do miss that part.

358
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:29,200
 You could leave Bigfoot tracks to throw people off, but usually when people see Bigfoot, it's actually funny because now that I think about it, most people don't see Bigfoot.

359
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,200
 I'm even talking about people in the wilderness. They smell Bigfoot.

360
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:41,200
 They'll say I sensed the presence. I didn't know what it was and I was hit with the most odorous, odiffious, terrible smell.

361
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,200
 And I left. And I've had people tell me that. They go, "I don't know what it was. I've heard the stories about Bigfoot."

362
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,200
 If you asked me what it was, just me and you. It was probably Bigfoot. I think it was Bigfoot.

363
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:59,200
 But they'll tell me that I didn't see it, but I smelt it. That would be easy for humans to fake.

364
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:05,200
 That would be easy for a breakaway society to put out there that would scare people away.

365
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,200
 So you could have these groups of cryptids actually be humans in disguise.

366
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,200
 Again, I haven't worked out how they're eight feet tall.

367
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:21,200
 But that aside, that most notable thing about Bigfoot, the fact that he's massive aside, is really interesting conspiracy theory.

368
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,200
 Tyler went to do some more research on it. He said, he looked it up. He goes,

369
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:33,200
 "You need a minimum of 160 people to have okay levels of diversity for multiple generations."

370
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:40,200
 So you could have 160 people leave an area and they would not be a bunch of inbred freaks within two years.

371
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:47,200
 I mean, although that might help them, right? If you had a bunch of inbred freaks walking around looking like monsters, it's just, it's a win-win.

372
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:56,200
 I guess it's not a win for the freak. I guess they're kind of losing, but you'd have more freaks and you'd have more babies and you'd have more freaks.

373
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:01,200
 And I was thinking about this when I go, this was mine. I'm adding this on. I'm adding this on.

374
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:07,200
 But I thought that would actually explain why when people go Bigfoot hunting, they'll go up to an area where there's no one Bigfoot sightings.

375
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:13,200
 And one, they never find a body, right? That's always been the thing like, what happens to the Bigfoot? Do the Bigfoot bury themselves?

376
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:20,200
 But whenever they find fur in an area where there's a Bigfoot sighting, it's deer hair, or elk hair, or something like that.

377
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:27,200
 It would make sense because what they're seeing is a Bigfoot sighting, or a human disguises Bigfoot, again, not to pull some sort of prank,

378
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:35,200
 but this is their land and they're trying to ward people off of it because there's a big monster walking around.

379
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,200
 Their suits are made of deer fur or elk fur, and that's why that is what's scraping out on the branches.

380
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:50,200
 That's why you cannot prove these things exist because although the sightings are real, the monsters are human.

381
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:59,200
 Now, it doesn't explain every cryptid, right? It wouldn't explain mermaids. It's just like some guy like that saying, "We're fed up with society.

382
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,200
 Let's live underwater." And then there's like 160 bodies just floating in the bay.

383
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:10,200
 It wouldn't explain every cryptid, but it would explain cryptids like Bigfoot.

384
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:17,200
 It's just another cool explanation of what it could be. It's humans disguised as Bigfoot to protect their land.

385
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:25,200
 Because if you're going into battle against someone and he was wearing a wolf fur, you're like, "Jay, I'm being a tank.

386
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,200
 I don't know why you think everyone lives in the 1600s."

387
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,200
 Well, imagine you walk through the woods and your tank broke down and you're trying to walk back to get some gas.

388
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,200
 And you saw a bunch of people dressed up as monsters.

389
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:40,200
 "Oh, no, no, no. You didn't see a bunch of people dressed up as monsters." You saw a bunch of monsters.

390
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,200
 You'd run away. You'd leave the area.

391
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,200
 So they would continue to protect their land.

392
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:54,200
 And just over this glade, past the river and right behind that big old rock, it leads you to a resplendent valley.

393
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,200
 And there's like a little camp. A little camp there.

394
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,200
 I've always wondered about this. You know, we look at pictures of America.

395
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,200
 Right? We salute them all day long until our arms get tired.

396
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:12,200
 If you look at a map of America, it looks so tiny, right? And you see all these roads and everything.

397
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:19,200
 I have a-- I wonder, because we always find like lost tribes in the Amazon. We'll wrap it up like this.

398
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,200
 We always find like lost tribes in the Amazon. Definitely don't always find them if we found them. They wouldn't be lost.

399
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:31,200
 But there's tribes in the Amazon that have been discovered. There's the tribe on Sentinel Island that's never been fully communicated with.

400
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:38,200
 What if in the middle of America there's a like pioneer village or a little pilgrim village?

401
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:44,200
 Like you go around the bend and there's a bunch of cottages made of stone.

402
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,200
 And there's like thatched roofs and like little little fireplaces and stuff like that.

403
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:58,200
 I bet you that could happen. America is so big. I bet you in the middle of some massive desolate landscape covered in nothing but wilderness,

404
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:04,200
 you could have a little pioneer village and you'd have pilgrim-- you'd have pilgrim--

405
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:11,200
 they're so wearing their uncomfortable pilgrim clothes. Everything's made of wool and super itchy and they got on their big old hats with their heavy buckles

406
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:17,200
 and they're like, "Ah, Martha, isn't this the life?" And they don't know of anything out there, right?

407
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:24,200
 Maybe there was four earthquakes and it made these huge chasms open up on all the sides of the village.

408
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:30,200
 And they're like, "We did lose a lot of pilgrims and pilgrimesses during those four massive earthquakes."

409
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:39,200
 But here we are, completely isolated from the rest of America that we can only assume who we can only coo who can only assume.

410
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,200
 Still looks like they're dressed for a child's pageant during Thanksgiving.

411
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:52,200
 And he's smoking his corn cob pipe. And the pilgrim people are just kind of going about their business.

412
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:59,200
 Carrying buckets of water, eating corn, avoiding the massive chasms that surround them.

413
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:08,200
 That could happen. That could happen. You could have, just like you have tribes in other parts of the world that were just left behind the march toward civilization.

414
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:16,200
 I wonder if you have places like that in America. If you have a little village and either they willingly did it, they saw the way things were going

415
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:21,200
 and they're like, "Ah, pantaloons. We don't want anything to do with these weirdos." And then they just retreated to the woods.

416
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:30,200
 Or if it was an accident, if they got lost, they're like, "See you later, Roanoke. We'll be back in a little bit."

417
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:36,200
 And everyone left and they formed another city and they're like, "Oh, this city will be our winter city because it gets too cold on the East Coast."

418
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:42,200
 And then they're like, "Hey, did anyone make a map back home?" And they're stuck there.

419
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:47,200
 I've always wondered if that was possible. And now I got this third theory to look at.

420
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,200
 Maybe that's true. Maybe a bunch of pilgrims did get logically tylered and not say this.

421
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:58,200
 Maybe a bunch of pilgrims just walked out into the wilderness one day and they liked it out there.

422
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:06,200
 They liked it out there. They didn't have to like shine their boots all the time and they took off those big heavy hats and they're just like leaning against trees.

423
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,200
 And they're like, "Dude, this is life. Maybe we should just live in the wilderness."

424
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,200
 And then they're there for a while, right? Everything's just totally fine.

425
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,200
 And then some dudes are walking through the woods and they're like, "Hey, what's up, pilgrim bros?"

426
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,200
 And they're like, "Oh man, those dudes are super lame. We don't want to have anything to do with them."

427
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,200
 So they scare them off. They shoot muskets at them and stuff like that.

428
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,200
 And they're like, "Okay, now the feds are looking for us. They go deeper into the woods."

429
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,200
 And they go, "How do we not get caught anymore?" And some guy's sitting there with this corn cob pipe.

430
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,200
 He strokes his beard and he's like, "Hmm." And he keeps stroking it.

431
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:43,200
 He strokes it for 100 years and his beard becomes so long and wraps around his body.

432
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,200
 They're like, "Dude, were you ever going to come? We've been waiting for you to come."

433
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,200
 And we said, "You had the answer. You've just been stroking your beard for 100 years.

434
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,200
 We've been feeding you and wiping your butt this whole time. We've done nothing else."

435
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,200
 And then he stands up and he goes, "Ta-da!"

436
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,200
 He's like, "Oh, furry." He's all furry. And he goes, "We just all have to do this.

437
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:09,200
 We just have to pretend that we're furry monsters in the woods because no one wants to mess with furry monsters, right?"

438
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:16,200
 And the pilgrims start clapping and the dude's like, "Yep. I know. I know, guys. Keep laying it on me."

439
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:22,200
 "I just became the world's first bigfoot."

440
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:27,200
 That doesn't explain the Yeti. That doesn't explain the Yowing in Australia.

441
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,200
 But it may explain the existence of our furry friend in the Pacific Northwest.

442
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:41,200
 So the next time you hear someone talk about Bigfoot or pilgrims, sit them down and let them know America's real history.

443
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:52,200
 At one point, some pilgrims got lost, open fired on some nerds, and then grew their beards so long they became the beasts of legend.

444
00:32:52,200 --> 00:33:01,200
 And if they disagree with you, just look them in the eyes, shoot electricity at them, shoot electricity at them, and fly away.

445
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:10,200
 Because nowadays, the truth is what you make it.

446
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:18,200
 DeadRabbitRadio@gmail.com is going to be our email address. You can also put us up at facebook.com/DeadRabbitRadio.
