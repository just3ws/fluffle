1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 An ex rugby player turns his athletic prowess into a weapon of war as he takes down a South African gang of rapists.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,500
 That's an intense intro, and that escalated really really quickly.

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,500
 A gang of rapists versus an ex rugby player. Who will win?

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,500
 And then we travel to rural Virginia.

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,500
 To meet two buddies, Max and PJ, driving around late one night.

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,500
 They thought they were going to have a fun time, listen to some tunes, kick back a couple beers.

7
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:43,500
 Instead they came face to face with reality bending madness. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,500
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carbenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:02,500
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. Hope you guys are having lots of fun. We got a ton of stuff to cover, so we're going to get started right away.

10
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,500
 First off, coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now, everyone on your feet, I don't care what you're doing.

11
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:14,500
 You jump up, you let go of that hang glider and fall to your death, but you salute John Giles, our newest Baytran supporter.

12
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,500
 Everyone give a round of applause to John Giles, walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

13
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,500
 Now John, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode. If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

14
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,500
 Just helps to hear the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

15
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,500
 John, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

16
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:38,500
 We're driving all the way out to South Africa. That's why I need to drive.

17
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:45,500
 I need to start matching the vehicles up to where the stories are because I throw them the keys and then I turn on my notes and I realize there's no roads going there.

18
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,500
 But...

19
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,500
 John somehow drives us all the way out to South Africa.

20
00:01:52,500 --> 00:02:01,500
 It's early 2011 and former rugby player Joseph "Shinogwana"

21
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,500
 He's a 33 year old man, gets the worst news you could possibly get.

22
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:14,500
 He was a former player for the Blue Bowls, which I've practiced not saying Blue Bowls all day long.

23
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,500
 He was a former player for the Blue Bowls, a professional South African rugby team.

24
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,500
 He didn't quite blow up his career, wasn't the best, but he did play between 1998 and 2001.

25
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,500
 Ends up leaving the league.

26
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,500
 He did some businesses here and there, became a born again Christian in 2010.

27
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,500
 But in early 2011, Joseph gets terrible news.

28
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:45,500
 He finds out that his daughter, his beautiful beloved daughter, has been gang raped.

29
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:52,500
 And if that wasn't bad enough, she got aides during the rape.

30
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:59,500
 So Joseph is sitting there in his room, his prayers have gone unanswered, the police are useless,

31
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:07,500
 in South Africa the government is doing nothing to punish these rapists who gave his daughter a life sentence.

32
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,500
 Or death sentence actually, right? That's what I should have said.

33
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,500
 Totally changed the quality of her life, totally changed everything about it, one night of brutal terror.

34
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:24,500
 And Joseph does what I think any parent would do in this type of situation where the government is not helping

35
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,500
 and these people are just wandering around free after doing this horrendous act.

36
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,500
 He picks up a handaxe and begins stalking them.

37
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:41,500
 So maybe not every parent would do that, but I think a lot would want to in this type of situation.

38
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:49,500
 So on March 20th, 2011, Joseph is trailing this dude, because he knows the guys who did this.

39
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,500
 He knows the guys who raped his daughter, in effect he murdered her, right?

40
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:59,500
 He knows who was going to die eventually from this disease. He's moving through the bushes and he's trailing this guy.

41
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,500
 This isn't also just some weak dude, this is a former professional rugby player.

42
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:11,500
 So when Joseph jumps out with that handaxe and begins swinging it and chopping this dude up,

43
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:19,500
 it makes short work of this guy who was just walking down the street.

44
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,500
 That was on March 20th, 2011, that was the first murder in Montclair.

45
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,500
 This dude was hacked up and beheaded.

46
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:39,500
 A few days later in Lambtonville, South Africa, another man, hacked to death with a handaxe, decapitated.

47
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:50,500
 Yellowwood Park. Later that week, Joseph finds the third man responsible for this horrendous crime, chops him up.

48
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:58,500
 Within two weeks of starting this spree, he killed three men and grievously injured two others.

49
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:06,500
 Two other people he rolled up on and just began swinging that axe and they were able to make it away with massive damage to their body.

50
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,500
 They went to the police and then he caught the last guy who was part of this horrendous rape gang.

51
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:21,500
 That guy also got away but not without getting hit with an axe wielded by a massive muscular man with vengeance in his heart.

52
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:27,500
 So they identify him, these people who get away, they say, "Hey, this is the guy who attacked me and the police roll up."

53
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,500
 And they arrest Joseph, they charge him with three murders.

54
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,500
 One of the guys, he chopped his head off, they found the head a mile away.

55
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,500
 I don't know why he was caring for a mile and he goes, "Ew, gross!"

56
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,500
 But it wasn't like these crimes of passion, he was also just doing weird stuff with the bodies.

57
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:51,500
 But he was saying, "No, no, no, these people did the ultimate brutality to my daughter, so who cares if they're a mile away or a hundred yards or right next to it? Who cares?"

58
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,500
 And so the defense, when he goes to trial, he gets arrested, he goes to trial and the defense is like, "This was a crime of passion."

59
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:05,500
 His daughter was raped and she has AIDS and can you imagine what, I mean, the very best she's going to have to take medicine, very, very expensive medicine for the rest of her life?

60
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:12,500
 And the worst, you know, she's not going to be able to have kids, all this stuff, right? Or she can have kids but child could end up having it as well.

61
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,500
 And what happens though is the police say, "Well, here's the thing, we investigated this."

62
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:25,500
 Like, after he chopped up all these people and we looked into him, we investigated this, his daughter doesn't have AIDS.

63
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,500
 The defense team is like, "What?" He's like, "No, his daughter does not have AIDS."

64
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:41,500
 And the defense team goes, "How do you know that?" The police goes, "Well, because his daughter was never raped."

65
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:48,500
 And the defense is like, "How dare you say that? Like, she is making these allegations and you're saying this didn't happen at all, this rape..."

66
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:54,500
 First you're saying she didn't have AIDS, which isn't true, but you're saying this rape gang didn't even rape her in the first place and the police go,

67
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,500
 "I didn't rape her because Joseph does not have a daughter."

68
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:04,500
 He doesn't have a daughter, so she couldn't have been raped and gotten AIDS.

69
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,500
 He was nuts.

70
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:13,500
 He imagined the whole thing.

71
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:25,500
 He was sitting in his house one day and thought his daughter got raped and got AIDS from these five men and then he murdered five random people.

72
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,500
 One of them, the third one in Yellowwood, they don't even know who it was.

73
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:34,500
 It must have been someone passing through town, he chopped him up so badly, he doesn't know who it was.

74
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,500
 The police don't know, the body's unidentified.

75
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:43,500
 There's some random guy walking, attacked by a dude who thinks you raped his...

76
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,500
 I've been in a lot of fights in my life, but I've never been in a fight with a level that high.

77
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:56,500
 I could not imagine fighting a guy, first off jumping out of the bushes and coming at me, but thinking that I did something so unspeakable to a loved one.

78
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:02,500
 Like, I've found people over money, right, over some girl we were both talking about.

79
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,500
 But I mean, that is a fury that I think very, very few people could stand up to.

80
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,500
 And it was fake! It wasn't even real!

81
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,500
 He murdered, he was a serial killer, he murdered all these guys and thought that's what he was doing.

82
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:26,500
 And it came out later, the cops were like, "Oh yeah, and apparently while he was doing this, he also kidnapped a woman and held her captive for three days and raped her."

83
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:33,500
 So we're charging him with that, defense attorneys who were trying to say that he was a vigilante.

84
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,500
 Which is against the law, by the way, that's not a defense, but...

85
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,500
 So he is currently doing five consecutive life sentences, apparently during the trial.

86
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,500
 He was nuts, he was speaking in tongues, he was acting super weird.

87
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,500
 The defense lawyer was probably really, really embarrassed.

88
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:53,500
 His father is like, "Listen, my son has a history of mental health problems, he's had these all of his life."

89
00:08:53,500 --> 00:09:01,500
 And the judge goes, "I think that this, I think this blathering idiot in the corner, I think he is okay to...

90
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,500
 I think he's competent enough to stand trial."

91
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,500
 So they did, they held the tree, he probably was, and he probably should have been medicated and locked up in some loony bin.

92
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:15,500
 But yeah, they said, "You're competent to stand trial, he was found guilty, five consecutive life sentences, he'll never get out."

93
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,500
 Crazy, crazy story. Everyone loves vigilantes, right?

94
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:26,500
 I mean, unless you're a criminal, everyone loves the common man coming up and taking down those bastards that are ruining your neighborhood,

95
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,500
 or doing horrible things to kids, or...

96
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:38,500
 But they have to actually be doing that stuff first, otherwise you're just a serial killer, otherwise you're just part of the problem.

97
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:44,500
 I understand, Joseph, the sentiment of wanting to do that, but your daughter does not exist!

98
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:51,500
 You know what would be really creepy? Imagine him in jail now, and him going, "How come my daughter never writes me?

99
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,500
 How come I never get any letters from my daughter?"

100
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:01,500
 That's so, that's so depressing, I gave up everything for her. Where's my daughter?

101
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:08,500
 He brings that to jail, he brings that to jail, he fashions the hand acts out of, out of like, bed, bed stuff.

102
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
 It's just a pillowcase, but he's still killing people with it.

103
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:18,500
 Joseph may still have a second act in him, hopefully not, though. He does sound like a muscle-bound lunatic.

104
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:26,500
 John, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonar copter. We are leaving behind South Africa.

105
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:32,500
 We are headed all the way out. We have to make sure Joseph isn't hanging on to the bottom of the copter as we're taking off.

106
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,500
 He could be hitching a ride with us. We're headed all the way out to rural Virginia.

107
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,500
 This is not a town, I'm saying rural as in, little country area.

108
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:49,500
 As we're headed out there, I wanted to do a really quick Dead Rabbit Recommend.

109
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:55,500
 The movie is very unusual, it's a sub-genre of horror movies, which I classify as the Wish movies.

110
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:02,500
 Most famously known as the Wishmaster series, which I love those, but also there is a really great horror movie called The Brass Tea Pot.

111
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:08,500
 There are about movies of people making wishes and wishing going sideways, Monkey Paw type stories.

112
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:14,500
 There's a new movie out now, it's a shutter exclusive called The Advent Calendar.

113
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:25,500
 It's a French film, but it's about a woman who is paraplegic and she gets an Advent calendar that is also the home to a German demon called Icke.

114
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:33,500
 And every day there's a new treat that comes out of the Advent calendar and every day she has to make a decision, does she continue to go on with this?

115
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:39,500
 Does she let Icke's game consume her soul? It's really interesting. It's a really, really interesting horror movie.

116
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,500
 Really, really interesting horror movie, I enjoyed it. Some really cool visuals.

117
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:51,500
 The scene, I don't want to spoil it, but there's a scene where Icke shows up for the first time, it confronts one of the characters.

118
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:59,500
 And I think I might classify this as maybe my top 20 horror movie moments of the past 20 years.

119
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:06,500
 Like it was a really cool scene. You very rarely get good Christmas themed horror movies.

120
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:12,500
 I know Lana, my friend Lana for a long time, has been trying to do a Thanksgiving horror movie or Christmas horror movie.

121
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:17,500
 They're hard to pull off, but The Advent Calendar is a really good Christmas themed horror movie.

122
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:24,500
 It's creepy, it's moody, and I give it a watch. Shutter Exclusive, The Advent Calendar. Dead Rabbit recommends The Advent Calendar.

123
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:32,500
 John, go ahead and lower this carbonar copter onto this rural street here in Virginia.

124
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:39,500
 I found this story on the website, the phenomenal website. You're doing yourself a disservice if you don't go to this website.

125
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:47,500
 It's called Phantom and Monsters, phantomsandmonsters.com, and it's run by a man named Lon Strickler.

126
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:57,500
 And he's just such a great voice for the conspiracy theory community. He writes tons of books. He has this great resource, phantomsandmonsters.com.

127
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:03,500
 Definitely check it out. I find a lot of good stuff on there, and this story is no different than that.

128
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:10,500
 We don't have a time period for this story, though. That's one of the things, I don't know if this story takes place in the 90s or 2000s.

129
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,500
 So I don't know as far as that goes. I wish there was a little more information.

130
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:25,500
 But in rural Virginia, there was a man, we're going to call him Max. Max, he's 19 years old, and his cousin PJ, who's 19, 20 years old,

131
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:31,500
 are driving down the back roads of Virginia. It's 9pm, and they've been drinking.

132
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,500
 He goes on to say, he goes on for any law enforcement that may be reading this story, that we weren't drunk.

133
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:42,500
 We were just buzzed. We had like a good buzz, but at no point were we actually ever drunk.

134
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:49,500
 They're driving through these back roads of Virginia, and all of a sudden, they both have the urge to pee.

135
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,500
 They both need to use the restroom.

136
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:58,500
 So right when they're thinking about that, they see a corner store. This isn't an area they're super familiar with.

137
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,500
 They're obviously like, familiar with Virginia, but they're just driving down random roads.

138
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,500
 They see a corner store, and they look at each other like, "Score!"

139
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,500
 And this is when you know, they say they're just buzzed, but this is when I think they're drunk.

140
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,500
 As the car's pulling up, their plan is, they're at this corner store, and there's like people milling about,

141
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,500
 and there's cars getting gas pumped.

142
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:24,500
 People in the store. Their goal is not to go in and ask, "Hey, can we use the bathroom?"

143
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,500
 They go, "Hey, let's go around the back and pee behind the building."

144
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,500
 That's when I was like, "Okay, these guys are probably a little more than just buzzed."

145
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:38,500
 I do want to interject here, though, and say, in my personal paranormal research,

146
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:44,500
 I've done, used to do a lot of on-the-ground ghost hunting back in the day. A lot of it.

147
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:50,500
 I noticed a trend, and it was something that we used to tell to see if something could be coming,

148
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:56,500
 is the need to urinate goes up when paranormal events start happening.

149
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,500
 It's super weird. I've noticed it several, several times with myself.

150
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,500
 Other people have noticed it as well, and then they see the giant wet stain on my pants,

151
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,500
 and they're like, "Jason, is something spooky coming?" I'm like, "Uh, yeah?"

152
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,500
 No, they've also like, we've been hanging out and doing a ghost hunt,

153
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,500
 and someone will be like, "Dude, I have to pee. I have to pee."

154
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,500
 And then something weird will happen, and I kind of collected all that data.

155
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,500
 So the fact that this happened in this story, that's part of the lore.

156
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,500
 I don't know what the mechanism is for it, but it just causes it.

157
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,500
 Not all the time. I don't know how many times aliens have to--

158
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,500
 If you don't pee, I have to say that. We're not peeing in our pants.

159
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,500
 You just have the need to pee.

160
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,500
 But I don't know how many times aliens are like, mobbing up UFOs.

161
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:41,500
 Anyways, they pull up to this country store, and they realize the store looks kind of old-fashioned,

162
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,500
 but that makes sense. You know, it's rural Virginia.

163
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,500
 They're not really keeping up with the times.

164
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,500
 The village is taking place right next door. They think it's like 1892.

165
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,500
 So these guys are walking around, and they notice everyone's kind of dressed funny.

166
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,500
 But they're in little bust, and they need to pee.

167
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,500
 They're not really thinking about it, but they see like kids there,

168
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,500
 and there's like a little like bench swing outside the corner store.

169
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,500
 Very quaint place.

170
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:09,500
 And as they're going to go behind the building to pee, they see a guy, and he's pumping gas.

171
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,500
 And he kind of like, has the gas nozzle in there, and he looks at the boys,

172
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,500
 and he's like, "Hey guys, what's up?" And they're like, "Hey, how you doing?"

173
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,500
 And they're like, "Oh no, he found us. We're not going to pee in his face.

174
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,500
 Peeing in his face and run away."

175
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,500
 They said this guy, he looked, he was really well dressed.

176
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,500
 Funny because this is like a little gas station corner store.

177
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,500
 They said he's wearing a nice suit, nice tie, slacks, and hair slicked back.

178
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,500
 They said he looked like an Italian mobster.

179
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,500
 He kind of gave off that fashion advice.

180
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:42,500
 So much not his personality, but just the way that he looked.

181
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,500
 He was a six foot tall dude. They said he was built.

182
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,500
 They said he looked like he could mess you up, but he didn't seem like he was going to.

183
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,500
 And they're kind of just doing a little bit of small talk there.

184
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,500
 And as they're engaging the small talk, they just kind of get to know him.

185
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,500
 And customers are kind of filtering out of the store.

186
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:02,500
 And eventually it's them three that are left in this country's store.

187
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,500
 The close sign is up, and at this point they're full on chatting.

188
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,500
 They've really made a connection with this young man.

189
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,500
 And Max and PJ goes, "Hey man, now this store is closed.

190
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,500
 Do you want to go like drive around the back roads with us and drink?"

191
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,500
 It'll be fun.

192
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,500
 The guy kind of thinks about it for a second and he goes, "Yeah, you know what?

193
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,500
 Totally. I will totally do that with you.

194
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,500
 Just let me finish closing up the shop and we'll go."

195
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,500
 And so PJ and Max go back to the car and eventually the dude comes out

196
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,500
 and he's carrying like a bottle of wine.

197
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,500
 It's in a paper bag, the ultimate concealer of alcohol.

198
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,500
 And he goes, "Hey, you guys got to try this wine."

199
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,500
 And Max is drinking it and PJ is drinking it.

200
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,500
 And they're kind of passing around and they're driving through the back roads.

201
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,500
 And they said the man was directing them where to go.

202
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,500
 So he's like, "Oh, turn left here. Yeah, it'll be really cool if you go right.

203
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,500
 Yeah, watch out for this loop. Wee!"

204
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,500
 I don't think he got them onto Six Flags Virginia and got them into a theme park.

205
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,500
 But he drove them around.

206
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,500
 He goes, and Max said, who's really narrating this story.

207
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,500
 He goes, "As we were driving around, we were just drinking and talking and having fun.

208
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
 And he was just able to point us down these roads.

209
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,500
 We never felt lost. He knew this area like the back of his hand.

210
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,500
 We're doing this for hours and hours."

211
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,500
 And the man keeps talking about the gas station.

212
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,500
 And he talks about how the gas station was in his family for generations,

213
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
 how it's something that he has to do.

214
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
 He feels like he has to do it.

215
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,500
 He also says, you know, I'm sure you guys can tell,

216
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,500
 but as he takes another swig out of the wine bottle,

217
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,500
 I think I have a bit of a drinking problem.

218
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,500
 Like my family definitely thinks I have a drinking problem.

219
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
 I have to hide it from my family.

220
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:38,500
 So guys, I'm so appreciative that we can drive around and just drink and be buddies.

221
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,500
 And I don't feel ashamed of this.

222
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,500
 And Max said, even though they were talking for hours and hours,

223
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:49,500
 he goes, "To be truthful, I have to admit not all the conversation I was completely aware of.

224
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,500
 I was drinking. They are driving, by the way.

225
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,500
 It's incredibly dangerous, obviously. He goes without saying, but I'm drinking and he's talking.

226
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,500
 He goes, "I don't remember a lot of the details about it. I don't remember his name.

227
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:06,500
 I just remember a point in the conversation when everything changed.

228
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,500
 He goes, "We were driving down the road and he was talking to us,

229
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,500
 but I think also he was kind of talking to himself."

230
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,500
 And he started to not be happy.

231
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:23,500
 He started to make this emotional mood shift from happy to troubled to depressed.

232
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,500
 And I could tell that just from what he was saying and how he was feeling,

233
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,500
 that he was in a really bad place in his life.

234
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,500
 And there was something about him, something tugging at his soul, saying,

235
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:40,500
 "He needs to do better, not just for himself, not to just prove it. He can do it.

236
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,500
 But he needs to do better for his family.

237
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,500
 He has a family that depends on him and he just can't keep spinning the wheels.

238
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,500
 He can't just keep managing this little corner store in the middle of Virginia.

239
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:58,500
 He needs to become a better man."

240
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
 And the mood completely changed.

241
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:05,500
 It was just this weird epiphany that this dude got and Max felt it.

242
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:10,500
 And the mood changed and the dude goes, "Can you take me back to the store?

243
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,500
 I think it's time for me to call it a night."

244
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,500
 And he goes, "He directed us back down these roads, back to a store.

245
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,500
 Different roads this time. Go left here.

246
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,500
 Okay, keep going. Wee, go up down this one too.

247
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,500
 They get back to the store and at this point the cars run the low on gas.

248
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,500
 They had been driving around for quite a while, so at this point it's about three in the morning.

249
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
 And they go, "Let's just refill up at this gas station."

250
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:40,500
 So they pull up to the gas station and they're sitting there and the dude is in the back seat.

251
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,500
 And he says, "Hey, I'm going to go inside and I'm going to open up this shop

252
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,500
 and we can hang out on there for a little bit longer."

253
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,500
 And PJ and Max are like, "Oh, that's cool, you know."

254
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,500
 Max is sitting there and he hears the man get out of the car.

255
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,500
 Here's the back door shut.

256
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:04,500
 And then instantly, Max and PJ are sitting at an abandoned corner store gas station,

257
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,500
 completely overgrown with weeds.

258
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:16,500
 Shattered windows appear into a darkness of a long abandoned shop.

259
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,500
 The gas pumps were broken.

260
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,500
 Nature had reclaimed this store.

261
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,500
 But reclaimed it from when?

262
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,500
 They were just here hours ago.

263
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,500
 They were just sitting in this driveway seconds ago.

264
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,500
 And when that back door slam shut both PJ and Max, they said,

265
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,500
 "In an instant, everything was different."

266
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,500
 It was like removing a slide of a slideshow.

267
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,500
 It was this and now it's that.

268
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,500
 Max and PJ look at each other.

269
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,500
 They have no idea what is going on.

270
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,500
 They turn around and in the back seat is the brown paper bag

271
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,500
 that was used to disguise the wine bottle.

272
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,500
 They have absolutely no explanation for what's going on.

273
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,500
 They cannot figure it out.

274
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:08,500
 So they do the rational thing and just leave the area.

275
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,500
 Hopefully they can find another gas station that's open at 3 in the morning.

276
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,500
 And they do.

277
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,500
 Miraculously, they do have enough gas to get to another gas station.

278
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
 And they go home.

279
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:23,500
 And the whole time, they're trying to figure out what in the world happened.

280
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,500
 And so they start to piece together things, little things

281
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,500
 that they didn't even really think of when they were happening.

282
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,500
 When they pulled up to the gas station, they said it looked old,

283
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,500
 but looking back, the gas pumps looked super old.

284
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,500
 And not like they were old mangled up, but the style

285
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,500
 reminded them of something from the 1920s,

286
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,500
 something they would have seen in a history book,

287
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
 or in a mobster movie.

288
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,500
 Then they start talking about the people who were...

289
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,500
 Because there were multiple people there.

290
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,500
 This isn't a vanishing hitchhiker type of story.

291
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,500
 And multiple people in the gas station, what happened to them?

292
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,500
 Who were they?

293
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,500
 And they start talking about them and they realize that

294
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,500
 all the people there were dressed like they lived in the 1920s.

295
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,500
 The little boys had like on the suspenders

296
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,500
 and the stylish shorts of the time.

297
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,500
 The women all dressed up like women from the 1920s.

298
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,500
 They're doing flabber dances through the aisles.

299
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,500
 They're like, "That should have been our first glue."

300
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,500
 And then the man they met also looked like a mobster from the 20s,

301
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,500
 but they just figured, I mean, who doesn't want to look like a mobster from the 20s?

302
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,500
 That was a killer look, no pun intended.

303
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,500
 And they're like, "Okay, so wait a second.

304
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,500
 The place looked like it was from the 1920s.

305
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,500
 The people who were there were dressed like they were from the 1920s.

306
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,500
 And when we showed back up at the gas station,

307
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,500
 it looks like it hadn't been used since the 1920s.

308
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,500
 What in the world happened here?"

309
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,500
 Max goes home and he tells his mom about this.

310
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,500
 He's like, "Mom, you won't believe the night I had."

311
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,500
 Tells her the whole story.

312
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,500
 And she says, "I know what gas station you're talking about.

313
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:53,500
 I know that as an actual like corner store gas station.

314
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:58,500
 That place has been closed since the 1970s."

315
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,500
 That's not even, we're not even to peak weirdness right now.

316
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,500
 Max tells this story to his fiancee years later.

317
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,500
 As he's telling her the story, it intrigues her tremendously.

318
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,500
 It intrigued me.

319
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,500
 And I'm not even sleeping with the guy.

320
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,500
 She begins researching stuff.

321
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,500
 She begins looking up photos to be like,

322
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,500
 "Is this what they're wearing?

323
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,500
 Is this what they're wearing?"

324
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:27,500
 And she Googles a photo from the 1920s of a store, like a convenience store.

325
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,500
 And she gets these photos together.

326
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,500
 Now at this point, because they never went into the store,

327
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,500
 they never once went into the store.

328
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,500
 She didn't know that the first time he told her the story,

329
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,500
 she assumed that he did.

330
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,500
 So she got a photo of the inside of a 1920s convenience store

331
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,500
 to show, or corner store, everyone is grabbing it,

332
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:48,500
 to show Max to say, "Is this what it looked like?"

333
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,500
 But you know, he wouldn't know.

334
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,500
 He didn't go in the store.

335
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,500
 He just kind of looked in through the window.

336
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:58,500
 So she shows him the photo and he goes, "That's him.

337
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:05,500
 That's the dude who we saw in Virginia in that backcountry road."

338
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,500
 And so they do a reverse Google search of the image.

339
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,500
 His name was Alex--this is not--this story is true.

340
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,500
 This is insane.

341
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:21,500
 Alex Sambato owned a corner grocery store in the 1920s.

342
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,500
 And he owned it until 1947.

343
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:30,500
 So that would place the age, because they said he looked like he was in his 20s.

344
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,500
 He was a younger man.

345
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,500
 So that would be right.

346
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,500
 This Alex Sambato, who is an Italian immigrant,

347
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:41,500
 who--the photo of him does look like he's a broad-shouldered guy in his suit.

348
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,500
 He's wearing like an apron, but you can tell he has a nice suit on underneath him.

349
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:49,500
 In the 1920s, when he was in his 20s, he owned a corner grocery store.

350
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:54,500
 He made the decision in 1947 to do better in life,

351
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:59,500
 to make a huge change, to realize that if he really wanted to be happy,

352
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,500
 he had to take a risk.

353
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,500
 Alex Sambato started--

354
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:10,500
 I don't remember what the business does.

355
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,500
 I try to think of the word.

356
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,500
 I know what they do, but I can't think of what they do.

357
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,500
 What they--he has a bunch of trees.

358
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,500
 What are you like, Jason?

359
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,500
 You were doing so good.

360
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,500
 You were doing so good.

361
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,500
 Now he's an int?

362
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,500
 What are you talking about?

363
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,500
 He--so he quit the corner store in 1947.

364
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,500
 He bought a bunch of orchards.

365
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,500
 What is that, an orchardist?

366
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,500
 So he sells apples and cherries and walnuts.

367
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,500
 Walnuts are in the story.

368
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,500
 I don't know why.

369
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,500
 I'm so excited.

370
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,500
 That was from yesterday's episode.

371
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,500
 People don't remember the walnuts.

372
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:48,500
 So he has these trees and he's distributing apples and cherries and walnuts.

373
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,500
 So he did.

374
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:54,500
 He left behind the corner store and he started this orcharding business.

375
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,500
 Now I can wrap my head around a time warp, right?

376
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,500
 We've covered those a lot on the shows, but we're not even done with this story.

377
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:05,500
 As Max and his fiance are looking at this photo and they're doing the reverse Google search

378
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,500
 and finding that this company, and now is still around,

379
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,500
 from Avera Marketing is what they're known as.

380
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:17,500
 He owned a corner store in the 1920s.

381
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:24,500
 In San Francisco.

382
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,500
 He didn't live in Virginia.

383
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:31,500
 He didn't own the gas station corner store in Virginia.

384
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,500
 He lived in San Francisco in the 1920s.

385
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:44,500
 So what we have is a story where two locations across the United States get merged into one.

386
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:51,500
 Where two completely separate time periods get merged into one.

387
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:58,500
 To such a degree that Alex coming to, I'm assuming,

388
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,500
 I think the story takes place like in the 70s, the 80s, the original story.

389
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,500
 I really wish we had a time period for it.

390
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:08,500
 But if we have Alex appearing in the 80s, why wasn't he like, what is a trans-am?

391
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,500
 What's up with your weird devil car?

392
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:16,500
 How did he not notice the inconsistencies, the fact they're in a souped up Mustang

393
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,500
 driving through the woods?

394
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,500
 The woods! He's from San Francisco.

395
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,500
 But he knew his way around the back country of Virginia.

396
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,500
 So in his reality was he driving around San Francisco.

397
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,500
 In our reality were these guys driving around in Virginia.

398
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,500
 How this story is so bizarre.

399
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,500
 This is one of the weirdest stories I've ever come across.

400
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:44,500
 The time warp, that would have been interesting enough, but now we have two geographical locations

401
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,500
 merging into one.

402
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:55,500
 And you have this amazing moment where what if this wasn't a story about two young men

403
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,500
 meeting a Phantom hitchhiker owned a gas station.

404
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,500
 The story was really about Alex coming to a crossroads in his life.

405
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,500
 Alex realized that something had to change.

406
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,500
 He had to do something different.

407
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,500
 But it took the mysterious meaning of these two guys who dressed kind of weird.

408
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,500
 They had holes in their pants.

409
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:19,500
 They were listening to crazy screaming girls girls girls music on their tape cassette.

410
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,500
 The craziest, most out of control guardian angels in existence.

411
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,500
 But it was that night that made him come to the conclusion I have to change things.

412
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,500
 I have to start working towards being a better person.

413
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,500
 Did this event change his life?

414
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:41,500
 Is this the event, the reason why he started really analyzing what he wanted?

415
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,500
 A weird event for him as well.

416
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,500
 But was he in his mind driving around San Francisco?

417
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,500
 In his mind was the car like an old timey car and they were dressed.

418
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,500
 I don't know.

419
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:57,500
 It's really hard for me to wrap my could you think he would have been puzzled by their automobile.

420
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,500
 The only thing I can think of I thought about this too.

421
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,500
 They were driving a classic car.

422
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:05,500
 But I don't think two knuckleheads in Virginia were driving around in 1920s era.

423
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,500
 Studebaker or whatever.

424
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,500
 So what is this?

425
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,500
 What is this story?

426
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:14,500
 Temporal distortion, spatial distortion, people observing.

427
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,500
 There's no way he could have known his ways around the back roads of Virginia.

428
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,500
 He must have in his mind been somewhere else.

429
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,500
 Absolutely fascinating story.

430
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,500
 Why he got out of the car and shut the door and reality snaps back.

431
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,500
 Who knows?

432
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,500
 But you know something?

433
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:34,500
 We're looking at the story from Max's point of view where he's like a super weird and he discovers this photo and he goes that's the guy.

434
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:41,500
 We're looking at the story from Alex's point of view where this may have been the night where these two strangers took him for a ride and he had this moment of friendship.

435
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,500
 But he also had a moment of clarity.

436
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:48,500
 He changed his life for Max who is just an interesting trivial story.

437
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:55,500
 PJ this event broke PJ.

438
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,500
 And of course it would.

439
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,500
 We talk about these scary stories all the time.

440
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,500
 We talk about these true crimes all the time.

441
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:07,500
 But when you're in them.

442
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,500
 When you're 10 toes invested in one of these things.

443
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:17,500
 When you're sitting there and you just had a fun night and you're a little buzzed and you hear a door shut and you look up and reality has shifted.

444
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,500
 Everything you know has changed right in front of you.

445
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,500
 That will break your brain.

446
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,500
 He couldn't get over it.

447
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,500
 He stopped eating.

448
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,500
 Stopped sleeping.

449
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,500
 Couldn't function.

450
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,500
 A complete breakdown of his psyche.

451
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,500
 They tried to get counseling for him.

452
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,500
 Wasn't working.

453
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,500
 I mean think about it you go meet your counselor.

454
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,500
 You're like I don't know if you're going to cease to exist.

455
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,500
 I don't know if I blink.

456
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,500
 If all of a sudden my house will have been abandoned for 80 years and I'm an old man.

457
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,500
 I mean if you step back and think about it.

458
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,500
 That's how terrifying this would be.

459
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,500
 Imagine where you're at right now.

460
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,500
 Imagine blinking and then all of a sudden.

461
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,500
 Everything is 50 years from now.

462
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:09,500
 Not cool 50 years from now like floating cars and holographic sex babes.

463
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,500
 Like weeds.

464
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,500
 Weeds everywhere in broken windows.

465
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,500
 Imagine you're sitting in your house and then bam.

466
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,500
 All of a sudden it's completely run down.

467
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,500
 There's garbage everywhere.

468
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,500
 You're like oh this is my normal house.

469
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,500
 I live in the dumps.

470
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,500
 But it would break your brain.

471
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,500
 It would really break your brain.

472
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,500
 It would mess with the way that you processed reality.

473
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,500
 We did that story recently about those two hikers and one of them like walked.

474
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,500
 Was looking over the valley for like 45 seconds a minute.

475
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,500
 Turned around and the other hiker was missing.

476
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,500
 And they never found her.

477
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,500
 And this person was investigated and it wasn't them and they never found any trace of this person.

478
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,500
 And I said on that episode how would that destroy your ability to perceive reality.

479
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:51,500
 At any point you would think anyone around you could just vanish.

480
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,500
 They never found any proof that this woman was even up there.

481
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,500
 But she was. Other people saw her.

482
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,500
 But I mean they couldn't find any shoelaces or nothing. She vanished.

483
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,500
 And I said how could you go on like that.

484
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,500
 This is worse.

485
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,500
 Because at least the hiker could go maybe she slipped.

486
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,500
 Maybe she fell.

487
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,500
 Maybe a bear got her.

488
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,500
 Something.

489
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,500
 I didn't see what happened.

490
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,500
 So it must be something rational.

491
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:19,500
 This one the two guys they are looking.

492
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,500
 And it just changes.

493
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,500
 Reality shifts.

494
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,500
 PJ was almost committed to a mental institution because of this.

495
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,500
 He could not comprehend what he saw.

496
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,500
 Fascinating story.

497
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,500
 It has everything I love about these paranormal topics.

498
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,500
 A guy going crazy.

499
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,500
 Because we don't see that enough in these things.

500
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,500
 I'm not saying I hope more people go crazy.

501
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:45,500
 But a lot of times in these stories these people have these fantabulous adventures.

502
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,500
 And then they crawl back into bed.

503
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,500
 Or they end up eating breakfast the next day.

504
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:52,500
 And that makes sense because your body does go through a sort of shock when you see the paranormal.

505
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,500
 Because it shouldn't be real.

506
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,500
 But the long term effects are...

507
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,500
 I think there's more of this.

508
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,500
 I think there's more of these people just kind of going...

509
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,500
 Like old loony tunes crazy.

510
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,500
 And we don't see it enough.

511
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,500
 And actually now that I say that we probably don't see it enough.

512
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,500
 Because they're not telling their story.

513
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:16,500
 They might not even have the ability to tell their story.

514
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,500
 So if you ever find yourself driving down a back road.

515
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,500
 Anywhere.

516
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,500
 It doesn't have to be Virginia.

517
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,500
 I think we've found out that borders don't matter.

518
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,500
 In this story.

519
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,500
 You're driving down a rural road.

520
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,500
 You see a little corner store and you have to pee all of a sudden.

521
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,500
 You should hold it in.

522
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,500
 That's the takeaway.

523
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,500
 Don't pee at a random gas station.

524
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,500
 I recommend only urinating at chevrons.

525
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,500
 Or BPs.

526
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,500
 Or you know chain gas stations.

527
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,500
 Because nothing weird is ever going to happen there.

528
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,500
 You might have a gun shoved in your face.

529
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,500
 You might get assaulted by a homeless person.

530
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,500
 But you don't have to worry about any sort of time travels or time slips.

531
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,500
 So you have to figure out what's more important.

532
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,500
 Your mental health.

533
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,500
 Actually now that you've got a kidding of 357.

534
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,500
 Shoved against my temple for 20 minutes.

535
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,500
 As some guys negotiating with the police.

536
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,500
 Would probably be pretty traumatizing either.

537
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,500
 I guess the moral of the story is hold it until you get home.

538
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,500
 Because if you pull over to the side of the road to urinate.

539
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,500
 You may just think you're going to drain the main vein.

540
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,500
 You're going to let the lizard leak.

541
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,500
 But instead you're going to find yourself falling crotch first.

542
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,500
 Into a world of mind breaking mystery.

543
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:34,500
 Yeah that's good.

544
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,500
 That's a good ending.

545
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,500
