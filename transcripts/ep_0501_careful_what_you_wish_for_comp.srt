00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
 A diner in Long Island has a terrifying past.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,440
 And then we traveled to Estonia to meet a journalist who took a trip on a spaceship.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:17,520
 Everything was going great until the corkscrew entered his head today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:29,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,520
 Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. We got a lot of

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,800
 stuff to cover. So we're going to slide right into this one. First off, let's toss the keys to all of

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:46,160
 our vehicles into the capable hands of our newest Patreon supporter, Evan Young. Evan,

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,080
 everyone give a round of applause to Evan. You don't have to. I mean, he would just be polite.

9
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,240
 He's going to be our captain this episode. If you can't support the Patreon, totally understand

10
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,720
 that's fine too. Just help spread the word about the show. Talk about it online to your friends

11
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:05,440
 that also really, really helps out a lot. Also, I have sent out all of the Patreon supporter

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:11,600
 stickers. I still have some, but if you have sent me your address officially today, some of you guys

13
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,560
 have been waiting a while. I apologize for that, but they have all, if you've sent me your address,

14
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:23,440
 yours is in the mail today. Sorry I fell behind on that, but it's all, it's all out there. So it's

15
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,440
 on the way. So you can keep checking your mailbox. Sorry, because some of you guys have been checking

16
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,200
 your mailbox quite a lot. Evan, let's go ahead and touch the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We're

17
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,840
 going to take a long car ride. We are leaving behind Oregon. We're headed out to New York.

18
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,720
 That's the door as we're opening to go into the diner. Specifically, we're going to the Seacrest

19
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,760
 diner. Now this is a diner in Long Island. We're going to walk. We're going to get our

20
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,560
 menus. We're going to sit down and we're going to start off with a little lightheartedness because

21
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,800
 this segment gets pretty rough really, really fast, but I think it's an interesting segment.

22
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,320
 But first off, let's do one of my favorite things. I love reading, I love reading reviews.

23
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,000
 I love reading bad reviews online. So we're sitting down at the Seacrest and we're looking

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,680
 through the menu. Go ahead, order whatever you want. Evan's paying for it. Evan's paying for it

25
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,560
 with the Patreon donation. Go ahead, order everything. But as you're eating your, I don't

26
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,440
 order anything. As you're eating your food, I'm going to read you a couple of these reviews here

27
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,840
 real quick. These are real reviews I found on their Yelp page or whatever review site it was.

28
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,880
 Went to have coffee and dessert with family and everything we ordered was old. And everything

29
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:43,360
 we ordered was old. Mold growing on rice pudding. Carrot cake, dry and stale. Even chocolate ice

30
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,600
 cream didn't taste right. Never going back again. If I sat down, if we're having dinner or something

31
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:55,280
 like that and I see that there's mold growing on the rice pudding, I'm not going to go,

32
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:03,280
 that's disgusting. I wonder how this carrot cake tastes. This is so gross. Luckily I have this

33
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,720
 bowl of ice cream. This bowl of ice cream must be delicious. Like the mold on the rice pudding,

34
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,080
 right? You just quit eating. You just quit eating at the point. We got to get the laughs in now because

35
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,440
 this next segment's rough. I'm sorry you're on this episode, Evan. Here we go. Last review.

36
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:26,240
 Old filthy wobbly chairs. Dirty rug being swept as we ate until you're like,

37
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,440
 "You're taking a piece of fried chicken. Dust is all flying in your mouth." Dirty rug being swept as

38
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:41,440
 we ate. Disgusting bathroom. Menus were even greasy dirty. The service just is bad. Okay, so all of

39
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,600
 that stuff's going on, right? You go. You go. And the chairs are wobbly. Whoa, whoa, whoa. That'd

40
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,880
 actually be kind of fun. Old filthy wobbly chairs. The dirty rug is being, at least they're sweeping

41
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,840
 really, but dirty rug being swept as we ate. Disgusting bathroom. Again, they're like,

42
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,400
 "What? This chair is horrible and this place is disgusting. I know the one clean place in this

43
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,120
 restaurant. I will go into the lavatory." Of course it's going to be disgusting. The service was bad

44
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:14,240
 and then when you get to this is the best part. This is the best part. Waitress has pus on her face.

45
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:21,680
 Waitress had pus on her face. They actually all did. So basically every, remember the service

46
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,840
 staff had pus on their face. Like they just hatched from some sort of cocoon in the back.

47
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,760
 And then they still ate the food. So after all of that stuff, the wobbly chairs, the stuff getting

48
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:37,120
 swept on you, people with pus all over their face, then we have a review of the actual food.

49
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:45,040
 "Burn hash browns, overdone eggs, french toast was really just toast fried." I don't know, that means.

50
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,320
 "We left feeling grossed out and disgusted and the prices were not worth the meal."

51
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,520
 Two exclamation points. So if they're all that, you're like, "Man, you know what? Looking back on it,

52
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,480
 I really got overcharged for my french toast covered in pus. I shouldn't have paid that much.

53
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:06,320
 I'm going to go review yelp as I slowly transform into cocoon." Okay, this next

54
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,680
 segment is not funny at all. So we want, those are real reviews. And the Seacrest is a real

55
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,840
 restaurant, but it's going to get dark here. So I really kind of want, this whole episode is a

56
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:22,960
 little just dark. But anyways, there we go. The joy has now left my body. It's just floated away.

57
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:30,000
 Evan, we're going to snap our fingers. We're going to go back to the 1980s to kind of get a sense

58
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,240
 of context for the story. I was reading this article recently, American criminologist Marcus

59
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,640
 Felsen, who's recently, he'd come up with this theory a long time ago, but he says he can really

60
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,520
 look at it because of the COVID lockdown. So he goes, "When we look at crime, we always go

61
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:50,640
 income disparity, where people are at, opportunities, broken window theory, all this stuff." He goes,

62
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:57,040
 "I've always had a theory about really what causes crime at a root level." And he goes, "I've really

63
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:02,320
 been able to see how it works because for the first time really ever, we've had mass amounts of

64
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,840
 people locked down." He goes, "Really, it comes down to three things. A capable offender, a suitable

65
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:15,680
 target, and the absence of an appropriate guardian." So in other words, a specific deterrent. Could be

66
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:22,320
 a video camera can be the guardian. It could be a police officer. It could be a neighborhood watch.

67
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:28,000
 But think about if you think the video camera doesn't work, or if you think even if the video

68
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,600
 camera does work, or if someone watches you do it, you won't get in trouble for it. Petty vandalism,

69
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,760
 skateboarding, things like that. Then you do it. A capable offender, a suitable target,

70
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:45,760
 absence of a guardian. That is really what, what, that's really kind of the base level of where

71
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,720
 crime begins. And I'm real, I mean, this is like a 40 year long theory. This guy's gonna work,

72
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,720
 and I'm really kind of breaking it down, but that's what he's saying. He goes, "We saw house burglaries

73
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,760
 drop during the COVID-19 crisis, because everyone was home. You didn't have suitable targets,

74
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:08,160
 but commercial burglaries skyrocketed because people weren't at work." He goes, "You have the

75
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,120
 capable offender, you had the thieves. The target changed." He goes, "You still, you didn't have people

76
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,040
 breaking into houses like they used to because that was no longer a suitable target. The guardian was

77
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:24,160
 there. It was you." So he goes, "Really, that's why we saw massive reductions in crimes in some areas

78
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,920
 and increase is another, domestic violence. We've seen an increase one." And there, we haven't really

79
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:35,760
 seen a lot of upticks yet, but they're believing we're gonna see a huge uptick in like child abuse

80
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:41,280
 during this whole time. Kids who used to go to school and they'd be seen with a black eye,

81
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,520
 I told you this wasn't a great fun segment. Kids who used to go to school and see a black eye or a

82
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,600
 chipped tooth or something like that, and there were guardians to say, "Hey, what's going on, man?

83
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:56,640
 Those are absent now." So we expect to see an unfortunately increase in child sexual abuse,

84
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:01,600
 you know, child violence towards children, things like that. We've removed that guardian,

85
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,880
 which is normally society, which is teachers, peers, things like that. Kids may never leave the

86
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:12,400
 house. We have this intersection and I was reading that article and I reminded me of this story I'd

87
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:18,480
 come across a couple months ago. I had seen it on Reddit. I had never, ever heard of this true crime

88
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:24,640
 story before. So I want to give a shout out to a Reddit username @Amatic13 because again, I've

89
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:30,240
 been a big true crime fan for decades and I've never heard of this story before. Evan, let's

90
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:37,200
 drive around the Jason Jalopy. We're in New York. It's May 28th, 1982. It's Memorial Day weekend.

91
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,480
 As we're driving, we see a gang of youths. There's five young men, they're ages 18 to 22. They're

92
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:49,680
 called the Sutter Avenue boys. They're a Brooklyn gang and whatever sparks in their head to start

93
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:57,200
 this violent spree, it doesn't end quickly. Flatbush Avenue. These guys are driving down Flatbush Avenue.

94
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,960
 They see this parking garage called the patio garden garage. They pull up, these five guys get out,

95
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:08,160
 beat up an attendant, beat up the parking attendant, then just beat up six other people who are just

96
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,840
 standing around. They rob them. They end up getting $2,400 in cash. They get gold rings.

97
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:20,240
 And they steal a car. They steal a 1981 Cadillac. So they've upgraded their vehicle. They drive away.

98
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,000
 They see some cars parked on the road in this nice neighborhood. Suitable target, capable offenders,

99
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,560
 obviously. They see this row of cars out here and they go, well, we know what that means.

100
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,720
 There's a bunch of people in the house. Now that would normally be a deterrent, right?

101
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,640
 These guys are armed with a rifle and a shotgun and a couple of blackjacks, which are basically like

102
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:49,520
 lead in a, it's basically like a sap. It's like a, even those are old terms. It's basically lead in

103
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:55,920
 a cloth. It's like a lead or like a thick metal that you can use to clobber people. Super painful.

104
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,960
 It can kill you getting hit with a blackjack. Most criminals will stay away from mass groups

105
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,680
 like that, but they had already taken on seven people. They took on an attendant and six other

106
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,120
 people. They got a Cadillac and all this gold jewelry and they got this cash. Let's go for a

107
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,400
 bigger score. They roll up to this party. What happened was this family son had just come back

108
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:22,640
 home from college. They're having a party. It's 12, 20 a.m. There's 22 people in there. 22 people.

109
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,480
 The party's actually starting to wind down. The center avenue boys, one of the guys stays in

110
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:33,280
 the car. The other four go in at gunpoint. They take over the party. First time they're beating

111
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:38,800
 people up. This time we see an escalation already within an hour or two. The center avenue boys

112
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,880
 weren't a charitable organization before. They were a street gang, but we see a massive uptick

113
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:51,840
 in this activity in just hours. First time they beat a couple people up. Now they go in there.

114
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:57,760
 They start beating people up, but then they order people to take their clothes off. They begin

115
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:04,240
 beating people up. They begin making them strip. Then the center avenue boys rape a woman there.

116
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,640
 Then after they're done raping this woman, they pee on the people. It seems almost ju- I mean,

117
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:16,560
 I understand why they're doing it. It's to completely just dehumanize these people that they brutalized

118
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:23,280
 for a period of time. They pee on them. They leave. That's not even the worst that's going to happen

119
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:30,240
 that night. They drive out to the Seacrest Diner, and as they're driving by, they see the most

120
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:39,600
 suitable target yet. It has no windows. It's a restaurant. It's about 12.20 a.m. No windows.

121
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,440
 Brutalized six people, brutalized 22 people. When they walk into the Seacrest with guns ready,

122
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:52,560
 there's more than 80 people in this restaurant. What happened at the Seacrest for about an hour

123
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:59,920
 and a half? The only people who really know for sure are the assailants and the people in there,

124
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:09,280
 because people don't like to talk about it. This level of inhumanity in such recent times in

125
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,400
 America, I mean, we've had like Colts do weird stuff, but I was shocked at this store. I mean,

126
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:20,080
 this happened in 1982. This happened in my lifetime. It's been pretty much forgotten. I wouldn't

127
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:28,240
 necessarily say covered up, but this gang goes into this restaurant. These five guys walking

128
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:36,080
 with guns begin robbing people. They rape a waitress, and then they begin ordering people

129
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:44,080
 to rape each other. They had to shoot two people because two people completely resisted. They were

130
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,320
 like, "We're not going to do this." So the Center Avenue boys just shot them, continued beating people

131
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:58,080
 up and ordering people to rape each other. I mean, that's inhumane. We don't know the full scope of

132
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:06,320
 what happened at the Seacrest Diner, because when they left about an hour later, the cops were called,

133
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:12,240
 and when the cops got there, a bunch of the victims just left. They just went home. They

134
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,440
 didn't want to talk about it. They didn't want to testify. They didn't want to think about it in

135
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,040
 any way, shape, or form. They just went home. There was always rumors about the scope of the

136
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,640
 brutality, rumors about forced incest, and people they don't want to talk about.

137
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:36,560
 These guys got arrested the next day, and you still had people who just never came forward.

138
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:43,040
 There's a quote from John Nolan. He was a senior detective on the robbery squad. He got called out

139
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,360
 to this because it was basically the equivalent of a mass shooting. You had a mass casualty event.

140
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,600
 Even though just two people were shot, they both survived. I can't even really imagine that

141
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,320
 happening outside. It's horrible when it happens there too, but outside of like a war-torn country.

142
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,760
 Here's this quote. It's describing this woman he saw at the crime scene. "She was wearing a light

143
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,520
 colored blouse and a dark skirt. Her arms folded from shoulder to shoulder as if to protect her

144
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:17,920
 breasts. She reminded me of all the pictures I had seen of people from concentration camps

145
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:25,680
 who had lost all hope. Her face spoke volumes. There was sadness in her eyes. She had very dark

146
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:31,040
 circles around her eyes that contrasted with her white skin. She obviously had not slept.

147
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,200
 I thought how tragic it must have been for her and how tragic it still must be."

148
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:43,680
 These guys were charged with 800 counts of attempted murder, rape, assault, robbery.

149
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,480
 Each of them got sentenced. They were all arrested the next day. Each of them got sentenced to

150
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:56,160
 3,000 years in jail, but which sounds great, right? Two of them are already free. So one of the guys

151
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,680
 was released in 2002 because this is the way American justice system works. You usually get

152
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,960
 a really big penalty and then there's some changes in judges and there's some changes in

153
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:12,000
 procedures and policies and things like that and people and time passes and someone goes,

154
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,120
 "Oh, I don't remember that. I maybe read a headline sometime back in the day. Oh, yeah,

155
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:24,320
 you're paroled." It was released in 2002. We had another one released in 2010. You have those two

156
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,040
 and then two other of them, they got life because they were connected to an earlier murder that

157
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,200
 wasn't related to that rampage. They had murdered someone before this. This wasn't the get along

158
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:39,920
 gang, right? They're already up to no good. Then you have one more guy who is... Actually,

159
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,000
 I couldn't find any information on him. I couldn't tell whether he was released or not

160
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,920
 because there's really not a lot of follow-up. The big news story was back in 2002 when the first

161
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,280
 guy got released in 2002. It was a big news story because it was like the 30-year anniversary. It was

162
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,600
 that year and people are like, "What? You letting them go?" But then when they let the other one go

163
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,600
 in 2010, people are like, "Huh?" That restaurant's still there. People are still leaving bad reviews

164
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:12,880
 on it. I wanted to read those funny reviews to kind of... It's such a dark story because again,

165
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:19,520
 when I was reading about it, I thought, "This is like something you'd see in a movie, like a

166
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:25,280
 really messed up movie." I guess even though I read a lot of true crime and definitely read a

167
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:35,120
 lot of conspiracy stuff, sometimes stuff still shocks me. I've read some really weird,

168
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:43,040
 true crime stuff, but I'm like... It's just shocking. I'm shocking one that it happened.

169
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:49,200
 It's shocking too that it happened so recent, really, in my lifetime. Then memories just have

170
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:54,960
 faded. The people who this happened to are still around. This wasn't a long time ago.

171
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:01,200
 There are people who were suffering from this that are still around. Then these guys were

172
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:06,400
 walking around free. I don't know. It's so bizarre. I found the whole thing so bizarre. I don't have

173
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:13,040
 like a proper dead rabbit radio ending for it. I actually thought about reading the reviews

174
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:18,800
 after the story, but then I thought, "That's not a good wrap. But you got to do the stories before

175
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,480
 because then afterwards..." You don't want to hear any jokes. You don't want to hear any jokes

176
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:28,800
 about moldy rice pudding. You just want to leave the sea crest. Leave it all behind. But that's it.

177
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:34,000
 I'm just going to shrug my shoulders. Bizarre true crime story that happened within my lifetime.

178
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:42,160
 It's very likely it happened within your lifetime too. That's it. That's it. I just put my menu down

179
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:51,280
 and just kind of sigh. I go, "Evan, pay the tab. Let's leave the sea crest diner." I just wanted

180
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:58,560
 to talk about that just completely dark story of a true crime. We are leaving the sea crest.

181
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:02,640
 Let's get a little more upbeat here. We're leaving behind the sea crest. I hope, you know,

182
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,040
 all those people who suffered from that are finding peace now. Let's hop on the Carbenter

183
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:14,400
 Coptor. Evan, we are headed out to Dagava Estonia. The helicopter is leaving behind the sea crest.

184
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:21,040
 There's Pussface Waitresses chasing us. "One of us! One of us!" flying away. And I'm like,

185
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:26,000
 "Good thing we got away from them. Now, to choice some delicious rice pudding." Dude,

186
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,320
 and then as I go to take a bite, I realize it's not rice pudding. It's Puss. There's little

187
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:36,880
 waitress face in it going, "One of us! One of us!" But I'm kind of hungry. So I take a bite anyways.

188
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:45,840
 We are leaving behind that whole story. We're headed out to Dagava Estonia. It's August 1999.

189
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:54,160
 It's evening time. Helicopters flying low over the valley. There's a man named Anton Zilgavis.

190
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,920
 He's a journalist. He's just going for a walk, right? He's walking along the coastline,

191
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:04,400
 skipping stones like splinter. If you get that reference, dude, you're my best friend.

192
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:12,400
 He's skipping stones. And I remember I had that album. I play that album all the time, dude.

193
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:20,480
 Anton is skipping stones. He's walking around. He sees a meadow. And in the meadow, he sees this

194
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,240
 egg-shaped object. It's a metallic object just sitting there, little landing,

195
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,920
 laggy things, you know, just like on the ground. He walks up to it. He knows exactly what it is,

196
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:38,080
 obviously. He goes, "That is not a hut of one of my countrymen. That's obviously UFO." So he starts

197
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,520
 going, "Hey, guys, guys!" And the egg is just sitting there. It's big. It's not like just a

198
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,080
 chicken egg. It's not a tiny chicken egg. He's like, "Guys, guys!" He's kind of waving his arms.

199
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:55,280
 "Guys, open up. I want to see you, guys!" He starts calling out for what he refers to as

200
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:01,520
 the brothers of intellect. Brothers of intellect! Brothers of intellect! Please, all these other

201
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:12,960
 people are stupid, but you and me were smart. Door opens up. An outcome, these three tall,

202
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:20,640
 what he describes as humanoid aliens, with silvery coveralls. I'm thinking they're Nordics,

203
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,800
 which are generally the blonde-haired blue-eyed aliens. That kind of fits their description more

204
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:30,000
 than it. Generally, people go, "Oh, it's a reptilian," or gray, but generally, when they're

205
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,880
 referred to as just humanoids, it's usually what's called a Nordic alien. These three tall

206
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,360
 aliens come out. They're wearing silvery coveralls. They start walking out to him, and he's like,

207
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,000
 "Oh, yeah, dude. Me and you, dude. We're both brothers of intellect. Oh, dude, yeah, but maybe

208
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,320
 I'm a little more intellectual than you, but I guess we'll find out." And as he's talking,

209
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:55,120
 they point a silver stick at him, and they shoot him, and he gets paralyzed. And they take him

210
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,680
 onto the ship. Now, at this point, he's probably thinking, "Probably, I did offer to just come on

211
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:05,520
 the ship. Probably didn't have to be paralyzed, but, you know, when in Rome, when in Romulus 7."

212
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:12,400
 So they take him aboard the spaceship, starts flying. I'm assuming, at this point, you can

213
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,680
 probably start moving again, but maybe not. Maybe it was a really bad paralysis. They're flying,

214
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,920
 and he's probably like, "Oh, dude, this is so dope. Am I going to go to the moon?

215
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:26,160
 And we're going to end up on their alien planet. Maybe fall in love with some hot alien space babe."

216
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:31,440
 And then it goes, "Eeeer." And it lands in the Caucasus Mountains, and he's like, "Oh, man."

217
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,040
 It lands, and the door opens up, and he is allowed to leave. So he's not paralyzed anymore, and he's

218
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:43,040
 walking around. And he says he thought it was the Caucasus Mountains because he kind of recognized

219
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:48,480
 the geography. He kind of reckoned it kind of looked similar to them. And he sees all these other...

220
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,880
 He doesn't necessarily say they're the more egg-shaped vehicles. He just says he sees more

221
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,040
 what he refers to as objects. So they could be more of the egg-shaped things. Could be something

222
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:05,840
 else. But he sees a lot of these tall, silvery-clad aliens walking in and out of these objects. And

223
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,160
 he's kind of standing there. And then one of them walks up to him. He's like, "Hey, so are you the

224
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,360
 brother of intellect? He's like, going to be hanging out with me? Are you the tour guide? Or like,

225
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:19,200
 what's going on? Where's that hot space babe I was imagining?" And at that point, the alien pulls

226
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:26,080
 out what's described as a corkscrew and begins to dig it into Anton's head.

227
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:34,960
 He then goes through what he calls extraterrestrial experimentation. We're not for sure exactly what

228
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,080
 that is. I mean, I guess the corkscrew being put through your head was probably test number one.

229
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:46,480
 Do humans feel pain? They're all, "Shh, yes, extreme pain when corkscrew enters the brain."

230
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:53,840
 We don't know the full scope of it, but what we do know is he is take after this alien experimentation.

231
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:59,280
 He leaves behind the caucus region. He's put back in this egg thing. He's dropped back off

232
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:05,360
 at Dagavout Estonia. I'm actually, they dropped him off a little bandaid on his forehead. He's like,

233
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,840
 "Ugh, I think I'm going to need more than a bandaid." And they're like, "No, that's the only thing they

234
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,440
 say to him the whole time. The rest of the time they're super silent and they're just like,

235
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,040
 drilling him with stuff." It's like, "Oh, come on, man. I have a splitting headache. I'm pretty

236
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:21,200
 sure some of my brain's missing." They just walk away. He has a little bandaid, a little

237
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:27,040
 SpongeBob bandaid. He's like, "Ugh." Now, remember, he was like, this thing was like sitting in the

238
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:33,200
 middle of nowhere. He was walking down the coast, skipping stones, and he saw it. He was pretty

239
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,240
 much invisible to this thing, much like the shredder is when he's sneaking up on the Ninja Turtles.

240
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:45,200
 He was the one who started yelling, "Hey, guy, hey, alien, spaceship, come over here. I want to talk

241
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,480
 to you guys." The reason why I want to point that out, not saying like this guy deserves what

242
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,200
 happens to him. I'm not saying that at all, but it's one of those things. I ate when I was researching

243
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,240
 this story, I put everything in a file, and this file was called "Careful What You Wish For." It's

244
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,440
 not just because I'm a fan of Tales From The Crypt, but after he gets dropped off, shortly after

245
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,680
 he gets dropped off, he's like, "Oh, man, better go home and change my bandaid." It's like brain

246
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:14,480
 fluid is leaking out of him. Shortly after he's dropped off, he comes down with a mysterious

247
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,520
 illness. We don't have any details of what the illness actually is. This information I got from,

248
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:25,760
 think about it, docs.com, and they got it from something called NLO #44, was their November,

249
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:32,800
 December issue, 1999. We don't have a lot of specifics, but he comes down with a mysterious

250
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:38,720
 illness, an unknown disease, as the term actually used in the write-up. And within three months,

251
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,960
 he was dead. Now, it's possible that, you know, maybe he was allergic to skipping rocks. Maybe

252
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,680
 he has that horrible illness that if he skipped more than three rocks in a day, he's gonna die in

253
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:55,680
 three months. That's not possible, right? But it's possible that he had a mysterious illness

254
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:00,960
 anyways, and that's what killed him. But, you know, it could be just be a coincidence that he was

255
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:07,440
 subjected to paralysis rays and corkscrews and the brain and alien experimentation and then

256
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,920
 dies three months later. It could be a coincidence. But what I think is interesting about this story,

257
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:16,320
 and that's horrible that the guy died. I'm not like, "Ha ha, that guy died." I'm not like that. But

258
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:22,800
 what I find interesting about this story is there's been a theory going on for a long time in UFOology.

259
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:28,800
 We've talked about it a couple times on this show, that aliens appear only to certain people.

260
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:33,520
 Like, UFOs are just something that's seen in the sky, but actual, like, contactees,

261
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:40,400
 aliens choose you. It's not like I'm walking through the forest and I see a deer. A deer is

262
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:46,240
 going to be seen by anyone walking through the forest. An alien only presents themselves or

263
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:53,120
 abducts people who meet specific factors. That's been a theory that's been bandied around for a

264
00:25:53,120 --> 00:26:00,720
 long time. Aliens, there's always been that thing that they may only appear to certain people. And

265
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,400
 we've covered that a couple times. What if this is why? See, the UFO wasn't there to meet. They're

266
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:12,480
 actually minding their own business, hanging out in their egg, testing out new corkscrews on each

267
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:18,800
 other. And this guy, this guy who wasn't supposed to be abducted by aliens, starts making a big

268
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:24,320
 bru-ha-ha outside. These aliens are looking at each other and are like, "Can you scan that dude and

269
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,440
 find out if we're supposed to abduct him?" or something. They're like, "No, he's a nobody."

270
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,360
 But he keeps yelling about Brothers of Intellect. He's going to just draw a bunch of attention.

271
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:39,200
 They're like, "I don't know. Should we just abduct this guy? I don't know. We're not supposed to,

272
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,840
 but I guess he keeps saying he's smart as we are." Well, should we, of course,

273
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,800
 screw to the brain? We'll show him how smart he is. What if being abducted by aliens, and you're

274
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,040
 not supposed to be abducted by aliens, or having a visitation with aliens, and you're not on the

275
00:26:53,040 --> 00:27:00,240
 guest list, has horrible consequences like that? Maybe the reason why I don't see aliens, like

276
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,720
 I've seen ghosts and demons and stuff like that, cryptids and all sorts of stuff. I've never seen

277
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:11,760
 aliens. Maybe because they don't, like, if I see them, something, something's gone wrong. Like,

278
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:18,720
 I'm not on the guest list. I don't get to go into the VIP room. I'm not on that list. Maybe you're

279
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:24,320
 not on that list either. We can all see a ghost. We can all see a cryptid. But you might have to

280
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:31,040
 have a special genetic makeup to actually go face-to-face with an alien. If that's the case,

281
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:38,320
 that may be another reason why aliens can't do full disclosure. It could be something as simple

282
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:45,520
 as what we already know to be true here on Earth. When two different cultures meet,

283
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:52,960
 that are separated by oceans, it's very, very likely, if not guaranteed, that there will be

284
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,680
 disease communicated between the two cultures that will kill one if not both. Aliens may not be able

285
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:08,800
 to come down and visit us en masse because they may kill us within three months. Corkscrew

286
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:16,720
 to the head or not. There could be something that they know about, that when they visit us,

287
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,560
 if we do not have the right genetic makeup, it will kill us. So they scan everything as they're

288
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:27,840
 flying by. When they look for someone to abduct, when they look for someone to communicate with,

289
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:37,920
 he can survive if he meets with us. She can't. It would be a terrifying ending to a story of first

290
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:46,640
 contact if someday UFOs do appear over major cities. Their leader's land begin talking to our

291
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,320
 leaders, begin exchanging information, begin exchanging technology. And three months later,

292
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:59,280
 90% of the world's population is dead. The remaining humans would ask the aliens,

293
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:05,520
 if you knew this was going to happen, why did you come down? If you knew that you carried a disease

294
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:11,600
 that would kill most humans, why did you appear? The aliens would just go, you've been asking for

295
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:17,840
 disclosure for so long. You've been looking up in the sky for so long and begging for us to reveal

296
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:26,080
 ourselves. You said you were our brothers of intellect. We tried to stay hidden, but you just

297
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:34,160
 kept looking for us. This is the future you chose. That's when the aliens get back on their ships.

298
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:43,920
 And fly back out far away from human eyes, leaving us to rebuild a shattered world who got exactly
