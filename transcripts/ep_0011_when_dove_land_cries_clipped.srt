1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Did an entire town in Pennsylvania just up and disappear?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,500
 The planet Mars throws up all over itself.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:13,500
 And what happens when conspiracy meets country music?

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,500
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:23,000
 [music]

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,500
 Okay everyone, we're back for another episode.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,700
 Episode 11.

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,000
 Episode 11 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,500
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,000
 I think at this point I have outlasted like 50% of all podcasts ever created.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,500
 I think most podcasts, they get started with good intentions, but for whatever reason, they fall off.

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:47,500
 Let me just say to those of you who have done podcasts in the past, or any sort of artistic or creative project,

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,500
 and you gave up on it, don't give up on it.

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,500
 Pick it back up, because it's always fun, even if you're like me just doing it for a hobby.

15
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,000
 I really enjoy doing this.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,500
 We, I went over the subjects a bit.

17
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,500
 I'm not going to complain about the weather tonight like I normally do.

18
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,000
 It's actually not terrible.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 It could be a little bit cooler.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,500
 And I'm also going to try to keep it under 20 minutes.

21
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:15,000
 Now, one of the reasons why we, one of the reasons why we ran a little bit long last time,

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 so I didn't get to the Mars story, so I'm probably going to start off with that.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 I wanted to go ahead and give out a quick, we got a sponsor.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,500
 We got a sponsor today. It's, can't even, Bragg's Apple Vinegar, Apple Cider Vinegar.

25
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:38,500
 They're not actually a sponsor, but I've recently been just can't even.

26
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:44,500
 So I started taking shots of it to help with my digestion.

27
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:54,500
 Just the mere thought of it is just, just the taste just gets to you.

28
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,000
 I don't know if you've ever had it.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,500
 It's actually really healthy for you.

30
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,000
 And you know, there's that, I'm not a big fan of homeopathic stuff.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,500
 I like Western medicine.

32
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,000
 I like medicine that was created in the laboratory.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 I started going to this doctor recently, a nurse practitioner, whatever.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,500
 And I go and I'm like my back's hurting and she's like, well, rub eucalyptus oil and take the tears of two Chinese rainbows.

35
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,500
 And I'm like, no, just give me something manufactured in the lab.

36
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,500
 That's what I want.

37
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:27,000
 I can go online and find out about the healing properties of, you know, like Bungo Bungo root.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,500
 I can find that out and buy it myself.

39
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:35,000
 I'm going to you because I need something that I can't buy online or you can buy anything online.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:43,500
 But I need, I'm going to you because I need a prescription for like antibiotics or something like that or pain medication or whatever.

41
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,500
 I'm not going to you to get your latest recommendation from Mother Earth, Mother Jones, whatever.

42
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,500
 One of those hippie-dippy magazines.

43
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,500
 Give me some Western stuff.

44
00:02:53,500 --> 00:03:01,500
 I'll deal with the long-term consequences later on if it's like destroying my liver because right now I just need something to take care of stuff.

45
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:09,000
 Yeah, she told me to get like CBD oil for my back and I was like, yeah, CBD oil is great, but I get drug tested at my job.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 So if I pop a drug test and apparently like CBD oil is fine as long as you don't put it in like get it in your mouth.

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,500
 But I would get it in my mouth.

48
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:29,000
 Today I was putting on some back cream, some of that.

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,500
 I made my own back rub stuff.

50
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,500
 I got some, you know, generic back rub, topical ointment, topical ointment for pain.

51
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:43,500
 I bought some of that from Walmart and then I have a bag full of scorpion peppers that my friend at work gave me.

52
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:55,500
 Hey Mark, you gave me these bag of scorpion peppers and I took a scorpion pepper and I just, I took a little dish and I put a bunch of the back cream in it, like the great value back cream.

53
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:04,000
 And then I took a scorpion pepper and like stuck it in there and like squeeze it around and mixed it all up and let it soak, let the oil soak in.

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 And it actually works pretty good. It burns. I actually thought it would burn more.

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 So I think I need to kind of like squish it more, get some more oils onto it.

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,500
 But going back to the thing is so I rubbed it on my back and then two minutes later I ended up rubbing like near my eyeball.

57
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,000
 I didn't get it in my eyeball.

58
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 So if I had CBD oil and I rubbed it on my back and no matter how great I'm sure that it feels within minutes I would probably end up like flossing my teeth or picking my nose or something like that.

59
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,500
 And it's going straight into my bloodstream. So I can't help that.

60
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,500
 So give me something, give me like some Western medicine. Give me some Western medicine.

61
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:45,500
 So anyways, apple cider vinegar. I've been drinking that to help with digestion stuff and it kind of like keeps your energy level up.

62
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:54,000
 I actually recommend that it does give you energy. Usually in the morning the first thing I'm doing the keto diet. I don't know if I talked about that.

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 I've lost 75 pounds so far since last year. But anyways, that's a whole other project. I'll reveal that.

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 But anyways, so I lost 75 pounds and one thing I've been doing is there's a thing called fat bombs.

65
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 You know what, let me go ahead and get started with the show. I'll save all that stuff for later.

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:20,500
 So Mars. You know, one of the theories, again, like one of the conspiracy theories that I like to believe in is that humans may be from Mars.

67
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:27,500
 Like maybe that was like the story of the Garden of Eden is that idea. Like that was a planet.

68
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:36,500
 And the Bible is basically a very, very, it's like close to an accurate history book but told on the level of a caveman.

69
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:42,000
 If any of that makes sense. So I think like a lot of the early stuff is metaphorical.

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 I don't believe that there was an actual talking snake in a Garden of Eden where they're like hanging out with animals.

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 I think that's a metaphor story for the creation. But I also think it's kind of neat to think that maybe a theory that I wouldn't be surprised if humans came from Mars.

72
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:09,500
 And when we look up at it and we go, well, Jason, you can look at the Mars, there's no structures. If we were there and we were advanced enough to launch a shuttle to Earth, we would see stuff.

73
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:16,500
 But not if there was no atmosphere and stuff had been eroded over, you know, hundreds of thousands of years.

74
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:23,500
 So that's my argument. But it doesn't, I mean, again, it's something that I think is interesting to believe in. I don't really, I can't really prove it.

75
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:29,500
 And that'll kind of come into play later when we talk about the country music conspiracy theorist.

76
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:35,000
 So if anyone is like, no, Jason, that's actually not true. And here's some facts to back up that what you're saying is wrong.

77
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 I'll be like, okay, you know, it's just, it's a fun theory for me to entertain.

78
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 But he, but a lot of times the thing that's more fun or funner than the theory is the actual truth.

79
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 I think a lot of times it can be more interesting. I saw this headline and I'll post the article in the links.

80
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,500
 The headline was Fox News, because again, they have a lot of really, they have a good weird news section.

81
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:05,500
 Headline is Mysterious Mars Rock Formation Explained and it doesn't involve UFOs.

82
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,500
 So I saw the headline and I was like, oh, okay, you know, this might be kind of interesting.

83
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:16,500
 But of course, you know, I think it would be more interesting if it involved UFOs, but it's actually not.

84
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,500
 This is what I think is fascinating. So anyways, they found this rock formation.

85
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:33,500
 They call it an enigmatic, like an enigma, but okay, anyways, you'll read the article.

86
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:41,000
 A weird pile of eroding sentiments and people thought that it says,

87
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 "And UFO hunters strongly believe an extraterrestrial spacecraft was like, okay, so they're sorry, sorry, getting ahead of myself."

88
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 So UFO hunters were saying that looks like that was caused by like UFOs taking off and landing.

89
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Like it was some sort of launch pad or some sort of area that would show that.

90
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,500
 What's amazing about it? It was a volcanic explosion on Mars.

91
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:12,000
 So the fact to think like we think of Mars as like this dead planet, to think underneath there's like lava.

92
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,500
 Like it's still alive at its core. It's still burning and churning and all, you know, all of the stuff that we have on Earth.

93
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,500
 It's still happening in those empty cave systems. This wind is just whistling through.

94
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:33,000
 It's just stark and alone and dark. There's no life, but you still have all of that churning planet.

95
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,500
 I find it's fascinating. This volcanic eruption, it's the, the Medusa, I don't know why these words are so hard to pronounce.

96
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:55,000
 The Medusa Fase Formation, this enigmatic pile of eroding sediment, this results of this volcanic eruption, is one-fifth the size of the United States.

97
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 It's also quoting here, "100 times more massive than the largest explosive volcanic deposit on Earth, which would make it the largest known explosive volcanic deposit in the solar system."

98
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:22,500
 That is amazing. That's just that, that raw power. I mean, if there was any, anything on the planet when that happened, it would have instantly been decimated.

99
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:31,500
 100 times more massive than the largest explosive volcanic deposit on Earth. And it's the largest one that we've ever seen in the solar system.

100
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:38,500
 That's amazing to me. Just that act. I find, and I think we talked about this first episode. I find volcanoes fascinating to begin with.

101
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:44,000
 I live between two volcanoes. Not on purpose, but I mean, I just kind of ended up here.

102
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 So to me, that story, that violence of the universe, that churning and that explosive power and all of that stuff, and it kind of just happening in a void.

103
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 If we weren't here to observe it, it still would have happened, but it would just, this planet still would have just been tumbling through the darkness of space.

104
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:19,500
 And we look up at it and we can measure it and we can be in awe of this. And then you think about the magnitude of the galaxy and of the universe and all of these amazing scientific, geological, astronomical events happening.

105
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,500
 And we're lucky enough to be able to just view this one. I just think that's amazing.

106
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:31,500
 And so I do like the idea of like, oh yeah, you know, there's other stuff out there like the fantasy version of life, but that's pretty awesome.

107
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,500
 Like a lot of times the reality of life can be just as amazing.

108
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:48,000
 Another thing I want, I think I'm going to finish up with the conspiracy country music thing. I think that'll probably be easiest because this one's actually a short topic because I've come across quite a few conspiracy theories.

109
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,500
 There's not a lot of information on, well, and here's the interesting thing about that.

110
00:10:53,500 --> 00:11:03,500
 I'm going to open this Diet Pepsi here. Dead Arab Radio sponsored by Diet Pepsi, Choice of a New Generation.

111
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:12,500
 So a lot of times you come across conspiracy theories that nobody knows about or very, very limited people know about.

112
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:22,000
 That usually means, well, it could mean a lot of things, but anyways, one is that it's fake and somebody's just making it up and the story hasn't spread that far.

113
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Two, it's true. And the reason why nobody knows about it is because it is being covered up.

114
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,500
 Like if stuff does get out, the web pages are taken down. Or three, it's true and it just hasn't gained traction.

115
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:46,500
 So it's either fake, it's either like a fake one and it hasn't caught it in the mainstream. It's a real one and it's being deleted as it's being talked about.

116
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,500
 Or three, that it's real and it just hasn't gained traction yet.

117
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:57,000
 Obviously, for the most, 99% of them, they're just fake and you just don't know about them yet.

118
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 You know, someone makes up a conspiracy.

119
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,500
 Like at some point someone made up Loch Ness Monster and we can do a whole episode on that, but that's pretty much been disproven.

120
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,500
 But it took a while for that to catch on.

121
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:17,500
 But anyways, so there's a conspiracy going around and we're going to do a lot of these conspiracy theories that no one's heard about.

122
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,500
 Because I find these really fascinating because you can disprove this one and disprove that one.

123
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
 The more information that's out there, it's easier to disprove.

124
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:29,000
 So here's one of our, I think we'll have a little segment called "Missing Conspiracies" or something like that. I don't know. I don't really like that.

125
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 But, "Doveland, Wisconsin."

126
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 I said Pennsylvania earlier, but it's not Pennsylvania. I just realized that.

127
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 "Doveland, Wisconsin" is a town in Wisconsin that people have said, "Oh, you know, I have my coffee mug," says "Doveland, Wisconsin" on it.

128
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 And some people had, you know, because it was kind of a tourist town. People would go through it and just kind of nestled into Wisconsin.

129
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:08,500
 And people, you know, Hood River is a tourist town. We have all our little chachkies. You can get Hood River shirts and may the forest be with you or whatever.

130
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
 It's all good in the hood.

131
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:16,500
 So people have mugs and they have these shirts and these type of things for the city of "Doveland."

132
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:22,000
 And the problem is the city of "Doveland" no longer exists.

133
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,500
 The question is, did it ever exist? Is this just a fake story?

134
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,000
 So I'm on this website. I'll post a link to it.

135
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 Now, again, this website has about as much information as any of the websites do.

136
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 When you start looking through conspiracy theories, when you look for "Doveland, Wisconsin," you'll see people go, "I can't find any information on it."

137
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:52,500
 So we're going to--Pinselvainian Patriot. This is this person's page. That's why I got the state mixed up earlier.

138
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:59,500
 So I'm going to read a bit from here and I'll send you the link because you can definitely go check this out for yourself and support this person's website.

139
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,000
 Okay, so this is the beginning of it.

140
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:11,500
 "Supposedly there was a small town in Wisconsin called "Doveland" that just up and disappeared sometime in the late 1980s, early 1990s.

141
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:18,000
 One day the town was there, the next it wasn't. Every man, woman, and child vanished into thin air."

142
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,500
 And they're saying that it doesn't show up on any maps.

143
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,500
 People in the area don't remember that it existed.

144
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:32,000
 Which, I mean, again, makes you think that it's most likely a fake one.

145
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 And here's the theories that "Pinselvainian Patriot" put out for what could be going on.

146
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 One, that the town never existed and it's just a lark, which is termed for a live-action role play.

147
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 It's just somebody making up a conspiracy theory and seeing if it ever gains traction.

148
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Two, that there was a town called "Doveland" Wisconsin that just slowly people filtered out of because of the economy.

149
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 And eventually started to become a ghost town and then maybe they changed their name or something like that.

150
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Three, this is where we get into the really unfeasible thing. So the first one is the most likely that it's fake.

151
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 The second one is possible that people just kind of filter out of the town. Both of those happen.

152
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 I'm going to put in my own three right now. Oh wait, no, never mind. That was number one. I was going to say it's all made up.

153
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 His three, or her three, is where we start to get into the really weird conspiracy theories, which to me is kind of the cool stuff with this type of story.

154
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 That a government project or experiment went wrong and it killed everybody or did something to the population and the government had to cover it up.

155
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Now that's the, you see scenarios like that in movies like "The Crazies" or any sort of like "Return a Living Dead" where there's a population,

156
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 there's some sort of outbreak and the government has to basically destroy the whole thing and just purge it.

157
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 And you could say, well that's impossible. How could you get away with that?

158
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 Well one, this was back in the 80s and 90s, which wouldn't be a little bit easier for them to cover up.

159
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 But two, you know, America's a huge place. A lot of times we don't realize how big America is.

160
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 So if you had some small town, you know, because they never really say what the population of this is,

161
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 let's say you had a town that only had like a thousand people in it and you did release some sort of virus or you ran some sort of test or something in that town,

162
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 and it went sideways, you could cover it up. And if anyone ever asked about it, just be like, oh no, no, no, that town didn't exist.

163
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 And over time eventually people would, people who were around to even remember that town would be gone.

164
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 I mean it wouldn't be easy. I'm not saying that it would be super easy to pull off making a thousand people disappear.

165
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 But it's, I don't think it's as implausible as we would think.

166
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 You couldn't do it with a major city, but if it was a small town in the middle of nowhere, because again, see the real scant on detail, so who knows.

167
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 But I don't think it's as implausible as people think.

168
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 The fourth one is the town fell into another dimension.

169
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 The town fell into another dimension, or we shifted into a reality where the town never existed and that was like the Mandela effect.

170
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 That's what I talked about, I think on episode seven, Shower Power.

171
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 We talked about the Mandela effect and how I'm in a universe where people don't shower all the time.

172
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 And we may have all moved to a universe where Dublin, Wisconsin no longer exists.

173
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 So I think it's an interesting conspiracy theory.

174
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 It's one of those ones that I've never really heard of.

175
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 I have a list of conspiracy theories.

176
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 It's not like I have this special list. It's on the internet.

177
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 But it lists them all from most popular to the ones no one knows about.

178
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 And this one's, I think, in the middle. It's going to get weird.

179
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 This show's going to get weird when we start going deeper and deeper in this conspiracy list.

180
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 So Dublin, Wisconsin, did it exist?

181
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Most likely not, but I think it's an interesting story.

182
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 I think it's an interesting story, and I think the idea of a small town, like a small American town, just up and disappearing.

183
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 I think it's creepy. I think it's very twilight zoning. I like it.

184
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 I think this would be more plausible also in a country where this stuff may have happened in Russia.

185
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 You may have had a small town on the USSR, on the outskirts of the Soviet Union, Siberia, that area, where this did happen.

186
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 And it would be very easy to scrub. There are racing people from pictures.

187
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 So I'm going to try to do this quick, but I don't know if I can do it justice.

188
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 So we're going to go ahead and try this out.

189
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 Now I want to talk about the YouTube star, Flat Earth Man.

190
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 So Flat Earth Man is a country music singer who sings about the Flat Earth.

191
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 I'm going to play a little bit of it for you. We're going to talk about it.

192
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 I really can't stand playing this for long, and you'll hear why.

193
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 So we're going to go ahead and get this started.

194
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Okay, so obviously, I can't watch this again.

195
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 I've already seen it like three times. I'll put the link in the description.

196
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 But he tells this origin story where a guy tells him first about the Flat Earth, how great the Flat Earth is.

197
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 And he's like, "Oh, I don't believe you. I don't believe you."

198
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 And then he went and did his own research.

199
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 And that's something you'll hear them say a lot.

200
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 They'll say, "Just research it, man. Just research it. Just research it."

201
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 And they feel like if you just research it, then you'll come to the truth.

202
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 And I run into that mentality with this, and I run into it with all sorts of issues, including like politics, like real issues.

203
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 People go, "Oh, no, no. Research it, and once you research it, you'll believe exactly like I do."

204
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 And the problem is that people, you're always going to bring your own person to your research.

205
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 We may use the exact same research tools, and you may come to a different conclusion than I can. I do.

206
00:19:49,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 The problem is that if I do do the research, do do, if I do do the research and I come to a different conclusion, then I'm just a shill, or I don't get it, I didn't look too much into it.

207
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 So these people are always like, "Just research it, just research it, you'll come to the same conclusion."

208
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 I did research it. And whenever I go into a conspiracy theory, I try to keep an open mind, and generally I view it as, I don't know anything about this subject.

209
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 So if I knew nothing, if I did not know that the Earth was a globe, if I was never taught that before, based on the information I'm receiving, would I believe it?

210
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 And I do that with all conspiracy theories. I give them a fair shake. And I do with ghost stories, I do with Bigfoot, whatever.

211
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 I'll give you a fair shake. So when I was first looking into Flat Earth, they're like, "Listen the way there should be a curvature of the Earth, but these people have done these models, where they stick sticks in the ground.

212
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 They run these ropes, and it should be like an 8 foot drop-off, and it's not there." And I'm like, "Hmm, okay, yeah. I guess, I mean, yeah, I guess that makes sense.

213
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Then, you know, water finds its level, water finds its level, that's a big thing." And I'm like, "Well, yeah, I guess, you know, the ocean, it looks relatively flat."

214
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 And they're like, "You know that the windows in the plane are concave, so if you look in your fisheye lens, okay, yeah, yeah."

215
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 So I do the research, and I keep an open mind when I'm really doing it. The thing is then what I do is then I research the arguments to their points.

216
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Because the fact is, is I'm not a geographer, I'm not a mathematician. So if someone says, "If you stick sticks on the ground and you see no dip, and that means the world's not curved,"

217
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 and I go, "I personally can't argue with them." So then I go, "Well, I'm going to find someone who knows what they're talking about, who argues that, and we'll see what they come up with."

218
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 And so then I look at the other people, and they're saying, "The earth is so big that you're not, you're basically, your math is wrong."

219
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 But if you stick sticks from the ground and ropes, you're not going to see a drop-off because we imagine earth is smaller than it is.

220
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 So I go, "Okay, so again, I keep an open mind when I hear it. When I come across an argument that I don't have the facts to refute myself, I'll find someone else.

221
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 And if the other person is not giving me the right, if I look at whether the other person, and then I'll look back at the conspiracy argument for them refuting those points, and very rarely can they.

222
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 You have the conspiracy, you have the skeptic, and the conspiracy, a lot of times, then they go back and they're like, "You're just the shill, you're just the shill."

223
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 And that doesn't happen all the time. Sometimes the skeptics are wrong, and the conspiracy theorists do have a good answer for the skeptics, and that's when we're kind of back to square one.

224
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 But 90% of conspiracy theorists can be now. This is where he's doing, this is the part of his story where he's doing his research, to do his research.

225
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 And that's a big part of the problem here, because they're saying, you know, the videos are fake.

226
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 One of their arguments is that all of NASA's stuff is fake. Here, watch this video. This video is the truth, though, what I'm telling you is the truth.

227
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 Everything else is fake, and again, it goes back, you know, the idea of fake news has been around much longer than the term has been, obviously.

228
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 If NASA is faking videos, and then someone says, "Here's my video, that's the truth." The first question you should ask is, "Well, how do I know you're not faking it?"

229
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 How do I know you're not making this stuff up? And the fact of the matter is, is you can set anyone down, people who don't have a good understanding of something,

230
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 you can have them watch videos, primarily videos, books and magazines will do too, but if people don't have a strong knowledge base of something, you can show them videos on things,

231
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 and that's really the first exposure they're being given. We're not taught in school, we're taught in school the world is round.

232
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 And that's kind of it. Unless you're going, you know, a geology major or a science major and you're going to have classes that will go, or astronomy,

233
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 it goes more into the formation of planets and things like that, for the most part, they don't spend a whole amount of time on how we know the Earth is flat,

234
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 because it's not a subject that really needs to be talked about. This guy who says he didn't believe in a flat Earth before, which is probably true,

235
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 and someone told him about it and he goes, "Whoa, that doesn't make sense, like putting stuff in a line and water finds its level."

236
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 And the guy saying, "Hey man, just research it, that's all I'm asking." So he goes and he watches some YouTube videos, which to be fair, can be very convincing if you don't have a firm grasp on any subject.

237
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 I don't know a ton about guns, so if I started watching videos and they're like, "Yeah, you know this AR-15, it can fire a thousand rounds per second with this extra additional thing,"

238
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 I'd be like, "Okay, I don't know." And then I would repeat that information to a friend of mine who knows about guns and they're like, "Dude, you're an idiot, that gun, that's impossible, the barrel would melt,"

239
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 and I go, "Oh, okay." Because I don't know a lot about how guns work, and I'm sure a bunch of you people out there are going like, "They're not called guns, they're not called that, they're called rifles or weapons or whatever."

240
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 But so that's the thing, if I sit down, or if I'm, you know, I don't know a lot about the base subject, so a video that comes across in a professional manner can convince me.

241
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 Now here's the big thing, we're going to jump ahead to the end of this song, because this is the important part.

242
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 So the question always is, whenever you talk to someone from who's flat earth or in trust me, there's more of them out there than you think.

243
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 A recent survey said 20% of millennials don't know whether or not the earth is round.

244
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 20% of millennials. So there's a lot more, and they'll say, "Hey man, I'm just asking questions, I'm just asking questions."

245
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 But anyway, so the question always, this is always your best rebuttal for this, is why would they lie about the earth being round?

246
00:25:45,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 Why, what would be the point of that lie? And this gentleman here, Flat Earth Man, tells us, gives us the answer, and this is what I hear a lot from these flat earth people, of why NASA, it's NASA-like conspiracy, they hate NASA, so let's play this.

247
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 Nice face, it's very, very irritating to watch.

248
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 But anyway, so that is the answer generally, is Flat Earthers go, NASA's hiding it, because if the world was a disk, the world was just a disk and it didn't match the physical properties that we've been being told, then God would have had to create that disk.

249
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 It would be proof of God, if we were living on a disk. You say that we're on a ball in the middle of a black universe, spinning around in a solar system within a galaxy, and we're just nothingness.

250
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 And if we were a disk, that's proof of God. Okay, uh-huh, yeah.

251
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 I'll accept that concept, but here's the thing.

252
00:26:45,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 Why, if the Catholic Church, this might be controversial, but the Catholic Church is much older than NASA, religion is much older than NASA, the idea that the earth is round,

253
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 has been around far, far longer than most civilizations, definitely longer than NASA, NASA didn't make it up.

254
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 We knew that it was round for, you know, a thousand years. You hear stories that people used to believe the earth was flat, and that's really not true.

255
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 Well, I mean, we're talking Romans may have thought the earth was flat, but once you got, and even then that's debatable, because once you had to start sailing, we definitely knew the world was round by the time we were sailing the oceans.

256
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 That was kind of the whole point of going, they'd watch ships go over the horizon, they'd come, they were trying to get to India, they're trying to circumnavigate everything.

257
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 They didn't necessarily know how big it was, but there were theories, and they were actually very close.

258
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 Mathematically, they were able to figure out how big the world was, because they knew it was round.

259
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 Here's the thing. There was a book written by the guy who wrote Iqabahd Crane.

260
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 I don't remember that guy's name, and I don't remember the name of the book, because I'm just kind of riffing off the top of my head, but anyways, in the book, he, it was basically a guy wrote like a fake history of New York.

261
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 It was a comedy book, and in that book, it was written like the 1800s, it was written around the time of Sleepy Hollow.

262
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 And so in the book, he states that, "Oh, people in the past used to believe the earth was flat, and they'd fall off of it."

263
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 And people back then knew that was fake, and they thought it was funny that someone could be so stupid to think the world was flat.

264
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 Now we believe, we tell people, "You know we used to think the world was flat, we didn't know it was round until we sent satellites up into space, and then we could see it."

265
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 So it's where they're getting their information. They always knew it was round.

266
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 At any point when we started doing mathematics, at any point when we started exploring, we knew the earth was round.

267
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 You could go up onto mountains and see the curvature of the earth, you could measure stuff, and you could estimate the circumference of the planet.

268
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 They weren't idiots, and they could look up in the sky and see round planets.

269
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 But anyways, my point being is that flat earthers believe that if it turned out that we were on a dysthebby proof of God, if that was the case, then why didn't any sort of major religion,

270
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 whether it be Islam, or Christianity, or Judaism, or the Catholic Church, the Protestant Church, or whatever, basically say, "The earth is flat, the earth is always in flat."

271
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 If you believe it's round, you're going to hell, like they could have put that in it, because they have a vested interest in proving the existence of God.

272
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 So if their concept is right, if NASA is some sort of satanic, illuminating conspiracy, they're a little late to the game, because they only got started 60 years ago.

273
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 People knew the world was round before then, and you had organizations that have vested interest that if they could prove the world was flat,

274
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 therefore God exists, which I don't believe that concept anyways, necessarily.

275
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 If the world was flat, you could see, if we were born in a universe where we knew the world was flat, and we sent a satellite up and it hit the roof,

276
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 then they would just go, "Well, that's just the way the universe..."

277
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 They could still argue for a big bang or anything like that, they just say it worked out differently.

278
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 That's my... you know, when you talk to Flat Earthers and they bring up the thing like, "It's a NASA lie, it's a NASA lie."

279
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 The best answer for them is, "But NASA's only 60 years old."

280
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 What were they doing before that?

281
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 And they'll be like, "Well, they used to believe the earth was round, and then you..."

282
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 I mean, they used to believe the earth was flat, and then you question them, "Prove that to me."

283
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 "Show me any historical records where they say the earth was flat."

284
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 "Well, the Bible said the four corners of the world, well, okay, is the world a square?"

285
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 "No, it's a disk."

286
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 "Have you ever seen a disk with corners?"

287
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 "No."

288
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 I'm straw-manning it, obviously.

289
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 There was a Flat Earther in front of me, they would be coming back with better points, but the end result would be the same.

290
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 Because they always go to the four corners of the earth's argument.

291
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 And to be fair, you know...

292
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 Anyways, it can get frustrating because you're running around in circles with them,

293
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 but that's the thing you have to...

294
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 You can't argue with them scientifically, because I don't have the technology to fly up into space,

295
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 and they don't have the technology to fly into space,

296
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 and this kind of goes when you're arguing any conspiracy theory.

297
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 They're going to throw out facts and numbers to you,

298
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 and what you have to do is you have to question the root cause.

299
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 If the conspiracy theory is controlled demolition for 9/11,

300
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 your question is...

301
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 My question always is, I'll let someone tell me all about 9/11,

302
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 I'll say, "If the government...

303
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 If the US government was behind 9/11, why?"

304
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 And they'll say, "Well, because they wanted to invade Afghanistan and Iraq, they wanted to have war for oil."

305
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 That's the general thing.

306
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 They wanted to create a police state, things like that.

307
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 My next question is, because all I do is ask questions,

308
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 my next question is, "If the government faked 9/11, if it was controlled demolition,

309
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 why did they have 17 of the 19 hijackers from Saudi Arabia?"

310
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 Wouldn't it have been easier to have three hijackers from North Korea,

311
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 five hijackers from Iraq, and six hijackers or whatever the remaining ones from Afghanistan and Iran?

312
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 That was the axis of evil.

313
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 If they're making it up, they can make up whatever they want.

314
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 They could say, "Yeah, North Korea, Iraq, and Iran, and Afghanistan all worked together on this."

315
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 Why, if they're making it up, why put 16, 17 people from Saudi Arabia in allied country?

316
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 I've never had a conspiracy theorist be able to answer that question.

317
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 So when they say, "Research everything," I'm going to go back to question everything.

318
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 Question what they're telling you, what the conspiracy theorist is telling you.

319
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 Question what the skeptic is telling you.

320
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 And all you're doing is asking questions, and you'll almost always get to the actual truth of the matter.

321
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 And to me, that is the most fascinating thing.

322
