00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
 mysterious purple spheres found all over the world,

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:10,640
 and a book that caused the Soviet Union to purge authors is now available on Amazon. Today on Dead

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:20,240
 Rabbit Radio. Welcome back to Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,120
 day. Hope you're having a great day. Hope you're having a lot of fun this week. A lot of cool things

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,360
 going on, I'm sure. I don't know, I'm pretty recorded this episode, so I'm assuming the world is still

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,520
 around. Get ready for my vacation, looking forward to that. I'm gonna have a lot of fun, gonna have

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,160
 some rest. I'll still be doing research, we'll still be recording stuff. We'll see what the

8
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,360
 recording schedule goes, I can't really say for now, but we may end up taking a week off the show

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:52,080
 just to give you a heads up. I don't want to, but you know, I gotta recharge. We're also gonna be

10
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,720
 going into season two soon. It's pretty much gonna be the same. I might fiddle with the intro a bit,

11
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,280
 but we'll see where that goes. We'll see where that goes. So there's this game I like to play.

12
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,760
 It's kind of a mind game with myself. Something I do when I'm bored and I'm out in public. I made

13
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,280
 up this game called Amnesia, and it's pretty stupid, but I have fun doing it. What I'll do is I'll

14
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,560
 walk around, I'll basically establish a time period of when I got Amnesia. So generally it's around

15
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,720
 2001, something around there. I'll have Amnesia, and then I'll walk through the movie department,

16
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,160
 and I'll be like, whoa, wait, what? What's Spider-Man Homecoming? What's this?

17
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,320
 There's a, are you telling me there's a live action Spider-Man movie now?

18
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,720
 And then I'll thank someone who will say, dude, there's like five Spider-Man movies right now.

19
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:50,560
 What? No way! Five Spider-Man movies. What's this? Transformers The Age of Extinction? What?

20
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,080
 Is this real? Yeah, dude, that's like Transformers 4. What? I know, it's a stupid game.

21
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:02,640
 It's a stupid game, but for whatever reason I like playing it, I like walking around the movie

22
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,360
 section and not knowing those movies existed. There's something about watching a movie for the

23
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:15,360
 first time that you only get like a single time, obviously. Like, you can say the first time you

24
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,000
 saw, there's movies that you watch and you're like, how, how did I not watch this movie decades ago?

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,160
 And it's harder to appreciate with new movies when you go see Infinity War, you're like, well,

26
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,920
 I saw that opening night, that was great. But like, I saw Alien for the first time maybe five years ago,

27
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,960
 and I was just completely blown away. I saw Return of the Dead, which is one of my favorite movies.

28
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:44,560
 I think it's probably one of the best zombie movies. It's at least, it's tied with the dawn of the dead

29
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:52,400
 remake, but Return of the Living Dead. I saw for the first time maybe in like 2005, and it's crazy

30
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,960
 how well those movies hold up. Like, I love that movie and I have like an Onita medical supply shirt.

31
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:04,400
 I mean, I really love that movie. I love the way it looks. I love the storyline. I knew of it as a

32
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,400
 kid, but it looked too scary to watch. And so it's not the nostalgia factor. It is this great movie

33
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,040
 that is just timeless. And the same thing with Alien. Like, it was too scary for me to watch as a

34
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,480
 kid. It came out when I was an infant, but even when I was like growing up, I was like, no, you

35
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,240
 know, I'll watch Aliens. That looks, you know, that's action packed, but Alien's creepy. Alien looks

36
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,840
 too scary for me. And the thing is, is like that movie also holds up so well that you can watch it

37
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:41,520
 for the very first time in 2012 and be like, this is an amazing movie. This is one of the best horror

38
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,640
 movies I've ever seen. The thing, the one issue I have with Alien is that when you watch it now,

39
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,400
 it may be different because all the prequels to Prometheus and all that stuff, but when you

40
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,560
 watch the first Alien now, you know Ripley doesn't die. So the whole last half hour with her running

41
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,000
 through the ship, you're kind of like, well, you know, she's in four other movies. So I know she

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,040
 doesn't die. So that last act, it falls a little flat because I know she goes on to do sequels,

43
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,120
 but it's still really intense. You know, the ending still is really good. It just doesn't have that

44
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,960
 suspense to it. She died in the original version. The Alien, in the original draft, the Alien eats

45
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:32,000
 her head and then picks up the radio and says, I'm coming back to Earth in her voice. And I'm

46
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,200
 really glad they cut that out. One thing I'm glad, one thing I wish they hadn't cut out,

47
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:43,200
 one of my fears is turning into something else, like morphine into a tree or morphine into like,

48
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:49,040
 like a raccoon or something like that. It's this weird fear I have. I mean, it's completely irrational.

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,880
 But in the original and the director's cut of Alien, we're in the deleted scenes, I guess I should

50
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,440
 say, we find out that the eggs that the facehuggers come out of are actually humans or other life

51
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,200
 forms that melt into an egg. And they're basically the facehuggers. That's the life cycle. An Alien,

52
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:13,600
 just a standard foot trooper Alien grabs you, does something to you and melt, you melt and you turn

53
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,000
 into an egg and then you just sit there dormant for a thousand years until someone opens you up.

54
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,480
 That would have been a hundred times more terrifying than like a queen alien laying eggs. The idea that

55
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,840
 those hundreds and hundreds of eggs we saw in the first Alien, to think that that was all of those

56
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,760
 were previous Alien people, and they all melted into these eggs and the Alien put them there.

57
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:43,120
 That's far more Alien to me than basically in the second one, the Aliens became like insectoids.

58
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,080
 And they had like a queen who laid eggs and stuff like that. In the deleted scene, Dallas, who is

59
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:55,680
 the captain of the ship, is melting into an egg. He's melting into an egg and he's begging

60
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:03,520
 Ripley. He's like, "Kill me. Kill me." And you would just watch him like slowly melt and you see

61
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,840
 another crew member who was taken to the very beginning. He's like almost all egg and she

62
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,240
 flamethrowers him. That's way more terrifying and again way more Alien. Making them insectoids is

63
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,760
 something that's relatable to on earth. But so, Ridley Scott, you should have went with your

64
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:23,760
 original vision. Let's go ahead and start the show. You know, so we're going to look at two stories

65
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:29,360
 today like we normally do. Actually, I want to make a quick note. So a couple episodes back,

66
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,040
 I was talking about sugar babies and sugar daddies and salt daddies. And when I was doing that, of

67
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:40,720
 course, I was looking up the history of the sugar babies and the sugar daddy and the sugar mama.

68
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,480
 There used to be a sugar mama candy. These are all candy. Sugar babies are the little

69
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,520
 brown caramel things. The sugar daddy was like a caramel bar, like a caramel popsicle.

70
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:59,760
 The sugar daddy was originally called the Papa Suck. The Papa Suck. So good name change. Whoever

71
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:06,560
 said, "Hey, let's not call this Papa Suck because that just sounds creepy. Let's rename it to

72
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,960
 sugar daddy." So good on them. I just wanted to include that piece of trivia. I kept trying to

73
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,280
 figure out a way to fit that in an episode. So I'm just cramming it in here. So we're going to

74
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,720
 talk about two stories today. They're both fairly interesting. One has been resolved and one,

75
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,160
 they just, I've looked all over for a rational answer to this, like a confirmation of a rational

76
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,920
 answer. We haven't gotten it. We're going to go ahead and start with the one that's been resolved.

77
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,600
 And what we're going to look at today comes from the conspiracy list that we look at all the time,

78
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:39,920
 the iceberg conspiracy list. On that list, there is listed something called the Black Book. Now,

79
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,280
 it's a very generic term and you know, you're not really going to pull up anything for that. But I

80
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,280
 was pointed in the right direction by somebody. What it is in reference to is the Black Book of

81
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:59,280
 Soviet Jewry, J-E-W-R-Y, like Jews. So the big Black Book of Soviet Jewry is an interesting book

82
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:06,160
 on multiple levels. One, it's in what it is is interesting. And then two, the path that took

83
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,720
 to being published is interesting as well. So what it is was that during the Soviet Union,

84
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,080
 during World War II, I guess I should say, in the Soviet Union, the war was going on and the

85
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:22,640
 Soviet Union got a couple Jewish authors and they go, we want to know what the Germans are doing to

86
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:29,200
 the Jewish populations of what's going on. We want to have an account of what is going on in

87
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:34,960
 Germany as we're moving through. We want you to interview survivors of camps because the

88
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,520
 governments knew about the camps. We want to find out what they were doing. So the Jewish authors

89
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:45,840
 were like, oh, that's great. And the Soviet Union had had a reasoning for this. They wanted to use

90
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,800
 it as a propaganda tool so they could enlist, they could help get allies and say, look, we're

91
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,800
 fighting for these poor Jewish people as well. Like they're trying to get the Western Jews to say,

92
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,160
 we need to have Stalin as a good ally. He's on our side. So these Jewish authors began asking

93
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,040
 soldiers to send accounts, ask to gather any documents out of the camps, any documents that

94
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,240
 they find and send them over to them. And they were going out not necessarily to the front lines,

95
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,240
 but they were going out after these battles and collecting these documents of what was going on.

96
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:26,480
 And they got a lot of diaries. They found poetry written on cigarette paper in these

97
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,600
 camps. They're getting first-hand accounts from soldiers, from survivors, and they're compiling

98
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,760
 all this information. And they're like, oh, this is really bad. We really got messed up over here.

99
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,600
 Germany was really giving it to the Jews. And what happened was they eventually compiled most of it.

100
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,080
 And when they came back and they gave it to the Soviet government, they looked at it and go,

101
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:54,080
 no, no, that's not really what we're looking for. And the problem was that because as the Germans

102
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:00,160
 moved west or east, sorry, this is not going to be another Leningrad mistake, as the Germans were

103
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,880
 moving east and they're taking over areas, you would have people in those areas say, oh yeah,

104
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,640
 no, we'll help you take on these Jews. We don't like them either. So you had some of the reports

105
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:17,360
 implicating now Soviet members, members of the Soviet Union, as Soviet Union was now moving west,

106
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,800
 taking over territory, some of the accounts made those people look bad. The other thing was that

107
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:29,920
 the Soviet Union didn't like that the book showed that the Jewish people were getting treated worse

108
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,840
 by the Germans than Russians or Ukrainians or Romanians or anything like that. They felt like

109
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:42,640
 the book heightened their pain over the others, which, you know, makes sense for multiple reasons

110
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,120
 why what specialized that the least of the reasons being that that was kind of the impetus of the

111
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,560
 book and the authors were Jewish. What happened was the Soviet Union during this time period,

112
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,400
 we're in like the late 40s, early 50s, they began purging doing their own purge of quote,

113
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,880
 unquote, "cosmopolitans," which was their code word for Jewish people. And a lot of people who

114
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,880
 worked on this anti-fascist committee who was putting this book together were getting purged out.

115
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:15,760
 The main author was kind of traveling the world. He wasn't part of that, but he constantly feared

116
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,800
 whenever he went back home that he was going to get arrested, he was going to get purged.

117
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,280
 What's really interesting about it was at one point, so the Soviet Union at this point is not

118
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,560
 interested in it, and the notes, the book was actually like compiled and ready to print. They're

119
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,240
 like, "No, we don't want it." So the book starts moving around, all the notes start moving around

120
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,000
 from this place to that place, they end up in a museum, they come back, they're getting damaged,

121
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,880
 they're getting worn out, they become illegible. So a lot of the work they put into this stuff,

122
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,000
 these documents that they got started to decay because they're moving around so much. Some people

123
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,280
 are like, you know, they don't want the Soviets to destroy them, so they move them here, they move

124
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:56,320
 them there. At one point, they sent them all to Jerusalem to newly found the Jerusalem. And the

125
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,920
 publishers in Jerusalem looked at it and they go, "You know, this book really has a lot of stories

126
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,480
 about how great Stalin is," because the author was a big fan of Stalin, even though he was afraid

127
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,120
 of being purged. They're looking at the book and they go, "Well, you know, there's a bunch of stuff

128
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,680
 in here about what a great guy Stalin is. There's a bunch of stuff in here about how non-Jews are

129
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:20,640
 helping Jews." And they're like, "This isn't for us either. It's not specific enough about the Jewish

130
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:26,160
 plight during that time. It has all this other Soviet Union propaganda in it." And so at this

131
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,160
 point, the author is between a rock and a hard space because he's put all this research into it

132
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,600
 and doesn't know what to do with it. Nobody wants to publish it. At one point,

133
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,880
 he did have some publishers come to him and say, "We want to publish it in English and French

134
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,080
 and German and all this stuff." And the author goes, "Are you going to publish it in Russian?" And

135
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:47,600
 they said, "No, we're not going to publish it in Russian." So he refused to release the files. He

136
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:56,080
 felt that this book needed to be read in Russia. He said it was very important to the Soviet Union.

137
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:01,600
 It's a collection of these stories. It's a collection of these accounts that anyone who's

138
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:09,200
 looked into the Holocaust has heard before, not necessarily verbatim, but this same style.

139
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,720
 There was one story that was just sad. I mean, they're all fairly sad, obviously. But I thought

140
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:22,640
 this one and just, you know, what's interesting about the book is because it's a collection

141
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:29,200
 of writings. Some are more literate than others. Some are children's diaries. And some are written

142
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,080
 by professional authors who went out and investigated these things. So you'd have a poem next to a

143
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:41,280
 journalist account of a survivor. I did come across this one. I thought it was interesting. So

144
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,960
 you had a mother who had to hide her husband in the basement in the cellar. So it wasn't like a

145
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,000
 basement and it was so cramped he couldn't stand up. He's underneath there. He was down there for

146
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,360
 two years. He's like, you had to move the stove aside and he would pop up. His kids and even

147
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:04,080
 even though he was down there, they were afraid that the kids would say something. And she kept him

148
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:08,800
 down there. And at one point she got sick with typhus. The mother got sick with typhus. So she

149
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,240
 went, she was taken to the hospital. The kids were taken to the neighbor. And at night, this guy who

150
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,720
 had been in this basement all this time, there was no food there because the people who would

151
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,520
 normally bring the food in are gone. He began eating wallpaper. That's something that happened

152
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:29,760
 in a lot of siege situations. The glue behind the paper can actually have some sort of sustenance.

153
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,440
 They were doing that in Leningrad as well. They're eating the wallpaper. They're eating their shoes

154
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,320
 because shoes used to be made of leather. You can like cook a stew out of the glue from the wallpaper.

155
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,360
 And he would crawl back down there during the day. And again, it was so small he couldn't

156
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,680
 lay down. He couldn't stand up. He was just crunched over. And what happened was in September

157
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:54,720
 of 1943, the Red Army showed up outside the town that he was in. And the Germans put up a

158
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,520
 strong fight in this town. And at one point, armed Germans were like right outside the house,

159
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:04,320
 loading their guns, shooting, taking fire and stuff like that. And he's in the house

160
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,400
 and the battle's going on. And when the woman finally gets out of the hospital,

161
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,000
 she got out of the hospital and she took her kids and like everyone else, they kind of fled

162
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,600
 into the forest to stay away from the battle. And when she came back to her village, she came

163
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:25,360
 back to her house. The house is burned down. And she goes to, you know, go through the ashes. And

164
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,960
 he was still in the basement. He had suffocated. And he died two days before the town was liberated

165
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:36,720
 by the Soviets. So it was just one of the accounts that was an account that a journalist,

166
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,440
 a Soviet Union journalist, got from these front lines of this fighting. Just, you know,

167
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,040
 again, just another horrible event that happens in war. So at this point, this book

168
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,480
 as complete as it can be, generally it's called the complete black book of Soviet Jewry or Russian

169
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,120
 Jewry. It is available on Amazon. You can pick it up. I actually kind of scrolled through it.

170
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:03,120
 It was a little bit too dense for me to get into, to get into the podcast, you know,

171
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,200
 basically to fit into 20 minutes, but I was looking through it. And it is those first hand

172
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:12,400
 accounts. And a lot of the accounts come from the death camps that were on the Soviet side.

173
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,400
 On lighter news, this is a story I've been looking at for, for honestly, probably about

174
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:21,920
 two or three weeks. It's been a story that I've been bumping up episodes because I can't find

175
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,360
 the information that I want on it. This is also from the conspiracy list. So you're getting a

176
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:34,720
 double header today. Today's episode, I mean, today's story is about purple spheres. Now,

177
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,880
 what purple spheres are is there's these little purple jellies that have appeared in random places

178
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:47,680
 around the world. Now, not that might be overselling it in a few gardens and in the middle of the

179
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:53,120
 desert, they'll find these piles of these little jelly spheres. And there have been a couple news

180
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,120
 reports in Arizona because there's just like this pile of it sitting out in the quote unquote middle

181
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,040
 of nowhere. I don't know how far it is off the road, but it can't really be in the middle of

182
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,720
 nowhere if a news crew keeps driving up there. And there was also a garden in Britain that found

183
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,640
 these fears. Now the guy in Britain says that he looked up in the sky turned yellow and then blue

184
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,800
 and then this gallop of gel fell on his, fell on his front lawn in the desert. They're, they don't

185
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,520
 know where they came from. They're just like, here's a bunch of gels. So at first I'm like, okay,

186
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:27,760
 you know, the first thing was somebody just dropped off some of the like little Orbeez or it's a

187
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,120
 hydrating little ball that you use for plants. You put them in plants and they slowly release water.

188
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,640
 The problem is, is that a lot of these stories are from like 2012. The British story definitely

189
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,600
 is from 2012. The Arizona story is farther back. And what this is the way it'll normally work.

190
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:50,400
 They'll have a report on the initial incident where we found these jellies. They'll have the

191
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,360
 report on the initial incident saying we found these jellies and we don't know what they are.

192
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,080
 And then you'll get a follow-up article and they'll send them to a lab and the lab will go, well,

193
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,640
 it's not, we know what it's not. It's not a living matter. It's not any sort of egg,

194
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,680
 but we're going to send it in for chemical testing. And then there's never a follow-up story.

195
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,960
 It's really bizarre. And generally, like I said, I go into these conspiracies believing them. So

196
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,360
 generally I'll go to sites that prove this stuff or talk about this stuff as if it's real, if it's

197
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,800
 like alien eggs or some sort of bioweapon or some sort of like life form that we don't know of.

198
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:32,160
 And then I will go and I'll type in, I'll type in purple spheres debunked. And even the debunking

199
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,760
 sites, you're like, yeah, yeah, they're fake. They're just these Orbeez probably. But they,

200
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,800
 they never have anything either. And all of the articles that go, we sent them off to testing.

201
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:49,360
 I mean, it's been six, seven years since the ones in Britain were sent to testing and we never,

202
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,400
 I can't find any analysis of the testing coming back and say, oh yeah, they're totally, totally

203
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,560
 fake. Even when they sent off Bigfoot fur, you'll generally get the article saying it's Bigfoot

204
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:03,440
 fur. Then you'll find another article where they're like, we tested it, or we're sending it to testing

205
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,280
 and then you'll get a third article saying it's wolf hair. But all of these articles in just was

206
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,320
 going, oh, we know what it's not. It's not eggs. We're sending them off to testing. An interesting

207
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,800
 thing is some people think that they're falling out of airplanes or falling from the sky, but they

208
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:22,560
 are always in like a clump on the ground. And generally when things fall from the sky, obviously,

209
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:27,760
 they have a scattering effect. If an object is moving, it's not going to drop it in one clump.

210
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,160
 And looking at the photo of the one in Arizona, which is, you know, the video footage,

211
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,480
 it is just one clump. And honestly, it looks like a car pulled up and they threw a bunch of stuff

212
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,360
 out into the middle of the desert. So that's my first inclination. And the thing is, is you look

213
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,000
 down and you go, oh no, it's alien eggs. When it could be a bunch of Orbeez, which is like a child's

214
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,520
 toy, or it could be, you know, the water plant stuff. If I was driving on the street and I found

215
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,840
 a packet of empty Doritos on the ground, I'm not going to think, whoa, aliens dropped this here.

216
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,680
 I'm going to go, oh, someone probably threw it outside of their car. It's because these things

217
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:05,760
 don't look normal. We think it's something abnormal. But on the flip side, if you've never seen a

218
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,320
 Doritos bag before, you had no idea what they were. That's sad because they're delicious.

219
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,160
 And you found them, you would send them a testing and they would go, dude, it's a Doritos bag.

220
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,720
 Like they would get back to you. So I don't know why these stories keep hitting with a dead end.

221
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,480
 If you know anything else about these purple spheres, if you know anything I don't know,

222
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:30,720
 you know, definitely let me know. But at this point, I think they probably are some sort of just

223
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,480
 over-the-counter product just because of where they're found and how they're just looks like someone

224
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,240
 just dumped them there. But again, I think it's weird that we're never getting any conclusive

225
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,080
 stays. It would be something that somebody should say, oh, you know, those are Orbeez. Like I work

226
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:50,400
 for Orbeez. We had the person who wrote that the niece of the person who wrote Bernstein Bears

227
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,600
 come out and say the Mandela effect isn't real. Like these people can interact with

228
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,240
 the media when these stories come up. So why no one from a company has said that's not

229
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,440
 fake. That's ours. We can show you exactly what they are. But the stories just all kind of disappear

230
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,400
 until the next batch is found. So I'm putting this in the still weird category. Like I said,

231
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,000
 I've been researching this story a lot and I was really hoping to find something else and

232
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:21,520
 nothing's popping up. So we're putting purple spheres in most likely some sort of

233
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:29,360
 just dump. Some human just dump stuff out of their car. But this might be something more than that

234
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,200
 until we get more information. It's in the up in the air category. But I'll let you know if I

235
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:39,040
 find anything else. And if you find anything else, hit me up. DeadRabbitRadio@gmail.com

236
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,920

237
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:51,600
 in the video for the Arizona report story. The reporter is so hot, dude. Not like the

238
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,160
 reporter is okay. I shouldn't say the reporter is okay looking. The reporter on the ground is

239
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:03,520
 attractive. But the like the anchor woman, oh dude, she's super hot. I think if anything,

240
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,880
 that was the best part about researching that story. So you look like one of those

241
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:14,640
 like no nonsense ex cheerleader blondes. She's really hot. Okay, anyways, facebook.com/deadrabbitradio
