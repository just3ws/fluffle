1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,160
 Is it possible that the genre of K-pop will save the world?

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,520
 And then we cover a far less fun story.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:16,280
 Is there any truth to the rumors that children are being snatched off the streets in Morocco

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,760
 and given a choice?

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:24,800
 Tell us where the genie's treasure is, or we will murder you today on Dead Rabbit

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:31,800
 Radio.

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,800
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,800
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,800
 It's a great combination of stories.

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,800
 We've got a little bit of salt, a little bit of sugar.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,800
 I don't know why I decided to describe it as that.

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,800
 It's just a nice combination.

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,800
 We've got a dark one, we've got a light one.

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,800
 But also a combination of the darkness and the light is our newest painter on some order.

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,800
 He's coming in as an immortal being, half shadow, half light.

17
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,800
 Jonathan Vaca, everyone give a round of applause to the entity known as Jonathan Vaca.

18
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:05,800
 Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-

19
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:25,800
 He's no longer like a chocolate and vanilla yogurt flowing in.

20
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,800
 If you can't support the patreon, that's fine too.

21
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,800
 Just helps to hear the word about the show really helps out a lot.

22
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,800
 We also have a merch store, which I never mentioned.

23
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,800
 It's in the show notes.

24
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,800
 There's a lot of really cool merch there.

25
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:42,800
 So Jonathan, let's go ahead and give you the keys to the dead rabbit dirgeable.

26
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,800
 We're going to leave behind dead rabbit command.

27
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,800
 We are headed out to a place we've been to a lot on this show, Korea.

28
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,800
 *Burps*

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,800
 Jonathan is flying us over to Korea.

30
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,800
 We're walking around the dead rabbit dirgeable and we're going to talk a bit about K-pop.

31
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,800
 Now I know what you're thinking.

32
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,800
 Really? Really Jason? Is that what we're talking about?

33
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,800
 I'm going to tell you this.

34
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,800
 I don't listen to a lot of the newer stuff, but I'm straight up hipster.

35
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,800
 I listened to K-pop before it was popular.

36
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,800
 I actually started listening to Wonder Girls back when they came out back in 2007.

37
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,800
 Little know and think.

38
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,800
 You guys know I've been researching conspiracy theories for like 30 years.

39
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,800
 The Wonder Girls got caught up in a lot of Illuminati theories.

40
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,800
 There's a lot of websites that did not like the Wonder Girls.

41
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,800
 They were posting videos of them like, "What? These Wonder Girls? What? They're not so wonderful. They're just human.

42
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,800
 They're just you and me."

43
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
 They made a video. I'll put it in the show notes.

44
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
 I don't remember the name of it off the top of my head.

45
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,800
 But they made a video where they're like, "We are robot people."

46
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,800
 And it's not like that was in the lyrics.

47
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,800
 But it has this video of these girls dancing around and then their bodies are like mechanical.

48
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,800
 And the anti Illuminati, anti transhumanist movement in the conspiracy theories went nuts over this video.

49
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,800
 Look at them. They're trying to turn us into robots.

50
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,800
 See these seven or however many they're worth, their line of keys changing?

51
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,800
 These seven Asian women. That's the future of the world.

52
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,800
 I'm like, "Okay, that's fine with me. They're pretty cool looking robots."

53
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,800
 People are like, "What? This music's going to brainw-."

54
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,800
 It's actually now that I started to say that it's really funny.

55
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,800
 The thing was is that this music was going to take over.

56
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
 We can't have it happen.

57
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,800
 And the last I had heard, because I was listening, I think I downloaded some of it as well.

58
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,800
 Legally. That's why I shipped from side to side.

59
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,800
 But there wasn't a huge K-pop market back then.

60
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
 Not like it was today.

61
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,800
 And I remember the last I heard of them, they were being taken over by Robot Factory.

62
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,800
 Cyber9 had bought their record label.

63
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,800
 And I'm like, "No."

64
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,800
 Now the last I had heard of them is the Jonas Brothers were going on tour and they picked them as the opening act.

65
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,800
 And I remember thinking, "Good for them. I hope the Wonder Girls have a big career."

66
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,800
 I don't know how big Korean pop music will be in America, but good for them.

67
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,800
 And now fast forward to BTS and K-pop has taken over.

68
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,800
 But the question is, can it save the world?

69
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,800
 There's actually a precedent for that, but we'll get to that in a second.

70
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,800
 Jonathan, you see that DMZ there between North Korea and South Korea.

71
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
 We're going to float perfectly over that.

72
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,800
 I hope you guys write your flag jackets.

73
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,800
 It's pretty treacherous time to be here.

74
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,800
 Because the war never ended between North Korea and South Korea.

75
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,800
 And I'm not going to go into a huge...

76
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,800
 We actually did a whole week on North Korea.

77
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,800
 I'm not going to go into the geopolitical ramifications.

78
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,800
 I think you guys are all pretty well educated.

79
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,800
 Things aren't great in North Korea.

80
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
 Things are pretty good in South Korea.

81
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,800
 I grew up during the Cold War and you would always hear stories about people on the other side of the Berlin Wall

82
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,800
 like getting copies of the Rolling Stones, man.

83
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,800
 USA, rock and roll, smoking camel cigarettes, wearing blue jeans.

84
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,800
 You used Western music, really as a psychological weapon, to help break down

85
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,800
 or build up, in my case I would say, to build up the youth of the East.

86
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,800
 You know what? Freedom rocks. Freedom literally rocks.

87
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,800
 Well, we're seeing the same thing happening with K-pop in North Korea.

88
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
 It's a very, very fascinating story.

89
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,800
 This isn't a click-baity headline or anything like that.

90
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,800
 There's been a lot of really interesting articles written about this.

91
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,800
 Now, you've had South Korean artists go to North Korea and perform music,

92
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,800
 but South Korean music, K-pop music is very colorful and energetic.

93
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,800
 When you see footage of them in North Korea, they're all kind of standing in the line.

94
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,800
 They're singing...they're singing pop music, but it's not how you would see it in South Korea.

95
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,800
 It's very restrictive. It's very performed for their audience

96
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,800
 because in North Korea, the music is people standing in the line singing.

97
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
 They have these huge concerts every once in a while.

98
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:44,800
 They'd been in like a 10-year gap. The first one was around 2008,

99
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,800
 and then they had another one in 2018 where they had all these K-pop stars go to North Korea

100
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,800
 to give this concert.

101
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,800
 But it's controlled exposure.

102
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,800
 Every one of the concerts were party loyalists

103
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,800
 because at the end of the day, music is one of the most powerful movements.

104
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
 It really is.

105
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,800
 Sure, you can look at a painting and go, "That's pretty,"

106
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,800
 but I don't think a painting has ever caused a revolution. I could be wrong on that.

107
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,800
 Painting doesn't really change the way you view the world.

108
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,800
 Right now, there's a hundred art majors snapping their... whatever they use.

109
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,800
 Chalk or charcoal or easels or what. They're just snapping everything around them.

110
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,800
 They're like, "Ah, Sakray Blue!" They're all French.

111
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,800
 Music, though, can change you. Music can change you.

112
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,800
 So you have to be careful if you have a totalitarian regime, how much music gets over there.

113
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,800
 But you want to have... The goal of both North and South Korea is reunification.

114
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,800
 The question is who's in charge afterwards. Both of them want a united Korea.

115
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,800
 North Korea wants South Korea. South Korea wants North Korea.

116
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
 They want to be reunified.

117
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,800
 So they're going to make these motions towards each other,

118
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,800
 but when you're having this state concert, they actually had a hardcore party loyalist in there

119
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,800
 so they don't hear a K-pop song and go, "You know what? Freedom does rock."

120
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,800
 And then immediately leave. Like, the people who are allowed to attend these concerts,

121
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
 they're not going anywhere.

122
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,800
 At the DMZ, where you have all the border guards, what is it, the 38th parallel?

123
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,800
 You have the guards in North Korea, then you have a couple miles of just nothing but land mines

124
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,800
 than the guards in South Korea. South Korea, they started blasting K-pop as some sort of psychological weapon.

125
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,800
 Now, again, I think the guards at the DMZ, we see a person's effect from North Korea from the DMZ,

126
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,800
 once in a blue moon, but they, I would assume as well, are pretty hardcore loyalists.

127
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,800
 But it's the citizens of North Korea. It's the people in the middle of the country

128
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,800
 that are the most... I don't want to say vulnerable because it makes the sounds bad,

129
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,800
 the most open to being changed by this music.

130
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,800
 There's an underground musical resistance going on in North Korea

131
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,800
 where flash drives of K-pop songs are smuggled into the country.

132
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,800
 Because when people defect from North Korea, and they're being asked about why you did it

133
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,800
 and how they did it, there's a North Korean guy, he's disguised as a South Korean guy,

134
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,800
 he's like, "Hey, uh, yeah, so how'd you do that? Can you tell me all about it?"

135
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,800
 He's wearing a little thing that says "press," but he spelt it wrong because they don't have any free press in North Korea.

136
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:21,800
 They interview these people, and then they arrest that North Korean spy, and then he defects as well.

137
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,800
 So when they interview people who've defected, one of the main reasons why they defected was music.

138
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,800
 They go, "I heard the music. I heard Western music. I heard K-pop music."

139
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,800
 And I realize something was wrong.

140
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,800
 That's one of the biggest common denominators of why people defect.

141
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,800
 Some of them say, "Yeah, my family got arrested. I had to leave."

142
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,800
 Other people say, "I was going to get arrested. Some people made defect for business opportunities."

143
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,800
 But one of the main underlying factors that cuts across everything is music.

144
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:59,800
 If you're caught listening to K-pop for a child, six months to a year of ideological training,

145
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,800
 they're going to send you to a camp. They're going to brainwash you to not like that music.

146
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,800
 Could you -- and it's interesting because I'm talking about these facts, but I want you to put your cells in the --

147
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,800
 could you imagine, right, whatever your favorite type of music is?

148
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,800
 You're into jazz. You're into bluegrass. You're into grindcore.

149
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:25,800
 And all of a sudden the authorities come to you and say, "Because of the music you like is not approved by us,

150
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,800
 you have to go to jail for a year, and we're going to teach you to hate that music."

151
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:35,800
 That music that you love so much that invigorates you when you listen to it.

152
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,800
 It makes you feel not alone. That's illegal.

153
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:45,800
 Now, you may choose not to listen to music. You may go, "Oh, I don't really like that music. It's not edifying.

154
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:51,800
 I'm not a big fan of it." But for the government to come in and say, "Your favorite type of music, you can't listen to it."

155
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:58,800
 Now, let's reverse this. Let's say your favorite type of music you've never heard before.

156
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:05,800
 You've heard all other types of music, but the music you love the most you never heard until tomorrow.

157
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:12,800
 You didn't know what country music was. Tomorrow is the first time you're going to hear a Randy Travis song.

158
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,800
 From the twangs and the steel guitar, it would blow your mind.

159
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,800
 You didn't know that was your favorite. You never heard that music before.

160
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,800
 You grew up in a world where country was so forbidden, you didn't even know there was a word for it.

161
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:33,800
 And then one day you find a Hank William Jr. album, and it would fill your soul with so much passion.

162
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,800
 You would do anything to find another one. There was one of these defectors.

163
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:43,800
 She said she watched the same music video over and over and over again for hours.

164
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,800
 It was the only one she had. That music opened her soul up.

165
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,800
 It's just fascinating and sad, really.

166
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:57,800
 The segment's turning a lot more depressing than I had it in my head, but they didn't even know this music existed.

167
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,800
 And you have this young kid who hears Wonder Girls.

168
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,800
 And to us, it's just bubblegum pop. I was like, "Oh, you know, this is the inch I like pop music anyways."

169
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,800
 It's a new type of pop music I'm interested in. To someone who had never heard pop before.

170
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:21,800
 Nothing. This blows their mind, and it actually makes them want to risk everything to listen to it, six months to a year.

171
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:30,800
 Now, that's if they're a kid. If they're an adult, it can be lifetime in prison for listening to K-pop.

172
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:39,800
 What K-pop is trying to do, what K-pop can do, is break the back of the authoritarian regime of North Korea.

173
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:47,800
 People are actually smuggling the music into the country, and people are risking their lives to listen to this music.

174
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,800
 That a lot of people just dismiss as bubblegum pop.

175
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:59,800
 You roll your eyes when you see them post stuff on Twitter. "Oh, yeah, who beat you?" But this music could change the world.

176
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:06,800
 North Korea is the most repressive regime on the planet. And if there's hope for them, then there's hope for everyone else.

177
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,800
 They're not the only repressive regime on the planet, but they're the most.

178
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:19,800
 And if we can figure out a way to help them open up, the world is literally our oyster.

179
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:26,800
 Not literally, then we're living on an oyster. But we did it with the Cold War. We pumped rock and roll across the Berlin Wall.

180
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,800
 We can do it. And it's so interesting, because on the one hand, I don't think I would risk my life if someone said, "You can't listen."

181
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,800
 And now, right now, if someone goes, "If you listen to Tupac, we're going to throw you in prison for a year."

182
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,800
 I'd be like, "Oh, that's fine. I've listened to all the Tupac." I got the songs in my head. They're like, "Oh, you should have said that and they sue me."

183
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,800
 I go, "Okay, fine. It's a stupid law." I don't think at my age I would defy the law to listen to Tupac.

184
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:57,800
 But if I had never heard Tupac before, if I had never heard rap music before, and I'd grown up and I was 44 years old and never heard any rap,

185
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,800
 and then one day someone came over to my house and was like, "Dude, you can't tell anyone about this."

186
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,800
 But check this out. And they put in "Natural Born Killers" by Dr. Drain Ice Cube.

187
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,800
 I think I would risk my life to listen to that music.

188
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:15,800
 So it's a fascinating-- music is just a fascinating thing. It speaks to you.

189
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:22,800
 Rap music speaks to me, and K-pop is speaking to them because it's showing a life outside of where they live.

190
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,800
 How the world really is. There was one person who said, "We are always told that Westerners were wolves.

191
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,800
 They were the enemies of mankind, and South Korea were the slaves of the wolves."

192
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,800
 And then we listen to this music and we realize that's all a lie.

193
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,800
 So K-pop can possibly topple-- I think it definitely can-- topple this regime.

194
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,800
 And to wrap it up on this note, this is actually a sad way to go out,

195
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,800
 the children of North Korea have to have a hidden language to talk about this.

196
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:57,800
 When a child in North Korea greets another one, they'll ask, "Have you ever worn a bulletproof backpack?"

197
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,800
 Which is a weird code because obviously that's a code, right?

198
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,800
 Obviously that's a code in and of itself. But that means do you listen to BTS?

199
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:17,800
 The children of North Korea have to come up with a code to talk about something that are in magazines in every other corner of the world.

200
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,800
 It's sad that they have to do it, but it shows that music can overcome fear,

201
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:29,800
 and if music can overcome fear, music may be the key to reunifying North and South Korea.

202
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:35,800
 Jonathan Vaca, we look over, wipe a little tear away from his eye. Oh no, no, no, I just got some light and dark material in my eye.

203
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:42,800
 I'm totally fine. We all have on our Wonder Girl shirts now and BTS-- BTS bracelets.

204
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,800
 I don't even know if they make BTS bracelets, but we have them.

205
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:51,800
 We're leaving behind the DMZ. Jonathan, let's hop in that carpenter copter. We are headed out to Morocco.

206
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,800
 [imitates carpenters]

207
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:01,800
 We're going to land out in the middle of nowhere. We're in a field. There's no one around us.

208
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,800
 There is a mountain, however, with a mouth.

209
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:11,800
 What is it like, the mouth from Rocky Horror Picture Show? It's like, come on in, guys.

210
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,800
 No, it's the big lion head from Aladdin, that Aladdin movie.

211
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,800
 Now you're like, Jason, that one didn't take place in Morocco. Two, it's not real.

212
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,800
 But this is just an imaginary part of Morocco for this first part of the story.

213
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
 We all know the story of Aladdin by now.

214
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:33,800
 A dude was walking through the desert and then some wizard-- this is the version of Aladdin that I remember from the movie.

215
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:40,800
 This wizard shows up and goes, "Hey, there's something really cool in that giant mouth, the giant animated mouth.

216
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:47,800
 Go inside of it." Robin Williams might be in there, I'm not for sure, but you go inside of it, you grab that lamp, you grab some treasure, bring it back to me.

217
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,800
 I'm your buddy, I'm your pal. I'm your willing slave.

218
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,800
 Aladdin's like, "Why'd you get that last part?"

219
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:03,800
 Aladdin walks into the cave, gets the lamp, Genie comes out, irritates everyone for an hour and a half, the end.

220
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,800
 So, apparently, I didn't know this. I didn't know this. That's based on a true story.

221
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:18,800
 You're like, don't shut it off yet. Don't shut it off. I'm not saying that Aladdin itself is a true story, but that myth in Morocco, they believe it.

222
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:31,800
 I'm not saying the government of Morocco believes Aladdin is real, but the nugget behind that story is so real, it's causing a string of murders in Morocco.

223
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,800
 Fascinating story, fascinating story.

224
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:43,800
 So, I use the term "Genie," but the term originally is "Gen," and it's-- for lack of a better term, they do grant wishes in a lot of times.

225
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:50,800
 There's a lot of different versions of the Gen or the Genie, depending on which culture you're getting them from.

226
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,800
 They're always tied to wealth and riches of some sort.

227
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:03,800
 In Western ideology, they're the Genie, you rub the lamp, they come out, they give you wishes, and the more powerful the wish, the more likely it's going to go wrong.

228
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,800
 In Islamic culture, they're best compared to demons.

229
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:17,800
 One thing I've always found most fascinating about Gen, though, is in the Islamic tradition, God crafted them out of smokeless fire.

230
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:24,800
 I've always loved that imagery, because it's impossible. Where there's smoke, there's fire. Where there's fire, there's smoke.

231
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:33,800
 I just love that imagery. I don't know why. I've always been drawn to that idea of he crafted them from smokeless fire. That's always stuck with me.

232
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:44,800
 But other than that, other than their origin story, and just the mere impossibility of how that would come into being, we have the story of the Zahori.

233
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:56,800
 Now, this is a very, very common crime, apparently. This is not a rumor. I know I said that in the intro, but I thought it was a rumor when I read the first article on Cabos.com, which is about, like, cryptids and things like that.

234
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:08,800
 But there's articles in MoroccoWorldNews.com. The police have a serious problem with this. Children are being taken right off of the streets, kidnapped by organized crime.

235
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:20,800
 All this stuff when you think about, like, reptilian, Illuminati conspiracy theories happening in the United States, children being snatched for satanic rituals, that's happening in Morocco right now.

236
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:34,800
 Children are being snatched off the streets, and then found days later in the middle of nowhere, tortured and murdered. Sorry, I know it's a bit of a whiplash from the K-pop segment, but this is real.

237
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:41,800
 And when these children get kidnapped, the police know exactly what it is. The child was a Zahori.

238
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:53,800
 In Morocco, this is a very, very regional belief. There are children that are born differently. Zahori, actually, ironically, means "lucky."

239
00:18:53,800 --> 00:19:12,800
 The idea is that they are either Jinn themselves, who when they were born, a Jinn replaced a human baby with a Jinn baby, and the human parents raised it as a normal human. That's very common in Faye folklore as well in Western Europe.

240
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:29,800
 The other version is that, unknowingly, a parent had a child with a Jinn, and this child is half Jinn, half human. But either way, it's the legend of Aladdin. You see, the magician sent, Aladdin wasn't just some poor urchin boy.

241
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:35,800
 Aladdin was a Zahori. And the wizard knew this, because there's ways you can tell if someone is a Zahori.

242
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:53,800
 A Zahori child knows where Jinn treasure is. They can just suss it out. They have an idea. They have a feeling, too. None of the traps the Jinn set up can hurt a Zahori child, because they're half Jinn, or a whole Jinn, depending on the myth.

243
00:19:53,800 --> 00:20:01,800
 But none of the traps can work. They are the only ones who can safely get in, get the treasure from a Jinn, and get back out.

244
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:11,800
 So the story of Aladdin in Morocco is real. At least that part of it is. They probably are a little iffy on the talking parrot.

245
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:22,800
 Aladdin was a Zahori. These children are fairly common. And there's a lot of telltale signs, so get ready to find out whether or not you could possibly be kidnapped. This is insane.

246
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:32,800
 I thought this was a local legend until I found all these news reports on it. But here's how you can tell if you're a Zahori. Again, in any other culture, you're just considered lucky.

247
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:40,800
 But in Morocco, it's incredibly unlucky. One, do you have- get a mirror. Get a mirror for all of this stuff. Stick your tongue out.

248
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:48,800
 If you have a clear line cut lengthwise in your tongue, so you have like a clear line in your tongue, you might be a Zahori.

249
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:57,800
 Some Zahoris have all these qualities, some just have a few. But I think really one or two will get you brutally murdered, so you might not want to check for this stuff.

250
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:09,800
 The palm of your hand, on one of them or both, you have a line that cuts horizontal. It's straight and it cuts horizontal across your palms.

251
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:23,800
 So I kind of have one of those. In palm reading, it's considered the luck line or the fate line. If you have a line that cuts across your palm, that means fate is going to play a strong part in your life.

252
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,800
 If you don't have a line that cuts across, then you have a much- your life is more up for grabs.

253
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:39,800
 One of your eyes has a slight squint, so I don't think it's like Popeye level. That was the worst Popeye in present ever. That was like if Fonz was a pirate.

254
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:49,800
 But you know, I don't think it has to be like that. Slight squint. Here's one. You have a special luster in your eyes, which everyone notices at first sight.

255
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:55,800
 Your blood color- don't test this one, don't test this one. You have the mirror for the other step.

256
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:01,800
 Your blood color is lighter than normal. And I had to look this up because I didn't know this was a thing.

257
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:14,800
 You have two hair whirls at the top of your head. So a head whirl is like the way your hair circles around. You're like, "Jason, I know what a hair whirl is. You're the only person on the planet who had to look that up."

258
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:21,800
 I didn't understand what that was, but that's a dead giveaway, because that's one of the few things you can just see. The hair whirl.

259
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:26,800
 Squinty eyes, you know, stuff like that. Charismatic eyes. You can probably see that from a distance.

260
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,800
 But like the tongue, you're not going to know that until they're already in your car and you can nap them.

261
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:37,800
 The more of those you have, the more powerful you are, as is the Hori. But again, it's not a good thing in Morocco, in any other country.

262
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,800
 Cool. You're super lucky, but not Morocco.

263
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:45,800
 So these children are being kidnapped, taken out to middle of nowhere because that's supposedly where the treasure.

264
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:51,800
 And you know what's funny to say? There is. This is what's really confusing about this for people in the culture.

265
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:58,800
 There are thousands of individual treasures buried all over Morocco.

266
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:06,800
 There's buried treasure all over the place in Morocco, because the early settlers who were coming in, even a long time after that,

267
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:11,800
 the only way to secure your gold, the only way to secure your valuables, you buried them.

268
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:18,800
 So in cemeteries, in the wilderness, in a forest, in a bog, there's treasure buried all over Morocco.

269
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:24,800
 Everyone knows that. Everybody knows that. People just two, three generations ago were still burying treasure.

270
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:31,800
 But because of the idea of the gin, if the family dies off, if they forget where the treasure is at,

271
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:38,800
 because it's underground, the gin gains control of it. It is now property of the gin.

272
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:45,800
 So you need a Zahori to just walk around the wilderness, and they'll get a sense for where this treasure is.

273
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,800
 So here's the thing. The treasure, the stories of the treasure are real.

274
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:55,800
 The story of these children who are half gin aren't. There are people who are born exceptionally lucky.

275
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,800
 There are people who make their own luck. But I don't think these kids are actually half gin.

276
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:06,800
 Otherwise you'd have whole swaths of the population who are half gin, because these traits, I'm half gin, according to this.

277
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,800
 I should ask my mom if she ever held out in Morocco.

278
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,800
 But the treasure is real. You know that for a fact. The question is how do you find it?

279
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:19,800
 So they're snatching these children off the streets who have these powers, who are these Zahori.

280
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,800
 They're taking them out to middle of nowhere. They kill them for a couple different reasons.

281
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,800
 One, because they're mad, because the children couldn't find any treasure.

282
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:34,800
 Because they probably can't. They're nine. Sometimes they're killed because the treasure is found.

283
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
 Because again, it's buried everywhere.

284
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,800
 You go, Jason, if they found the treasure, why--if you had a half gin and you lead them to one treasure,

285
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:47,800
 when you want to keep that half gin to lead them to other treasures, because you're stealing from the gin,

286
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,800
 you have to sacrifice the child to the gin.

287
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:59,800
 The kid's not getting out of there. Leads him to the treasure, he dies. Doesn't lead him to the treasure, he dies.

288
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:05,800
 And then for some segments of the sorcerer community of Morocco, you got to kill the kid to find the treasure.

289
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:10,800
 Like, you don't even--the kid doesn't even get to help find the treasure, which is not a good thing.

290
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:16,800
 He's not a goonie, but it's like--the kid's got--I'm trying not to make light of it, but I'm saying like,

291
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,800
 on one hand, you get to spend a little bit, like, longer alive, I guess.

292
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,800
 Like, a couple more hours, and then the other one, you just show up in the middle of nowhere and they kill you

293
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:30,800
 and they throw your blood everywhere. Geez, this is gone dark really, really fast.

294
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:36,800
 The other one, like, they ritually kill the kid right away and they use the blood to find the treasure.

295
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,800
 And maybe they stumble across it, because it's everywhere.

296
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:44,800
 And the problem is, is that then it proves that this is the way to find the treasure.

297
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,800
 There was a story I was reading in this article in the Morocco News.

298
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:54,800
 This family, their son was a Zahori, because, see, this isn't a--this isn't something the country bumpkins believe.

299
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,800
 Like, obviously not everyone believes it, but huge swaths of the population believes it.

300
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:05,800
 And this parent, this family sees as their child as a Zahori, and so the grandpa's like, "Great, I guess I gotta quit my job now."

301
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:10,800
 And he escort--he's like, "I'll throw him the newspaper down." He's like, "Dag, nab it. No, don't get to work."

302
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:16,800
 He has to escort his son to and from school every single day, because he will get kidnapped and murdered.

303
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,800
 That it will happen. And the kid wasn't allowed to go outside.

304
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:26,800
 So you're going, "Okay, yeah, I kind of ruined his childhood. He didn't get to spend the first nine years, and didn't make any friends."

305
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,800
 This went on till he was 20 years old.

306
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:35,800
 His grandpa's escorting them everywhere. He's at a nightclub dancing. He's like, "Hey, grandson, look at those hot babes over there."

307
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:40,800
 He's like, "Grandpa, you're totally killing my vibe. The grandpa's coming home with two college-aged chicks."

308
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,800
 Woohoo, party guy.

309
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,800
 When he turned 20, he got married, and the family goes, "You can take care of yourself now."

310
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,800
 They were doing this up until college.

311
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:58,800
 Because he could be 18, 19 years old, he will get kidnapped, taken to the middle of nowhere, and murdered, because he has a line on his tongue.

312
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,800
 This is happening today. These articles aren't from 1947.

313
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:12,800
 Fascinatingly terrifying story. A few physical abnormalities can get your child tortured and murdered.

314
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,800
 I've been glossing over the torture part as well, but they do that.

315
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:23,800
 They do that. That's part of the ritual. It's part of getting them to, you know, if someone's--if you ask someone, "Where's the treasure?"

316
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,800
 I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. They're not going to be like just bonking on the head.

317
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,800
 They're going to torture you to get the information that they don't know.

318
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:41,800
 And if you do happen to save around that tree, and you go and you dig around that tree, and you find something because it's buried everywhere, you've just doomed the next child as well.

319
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:52,800
 It's a story based on myth and superstition. It's a story based on something from 1001 Arabian nights, but it's having a deadly consequence today.

320
00:27:52,800 --> 00:28:04,800
 The story of the Zahari is one that tells us that sometimes the myths that we research for fun or to scare us at night can have terrifying real-world consequences.

321
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:14,800
 And honestly, there's only two good ways to end this epidemic. One, that everyone in the country just stops believing this lunacy.

322
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:21,800
 That people stop thinking that you can kidnap children at random and they'll tell you where magical treasure is buried.

323
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:30,800
 Or that one of these murderous sorcerers finds a real Zahari.

324
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:39,800
 Takes them out to the woods, tries to find the treasure, finds it because it's everywhere, and executes the child.

325
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:52,800
 But this child was not a child of flesh and blood. This child was truly half-jin, and has now become a force to be reckoned with.

326
00:28:52,800 --> 00:29:05,800
 This jinn is unleashed in the country of Morocco, and it will get vengeance not only for itself, but for every human child who was killed before it.

327
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:15,800
 This jinn moves through the country of Morocco, killing these men one by one.

328
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:28,800
 To health experts, it looks like an epidemic. To police officers, it looks like a series of gangland hits. No cause of death, just bodies being found everywhere.

329
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:38,800
 But it is only happening to those who engaged in this ritual. They wished for treasure, they got their wish fulfilled with the twist.

330
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:49,800
 Because while they may have enjoyed those earthly riches, while they were alive, the last thing they see is a entity reach into them and tear out their soul.

331
00:29:49,800 --> 00:30:06,800
 A few trinkets dug up from the earth in exchange for an eternity in a world of darkness, madness, and smokeless fire.
