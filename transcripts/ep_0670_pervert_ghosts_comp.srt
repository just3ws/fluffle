1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 A farmer out checking on his cattle has a close encounter of the "burned" kind.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,160
 And then we travel to Illinois to take a look at the story of a bizarre ghost

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,160
 that pulls people out of their beds and forces them into the closet.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,360
 And then things get a little kinky today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:26,880
 [Music]

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,320
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,280
 Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys are

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,800
 having a lot of fun, whatever you're doing. You're all robbing a bank right now. You're like,

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,080
 "I'm having the best fun ever." Shut up, hostages. First off, let's welcome into Dead Rabbit Command

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:48,720
 coming in on a blue light cycle from Tron. [Humming]

11
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,640
 It's Blue Synth, everyone. Give a round of applause. Don't bump into his light wall.

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,760
 Otherwise, you'll de-rez, but Blue Synth, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

13
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,320
 If you guys can't support the Patreon or if you don't fight for the users, that's fine too.

14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,080
 Just help spread the word about the show. Really, really helps out a lot.

15
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,760
 Blue Synth, I'm going to go ahead and touch the keys of the Jason Jalopy. It's not as cool as a

16
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,960
 light cycle, but we'll leave a stream behind us, a stream which is junk falling out of the trunk.

17
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,200
 Don't bump into that either. You'll get tetanus. I'm going to give you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,200
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We're headed out to Quixota, Brazil.

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:30,640
 Jason Jalopy is driving down the road. I got most of my information from the story from an

20
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,240
 article written by Marcus Loth for ufoinsight.com. It's a really good website. I recommend checking

21
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,320
 it out. A lot of great articles on there. It's April 3rd, 1976. We're in Quixota, Brazil. It's

22
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,920
 two in the morning. Jason Jalopy is driving real quiet. It actually broke down a while ago. We're

23
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,360
 pushing it. All the stuff that was falling out of the back was essential to make the car run.

24
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,320
 And we see a man. His name is Luis Barroso Fernandez. He's just a simple farmer checking on his

25
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,800
 cattle. Brings his wagon out little donkey. Walking frame. I wish I could get that donkey

26
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:12,640
 checked out. That's not a donkey noise. Hee-haw. Hee-haw. Luis and his donkey are taking this wagon.

27
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,720
 They're out checking on these cattle. And then all of a sudden, the distance Luis

28
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,720
 sees these bright lights in the sky. It looks like an airplane flying really low to the ground.

29
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,120
 He thinks that's weird. It's two in the morning. I wonder what it's doing this far out here. And

30
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,960
 the way it's flying so low to the ground almost looks like it's about to land. Now, remember,

31
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:37,280
 this is his farm. He's just want to play destroying all of his crops. And him and his donkey are

32
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,240
 standing there. And this plane is getting lower and lower and lower and closer and closer to them.

33
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:49,600
 And then all of a sudden, it shines an incredibly powerful blinding beam of light at both him and

34
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:57,440
 his donkey. The donkey puts one hoof up to cover his eyes. They're both paralyzed. They're both

35
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:04,800
 paralyzed by this beam. And the craft continues into the night sky, leaves the area. And Luis is

36
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,640
 just laying there on the ground. Now, there was a cowboy in the area just passing through. He sees

37
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,000
 what happens. He comes across Luis. He's paralyzed. He's laying on the ground. Luis is completely

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,080
 discombobulated. No word on the mental state of the donkey is probably just acting like a donkey.

39
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,400
 They take him to the hospital. They take Luis to the hospital. He actually had burns on the left

40
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:36,160
 side of his body. So it was like he was turning as the beam hit him. And he was in incredible pain.

41
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,240
 The doctors can't really figure out what's going on. They see that his skin is burned. They see

42
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:46,560
 that he's in pain. But when they ask him about it, he's like, "Uh, there's a UFO. There's a plane.

43
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,680
 Plane was coming down the side of the beam." The doctors don't know how to make that. Like,

44
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,760
 did he have an epileptic fit? No doctor, especially in 1976, is going to go and must be UFOs.

45
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,640
 So the astronomy lab, you're just going to think this guy had some sort of epileptic fit,

46
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,320
 had some sort of seizure and saw the bright light. That doesn't account for his burned skin,

47
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,720
 but they don't know what to make of it. They just know that his skin has been damaged and he's

48
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:16,000
 in a lot of pain. A few days after that, his hair goes completely gray. And he starts to suffer from

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,880
 memory problems as well. This affliction never leaves him. This happened in 1976, and it sticks

50
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:30,080
 with him until he dies in April of 1993. His memory gets worse and worse and worse to the

51
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:37,680
 point that he has the mentality of a child. By the time he passes away, he can only utter three words.

52
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:45,360
 "Mom, give and fear." Now, he was elderly when this happened, so you could go, "Well, maybe it was

53
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,040
 dementia, maybe it was some sort of Alzheimer's thing." But what made this weird? I mean, nothing

54
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,200
 in the UFO, him and a donkey getting paralyzed, and him only saying three words, is that his skin

55
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:06,480
 healed. But not just the burned parts. According to reports, as he got older and as his mentality

56
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:14,080
 dropped to that of a child, his skin was repairing itself. All of the burns went away,

57
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:20,800
 but so did his wrinkles. By the time he died, he was an elderly man, but he had the skin of a

58
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,600
 healthy man in the prime of his life. So whatever this beam was, it seemed to regress him. It's not

59
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,280
 like the mental deterioration was similar to Alzheimer's. It was reducing him to the mindset

60
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:42,080
 of a child, and his skin was also being made to look younger and healthier and more supple as well.

61
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,120
 He was already old when this happened. It would have been interesting to the aliens,

62
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,840
 let's do a test. It'd be interesting to see what would happen if they did this to like a guy in

63
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,520
 his 20s. Would he eventually, it must seem he would shrink into the size of a baby, but would

64
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,440
 he have lived long enough for his skin to be baby-like? You know how they have those arms that

65
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:09,680
 look like rolls, like dinner rolls at Thanksgiving? Would a 20-year-old man eventually start going,

66
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,120
 "No, me, no, no, that's some dude's fetish. That's some diaper fetish." But you know what I mean?

67
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:21,440
 Would they start to look like a baby? Not in size. Would they be like a six-foot-tall baby-skinned

68
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,560
 person, which would be incredibly terrifying. They have like ready cheeks, big ready cheeks.

69
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,320
 They have their hair in a little bow. They're wearing a onesie. That's a guy's fantasy too.

70
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:36,320
 Dammit, why does everything have to be a kink? We'll talk about that actually in our last story.

71
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,760
 But again, it's almost like this beam was regressing him mentally and physically

72
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:48,160
 too far mentally. Like if he had had the mind of a 20-year-old and the skin of a 20-year-old,

73
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,400
 his muscles are still super old. But who knows, maybe his organs and his muscles were repairing

74
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:03,120
 as well. But was this alien beam actually the fountain of youth? Interesting. We've seen people

75
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,720
 get shot with beams before by alien crafts and melt or have horrible burns, but I can't recall

76
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,840
 one where it had this sort of effect on someone for such a long period of time. The guy who melted,

77
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,720
 I mean, he died. This affliction lasted for almost 20 years for this man.

78
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,600
 So bizarre story. If in another circumstance where it didn't regress him that young,

79
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,760
 he would actually would have been a miracle. He would have been able to handle his farm and he's

80
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,400
 imagined getting hit by this alien beam and actually being younger and more fit and have

81
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,400
 your mind even more sharp. But instead he was turned into a man with the skin of a 30-year-old

82
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:47,600
 and the brain of a baby. And that is nobody's fetish. I hope not.

83
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,840
 Blue Synth, go ahead and call in that dead rabbit, Durgible. We're going to leave behind this farm

84
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:58,800
 and we are headed out to England. I didn't mention the story in the intro. I didn't know if I was

85
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,600
 going to cover it. It's actually really, really brief. Long time listeners of the show know that

86
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:11,200
 I'm very, very picky with my musical taste. I despise jazz music. I know I know I know I risk

87
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:16,880
 losing listeners every time I mention that. I despise jazz music. I don't like a lot of music.

88
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:22,640
 I don't like stringed instruments. I can't eat while I'm listening to heavy metal. I have these

89
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:32,480
 really weird hang-ups about music. I listened to 1990s to early 2000s, Gangsta Rap, and I listened

90
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:39,520
 to pop music. I can listen to pop music from really the 80s to current hits today. Basically

91
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:45,040
 those radio stations that your mom listens to all the time, that those radio stations are also for

92
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:51,120
 me. Hits from yesterday and today. I can listen to the newest Doja Cat. I can listen to Tiffany.

93
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:58,160
 I can listen to all this pop music that drives people nuts, drives people absolutely up the wall.

94
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,400
 I can listen to it all day long. Adele, Britney Spears, Jonas Brothers, Big Time Rush, One Direction,

95
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:10,560
 all that stuff. All the hits, all the great ones. So most people think my musical taste is trash,

96
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,840
 and that's fine. I'm totally aware of that. That's the music I enjoy. I know most people don't. I

97
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,440
 don't tell people, "Oh no, if you don't like Britney Spears, but you got to listen to this album and

98
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,800
 then three songs off this album, you just don't like Britney Spears." That's totally fine. I totally

99
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:31,120
 get it. I've listened to maybe one Rolling Stones song my entire life, and it was the one...

100
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,600
 Most people wouldn't even consider it a Rolling Stones song, and technically it's a Mick Jagger

101
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,320
 song. It's the one with him and David Bowie and they're dancing in the street. I remember as a

102
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,440
 kid when they were doing it, I'm like, "This is trash. This is the Rolling Stones. This is like this...

103
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,720
 I thought these guys were competitors to the Beatles. I'm like, "Rolling Stones, trash, dude!

104
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,600
 What is this?" I've only heard dancing in the streets with Mick Jagger and David Bowie dancing

105
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,360
 uncomfortably close to each other. I'm eight years old. I'm like, "What is this? What is this video?

106
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,840
 Are they a couple? Why are their nipples touching while they're dancing?" I knew I couldn't really

107
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:14,160
 make heads or tails of it. So I'm not a Rolling Stones fan. I'm not a Mick Jagger fan. I've never

108
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,880
 really sat down and listened to a Mick Jagger or a Rolling Stones song until the other day.

109
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:27,840
 And it is brilliant! Now, this isn't a music review podcast. This obviously has something to do

110
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,400
 with paranormal conspiracy and true crime. This still, I guess, isn't Rolling Stone. This is still

111
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:38,400
 Mick Jagger. This is really interesting because I saw the news articles pop up about it and then

112
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:44,240
 immediately they dropped the story, which goes to say something. So there is a bit of a conspiracy

113
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,800
 angle here. I saw these articles pop up and it was almost like no one had listened to the song.

114
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,520
 Everyone wanted to be the first person to report that Mick Jagger had recorded a brand new song,

115
00:10:53,520 --> 00:11:00,080
 featuring Dave Grohl, who is dope. As much as I may talk about my crappy musical taste,

116
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:06,080
 I recognize Genius when I see it and that's Dave Grohl. Like everything he touches is amazing.

117
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:12,560
 So Dave Grohl and Mick Jagger made this song called "Easy Sleazy" and I saw these articles pop up and

118
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,560
 it was, one of the articles had some of the lyrics and I was like, "What?" So I listened to it and I

119
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,600
 expected it to be trash. I expected it to be even Dave Grohl dancing so close, their nipples

120
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,440
 are touching, and me being like, "It's like me and eight years old all over again. What in the world

121
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,920
 is going on?" It's a perfect song about conspiracy theories and the lockdown and the effect of the

122
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:41,600
 quarantine, the COVID-19 quarantine on society and on a single person. It's brilliant. The song

123
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:49,520
 is amazing. It shows the mental degradation of Mick Jagger throughout the COVID and it's

124
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:55,360
 very, very anti-lockdown, which is why I think they were reporting it being like, "Mick Jagger has a

125
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,560
 new song and they were hitting publish and when he listened to the song it is absolutely anti-lockdown."

126
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:06,000
 The first verse is basically like, "I did whatever the government said and I shouldn't have."

127
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,560
 Basically played me for a fool. I was like, "Whoa." I was listening to the song and it has a lyric

128
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,840
 video. It'll be in the show notes and I was like, "Whoa. Okay. This is not the narrative."

129
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:24,320
 And then the second verse is him just kind of going, trying to like find some sort of normalcy

130
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,480
 in the lockdown. Like he's kind of wandering around his house and he's kind of losing his mind.

131
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,440
 And by the third verse we get to this and I'm going to have to say it. I can't sing it for copyright

132
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:42,320
 stuff, but this is how the third verse of this song starts. "Shooting the vaccine. Bill Gates is in my

133
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:49,840
 bloodstream. It's mind control. The earth is flat and cold. It's never warming up. The Arctic's

134
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:54,960
 turns a slush. The second coming's late. There's aliens in the deep state."

135
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:05,200
 And you can easily read that as him mocking those conspiracy theories, but the fact that he's even,

136
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,920
 and I think it can go both ways. I think on the one hand he is mocking it because there's just so

137
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,720
 many different conspiracy theories there and we've noticed that. Some people would just believe in

138
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,520
 every conspiracy theory put in front of them, but on the other hand the fact that he's even

139
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:25,840
 giving these conspiracy theories, like saying them in a song by Mick Jagger, a rock and roll icon,

140
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:31,840
 and the song itself is good. Like the instrumentation or whatever you guys used to describe music.

141
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:37,760
 The fact that he's putting them in this song and he's amplifying them when people are constantly

142
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,880
 trying to... This video may have trouble being on YouTube and Spotify because I even read those

143
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,400
 lyrics because him saying it... I'm not saying it's big and like he's red-pilled or anything like that,

144
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:53,520
 but you know what I mean? Like we have this rock and roll icon making jokes about the Bill Gates

145
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:59,760
 microchip in the bloodstream, aliens in the deep state. It's very, very interesting and I think

146
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:06,240
 it shows that degradation of Mick Jagger. And I think we're going to see. I remember before I said

147
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,560
 we're coming to the Golden Age of conspiracy theory and then I called it off on that episode of

148
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,400
 The Nashville Bombing. I'll put it in the show notes saying that now we make conspiracy theories

149
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:20,320
 out of everything. I mean now I'm starting to think that we may... I think we have a whole group

150
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,120
 of people now who have spent more time due to this lockdown, spent more time in front of their

151
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:31,840
 computers than they had before. They're working from home. They were trapped in their homes. I think

152
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,400
 we're going to have people who are discovering conspiracy theories for the first time. And

153
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:41,120
 that could be like this character in Mick Jagger's song or Mick Jagger himself. He's been locked in

154
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:47,040
 so much he's buying in to all these conspiracy theories. By the end of the song the character in

155
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,240
 the song believes these things. Mick Jagger may be taking the piss out of him. But the character

156
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,240
 in the song actually believes these things because of the mindset that he's endured, the lockdowns,

157
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,720
 and if kind of locked in. So I think that this song is kind of a herald to that. We may actually

158
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,160
 start to see people who are never interested in conspiracy theory become interested in conspiracy

159
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,520
 theory. A fresh fertile ground. The question is who will win the battle? Will it be people like us

160
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:18,880
 who enjoy conspiracy theories, who believe some of them, but are analytical enough to discard

161
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:27,040
 ones that just don't make sense? It's that or real raw news and dark outpost. But I do enjoy

162
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,920
 conspiracy theories. I know you guys do and apparently Mick Jagger knows enough about them to

163
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,520
 write this lyric. So sorry Mick Jagger. Sorry if you are listening to this podcast. I apologize for

164
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:43,280
 saying your music sucks. I have now heard one song that I like of yours and one song that I didn't.

165
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:49,760
 So technically you're 50/50. It's not as good as Britney Spears. But it's doing okay. Blue Synth.

166
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,200
 I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys of the Carbentercopter. We're leaving behind Mick Jagger's

167
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:58,320
 recording studio. He's still in the lockdown. He's like no please let me out. I'm going insane.

168
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:04,000
 See you later Mick. Write some other songs. We're never gonna let him out. We're leaving behind

169
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,080
 this recording studio and we're headed out to Jacksonville, Illinois.

170
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:15,360
 We recently covered, I think it was Tuesday's episode, a haunted university in Ohio. And while

171
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,880
 I was researching that I found a couple other haunted universities. Most of them, I always

172
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,520
 thought on this show when I started doing this podcast two, three years ago. It's almost three

173
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:30,080
 years at this point. I always thought we'd be covering way more ghost stories. But when you

174
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:37,200
 read ghost stories, they're so repetitive and it would constantly be stories. Woman with no legs

175
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:43,840
 floating down the hall, orbs, rocking chairs, stuff like that. It would so repetitive. I thought we

176
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,600
 would cover more ghost stories. I love covering ghost stories. I love reading ghost stories.

177
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,600
 So it turns out that a lot of colleges have ghost sightings. But most of them are in that vein.

178
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,080
 Most of them are, we hear that there's like a ghost floating down the hallway. At least

179
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,520
 the Ohio University had an entire ghost basketball team. Like that's something I can sink my teeth

180
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:09,440
 into. Illinois College was founded in 1829. So of course, there's going to be a ton of ghost

181
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,520
 sightings. And a school that old, there's going to be a ton of ghost sightings. And the question is

182
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,800
 how many of them are legit? How many of them are just rumors? Because that's what's going to happen.

183
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,760
 Students coming and going, stories being passed on, altered, being made more elaborate, all of

184
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,280
 these things are going to happen over the years. We have a classic ghost story about a woman in

185
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,160
 love with a man. He gave her a ring. She wanted to test if it was a real diamond. So she etched

186
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,960
 her name into a window. That story is real. That's not a ghost story, right? That's just a woman wanting

187
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,400
 to see if a diamond is real. But she does that. And then through what this is where the story gets

188
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,640
 more elaborate. Some people say that they were kept apart by her father. And the man was trying to

189
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:57,040
 hide in this building. So he hid in the attic and nailed himself in and then starved to death.

190
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:02,560
 He nailed the hammer on the outside of the door and be like, oh, there we go. Now I don't have

191
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,000
 any way to get these nails out. And I'll start to death. Did the dad just wait on the other side of

192
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,440
 the door for three or four weeks that he lay a siege to this attic? We don't know. There's just a

193
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,720
 door in this attic at Illinois College that is nail sticking out of the wrong side. So a story

194
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,920
 has evolved that a man nailed himself shut. Doesn't make any sense, but that's why they're in college

195
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:27,520
 to learn. Obviously, this is the first day of college they haven't learned about nails or physics

196
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,160
 or ghosts or really anything at this point. Another version of the story is he went off to

197
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,520
 fight the civil war, died when this young woman found out. She threw herself out of a window from

198
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,080
 the attic, falls to her death and dies. Why does the attic keep popping up in the story? Well,

199
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:48,640
 apparently two things. One, there was a window with this girl's name etched into it. So you had

200
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,840
 that level of proof. It's been replaced. So did that even exist? All the ghost stories that I

201
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,400
 read about this said that at least that existed. The other stuff they go, well, you know, there's

202
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:04,240
 different versions of it, but apparently for a time there was a woman's signature in this window.

203
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:13,360
 But the ghost story part starts with there is a rocking chair in the attic

204
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:19,120
 that is always facing out the window. That's where she sat in her rocking chair waiting for her

205
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,280
 beloved to come back from the civil war. He's really locked in the other room with the nails

206
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,280
 broken out. It's like, help me, help me. And she sit in there rocking back in the world's loudest

207
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,400
 rocking chair. It's so loud she can't hear his cries for help. If you go into the attic and you

208
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:39,120
 turn the rocking chair and then close the door, when you open it back up, the rocking chair will

209
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:45,760
 be facing the window again. That has to be a rumor for a couple different reasons. One, if it

210
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,080
 happened all the time, there's several ways you could test that is basically what I'm saying. One,

211
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,400
 you would have someone in the room as you shut the door. Two, nowadays you could put a camera up

212
00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:01,440
 there. Three, if it's really her ghost, why would you have to shut the door? Like, why is the ghost

213
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:08,000
 shy? Like, if it's a paranormal activity that happens every single time, why would you have to

214
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:15,360
 shut, why would you have to close off visibility to the chair to make it move? This is what I'm,

215
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,560
 this stuff I'm talking about, like I'm not trying to poop on these ghost stories. I find them

216
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:23,280
 fascinating. But this is where we have to analyze things. When someone tells you a ghost story

217
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,520
 like that, you go, when I first read that, I go, oh, that's kind of creepy. And then I started thinking,

218
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:34,320
 why, why, why, why, why, why? And I started sounding like a little crybaby. Illinois College has a

219
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,440
 medical school there. The legend goes that they weren't allowed to, back in the old times, I'm

220
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,400
 sure it's different now. I don't even know if it was real back then, but the legend goes, they weren't

221
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,200
 allowed to use human bodies in medical schools. I don't know what they were using. They'd have to

222
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,200
 use human bodies. They didn't have plastic. They didn't have dummies. They weren't allowed to use

223
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,320
 human bodies. So some of the more ingenious medical students became grave robbers or paid grave

224
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:06,800
 robbers to bring them fresh corpses that they used in the attic of the medical school. And late at

225
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,080
 night, they'd all get together and be like, dude, you want to come over to the attic tonight and

226
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,080
 learn stuff? Oh yeah, it's gonna be super awesome. We're gonna cut open some people. You bring the

227
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:20,400
 bruise, I'll bring the corpses. Let's go. Eventually the smell, people were walking around the medical

228
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:28,800
 school. They were smelling rotting flesh. It's not a smell you want to smell anywhere, right? There's

229
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:34,560
 no business where that is a good smell. Even like a mortuary, there shouldn't be rotting flesh. The

230
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:39,520
 authorities are called. They raid the attic. There's a bunch of corpses up there. Does that story

231
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:45,920
 make any sense? No, medical college, medical college most likely had access to corpses too. If you

232
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:51,920
 had access to corpses, even if it was illegal, you think you'd preserve them, right? You want to

233
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:56,960
 just let them rot. You want to be like spring break and you're all like at a party, you're like at

234
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,520
 Fort Lauderdale and someone's like, hey dude, what'd you do with all those corpses we illegally dug

235
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,440
 up? Huh? And it's like the hot Illinois sun they're all cooking during spring break. If you're digging

236
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,360
 them up, you're preserving them. The story doesn't make any sense at all. But this is where we start

237
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,800
 doing the backtracking. Apparently there used to be dorms in this building that the administration

238
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,520
 said we can't have dorms there anymore. No students can stay there. So what happened most

239
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:29,040
 likely, and we covered this on the episode on Tuesday, is there are dorms there that aren't

240
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:34,480
 able to be used and people made up a story as to why. But Jason, are you just going to poo poo

241
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,040
 ghost stories this whole episode? You say that you always want to cover them and I do. You say

242
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:44,320
 that you have a hard time finding them and I do. So why are you pooping all over these ones? Well,

243
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,160
 I'm not pooping all over. Technically I'm rotting flesh all over them, but I want to show the

244
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:53,280
 analytical side. Let's get to the meat of this matter. Let's get to the rotting cadaver flesh of

245
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:59,440
 this matter. On campus, this isn't, they don't give a date to the story. There's a young woman,

246
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,920
 she's on her way to a party with her friends. They're going to go, they finally got rid of the

247
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:10,960
 smell, the rotting flesh smell that has wafted over campus for weeks. It's a spring cleaning party.

248
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:16,320
 Everyone can now breathe easy. She's walking with her friends and she goes, "You guys go ahead. I

249
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,800
 gotta go back to the dorm and get something." And they're like, "Oh, okay." So they keep going and

250
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:30,400
 she runs back to her dorm. She sounds like she's doing more than running. She runs back to her

251
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:37,040
 dorm. She's gooning. She runs back into her dorm. Sorry if you don't listen to Monday's episode.

252
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,280
 She runs back in her dorm and there's a spiral staircase that takes her up to the top.

253
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:48,640
 She's running up the stairs. She sees the legs of someone standing up there and she kind of

254
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,280
 hesitates. Everyone should be at the spring cleaning party. Everyone should be celebrating that it no

255
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,560
 longer smells like human stew. And she kind of slows down and she keeps slowly walking up the

256
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:06,400
 stairs and she begins to see someone dressed in all gray. Their entire body is gray. She goes up a

257
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:16,240
 little bit further and now she can see its face and it has none. Now it could be blurry. Could be

258
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:24,320
 like a blurry face but I'm imagining, imagine with me, grody. Like it has like a caved in. Like

259
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:31,600
 it literally has no face. Like that dude from Saving Private Ryan. Not Tom Hanks. Don't imagine

260
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,440
 Tom Hanks. Remember in Saving Private Ryan you're like Jason I've tried blocking the scene out.

261
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,320
 Remember in Saving Private Ryan where the guy's on the radio and he's like going, "Hey, we need

262
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:46,320
 more bombs." And then he flips over. You guys, somebody's never seen this movie. This makes no

263
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:52,560
 sense. He flips over and he has a hole in his face. It looks like a bowl. That's him. Well imagine that

264
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:59,040
 guy but but he'll all timey in gray off it. Anyways, he has no face. It doesn't say but I want to

265
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:04,480
 picture this dude with like a caved in face. Not that I want to. It's just scarier. That was the

266
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,760
 longest way to say. He has a scary caved in face. She runs down the stairs obviously. She tells her

267
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,600
 friends. You won't believe what happened. Her friends and a bunch of other people go to the dorm.

268
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:19,360
 They can't find any sign of this guy. A legend that goes around school. He's called the Gray Man.

269
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:27,040
 Later on in time there's a building, a dorm called Crampedon Hall, where a guy goes to go to a party.

270
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,720
 This is later. We don't know actually how close this was to the first sighting but he's supposed

271
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,160
 to go to this party. He tells his friend, "Hey, I gotta go. I gotta go back to my dorm." Yeah,

272
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:39,120
 like, okay, see you later. Later on though when the party's over and they go back and they go to

273
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:44,880
 check on this dude, they find his dorm rooms empty. They start looking around for him. They open the

274
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,240
 closet. He's hanging in the closet. He's dead and his hands are tied behind his back.

275
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,040
 And they say there was no way he could have tied his own hands behind his back. I know what you

276
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:01,040
 guys are thinking. Wait a second. A few years after that, this dude was supposed to hang out with his

277
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:08,080
 buddies. Never showed up. This was also in Crampedon Hall actually. Supposed to show up. Never, never

278
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:13,600
 did. Let's go see what Barry's up to. He's supposed to hang out with us but he's not here. This is a

279
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,880
 lame party. We're all super lame without Barry. There's nothing going on. So they go to his dorm.

280
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:24,080
 They actually find his dorm empty. They look around. They can't figure out where he could be.

281
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,640
 And then one of them opens the closet and there is Barry. I'm making up the name Barry. His name

282
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:37,360
 is actually Barry. I'm not trying to put you on blast. He's hanging upside down, naked, with his

283
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,760
 hands behind his back. Help me, help me. Good you guys. You guys gotta help me. Get me down from here.

284
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:48,160
 So they do. They're not still hanging up there to this day. New freshmen are coming in. He's like,

285
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:54,480
 "Hey, I'm Barry. Welcome to Illinois University. I'm 60 years old. I've been hanging here all this

286
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,320
 time." They let him down. They ask him, "What happened? What's going on?" He said, "A ghost did it."

287
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:06,080
 He said, "A ghost did it." He said that he'd fallen asleep with the lights on. He was laying in bed,

288
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:11,600
 fell asleep with the lights on. He hears a noise in his sleep. He wakes up and there's a gray man

289
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:19,040
 with no face standing over his bed. Some sicko. Some sicko goes to the look. Was it all caved in

290
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:23,200
 and gross? Like, "Saving Private Ryan?" He's like, "What? Let's save him Private Ryan." I don't know

291
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,240
 what that is, but he just had no face. He didn't go in a detail either. They stared at each other

292
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:37,600
 for a while and then he saw the gray man turn and walk into the closet. The friends are like,

293
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,880
 "Wait a second. I don't care. How did you get in the closet?" He's like, "I don't know. The next thing

294
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,760
 I know, I was naked hanging upside down with my hand tied behind my back. But I don't know. I'm

295
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:56,800
 assuming it was the gray man who did it." Apparently that same night, other students said that they

296
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:05,120
 woke up and the gray man was standing over their bed as well. I think these guys, both of them,

297
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,800
 were doing an act known as autoerotic affixiation. It does happen. We actually covered that at a

298
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:15,760
 college and it was in Athens, Georgia. It was another college one. I'll put it in the show notes, but

299
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:23,600
 men will do it seemingly more often than women. They'll tie themselves up and they'll cut off the

300
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:29,600
 blood flow to their brain and they'll masturbate. It's a very dangerous sex game. So the first

301
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,400
 guy may have done it. It is possible to tie your hands behind your back in ways that people would

302
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:39,200
 not think it was possible. The first guy may have done it. The second guy may have done it and got

303
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:46,000
 turned upside down and was hanging there for a long time. And then when he heard his friends barge

304
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,480
 into his dorm room looking for him, he's probably like, "Uh-oh. I gotta come over and excuse.

305
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:56,240
 I have to fly. I'm naked hanging upside down in a closet." The only excuse he could think of was

306
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:03,920
 ghost, which is not a great excuse. Luckily, he could have died. It's possible that he was

307
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:09,840
 trying to commit autoerotic asphyxiation. He was saved just in the neck of time.

308
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:16,960
 Everything turned out okay. He had a really lousy excuse. But here's what's been on

309
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:24,320
 our conspiracy caps here. What if conspiracy cap firmly on, hold it down to your head for this one,

310
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:33,040
 what if ghosts can affect you sexually? We've all heard stories about succubi and incubi. They're

311
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:39,760
 demons who feed off your sexual desires and your sexual energy and basically the succubi. When you

312
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,880
 have sex with the succubi, it's creating demons and hell, that's one of the versions of it. Lilith.

313
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,280
 You call upon Lilith. You masturbate. It's all these sex-spilled stuff. We've covered it before on

314
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,840
 the show here and there. I don't think we've ever done a deep dive into it. It's pretty common stuff.

315
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:59,680
 But what if it's way more widespread than that? Here's my thing. Here's what I'm thinking. What if

316
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:07,600
 this dude wasn't trying to commit autoerotic asphyxiation? What if the ghost was making him do

317
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,800
 that? We always run into these stories where people, the people who die accidentally of this,

318
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:19,760
 we go, "But what if that wasn't their thing? What if the ghost tricked them into trick them into

319
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,200
 coming?" It's like the ghost is like, "Take off all your clothes. Oh, you're so fit. You're so

320
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,680
 muscular." You're like, "Thank you, great ghost. How can you see without a face?" He's like, "I have

321
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:33,040
 other ways of seeing." Then why don't you tie your hands behind your back? What if there's a spiritual

322
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:40,320
 world that leads us on to do stuff we otherwise wouldn't do? What if a ghost could alter that

323
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,680
 behavior? What if you never wanted to commit autoerotic asphyxiation? What if you never had a fetish for

324
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:52,640
 armpits? What if you never ever thought about being a feeder, like feeding someone so much and watching

325
00:30:52,640 --> 00:31:02,000
 them get super fat? But a ghost wanted you to do that stuff. The spiritual world was influencing

326
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,720
 you in some way. I'm not talking about demons. I'm talking about ghosts, because when we talk about

327
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:12,480
 ghosts, a lot of times the lore says they have unfinished business. What if their unfinished

328
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:19,760
 business is being pervert? What if you're a totally normal person and your wife brings home some

329
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:25,760
 trinket she got from the thrift store? And you're like, "Great. Another statue of Brainy Smurf.

330
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:32,400
 Perfect. It's totally gonna go with the rest of the Smurf collection." But that statue was owned by

331
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:38,400
 a pervert. He was owned by a peeping tom. When we talk about ghosts and possessed dolls and stuff

332
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,400
 like that, we always think about external stuff like you hear footsteps or there's a woman whispering

333
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:48,240
 in your ear. But what if this ghost actually inspires perverted desires inside of you?

334
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:53,280
 Where all of a sudden, for whatever reason, you start having dreams about looking in through

335
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,760
 people's windows. That's weird. I've never had a dream like that before. But you brush it off,

336
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:04,000
 right? Dreams are weird. But then you start to think about it more. You find yourself looking for

337
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 stories online, new stories about peeping tom's getting caught. You find yourself starting to

338
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,800
 watch porn videos, upskirt videos, dressing room videos, hidden camera videos. You start to get this

339
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:24,160
 need to be voyeuristic, as that little Brainy Smurf statue. This episode sponsored by Peo,

340
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:29,600
 that little Brainy Smurf statue was sitting on the shelf. This ghost is influencing these thoughts

341
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:37,040
 and desires that you never would have had before. Until you finally are driving through random

342
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:43,360
 neighborhoods one night, trying to look through windows as you drive by, fleeting glimpses.

343
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:50,320
 It's not enough. Eventually you find yourself sneaking up outside of a young woman's house

344
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:58,880
 and peering in through her window when she's all alone. These thoughts, these desires were never

345
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,000
 yours. But if you get caught, you're going to pay the price for them. Not this ghost, not this

346
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,360
 spiritual entity that is latching onto you. And again, it's not a demon. It's not malicious. It

347
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:18,480
 just wants to continue its fetish, even in death. That's conspiracy cap fully on. I have no proof

348
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:24,560
 of any of that. I just find it another possible piece of this onion we call the paranormal.

349
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:33,360
 Remember, this grey ghost appeared in several bedrooms that night, but only Barry ended up

350
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:42,160
 tied up in the closet. Was he more susceptible to the ghost? Was he the one that fell victim to

351
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:49,680
 its sick desires? Who knows. It's just creepy to think that when we look out and see people,

352
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:53,760
 when they do stuff we go, "How, why would you even do that? Why would you even think about

353
00:33:53,760 --> 00:34:02,160
 taking such a chance?" What sort of visceral thrill is really there for just a brief moment of sexual

354
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:09,600
 pleasure you're willing to risk it all? Maybe they don't have a choice. Maybe, even they don't

355
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:15,120
 understand why they're making that decision. Even they can't comprehend what's going on.

356
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:24,720
 There's just something next to them, something unseen, but it's there. The spirit goads them

357
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:32,960
 forward. It needs the pleasures of the flesh, because it is no longer flesh. It is an immortal

358
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:39,600
 spirit that will never be satisfied, no matter how perverted its victims become.
