1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,260
 Anti-cosmic Satanism, the misanthropic Luciferian order can't get more of a

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:15,180
 try-hard name than that. And zombies, zombies, zombies today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

3
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:24,380
 Hey everyone, welcome back to Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm

4
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,980
 having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too. It's October 1st. It's the

5
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,360
 beginning of Halloween month. We got a lot of good stuff this month. Today

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,960
 we're gonna talk about, like I said before, anti-cosmic Satanism. And I want

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,560
 to give you a brief overview of Satanism in general. Because there's basically

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,760
 like two big segments of it. One, you have the Church of Satan. So the Church of

9
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,360
 Satan was founded by Anton Leves and it doesn't really worship Satan as a person

10
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,920
 or as a creature. It's more of a humanist religion. It's more about, "I'm gonna do

11
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,680
 what makes me feel good." They do have, they're not like, "Don't go out and do

12
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,680
 heroin and, you know, molest a ton of kids." Like, if that makes you feel good,

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,680
 then there's some deeper problems. It's more about, "Don't deny yourself the

14
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,100
 pleasures of the flesh within reason." I've had friends who were that type of

15
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,760
 Satan worshiper. Not many, but I've run into a couple of them over the years. And

16
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,240
 they're just normal people. It's just they've chosen that as a religion. And

17
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:27,280
 that's kind of on par with things like Christianity or Mormonism or Buddhism or

18
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,020
 Islam or Judaism. It's just kind of a religious sect. And then just how when

19
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:37,200
 you have a group like the Christians, or the Catholic Church in particular, and

20
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,760
 then they have that, you know, that breakaway sect that was the movement for

21
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,280
 the Restoration of the Ten Commandments. We did a episode on them a while back.

22
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,760
 They were basically a death cult. Or you had, we did an episode on this as well,

23
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:54,160
 you have Islam as a major religion. And then you had the breakaway cult in New

24
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,160
 Mexico, I believe, where they tried exercising the four-year-old disabled

25
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,560
 kid. And then he died and they said he'd come back as Jesus and teach all the

26
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,880
 other kids how to shoot up schools. Like, the Church of Satan would be kind of

27
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,240
 that mainstream, you know, they have tax exempt status, they have buildings, they

28
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,120
 have a structure, things like that. And what happens is then you have smaller

29
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:20,280
 groups of people, basically where you get into the cult level, and their beliefs

30
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,680
 tend to be just a little more extreme. And when I say a little more, I mean

31
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,680
 they're nuts. They're absolutely nuts. Because basically it goes from having

32
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,000
 like a structure of a religion, and then five guys in their basement like just

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,560
 playing deathcore music and writing down their commandments or whatever they want

34
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,600
 to do. It's edgelord stuff. It really is edgelord stuff. Now if a bunch of kids

35
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,680
 want to get together and they're like, dude, let's come up with like a breakaway

36
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,760
 of Judaism. If a bunch of like Orthodox Jews are shitting in the basement,

37
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,760
 listening to, I don't know, what type of music Jewish people listen to, but you

38
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,320
 know, and they come up with their own, that's fine. Because generally their 10

39
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,280
 commandments or their new like little cult they're forming doesn't talk about

40
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,560
 just like murdering people. So that's kind of the group we're gonna be talking

41
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,320
 about today. We're gonna be talking about anti-cosmic Satanism in general. And

42
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:19,400
 then the MLO, which is the Misanthropic Luciferian Order. And again, you know, like

43
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,280
 I get it. And you know, the Church of Satan, the name is shocking. When you look

44
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,880
 into their beliefs, they're like, yeah, Satan's just the other, it's just an

45
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,520
 Abrahamic idea. It's this old religion. It's almost like a shock value name. They

46
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:38,800
 don't actually worship Satan as a person. So anti-cosmic Satanism is a breakaway

47
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,360
 of a breakaway of a breakaway. And I think it's important for the story we're

48
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,320
 gonna follow this up with. To take a look at kind of the overview of anti-cosmic

49
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,840
 Satanism, and I'm gonna be totally honest up front too, it's complete nonsense. Now

50
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,600
 I'll probably have a bunch of Satanists, or not Satanists in general, but well maybe

51
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,920
 them too, but a bunch of anti-cosmic Satanists flooding the comments or

52
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,800
 trying to murder me, I don't know. But let's go ahead and take a look at what

53
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,320
 these guys believe in. So let's take a look at what actually is anti-cosmic

54
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,840
 Satanism. This is from the Satanic International Network's website,

55
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,320
 SatanicInternationalNetwork.com, actually. In the beginning there was nothing but

56
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:24,320
 the energy of chaos. Abso and Tiamat slept and dreamed their darkest dreams. And

57
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,720
 all was good until the dark dreams began to spawn the cosmic gods. And then it's

58
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,800
 just nonsense from then on out. Like that was pretty ridiculous to begin with. And

59
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,680
 I know what you're thinking, you're going, "Jason, how is that any more nonsensical

60
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,800
 than in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth, or anything like

61
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,400
 that, any creation myth?" Here's my pushback on that. The Abrahamic religions,

62
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:54,000
 which would be Christianity, Judaism, Islam, their stories, whether or not you

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,160
 accept that they're true, their creation myths, their stories, have lasted longer

64
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:05,240
 than any empire ever on the planet. They're thousands of years old. And we will

65
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,960
 even look at things like Buddhism or Taoism. These things have stood the test

66
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:16,080
 of time. They have watched cultures rise and fall and rise again under the

67
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,160
 teachings of these people. Anti-cosmic Satanism was written by some people in

68
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,840
 their basement in a three-ring binder. That's the difference. You can use the

69
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,720
 names that you pick and choose from this ancient, "Oh, let's take this Tiamet.

70
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,520
 That's a cool sound of name. Oh, well, you set. Oh, that's a cool name." Well, it's,

71
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,200
 there are myths that stand the test of time that billions of people believe

72
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,760
 around the world that were carved in stone. And now you can read them on the

73
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,200
 internet. They've just spanned the breadth of human knowledge and human

74
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:57,960
 advancement. And then there's this nonsense. That's my pushback on that. So

75
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,800
 basically, these ancient gods were having the darkest dreams. Nothing's ever

76
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,880
 nice in these anti-cosmic sanism. It's always so dark and dreary. It's always so

77
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,680
 edgelord. Anyway, so they're having these horrible dreams and, or I guess, well,

78
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,640
 yeah, see, darkest dreams. That sounds bad. Anyways, so all these other gods pop up

79
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:22,920
 and then one god pops up among them all. We know him as Yahweh or God or Ra or

80
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,080
 whatever. Any of the good gods that we've ever heard about in religions was

81
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:32,200
 actually the evil god whose goal was to subjugate mankind and turn us into

82
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,920
 slaves. But see, the anti-cosmic Satanism, they've seen through the lies. They're

83
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,380
 pushing back against the demiurge. I believe that's how you pronounce it. So

84
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:45,440
 let's take a look here. These are their, here's some guidelines. They have, okay,

85
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,440
 "While there are no strict laws, a Satanist must follow." There are some

86
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,760
 guidelines that will lead you to a better life on earth. So let me, I'm gonna

87
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,520
 read these to you. Tell me if you think this would make, you know what, actually,

88
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,480
 no. I want you, I want to read these to you and I want you to imagine a 15-year-

89
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:06,920
 old kid writing these on a rainy, rainy day. "Do unto others as they do unto you."

90
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:14,200
 Okay, fair enough. That's it. That sounds familiar. This is one. "Do unto others as

91
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:20,280
 they do unto you." If a man strikes you on the cheek, destroy him. What? That seems

92
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,360
 like a bit of an escalation. Man strikes me on the cheek. That's not doing what

93
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,120
 they do unto you. That's, you're killing them. And then it says, "If a person shows

94
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,000
 you love, show them love." That'll be important for our next story. Number two,

95
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,600
 mercy is for the weak masses. Show no mercy towards your enemies. May your

96
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:48,800
 hatred towards them burn as bright as a thousand suns. I'm not, this, look at the

97
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:55,840
 show notes. This is totally sincere. Ridiculous. Okay, four, the strong,

98
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,080
 mischievous terror to make themselves heard over the wailing of the inferior

99
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,720
 majority. Again, guys, come on. This is try hard bullshit. This is so, I mean, again,

100
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:13,240
 like, I could write this stuff when I was 15 years old. The sheeple will all bow

101
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,960
 down when the strong man, it's garbage. It's garbage. Seven, the weak masses are

102
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,840
 trapped by morality. The satanist is beyond such constructs. That's gonna be

103
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,400
 important in our next story. See if there's any other gold ones here. Oh, what?

104
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:33,120
 Okay, this is bizarre. So they're talking about strong overcoming the weak and no

105
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,040
 morality. Like, we're above that. They're above that. I've already got Stockholm

106
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:42,600
 Syndrome. This is point eight. It's quite odd. This kind of stood out to me. The

107
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:48,200
 satanist should strive to create a fascist society in which the strong rule

108
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:54,720
 over the weak. That kind of fits in. But then we got communism and socialism must

109
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,520
 be fought as they seek to have everyone wallow in mediocrity. Might is right. I

110
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:05,840
 think the big problem, I think my main problem with communism and socialism is

111
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,280
 the fact that they are all headed by strong men. If we had a

112
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,960
 communist or socialist government that was like Star Trek, I'd be fine. And

113
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,080
 that's actually interesting to side because the Star Trek goes on. We start

114
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,440
 to see the dark side of the Starfleet. But if it is a truly like

115
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:28,400
 gallitarian utopian society, I don't need to own anything if we're in

116
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,840
 like this post-scarcity world. And I knew there was no Politburo or no Fidel

117
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:40,560
 Castro or Paul Pot or Joseph Stalin or Chairman Ma... or any of the hundreds of

118
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,880
 other examples we have of communism and socialism being run by corrupt, corrupt

119
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,780
 strong people. The satanist, nine, the satanist should be... you like that little

120
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:54,360
 rant there. Nine, the satanist should be prepared to sacrifice his own life if

121
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,520
 necessary to hasten the return of the dark gods. That's ridiculous. Ten,

122
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,720
 weakness must never be tolerated and annihilate the weak. And then there's

123
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,800
 some other stupid ones after that. If someone is bothering you, oh yes, point

124
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:15,600
 13. If someone is bothering you, ask them to stop. If they persist, annihilate them.

125
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,480
 Again, guys, the escalation here is completely out of control. Someone's

126
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,560
 like, "I'm not touching you. I'm not touching you. Will you please stop? I'm

127
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,880
 not touching you. I'm not... you burn their family's farm down and you scatter

128
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:34,000
 their ashes, right?" It's just that there's no in-between with these guys. And why even

129
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 put in, ask them to stop? Because you're gonna annihilate them anyways.

130
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,720
 Whoever stops doing something when you say, "Please stop." Okay, and then let's do

131
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,960
 this real quick. These are the satanic statements. This is... Jesus. This is

132
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:54,240
 there. What you just heard were the guidelines. You know, you don't have to

133
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,480
 follow them, but they're just guidelines. They're very, very polite,

134
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,920
 anti-cosmic satanists. These are the satanic statements. One violent action

135
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:10,160
 speaks louder than 1,000 words. Not 900 words. It's actually 1,000 words. Do not

136
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,960
 say, "Do." I'm a fan of that one. "Do what you must to get your point across." Okay.

137
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:22,800
 So again, the escalation. Whatever. "Only the inferior submit to social norms and

138
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,880
 the status quo." You know, I always think it's funny when I meet people who say

139
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,520
 that and yet they're wearing clothes. Because isn't that a social norm? Jeans.

140
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,960
 A t-shirt. I'll have someone in front of me talking to someone, debating someone,

141
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,120
 and they'll be like, "I don't follow any social norms." But you're wearing clothes,

142
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,920
 which is a social norm. Why do these guys care? They're anti-cosmic satanists.

143
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:49,040
 They're actually fighting to bring back the dark gods. Why do they have proper

144
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,640
 footwear? I don't understand it. "Your enemies do not deserve mercy. Showing them

145
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,320
 forgiveness will only lead to them taking advantage of you and eventually

146
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,920
 destroying you." I think there might be some... especially if they're enemies. I

147
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,720
 mean, they're showing mercy, but showing someone forgiveness and them taking

148
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,040
 advantage of you. Yeah, people go through that. Next sentence. "Kill them before they

149
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:15,200
 kill you." "Make yourself a terror to your adversary." This stuff is the most,

150
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:22,760
 again, most ridiculous, edgy, 15-year-old, try-hard nonsense. They're only... here,

151
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:30,440
 we'll cover this one last. "If given a blow..." Bad choice of words. "If given a blow..."

152
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:43,360
 I should have just said, "If you're punched or if somebody hits you." But if... if given a

153
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:51,400
 blow, retaliate a hundredfold. Okay. "Make the aggressor sorry that they ever

154
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,920
 bothered you." Again, I think you're supposed to ask them to stop first, but

155
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:02,800
 maybe that doesn't come with getting blown. "If somebody blows you, blow them back and

156
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:10,280
 99 of their friends." Anti-cosmic satanism. Now, you're like Jason. Okay, you just made

157
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:15,360
 fun of a ridiculous religion for way longer than you were supposed to. The

158
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,280
 episode's run a little long. But it's because it's setting up the myth...

159
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:25,560
 mythanthropic Luciferian order. So these guys don't really exist anymore. And

160
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,240
 again, that should be a bit of a spoiler alert. This group was established in

161
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:35,360
 Norway. It was set to the backdrop of the Norwegian, like, black metal music. They

162
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,800
 have a... it's really popular over there. Black metal. And they had a rash of

163
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,720
 incidents like in the 90s where like churches were getting burnt down and

164
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,120
 this one member of this black metal band blew his brains out and his band

165
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,280
 member took a picture of the crime scene and put it on the album cover and they

166
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,040
 had a little chunks of his skull in their... you know, whatever. I mean, that's

167
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,320
 gross, but... and it's sad that he killed himself. But anyway, so the

168
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,080
 mythanthropic Luciferian order grew out of this and one of the main founders of

169
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,520
 it actually was in a band called Dissection. I don't know if that's how

170
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,080
 you pronounce it. I know how to pronounce dissection, but I don't know if it's

171
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,320
 pronounced differently in Norwegian. And I actually listened to one of their songs,

172
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,960
 one of the like, the big songs, and it... I mean, musically it was really well done.

173
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,440
 It's not the type of music I listen to in general, but I can appreciate it. I used

174
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,760
 to listen to like, tamer stuff, like Metallica and Guns N' Roses, like, more

175
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,680
 like just heavy... I don't even know if it's classified as heavy metal, but it was

176
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,920
 actually pretty good. And I was like, "Oh, that sucks to that." You know, this whole

177
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,920
 story played out. But anyways, so the mythanthropic Luciferian order, we'll

178
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,560
 call them MLO. We'll... from here on out. But I do love saying that name because

179
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,400
 it's just so ridiculous. They have on their website, and again, this goes to

180
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,960
 show that the mentality of the people we're dealing with, these people believe

181
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:58,800
 that the Dark Gods are fighting against the God that most people know and that

182
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,960
 the anti-cosmic, the cosmic world we live in, is controlled by the evil God, but

183
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,760
 we're tricked into thinking he's a good God, and we have to, if we're given a blow,

184
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,560
 strike back with a thousand blows, or a hundred blows, or whatever it was, and

185
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:17,000
 don't be afraid to, like, kill our enemies and die for the Dark Gods. So this is

186
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,600
 from an interview that a couple of the leaders gave quite a while back. "What

187
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,400
 does it take for someone to become a member of MLO?" So Noxifer is the one

188
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:31,920
 answering this. "For a candidate to become a member of MLO, he/she must wholeheartedly

189
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,600
 sympathize with the misanthropic and anti-cosmic values of our order, and also

190
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:44,480
 be over 18 years of age." Again, why do you care how old they are? I mean, I get

191
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,960
 legally you have to care, but if you're like, "Oh, the whole universe is against

192
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:54,240
 us and the real Dark Gods are the ones in control," why do you follow any rules at

193
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,960
 all? Why don't they go, we get them when they're three, and we just like pound

194
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:03,240
 heavy metal music into their ears and really get it? Because why do you care?

195
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,280
 Why do you, following any laws, or wearing any clothes, or speaking any

196
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,680
 language, you should just be like, "I reject everything. Everything comes from an

197
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,600
 evil God and an evil society. I reject it all. I'm gonna walk around bucknakin and

198
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,580
 recruit 15 year olds." Like, what do you care? Why do you care? And why are you

199
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:26,720
 saying he/she? Why are you being so polite and gender-neutral? I don't understand

200
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,320
 the mentality of these guys. At one point they want to be like these feared

201
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,240
 rebels, and on the other side they're being like, "But first we must follow the

202
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:41,600
 laws." And they there them, like, "What is going on with these dudes?" So MLO was this

203
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,920
 anti-cosmic Satanist group, and they were basically in this big black metal band.

204
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,320
 They had a bunch of members, I think probably like less than 50 at the

205
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,800
 time, but it was enough they sat around, they did whatever drugs they do. I don't

206
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,060
 that's probably stereotype, but... And they sacrificed cats. So if you're a cat

207
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:05,400
 lover, you automatically hate these people. And two of the leaders, the guy who

208
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:12,160
 was in the band, his name was John, I can't say his last name, Nadhvit, and then

209
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,760
 he says his accomplice, Vlaad. I don't have the last name for the Vlaad written

210
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,640
 down here, but Vlaad, I'm sure I'll remember that. They start saying, "We're

211
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,720
 sacrificing cats and that's cool and all." But you know what the dark gods really

212
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,640
 want us to do? They want us to kill somebody, a human. They want us to make a

213
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:35,240
 human sacrifice. So this is the tipping point for any cult. Someone says we got

214
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:40,760
 to step it up a notch. Let's fight the government, or let's, you know, kill, do a

215
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:47,600
 human sacrifice or whatever. In very uncult-like fashion, and I am happily

216
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,800
 surprised, the rest of the members of the cult left. They're like, "Nope, we didn't

217
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,320
 sign up for this. Killing cats, that's one thing. We're not gonna kill a human."

218
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,920
 They left. So the only people left in the cult at that time in the misanthropic

219
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:06,720
 Luciferian order was Vlaad, John, and Vlaad's girlfriend. And so this is a

220
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,640
 summer of 1997. And John and Vlaad are out walking around kind of like bar hop and

221
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:18,280
 stuff like that. They meet this young man named Joseph Ben Meador. He was a, I

222
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,160
 think he was a Nigerian immigrant. They're in Norway. So they're hanging out,

223
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,320
 they're talking, and Joseph goes, "Hey, you guys kind of look like Satanists. Like,

224
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,480
 would you tell me more about your beliefs?" And they're like, "Yeah, sure." Again,

225
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,160
 like, you know, Joseph's just kind of asking some questions. They're walking

226
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,720
 along and eventually John and Vlaad kind of get the impression that Joseph is gay.

227
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:43,560
 And that angers them so much. They hate gay people. They hate them more than they

228
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:48,320
 hate the cosmic God. And again, this goes against your own beliefs. Why do you care

229
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,120
 about someone's morality? And he's just showing you love and he didn't give you

230
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,680
 a blow. He didn't strike you down. He didn't do anything. And they're just so

231
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:03,520
 angry with him that they make the decision then to kill him. So they walk

232
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,360
 back. They spend quite a long time walking around. It's dark now. And they

233
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,480
 invite him into their house. And Joseph, when they got to the house, Joseph decided

234
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,160
 not to go in for whatever reason. He probably got his little spider-sense

235
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,240
 tingling. And they're like, "Okay." And then John says, "Okay, let me go grab some."

236
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,800
 And he goes in, he grabs a taser and a pistol, and he goes, "Let's walk to the

237
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:29,440
 park and we'll discuss Satanism a little more." Now, that is an offer I

238
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,560
 would not accept. You want to go to Starbucks and talk about it? Fine. But I'm

239
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,600
 not gonna go to a park with you at three in the morning. But Joseph went and

240
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,600
 they're walking along and they shot him with a taser. There's a

241
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,840
 debate over who shot who. But they shot him with a taser and it didn't take. He

242
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:51,160
 didn't get taste. So he takes off running and then one of the two used the gun and

243
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:55,480
 shot him twice and killed him. Eventually the cops caught up to him. It was this big

244
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,800
 thing because they couldn't identify the body. Then the gay man's lover was

245
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,520
 arrested but he got let free because he didn't do it. And they caught these two

246
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,120
 guys and then they eventually confessed because even though they're like hardcore

247
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:12,840
 waging war against God, you know, a cop, a beat cop can break it out of him. The

248
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,240
 police can never figure out if he was killed as a satanic worship or as a

249
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,240
 hate crime. They couldn't, but they just knew that they killed him. These guys got

250
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:26,800
 ten years in prison for killing this dude. And then John, John Notavet, after he got

251
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:31,920
 out of jail he hung himself or I think he, I know, no, he shot himself. He was

252
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:36,160
 surrounded by candles and he had like this satanic grimoire in front of him.

253
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,920
 And what is, what a way to go. I just think that that's just so grim and sad.

254
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,600
 And you know you die and you're like, oh man, that was all made up. Should have

255
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,120
 figured it was made up because I wrote it in a three-ring binder with a big like

256
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,440
 mega death sticker on the cover. Like I really kind of botched that one. But

257
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,080
 anyway, so I'm trying not to make light of his death. I think that's tragic. I

258
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,120
 don't think that. I wish he hadn't killed himself even though he had killed

259
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:07,040
 somebody, but so that, you know, to put a pin on it, that's really, I think the,

260
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:14,560
 that's where if your religious commandments are, blow everything up.

261
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:22,480
 You're going to, your religion is going to blow up. If your religion is, you know,

262
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:29,120
 everything sucks. We were descended from demons and the one person that's supposed

263
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,760
 to take care of you, that invisible man in the sky, is the bad guy. And now we have

264
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,680
 to side with these dark, dark creatures, the dark ones. You call them the dark

265
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,280
 ones. Spoiler alert, your religion is going to explode and it's going to

266
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,920
 explode in blood and violence. And I do have to say this too, killing people is

267
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:53,440
 super tacky, super tacky. I've talked about that before. Oh, big deal. You killed a

268
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,640
 guy. Oh, he's blood sacrificed. Whatever, dude. You want to be, you want to be like a

269
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:05,920
 true agent of chaos? You could ravage for five dollars. You could destroy entire

270
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:11,680
 ecosystems. You could buy like kudzu vines or creeping vines or that, that horrible

271
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:16,240
 stuff. Those, you could buy plants from around the world and they just throw

272
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,240
 seeds out of your window as you're driving through Idaho. And then in five years

273
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:26,640
 they're going to be like, why the fuck are all of our crops being choked out by

274
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,280
 these horrible vines? Where did these come from? Go buy some fresh water

275
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,400
 crocodiles and just like throw babies into the river, not human babies.

276
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,440
 Throw a bunch of baby crocodiles into a river as you're driving down the road.

277
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,760
 You only need two guys and it'll start populating. It'll completely, that's

278
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,720
 Satanism. That's completely like destroying an area for generations and

279
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,960
 generations. Salt the earth. Oh, dude, you know what? Slipping in the bathtub will

280
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,560
 kill somebody. That's lame. I just get so fed up where they're like, yeah, do

281
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,600
 sacrifice. Oh, don't get me started on serial killers. Serial killers are the

282
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,120
 most overrated of all the killers easily and they're just so fucking tacky.

283
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,160
 I'm getting worked up. I'm getting worked up because this young dude died because

284
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,440
 these two people wanted to prove how badass they were because they were

285
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,920
 believing that nonsense. And yes, people believe all sorts of nonsense in

286
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:27,200
 religions. They do all sorts of horrible things. But this, I mean, come on, dark

287
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:33,200
 ones and blowing dudes and then you got to blow them 100 times. It's just, it's

288
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:39,760
 all nonsense. It's all nonsense. So the next story is going to be, I figure,

289
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,400
 we're kicking off Halloween, Halloween month. I think you guys know, if you

290
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,120
 listen to the podcast regularly, which some of you do and some of you don't, I

291
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,000
 really, you know, happy that anyone listens to it, even if it's just for an

292
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,480
 episode. But you know, I'm a fan of zombies. I'm a fan of zombie books and

293
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,040
 zombie movies. Pretty much zombies, anything. I still watch The Walking Dead.

294
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,840
 And the question always is, is how realistic are zombies? There's stuff like

295
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,360
 The Living Dead, which I think is the least realistic that usually would

296
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:13,280
 require some sort of like magic or some sort of apocalyptic bib.

297
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:26,880
 Nope. Stop. Stop. Okay. So this is Jason from the future. Now, if you're listening

298
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,200
 to this podcast in the archives, like if you've, if you've just started finding

299
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,600
 Dead Rabbit, you've been listening through, or if you're listening to it

300
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,800
 again after the first time, I did re- so originally there was a song here that I

301
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:49,200
 performed called Dead World. Spoiler alert, Dead World part one was in this

302
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:55,920
 episode. Now it was a mixtape, so I was rapping over somebody else's beat.

303
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,440
 Now, you know, in the world of rap or whatever, that's really not a big deal,

304
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,120
 but once you get into things like podcasting, if you fall into, I didn't

305
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,920
 get a copyright claim against me, but I wanted to get in front of it before it

306
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,040
 happened. I didn't want to be three, four hundred episodes in, and then someone

307
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,280
 goes, "Hey, my instrumental is used on that song." And to be fair, the producer of that

308
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,560
 beat, you know, deserves to get the credit. I don't even remember who made it, but

309
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:23,200
 all the other music on the podcast, I are their own completely, like the intro and

310
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,480
 the outro song, or it's free stock music, but the two rap songs that I

311
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,760
 ended up performing on the podcast, I just, it wasn't worth the hassle, but just

312
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,080
 let you know they have not disappeared into the ether. Dead World part one,

313
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,640
 there's going to be a YouTube link below, I guess below, you're on a podcast,

314
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,080
 so there's no below, but in your show notes, if you are so inclined, you can

315
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,400
 listen to the rap song that I did take out of here. But I'm in the future.

316
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,400
 This episode was recorded the first of October, I believe. Now it's November

317
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:01,280
 11th, 12th, I think my brother's birthday was yesterday. But yeah, so I will see

318
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:07,600
 you when you catch up to the present day. Whoa, disappearing now, how...
