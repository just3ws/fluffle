1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
 Today we're gonna look at one topic but different sides of it.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,800
 Sherry Schreiner, she's back but we got the serious stuff out of the way.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:17,040
 Today we're gonna talk about the prayers that you can use to fight the reptile alien overlords

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,960
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,120
 Garbinder. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,800
 Let's go ahead and move on to our first story. Now our first story is a continuation of the

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,720
 Sherry Schreiner thing. Now on Monday we did the episode that talked about a murder that involved

9
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:50,400
 two of her cult members. Followers however you want to describe it, disciples. She obviously

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,720
 doesn't think she's in a cult. They don't think they're in a cult so whatever. But one of them

11
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,320
 murdered the other one. It was interesting that was Monday's episode if you didn't hear it.

12
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,240
 On Tuesday's episode we talked about the life of Sherry Schreiner in her own words.

13
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:09,120
 She talked about her journey of being tormented by Lucifer or act technically. Lucifer is top

14
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:16,800
 general from childhood because she is set up to become one of the main players in the

15
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,480
 Battle of Armageddon. She is destined by God. God tells her through Bible codes. I didn't get

16
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,400
 into that yesterday because it's just way too complicated. But God talks to her using the

17
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,640
 Bible. She does this Bible code thing and finds her name and all this stuff in it. She's

18
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:37,520
 King David's granddaughter. And she believes that Lucifer is using reptilian, alien, demonic

19
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:46,320
 beans. They're all just squished into one. Just all those stupid things morphed into one big old

20
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:53,200
 dumb thing. Floating around attacking people. Trying to soul scalp us and live in our body.

21
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:00,880
 Trying to basically be the big bad of the universe. And it's her job to work with God

22
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,960
 to stop them. There's a bunch of stuff too which I haven't been able to make heads or tails of

23
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:12,000
 about how Jesus isn't really Jesus and Jews are terrible people. And I'm like I thought you were

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,600
 Christian. It gets really bizarre but at a certain point I just had to call it. I had to be like

25
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:23,520
 okay I've done enough research on this. Maybe someday I'll address her bizarre "I hate Jesus"

26
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:31,360
 stuff. But let's go ahead and move on to this segment. Now this was again a thing I go this

27
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,840
 I can't cram all this into one episode about Sherry Schreiner. Because on her website

28
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,800
 she has a frequently asked questions. Which you guys are like wait no no it tells about her

29
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:48,000
 eating Jesus thing. Maybe someday. Maybe someday. But on her website she has a frequently asked

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,520
 questions. Which is very very common. Every website has these. That's nothing out of the ordinary.

31
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,120
 What is out of the ordinary though are her frequently asked questions. Now obviously if you go to

32
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,720
 Bank of America's frequently asked questions they're going to be things like

33
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,880
 how do I set up a checking account. How often can I withdraw money from a savings account?

34
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,720
 If you go to Alex Jones frequently asked questions there tend to be stuff like

35
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,640
 who are you. The most frequently asked question would be like who are you and Alex Jones would

36
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,720
 be like I'm this guy. And then you'd go down a couple questions and it'd be like

37
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,160
 why do you think the Illuminati's trying to take over the planet. He'd be like well this is why

38
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,960
 Illuminati's trying to take over the planet so on and so forth. Frequently asked questions.

39
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,840
 The questions you get tired of answering all the time so you just put them in a form.

40
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,560
 And generally the first question is the one you are asked the most. Right? Because you just want

41
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,560
 to cut to the chase. You want to know how to open a checking account. You want to know who Alex Jones

42
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,880
 is. Frequently asked questions. Her very very first question on the frequent and this sets the tone

43
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,840
 for the rest of them. Her very very first question on the frequently asked questions is

44
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:03,280
 it's actually not even a question. It's a statement which I imagine people were writing in all caps

45
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,120
 to her and she goes I should create a frequently asked statement. I mean questions.

46
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:16,320
 Very first one. I'm hearing voices. If that's the most frequently asked question you are being asked

47
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:23,200
 and you're not a psychologist or psychiatrist you might want to reevaluate your audience base.

48
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,600
 The number one question people ask and it's not even a question. They're just saying I'm hearing

49
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,680
 voices and she's like yeah it's because you're under attack from the evil forces. Next one.

50
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,760
 I'm being followed. Again not a question and it really you're like obviously the people that

51
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,600
 are communicating. There's one of two things. She doesn't know what a frequently asked questions

52
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,880
 is. Sherri Schreiner has no idea what this is supposed to be but she seems a little more savvy

53
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,200
 than that. It could be she's tired of getting emails where people saying I'm being followed.

54
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,800
 I'm being followed and so she put this up here. Spoiler alert. The answer to I'm being followed

55
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:05,600
 is the same one as I'm hearing voices. You just pray. You pray to Yahshua not Jesus not Jesus

56
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,360
 to Yahshua and he'll protect you. I'm being harassed. Now this one she gets a little more

57
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:18,240
 specific and not a question. I'm being harassed. Ask Yahweh to stop the harassment being targeted

58
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,960
 against you. That's reasonable. And to chain them and cast those involved into the abyss.

59
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:31,360
 Bit of an overreaction. And though you're thinking oh she's quite cruel to people and I'm like no

60
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,280
 no no you don't let me finish. She goes on to say if they are humans that are behind the harassment

61
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,880
 instead of those reptilian demons flowing around. If they are humans behind the harassment.

62
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:47,920
 Ask Yahweh to break their equipment beyond repair. No chance. You can't take it to geek squad.

63
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,960
 Like this stuff literally disintegrates in their hands. It has to be beyond repair

64
00:05:52,960 --> 00:06:00,960
 and send them into derision in the name of Yahshua. Now I don't know if into derision is a thing.

65
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:08,000
 Glarium maybe? Isn't derision where someone makes fun of you? But anyways that's her thing. Next

66
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,640
 question. Again none of these are questions. I think I have chip implants. This is like

67
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,280
 number five or six on her list of most frequently asked questions. Easy fix though.

68
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,200
 If you think the aliens have implanted you with something she says you can deactivate chip implants

69
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:30,880
 with neodym magnets. Now what they are there's little magnets that you put in your ear. Super

70
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,800
 powerful apparently because we'll get to that in a second. You put the magnets in your ear.

71
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,480
 You put tape over it and you wear it for 24 hours. I would do a side note to that advice.

72
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,240
 Don't leave your house for 24 hours because everyone you see will go "what happened to your

73
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:52,640
 ear?" and you just be like "mh magnet aliens put a chip in my head." Yeah you want to avoid that

74
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:59,600
 conversation. So if you do do this if you put a super strong magnet next to your brain and tape it

75
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:05,360
 there just stay inside. Next question. This is actually a question and this is a very important

76
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:11,040
 question. It ties into the last one about taping magnets into your ear. Next question. I have

77
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:20,960
 a defib... I'll try pronouncing this right. I have a defib... I have a defib... I have a defib...

78
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:27,840
 I have a defib... you know okay that stupid thing. The thing that um... defib... the thing that um...

79
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:36,480
 defibb... this isn't a bit. I can't say it. A defibbrelator. I have a defibbrelator and I'm

80
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:42,240
 wondering if it is safe to use the neodym magnet on my body. Actual question. It took us a while to

81
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,320
 get to one of these. Great question. This is a response. Neodym magnets are very powerful and

82
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:57,200
 strong. I would not use them if you are on a defibbrelator, pacemaker, or any any type of machine

83
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,760
 without approval from a doctor first. And the reason why I'm including that one in this list

84
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:08,480
 is I would love to hear that conversation between a patient and a doctor. Dude as a pacemaker

85
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,720
 comes into the doctor's office and says "Hey, I hear from my check up. Yeah, everything's going.

86
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,200
 Doing a check and stuff out. You look great. Hey doc, before you go, I was wondering... I have a

87
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:23,280
 question. Can I tape magnets in my ear? The doctor would be like "What are you talking about? First

88
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,960
 off, no. You shouldn't even be around magnets. You shouldn't even be around people with magnetic

89
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,760
 personalities. You can't even be around a Mr. Rooley toy. Not at all." And he's like "Ah, because

90
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,640
 I think I got a chip in my head." At that point your doctor's writing you a referral to somebody

91
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,080
 else. But I would love to see a conversation between a patient and a doctor about whether or not

92
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:53,200
 they can tape powerful magnets into their head. Here's another great... Here's another... Again,

93
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:59,920
 if this is a question people are asking, you're either in the wrong line of work or you are

94
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:06,160
 having a ball. Because this is actually a pretty dumb question, a statement. "I have laser beams

95
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,400
 coming into my house through my windows." That's kind of charming. It's kind of like so sci-fi and

96
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,840
 paranoid and so ridiculous. Like I'm hearing voices. I'm being followed. That could be someone with

97
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,880
 like a serious mental disorder. But if someone comes to you and is like "Oh man, you won't believe

98
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,960
 my thing today." Laser beams came through my windows and started bouncing around my house. That is

99
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:36,560
 beautiful. You know what's really weird? I just had massive deja vu. I'm pretty sure I told a story

100
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,160
 or did a segment before about laser beams coming through windows and that whole setup. I think

101
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,360
 it was either deja vu or I did that exact same bit episodes ago and I can't really think of what

102
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,560
 episode it was. Weird. Like super deja vu. As I was saying it, I was like "I did this bit before. I

103
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,680
 made this joke about someone going you won't believe my day." Anyways, this is her advice. The laser

104
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,800
 beam messages come through my window and giving me deja vu. This is her advice. "Cover the windows

105
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,840
 they are using to hit you with laser beams with mylar blankets. You can get them at Amazon for

106
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:14,480
 dollars for 12. Really? What was this written? 1994? That's super cheap. Oh and then it says

107
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,640
 "Also ask y'all way to break their equipment beyond repair." Yeah just do that too. Throw up

108
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,920
 the mylar blankets and then pray to God and just make all of their laser beams malfunction,

109
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,760
 which is actually very very dangerous prayer. God's like "Yeah sure whatever" and all of a sudden

110
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,440
 the entire town gets vaporized by these things. So you're like "Jason, yes frequently asked questions.

111
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,760
 It's all well and good, but you promised me. You promised me space brother. You promised me

112
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:48,000
 how I could defeat the evil ones and protect them myself." And you're right I did space brother.

113
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,960
 That's a term that's used on her website quite a lot. Derogatory too. There are no such thing as

114
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:59,760
 space brothers. Only Yahweh and Yahshua can help you. I don't know how many people go around using

115
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,040
 the term space brother, but anyways. Except for us now. Here's some prayers. These are prayers that

116
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:11,760
 you have to repeat verbatim. Very very important because it's almost like a spell. You can't fiddle

117
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,880
 around with these. These are prayers that you can use to protect yourself and to launch retaliatory

118
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:24,400
 attacks. There are dozens of them, but I've selected two because most of them are really in the vein

119
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,080
 of what we're going to talk about. The first one is a general prayer. It's just a general protection

120
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:34,240
 prayer. We have just the standard "Now I lay me down to sleep, pray the Lord my soul to keep."

121
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,360
 And then what's the Lord's prayer? "Our Father run in heaven, how would be they name?" All that stuff.

122
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,560
 General prayers. This is her version of that. Heavenly Father. Bow your heads guys. Bow your

123
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:51,200
 heads. Now first off, let me say after doing that joke, I'm not making fun of prayer in general.

124
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,160
 I'm making fun of this nonsense. When I was preparing this thing, when I was like, "Ah,

125
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,240
 maybe this is a little sacrilegious, but so everyone close your eyes, bow your heads."

126
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,000
 Heavenly Father. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, weird, not Yahshua, but in the name of

127
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,280
 the Lord Jesus Christ, I asked you in Jesus's name, so bizarre. I'm wondering if these were

128
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,120
 copy pasted or somewhere else, because she doesn't seem to be a huge fan of that dude,

129
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,880
 or doesn't use that name, but okay, sorry, it's not an interrupt our prayer. It's all in a moment.

130
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,640
 Heavenly Father, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I ask you in Jesus's name to please send

131
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:30,880
 hundreds, hundreds, hundreds, and hundreds of millions of legions of angels to surround me,

132
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:39,200
 and encamp around me, and set up angelic shields, protective devices, impenetrable force fields,

133
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:45,200
 and angels to protect me against every attack of the enemy. In Jesus's name I pray, amen.

134
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,720
 Please put upon me the full armor of God. Please put upon me the spiritual camouflage

135
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,880
 to make me invisible to the enemy. Please put me upon the armor light, the breastplate of righteousness,

136
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,200
 the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit. In Jesus's name I pray,

137
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:12,320
 amen. Walking slowly away from an explosion. Now the spiritual armor is really in the Bible,

138
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,800
 like they do talk about that, it's allegorical, but they do talk about the spiritual armor. I've

139
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,640
 never heard of the spiritual camouflage to make me the ghillie suit, the holy ghillie suit, so you

140
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:28,400
 can like creep around as all the demons are like, where did he go? And you're just like disguised

141
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,440
 as a rock in the corner, demons like, I'm gonna sit on this rock. You're like, oh, these guys live

142
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,840
 to be quite long, this could take a while. But anyways, very specific. Set up some angelic shields,

143
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:46,080
 that's kind of a sweet imagery. Protective devices, what gear does an angel carry? Do they have like

144
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:51,760
 a Batman belt? And they're like, oh, better get my anti-reptile spray. Are they setting up like

145
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,000
 little Geiger counters in case any sort of radioactive alien? What protective devices?

146
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:04,800
 In penetrable force fields, is there any other kind? Who, who, who requests a penetrable force

147
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,720
 field? Why do you need that extra word in there? What type of force field do you want? I don't,

148
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,120
 I don't care, it can be penetrated, it doesn't matter to me. They should all be in penetrable.

149
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,160
 Anyways, then there's a bunch of other prayers regarding a bunch of other kooky stuff, but they're

150
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:27,520
 really, again, verbatim and, and I can't figure out, first off, I don't think I'm gonna be able to

151
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,080
 make it all the way through this, but I almost feel like I have to because it just keeps getting

152
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:38,080
 weirder. So this one is to break attacks on yourself. So let's say you're like, I think someone

153
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,720
 shooting laser beams through my windows. And she's like, check the frequently asked questions first,

154
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,280
 and then come back and I'll have a prayer for you to break an attack on yourself. And you're like,

155
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:52,640
 okay, so you have a prayer to break attacks from laser beams in my windows, and she goes kind of,

156
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:59,120
 I have one to break attacks on everything. You're like, that sounds awesome. She's like,

157
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,800
 sit and pray with me then young man, heavenly father, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,

158
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:12,480
 I break, crush, dissolve and destroy every satanic attack. And you're like, oh, that's cool.

159
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:18,160
 Satan, Satan, Satan worshipers use lasers. That's cool. You know, let me finish. Druid witch attack,

160
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:26,160
 Wicca witch attack, cabal a witch attack, wizard attack, shaman attack, witch doctor attack. When's

161
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:32,480
 the last time someone has been attacked by a witch doctor? When was this written like 1600s?

162
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:39,040
 Witch doctor attack, witchcraft attack. And just when you think, oh, okay, he's just going to list

163
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,280
 stuff all is when I was reading and I was like, oh, there's like right when you start to lose interest.

164
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:51,760
 She says vampire attack, werewolf attack. So now these things are real too. Vampire attack,

165
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:58,560
 werewolf attack, Santaria attack, playing too much to blame, voodoo attack, magical attack,

166
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,680
 which for some reason that's not already like bundled in with all the witch stuff, sorcery attack,

167
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:09,120
 Luciferian attack, demonic attack, satanic attack, psychic attack, telepathic attack,

168
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,760
 mental attack, remote viewing attack, mind control attack, radio onyx attack, psychotronic attack,

169
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:24,480
 psionic attack, death signal attack. Why would you need any other attack if you had options

170
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:31,600
 to pull a death signal attack? And what is it doesn't say just moves on to disease signal attack.

171
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:40,640
 What? Use those. I'm not worried about the witch doctor attack. And again, if you're only being

172
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:46,320
 harassed by a witch doctor, if you are alvin and the chipmunks looking for a map or whatever they

173
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,200
 were doing in that movie, you still have to say please don't attack me with the death signal.

174
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:57,520
 You have to do this whole thing. Scalar wave attack, tesla wave attack, laser wave attack,

175
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:03,360
 see that's why we got into this prayer in the first place. We had to do all of that ELF attack,

176
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:09,760
 RF attack, microwave attack, magnetic attack, acoustic attack, that's a dope name for a band,

177
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:15,280
 infrared attack, and every kind of attack that I don't know the name of.

178
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:23,920
 So why don't you just say please lord protect me from any sort of made up nonsense that some

179
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:29,200
 lunatic could have gotten ahold of, found an ancient book or some UFO technology and is using

180
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,240
 it against me. Thank you amen. But you have to list them all. Because technically you don't know

181
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,280
 and that catch all at the end, I may not even know what it is that's attacking me, but I have to list

182
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:46,400
 all of this stuff, but we're not done. That's just the first part of the prayer. So you're saying it

183
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,640
 and you're like great I'm not going to attack by aliens anymore. Now I need a time wasting attack

184
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,960
 as this person is still praying with you. This is the rest of it. Every person plays thing,

185
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:06,640
 witch, a cult source, psychic source, machine, any machine, cash register or terminator, they both

186
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:14,800
 apply, satanist, druid witch, wickowitch, cabala witch, wizard, this is, I'm not just listening

187
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,120
 stuff, this is actually part of the prayer. First one was against the attacks, now we have to protect

188
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:25,360
 ourselves from the people listing the attacks, which is oddly more than the attacks themselves.

189
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:31,680
 Cabala witch, wizard, shaman, witch doctor, this guy's back, I want to meet this dude. Vampire

190
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:36,160
 werewolf, they're still around, santeria practitioner, voodoo practitioner, remote viewing

191
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:42,080
 operator, radionics operator, psychotronic operator, psionic operator, pine gap group,

192
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:48,720
 who are these dudes? Who, again, right when you start losing interest, now a bunch of

193
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:55,600
 made up stuff shows up. Who are the pine gap group? What puts them on the same level as a vampire?

194
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:01,520
 Or a witch doctor? Pine gap group, never heard of them before, some probably some,

195
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,920
 they're either one of two things, completely made up or some super obscure conspiracy theory.

196
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:11,520
 I'll see if I can find more information on them. MIB, they're listed here, ACO, ACO,

197
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,480
 PsyCorp, we're getting some acronyms here, so I'm gonna skip those. Military group, intelligence

198
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,400
 group, army group, navy group, air force group, marine corps group, where's Coast Guard? Coast

199
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,400
 Guard group? They're not coming after me, a bunch of more acronyms here, MI5, MI6,

200
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:32,880
 Mars defense force group, and then finally the reptilian group, the draconian group, the gray

201
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:42,800
 group, and the insect group, and every name, and every group I don't know the name of.

202
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:49,920
 So just say everybody, just say please lord, protect me from every attack, from every person,

203
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:55,280
 ever, please. Also, no more lasers in my house, and God's like, I'll see what I can do.

204
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:03,280
 So, and then that has the standard like, thank you Jesus, I'll pray to you, just that's not

205
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,480
 technically the end of it, but the rest of it is not funny, it's just normal prayer stuff. So if

206
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,560
 you're like, God damn it, they said I really needed to stop the witch doctor sending laser

207
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:17,600
 beams in my house, you can look it up in the show notes. But before we go, yes, there is more,

208
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:23,920
 because we want to see how well these spells work, obviously, right? We want to see how well

209
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:31,040
 these spells work. She has a list called "Fun Things to Do as a Warrior for the Most High." So

210
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:37,120
 using the prayers she has taught you, and the knowledge she has given you to fight the good

211
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:43,520
 fight against the draconian alien overlords led by Lucifer to herald in Armageddon, here's some

212
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,600
 fun things you can do. There's 61 of them, I'm not going to read them all, because they start to get

213
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:53,360
 pretty derivative after a certain point. So once you've studied about her, and you've studied her

214
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,240
 teachings, and you've learned all of her prayers, you can say them, could you imagine memorizing that

215
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:04,160
 prayer? I mean, the Lord's Prayer is pretty simple. It's not "Our Father in Arna Heaven,

216
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,760
 please protect us from witch doctors and voodoo priests and kabbalah priests." Like,

217
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,880
 imagine having to memorize that. I'm sure some people do. But anyways, you memorize the prayers,

218
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,400
 learn the teachings. These are things you can do. Fun things you can do as a warrior for the most

219
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:24,880
 high. Number one, their automatic doors and their underground bases don't work for a day. For "Yah,"

220
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:33,120
 who's basically Yahweh, she's on a first syllable basis with God. She can just call him Yah. For

221
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,080
 "Yah," to put them in confusion as to what's wrong with them, and don't let them be able to be fixed

222
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:44,960
 for 24 hours. That'll teach those reptilian demons that are eating humans and taking their souls.

223
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:52,880
 Their doors won't work for 24 hours. You'll notice a trend that all of these fun things you can do

224
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:59,120
 with your special powers take place in underground remote facilities where you can never see if

225
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:05,360
 they're true. So you can basically pray and then go, "Take that automatic doors and go about your

226
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,240
 business and assume that somewhere down there there's a reptilian trapped in an elevator." But

227
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,000
 you don't know. So that's the first one. Their automatic doors and their under... That's the

228
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,360
 first one too. That was the first one she came up with. That's her most clever one.

229
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,320
 The automatic doors and their underground bases don't work for a day. Number two,

230
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,520
 the water sources get mysteriously blocked and stop flowing into the underground bases in cities for

231
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:34,320
 a day. Now at this point I'm thinking, yes, reptilian demonic aliens are plotting the overthrow of

232
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,800
 the planet and the death of God, but you know there probably are some like elderly ones down there.

233
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:45,040
 They've been here for quite a long time and they're just kind of frail and they have like their

234
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,920
 little hover walker and stuff like that and they're like, "Oh, I gotta watch the molding girls." That's

235
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,240
 our version of the golden girls where they're just moldy because they're reptiles. It was a stupid

236
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:00,160
 joke. But anyways, he's floating around down there and then the doors don't work and there's no

237
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:07,600
 water and he suffers and dies. Like I get that he's a demon reptile, but there's demon reptiles on

238
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,720
 defibrillators down there. And the doctor's like, "I don't know what happened. I tried getting in

239
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,760
 there. He died very slowly. We tried giving him some water. There was no water and people are

240
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,840
 going, "What's going on with the state of the art facility? This should be amazing. Why did my uncle

241
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,120
 reptile die? He never got to see the end of the molding girls." Never saw that end. Number three,

242
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,120
 their computer is malfunctioned and everything has to be reformatted. That's come on, man. That's

243
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:37,600
 basic. Four, elevator stop working and grind to a slow halt. Wanted to be better that they just

244
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,800
 stopped working and the people in them plummeted to their death? You're at war. You're at war with

245
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:48,000
 these reptile people. I know it just builds up the image of a sympathetic grandpa alien demon,

246
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,440
 but you're at war with these people. You want to just go to a slow halt? Five, this is actually

247
00:23:53,440 --> 00:24:00,720
 disgusting and this kind of sets off a trend. Their food supply gets covered in worms. Now,

248
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,560
 if I came home and all my food was covered in worms, I'd be pretty grossed out. But if I was a

249
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:11,120
 reptile, I don't think that would bug me. If I was a human who had the soul of a reptile, I would just

250
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:18,880
 be like free grub, literally. Don't reptiles eat worms? Aren't you basically then they're like,

251
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,600
 "Yes, our prayers come true. More worms!" That's what everyone's celebrating down in the city.

252
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,640
 Number six, the power supply intermittently goes on and off of that warning. Again, poor grandpa

253
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:35,680
 demon sitting in bed. His life support. So bizarre. But anyway, okay, seven, underground

254
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,840
 vehicles, not vehicles. You can confirm underground vehicles get flat tires for no apparent reason.

255
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,960
 Basic stuff. And it's weird because some of them are straight up like plagues of Egypt,

256
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,720
 where you're making worms magically appear. And then the other one is some guy, some reptilians,

257
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,880
 like, "Golly, my tire is flat and I don't know why." Is there an underground tunnel and they're like,

258
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,160
 "Guess we'll just walk." Nine, we're skipping, we're gonna start skipping some now. Nine,

259
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:09,120
 their consciousness becomes seared with the judgment and righteousness of the most high.

260
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,840
 That's some ghost rider stuff right there. That's basically like people have a flat tire,

261
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,640
 they're stuck in an elevator, uncle reptile just passed away because the electricity went off,

262
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,600
 there's a bunch of worms everywhere. And then all of a sudden they're seared, all of a sudden their

263
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,760
 brain is filled with the image of every sin they've ever committed and what the afterlife is going

264
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:35,120
 to be like, that's a total like, that should be your first one. Not people like, "Mmm, I wonder

265
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,160
 why this door won't work." And then they're like, "Oh my god, the righteousness of the one creator of

266
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:47,760
 the universe." Like that would be the equivalent of humans being the whole Senate Cthulhu existing

267
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:57,200
 in every human brain at once, would drive you mad. Not that, a flat tire versus that, versus eternal

268
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:04,240
 torment in a split second in your brain. Yeah. Anyways, 10, all bread mysteriously becomes moldy

269
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,640
 and inedible, food and machines won't work and the coffee becomes infested with bugs. That's after

270
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:16,640
 the everyone's soul is seared for a brief moment in time with the beauty of heaven and what they

271
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,360
 were never achieved. And they're like, "Oh my god, what happened? Oh my god, what happened? I need

272
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:28,320
 some coffee." They go to the coffee thing, a bunch of bugs everywhere. Next one after that, again,

273
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,440
 she peaked. She really peaked at nine. Next one after that, cell phones won't work as connections

274
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,200
 can't be made and they waste their minutes and time in roaming into oblivion one. When's the last

275
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,160
 time you ever counted your minutes on your cell phone? Two, she basically just described all of

276
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:51,040
 their cell phone carriers being sprint. That's it. It's not really a curse. That's just bad

277
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:55,280
 planning on your part of who you decided to go through for your cell phone provider.

278
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:01,680
 Now we get into the poop jokes. Now we get into the poop curses. Did you know? Did you know? I

279
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:06,480
 can never get that right. I can never do that voice the same each time. But did you know that

280
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,960
 reptilians and greys, they don't have buttholes? That is something you learned today on Dead Rabbit

281
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,760
 Radio. Due to Sherry Shryner, reptilians and greys do not have buttholes. They actually eliminate

282
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:21,680
 their waste through their skin. So if you try wrestling one and all of a sudden it starts to

283
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:26,480
 get slick, it's because it's peeing. And I'm pretty sure I did that joke before, honestly. I don't

284
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,040
 think I'm having deja vu unless I'm having a massive stroke. I think I've told that joke before. But

285
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:35,840
 anyways, reptilians and greys eliminate waste through their skin. This is number 12. Pray that

286
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:41,760
 their pores get blocked and they become constipated. See how they like that. I think they would just

287
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,960
 explode. If all their pores are supposed to release waste and their pores get sealed,

288
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,400
 actually that would suffocate them as well, because that's how we breathe at least.

289
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:56,080
 Oddly enough, number 23 gets personal. The guy who ran over Sherry's cat gets a

290
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:02,000
 demotion for pushing her buttons. What? That's it. Just a demotion? They're like,

291
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,480
 "You used to be the grand architect of hell. Now you're just the architect." No!

292
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,000
 Like, that's it? All this other stuff you're doing to torment cities full of people.

293
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:21,760
 And this guy just gets a demotion for running over a cat. Anyways, number 24 blocks sewer lines.

294
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:28,080
 This is verbatim. This is not me adding anything in here. Blocked sewer lines. So the reptilian

295
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:35,520
 turds will back up and float through every little nook and cranny. Oh yeah. Swim in your own

296
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:42,320
 kaka, you slime bags. I didn't add the "oh yeah" I didn't add the kaka or any of that ending that was

297
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,360
 all written down. But here's my thing. Weren't we just told that they eliminate their waste or their

298
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:53,200
 pores? How big can their kaka actually be? It would be like smaller than a rabbit's.

299
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:59,120
 But anyways, reptilian turds, which is also a great name for a man, will float through every

300
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,720
 nook and cranny. Number 45, they start to feel the true power of combined prayer from the most

301
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,520
 high people and wet themselves profusely. Not again just like they start to feel sorrow for the

302
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,240
 path they've chosen in life. They just start peeing everywhere. That's the goal of that prayer.

303
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:22,800
 And number 47, toilet paper stocks mysteriously vanish. 48, toilets and sewers get mysteriously

304
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:28,560
 blocked and back up causing floods in bathrooms and buildings everywhere. When you have the power

305
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:38,480
 of God at your disposal, what better way to fill the world with poop and pee and kaka from alien races?

306
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:45,040
 I don't think I've ever found a more- this was all on one page. It was frequently asked questions

307
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,400
 and I was doing the notes for that and I was like, "Oh, that'll be an interesting segment."

308
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,960
 And then I scrolled down a bit and it's like spiritual warfare. I was like, "Oh, okay." And

309
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,640
 then I'm reading those prayers and then I scrolled down a little bit more and it gave us 50 fun things

310
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:04,480
 to do. And I honestly don't think I found a more entertaining webpage ever on the internet. I think

311
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:12,400
 I had so much enjoyment reading this that I was like, "This is the internet to me." And what sucks

312
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:20,640
 is this stuff is so hidden. There's- we can estimate probably about five to ten thousand people who

313
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:26,160
 believe this stuff. They may not actively be following Sherry Schreiner, but I think that's a

314
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:32,800
 safe estimate given how much money she raised with her GoFundMe, which was $154,000. It was over the

315
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:37,440
 course of two years, but still they were all small donations. So I'd say probably around 5,000

316
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,160
 people, 6,000 people, believe her and it could be a lot more. Could be a lot more. That's what I'm

317
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:48,480
 saying, five to ten thousand. But to you and me, we read this and we laugh and we think this is

318
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:54,480
 hilarious. I think it's hilarious. You guys may have shut it off by now, but it's just this odd

319
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,960
 look at these beliefs these people truly believe. I just think I find it so fascinating that no

320
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,960
 matter how much nonsense you can throw out there, people will still believe it. But what intrigues

321
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:13,760
 me even more is that this story was submitted to me by Gary V. E-mail, just the Sherry Schreiner

322
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,680
 murder thing in general, and we've gotten all this information from it. And you wonder how many

323
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:27,360
 other groups are out there like this? How many other treasure troves of information do we have

324
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,640
 that are just lost somewhere on the internet? I feel like an internet archaeologist.

325
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:37,200
 I think sometimes it would be interesting to actually believe that this was real. I think it

326
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:43,440
 would be maddening. I think if you truly believed that there are people who believe in aliens,

327
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,680
 there's degrees. People who believe in aliens. And then there are people who believe that aliens

328
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:52,720
 are demons. And there's a sizable amount of both of those groups. Millions, I probably say,

329
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,640
 billions of people believe in aliens and millions of people believe that aliens are actually demons.

330
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,040
 And that's totally fine. I don't have a beef with that, even if I did it wouldn't matter,

331
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:07,040
 because it'd just be my opinion. But I think it's fascinating that they've, out of those groups,

332
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:12,800
 they keep whittling it down to you have a group, a sub-sub-subgroup, who believe that aliens are

333
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,440
 demons and Lucifer is planning to take over the world. And there's going to be a final battle

334
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,360
 of Armageddon. And those are all really well-known conspiracies. But then they believe that they

335
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:29,200
 are under assault because they are so important to God's plan for protecting the planet and the

336
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,000
 universe that Satan has singled them out. We talked about that a lot in yesterday's episode about

337
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,840
 the mythology we create for ourselves. And sometimes the mythology someone else creates for us to make

338
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:45,280
 us feel important. And they feel important because they feel like they are on the front lines of this

339
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,560
 war and they have this secret knowledge and they have these secret prayers and these powers and

340
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:54,960
 they're making doors not work 300 feet under the ground. But come on. Like at a certain point,

341
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:02,800
 it's so weird to me that people can watch your videos and people can believe all this stuff

342
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:10,560
 and then find that page I just read to you and still believe in it. But maybe that's just human

343
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:15,760
 nature. Maybe it's one of those things when you're talking to someone who has political beliefs

344
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:22,240
 different than your own and you have knowledge that says that this political party has done this

345
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,320
 bad thing or is doing this bad thing and you're trying to explain it to your friend and they're

346
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:31,760
 like, "but, but, but, but, but," and they'll run those circles. They'll try to rationalize it. And

347
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:37,040
 then after that conversation, you guys will go your different separate ways and generally people

348
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:44,240
 will maintain the same political or religious views even when evidence against it is put forth.

349
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:49,360
 Like factual evidence, not just feelings. Like actual factual evidence. So maybe it's just human

350
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:56,320
 nature to double down on the nonsense. At the end of the day though, if you think about it,

351
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:01,120
 is that if someone is having some sort of mental problem and they believe laser beams are coming

352
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:09,280
 into their window, I'm either going to laugh at them, probably not to their face, or say you might

353
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,320
 want to go see a psychiatrist, you might want to go check someone out. But to that person having that

354
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:20,400
 mental issue, that mental disorder, whatever it is, Sherry Shreiner is offering a concrete answer to

355
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:30,320
 that. Maybe that's the key. Maybe that's the key. It's not necessarily whether or not the questions

356
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:41,360
 are frequently asked. It's whether or not the answers sound good to you and work for you in the

357
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:47,440
 mind state you're in. DeadRabbitRadio@gmail.com is going to be our email address. You can also
