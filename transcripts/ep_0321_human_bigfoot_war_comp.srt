1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,040
 In the back hills of Arkansas in the year 1855

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,800
 Whoa horse whoa, what's gearing you so much?

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:21,520
 We have to stop these people but how we don't even know if they're people they're not people

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,280
 Pushing over a wagon

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,960
 wagon catches on fire

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:35,040
 Person standing in front of the silhouette of the fire. Yes, we don't know no human could push over

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,140
 No human could push over a wagon like that

8
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:48,460
 How echoing over the moonlit landscape of Arkansas we don't know how to stop these raiders

9
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:55,920
 You already said that where I'm saying it again. Dang it. We don't stop these people. They're not people

10
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,800
 Then what are they?

11
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:06,440
 They're the Bigfoot and this is the story of the human Bigfoot war of

12
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,600
 1855 today on Dead Rabbit Radio

13
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:26,960
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day

14
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,280
 I hope you guys are having a great day, too. You guys listen to yesterday's episode

15
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,720
 I think you can tell how how healthy I am which is not very

16
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:41,440
 The ending of that episode sounded like I was really trying not to cry at the story of Martin Guerrero

17
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,360
 I was holding in the cough for about 15 seconds

18
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,960
 And I was trying to say that final line so I could just finish the episode

19
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:55,360
 Cough and then go to sleep. Yeah, I don't know what it is. It could be the combination of me

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,720
 I've completely given up the nicotine. I'm not even on the patch anymore

21
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,680
 So I'm feeling kind of good, but I'm quite miserable could just be coming down with something because of the weather

22
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,080
 I don't know so this episode actually is only going to be one story, but it's a good story

23
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,680
 But so this episode is probably gonna be a little short

24
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,920
 I just need to get some more rest

25
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,160
 But I want it I'm glad I saved this one because I think this one is definitely one that can hold up its own episode

26
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:23,720
 Don't need anything else. So let's go ahead and jump into the Bigfoot human war or the human Bigfoot war

27
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,880
 I really don't think it matters which one comes first, but this is from the conspiracy iceberg

28
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,200
 This is also a recommendation from our Bigfoot or resident Bigfoot expert

29
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,640
 Bennett Bennett, thank you. This is one that I've actually had on the docket for quite a while

30
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,760
 I researched it probably like six seven months ago and just haven't reported it and then Bennett reminded me

31
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,880
 That it existed and I was like, oh, yeah, I already have the notes on this one

32
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,800
 So thank you Bennett for reminding me that of work that I had previously done

33
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,400
 Let's go ahead and jump into this

34
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,760
 So we're gonna get on our mighty steeds

35
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:01,320
 That sounds like a witch, but it's not we're not jumping on top of old-timey witches

36
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:06,520
 We're jumping on top of our horses getting on our mountian or horses. It's a better term

37
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,440
 You're not just jumping up and down on them. So get on your steed young traveler

38
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:17,960
 I'll eat your children. We're like, that's not a horse. You gotta get a real one. So we're taking our horses

39
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,960
 We're gonna ride back into time

40
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,960
 We're going back to the year 1855 we're going to the state

41
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,600
 of Arkansas now

42
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,600
 I think in 1855

43
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,200
 It was still pretty like yeah, there was a government there

44
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,760
 But it wasn't like super

45
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,480
 It wasn't like it is today

46
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,560
 I have no idea what I'm talking about

47
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,640
 What I'm trying to say is

48
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,640
 the state had like

49
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,280
 U.S. citizens in it and then a bunch of natives in it as well, which might again might be the case today

50
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,840
 But I think it was I'm trying to say it was probably more wildernessy wildernessy

51
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,840
 Okay, so

52
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,800
 Nowadays you can go to a little rock, but back then it was just rock

53
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,040
 It was just a giant rock. It hadn't been carved down yet by the settlers

54
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:09,560
 So we're riding through the wilderness of Arkansas on our horses on our mighty mighty steeds

55
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,920
 And we're gonna meet the Choctaw tribe and they're we're gonna meet a dude named Hamas Tubby

56
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,960
 So we're like poking his stomach. We're like, hey Tubby. Hey, he has a full on six pack

57
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:25,800
 This guy is a massive warrior. He's like you can call me Tubby. Oh, you want Tubby? You're the one who's Tubby

58
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,200
 Jason and I'm like, you're right

59
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,360
 But at least my name is not Tubby Hamas Tubby

60
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,880
 And he has a bunch of sons, right and they're recorded to be the Choctaw

61
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,680
 tribe is already a very tall native american tribe, but apparently

62
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,600
 Tubby and sons are pushing seven feet tall

63
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,000
 Seven feet tall. So a couple inches taller than me. So massive people, right?

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,200
 And they're in a group of even bigger dudes

65
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,880
 And while Hamas and company are chilling

66
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,040
 They're actually probably doing a lot to further the growth of their tribe

67
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,760
 But while they're in the area you start hearing reports of raiding parties

68
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,400
 People oh Tubby Tubby. I'm so glad you're here

69
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,760
 They're like, what's the matter dude? And he's like

70
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,000
 So I was walking with my girlfriend down by the river, right?

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,680
 and

72
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,120
 somebody like pushed us and then we ran away

73
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:28,760
 The native dudes like oh, well, that's that's that's quite rude. He got pushed and they're like, yeah, he got pushed

74
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:35,640
 Okay, you leave and then if someone else comes and they're like, oh Tubby Tubby. Oh my god

75
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,320
 I was I was just walking by the river

76
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:44,120
 But I had a bale of apples with me. I was carrying apples

77
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,920
 And something came out of the woods and pushed me over and took my apples

78
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,920
 And Tubby's like the plot of the plot thickens

79
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:58,120
 Now we have a motive for this pushing action that's going on and then

80
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,400
 No, no, okay

81
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,720
 So let me be clear here

82
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:10,200
 People weren't getting pushed at the river. The point is is that I was trying to build the narrative. There were multiple attacks

83
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,720
 By raiders in the area against people

84
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,760
 So whether or not apples or girlfriends were being pushed over the point is is that

85
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,320
 Someone kept attacking

86
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,320
 Choctaw natives in the area big people

87
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:31,960
 I mean if a Choctaw was like, oh my god, that guy was so huge Tubby knows. Hmm. That's interesting because we're the biggest people around

88
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,840
 And we haven't eaten apples in a while. So

89
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,520
 They're getting word of these raiding parties in the area

90
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,160
 Both at the river and beyond

91
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,840
 So they try to find out what's going on. Who's attacking their people and then

92
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:53,160
 Children start to disappear. So at this point Tubby's like, okay apples getting pushed or no apples getting pushed

93
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,840
 This has gotten serious like we have to take care of this kids are missing

94
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,320
 So they form up a

95
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:04,360
 Posse they form up a search party to find who is taking these people

96
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,640
 What they do is they have a 30 man crew

97
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,200
 So they're like load up boys

98
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,280
 Cloting up the rifles

99
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,840
 Putting bullets in

100
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,000
 Guys pulling up picture of his girlfriend

101
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,720
 He's kisses it puts it on the top of his horse so you can see these he's riding in the battle

102
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,280
 They're like, who's that? He's like, this is the girl I'm coming back to

103
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:30,120
 Puts it on there. Come on boys. Quit messing around get your guns ready. We got to go find some kid killers

104
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,760
 Like wait a second. How do you know they're killing the kids? He's like, I skipped ahead in the story

105
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:40,120
 So this group at the person who skipped ahead in the story. His name is joshua la flor

106
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,560
 He's half french half chock towel and he goes come on boys. Let's do this

107
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,120
 We're gonna find these people. We're gonna push him into the mud. We're gonna do more than that. We're gonna kill him

108
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,120
 They're like, yay. Yay. Some guy was like, really? You're just gonna push him into the mud

109
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,720
 It's like, hey, it's improv. I'm just coming up the top of my head. He hops on his horse. Now, we're gonna ride with him

110
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,800
 Come on. Come on, dude. Get your horse. We're gonna make some more of these tiny people

111
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,680
 Among these seven tall soldiers. We're wearing like modern day clothes

112
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,280
 They're pretending not to notice but they're like those guys are idiots

113
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,440
 They think they can be in this battle with us

114
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:20,520
 But anyways, we earn their trust halfway through the journey because they keep dropping stuff on the ground and we pick it up

115
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,840
 For them because we're tiny. It's all people can't pick stuff up. So anyways, we're right. I don't know

116
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,440
 We're riding our horses in this big cavalry band now

117
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:35,480
 We're able to track these bandits down in relatively short order. It's not like the next day. They're like, oh look

118
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:41,960
 But these guys are expert trackers. So we're able to get to where we're going and it doesn't take a lot of time

119
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,920
 And at one point we're up in a hill and joshua was like get down get down all the horses

120
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,480
 Are getting down. They're high. Can a horse kneel a horse can like get down

121
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,680
 Can a horse sit like a sphinx can a horse sit actually? I think it's a good enough question

122
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:02,200
 But like horses seem to be you know, it's funny and that's already going this segue on my episode

123
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
 I'm trying to make short because I don't feel good

124
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,600
 Horses

125
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,400
 Are one of the most alien looking creatures that I think we see on a daily basis like yeah, you know

126
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,680
 Water bears look weird and like insects are pretty disgusting

127
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,360
 But when you see a horse it actually looks like

128
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,320
 Some kid drew something and it came to life. It doesn't it's a big fat

129
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,080
 It basically has the body of a maggot just like a big round

130
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,800
 torso and then tiny little stick legs and then

131
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,640
 Uh, I just a head shaped like an aquatic creature or dinosaur and then a tail

132
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,960
 And it's so gross horses are pretty like gross looking

133
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:48,040
 They're magnificent and they're kind of awesome to look at but they look like big brown maggots with stick legs like really

134
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,440
 They're super super

135
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:56,840
 Alien looking they don't look like they belong like a dog. Everything looks in proportion cat. Everything looks in proportion

136
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,320
 Cows even cows look kind of weird too, but not as weird as a horse

137
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,680
 Anyways, you're like, and what horses are you looking at?

138
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,040
 Who was magnificent muscular beast on?

139
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,600
 I don't know. I they just look alien to me. I'm not saying that they're not pretty

140
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,440
 I mean brown maggots aren't pretty by definition, but

141
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,640
 They just look so alien to me

142
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,800
 anyways

143
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,800
 We're riding these

144
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,040
 Horses looking at me as I'm delivering that monologue the horse that I'm riding is like, dude

145
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,080
 You're kind of a jerk and he's trying to fight. I'm like, come on horse. No, no, no, you're good. You're one of the good ones

146
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,600
 You're one of the good ones. Oh, okay. Thanks Jason. So we're walking anyways

147
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:44,360
 We come to this hill the horses are ducking down and joshua the floor breaks out this homemade telescope

148
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,800
 It's basically just two pieces of cardboard and some nerds high glasses that he's told back in town

149
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:56,600
 He's turning. He's like there's a raiding part. I see the party over there. That's the raiders. They're in that little forested area

150
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,680
 Mount up boys

151
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:04,280
 Get back on our horses check our rifles. Yep, according to the story. We're rocking sharp rifles

152
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:11,160
 They're 50 caliber combat rifles. So getting putting those big old bullets in we're about to blow up some raiders

153
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,840
 Joshua the floor. Let's go. We're riding down the hill now

154
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:20,200
 Full charge not just dropping. I don't know why I'm making that noise

155
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,320
 Just all it sounds like a dude's at some British cheese about to start rapping

156
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,160
 The forest not the forest the forest stays there the horses

157
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,600
 Crash into the forest. So the horses

158
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,160
 Russian to the forest we're on the horses. So we all rush into the forest

159
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,880
 And the first thing

160
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,520
 We're hit with is the smell of death

161
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:48,920
 Start choking and gagging some of the smell so bad some of the horses

162
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,240
 Throw their

163
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,240
 Throw their right. It sounds like a witch throw their riders off of them. Uh

164
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,440
 Horses take off the smell is that bad

165
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 Imagine if somebody

166
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,240
 Who never wore deodorant?

167
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,280
 Died in an outhouse on a summer day and then that outhouse farted in your mouth

168
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,320
 That is what the smell of this area is like

169
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,200
 That is about enough. We're starting to gag

170
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,280
 Oddly enough one of the guys is like

171
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,200
 Oh, yes, my favorite smell in the world. He has a fetish for this by the rest of us

172
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,240
 Now as we're combating this basically chemical weapon at this point, we can't stand the smell of death

173
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,280
 We start to see these three figures

174
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:40,600
 kind of hunched over a pile of something and while we're like our eyes are all watery

175
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:48,760
 Trying to figure out what's going on one of them stands up and it's truly a monstrous man if not a monster itself

176
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,320
 seven to eight feet tall

177
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:58,120
 Seemingly covered in hair and holding like a chicken wing the arm of a dead child

178
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,840
 Taking another bite or just looking at us

179
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:07,240
 And we see there's two other figures like him

180
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,640
 And they're standing by a pile of all the dead children that have been missing

181
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,400
 There's been nine of them. I don't know if I said how many there were anyways

182
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:21,160
 There's been nine of them and they're partially decayed and being eaten or have been eaten

183
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,240
 And it doesn't matter because at this point we're

184
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,560
 Throwing up and the creature

185
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:32,440
 Kind of wipes its mouth off now joshua la flor. He's not freaking out. He's not throwing up. He's still on his horse

186
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,600
 He's completely enraged by what he sees he he takes his horse

187
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,680
 He grabs his sword and he

188
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:45,640
 Charge and he goes running towards on horseback the guy who's standing up who's just eating the kid's arm

189
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,040
 Running full bore. He's going to chop this dude's head off

190
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:55,320
 And the creature turns and just punches the horse in the head and kills the horse instantly

191
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:05,720
 Now joshua falls off the horse and the creature looks over at him and joshua pulls out his pistol and just unloads pop pop pop pop pop pop pop

192
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,520
 Every bullet pop pop pop pop hits this creature

193
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:13,400
 Empties the gun into this creature creature still coming joshua gets to his feet

194
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,080
 joshua grabs the sword and just starts hacking at this guy now

195
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:22,840
 He's drawn blood just slicing it up. He's cutting his blood everywhere. He's doing damage

196
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,760
 This isn't some sort of mystical creature, but it is some sort of creature

197
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:33,400
 And it's still coming towards him as joshua stabbing and slicing and cutting and then we're all in shock

198
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,400
 By what's going on because this whole thing happened in a matter of seconds

199
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,080
 From the time we all fell off of our horses or just smelled

200
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,640
 the horrible stench

201
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,640
 To where we're at right now

202
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:53,640
 Everyone's frozen all these combat trained soldiers are frozen and us and then and then one of the other creatures walks up behind

203
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,520
 joshua and while he's stabbing the first one

204
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:01,800
 Desperately trying to kill it. The other one just walks up grabs the back of joshua's head and goes

205
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:08,200
 Rips his head off of his shoulders and joshua just falls to the ground

206
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:14,760
 Now I imagine the creature did some sort of Harlem Globetrotter move the head started rolling around spinning it on his finger

207
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,680
 But whatever happened in real life at all the shock of people ended right there

208
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:25,720
 Like seeing their leader killed made them not being shocked which okay

209
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,520
 Let's take a second to go over this part real quick

210
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,680
 That is a really really bad team

211
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:35,320
 If you are a military man and you're trying to pick your best team

212
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:40,360
 Can you can't can you do well under pressure? Well, it depends if it's really smelly

213
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:45,000
 I can't but don't worry captain the second you die. I'll be ready to fight again

214
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:50,200
 But anyways, everyone's kind of like whoa. What was that? I just saw a bunch of kids getting eaten

215
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,600
 I just saw a horse get punched to death and I saw my captain's head get ripped off

216
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:00,920
 It's time to fight everyone opens fire with their rifles now. They're sharp 50 caliber rifles

217
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:06,760
 Creatures are like

218
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,640
 Getting shot

219
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:15,000
 Now it says in the story that every shot was a head shot because these guys were so good with these rifles

220
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 And I'm telling you that not because we're humble bragging. I'm like, all right

221
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,720
 Dude, we're so good shooting people with these rifles. It's because it plays an interesting part in what's coming up

222
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,200
 But anyways, so you just see this big foot

223
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:31,080
 It's like close up of a rifle shooting then a big foot piece goes off his head and then another shot

224
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,800
 piece go off his head and then slow motion

225
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,800
 Bigfoot brains going everywhere and then I guess I want to be making that noise

226
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:48,120
 He would already be dead all three of these creatures just getting massive 50 caliber rounds to the head

227
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:57,800
 Then birds come back to the forest

228
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:03,400
 They're french birds apparently

229
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,640
 and

230
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,280
 Nature has been restored now. They're like

231
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,200
 Oh wait, no, sorry, then there's I forgot this part

232
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:17,000
 So then they think they're all dead, right? But one of the creatures doesn't get shot at multiple times

233
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,640
 Why 50 caliber rounds? So here's the epilogue

234
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,320
 So they're like that good thing that was done and some guy has his back

235
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,080
 To one of the raiders. He's like, yeah, can you believe these guys are such knuckleheads?

236
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,760
 We killed them so easily

237
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,320
 What a bunch of what a bunch of rum dingers and then the creature gets up and starts running

238
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:39,880
 And they're like uh and so this young brave jumps off of his horse and grabs his knife and he's running through the jungle and the creature's like

239
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,840
 And that dude's running behind him

240
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,200
 Monsters running and then the guy jumps up

241
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:51,080
 Sticks him with a knife and just kills this dude with this monster with a knife

242
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,160
 Now he'd been shot up a bunch of times

243
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:58,280
 So they did think he was dead or not. It doesn't matter. The point is is that the last one was killed by a knife

244
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:05,800
 So the remaining people all of us basically there was 30 people in joshla flure la flare whatever

245
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,440
 He died he got his head ripped off

246
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,000
 So we start digging they make us dig the graves because we were completely useless in that fight

247
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,640
 We dig the graves we dig the grave for joshua

248
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,920
 We dig the grave to bury the children and then we just burn the body of the raiders

249
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,560
 We burn the bodies of these bandits

250
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,120
 slash monsters

251
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,120
 Because they don't deserve a proper burial

252
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,520
 And then we ride back home

253
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:35,880
 And we get home and there's a little little kid walks up to you and be like hey

254
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:43,640
 Hey, what what do you guys see out there? Is it true? Is it true the smell and the head in the head getting punched off and

255
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,480
 And all of that stuff and we look down at the little boy and we go

256
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,680
 I don't know if it's true. We're about to figure that out

257
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,160
 We're about to figure that out little boy

258
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,720
 He's like whether it doesn't make any sense and then bam

259
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:00,120
 We're back in the present day and then we go and grab a history book and we look up and it says

260
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,840
 1855 a little boy

261
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,800
 asked the question of two strangers and

262
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,440
 And they didn't have an answer

263
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,200
 That little boy decided to dedicate his life to finding answers

264
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,320
 That little boy's name was hawking

265
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,960
 Stephen hawking so we didn't know it, but we actually inspired

266
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,840
 Stephen hawking native american boy, but you didn't know that

267
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,720
 Native american boy born in 1855

268
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,880
 Anyways, the point is is that we're back in the future

269
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,200
 Let's take a look and see how much of this story is true

270
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,760
 Now like I said, I came across this story months and months ago and I did all the research

271
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,320
 I just let it sit there and I thought I just I don't really I think it's totally fake

272
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:48,200
 I think it's 100 fake. So I was like, I've done a lot of stories where I just talk about it and then go

273
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,560
 It's fake and then move on. That's what was preventing me from talking about it

274
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,080
 But when Bennett was like, yeah, you should cover it. I was like, I'll give it another look

275
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:00,280
 So let's really dig into this thing here. There's a website called sasquatchhistory.wordpress.com

276
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:05,080
 Which is really good website because I always like websites that take like love exploring stuff

277
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:11,240
 But then also know that stuff needs to be dunked and debunked and debunked and that is what this podcast does

278
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,560
 So let's take a look at what we can verify with this story

279
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:22,520
 This is what the sasquatch history website says one those sharp rifles. They didn't come out in 1855

280
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,800
 They weren't invented until 1870. So right there

281
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,760
 We have a problem and they were 50 caliber rifles

282
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:33,720
 But the thing is is like this website was saying that Native Americans really wouldn't have access

283
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:39,640
 If they had access to a 50 caliber rifle, the ammo would be quite rare for them

284
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,200
 They wouldn't be able to be super well trained on them to land headshot after headshot after headshot

285
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,720
 Because it was a military grade rifle with military grade weaponry

286
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,000
 It would be harder to get than say like a 22 round or something like that

287
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,600
 So right there you go. Well, then it's not true because these

288
00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:00,040
 Weapons that are named in it aren't didn't exist at the time even if they did they wouldn't be

289
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,280
 Plausible for them to use. Well, what's interesting is the story itself might be true

290
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,840
 But the detail could have been added in later

291
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,280
 So it could have originally just been they were using rifles and someone says oh no

292
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,000
 They'd have to have 50 caliber rifles to fight these monsters

293
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,240
 But apparently this story has some seed of truth into it

294
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:22,680
 If we look at the original story that there these weren't creatures at all. They weren't bigfoot

295
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,120
 originally it was just there was a bunch of raiders in the area and

296
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:31,240
 They were killing kids at a certain point and these guys came out and they fought humans

297
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,560
 And they shot a bunch of times in the head and that was kind of the end of it

298
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,960
 And then the humans became more than human they became man beasts

299
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,600
 And then over time they became beasts or bigfoot's

300
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,600
 So now they're fighting giant hairy people in the middle of the woods

301
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,720
 So you have that you have an origin of the story you have like an evolution of the story

302
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:58,040
 The area where this happened in the Choctaw language. It's known as looking for killers

303
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,200
 This little grove

304
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,200
 Where all this supposedly went down

305
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,920
 Is no one has looking for killers in Choctaw?

306
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,840
 So it's possible something went down. However, here's the real kicker

307
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:14,520
 I'm getting all of those details from that website sasquatchhistory.wordpress.com

308
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,840
 And they could be making it up or they could be completely wrong because I tried looking for

309
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,720
 The glenn I tried looking for what looking for killers means in Choctaw

310
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:30,920
 I tried looking for earlier versions of the story. I couldn't find anything the real kicker to the story of whether or not it's true

311
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:38,120
 Is there was no such person as joshua la flor the person did not exist at that time period

312
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:43,800
 I'm not saying that there's not one now some guy's a bookkeeper in Idaho. He's like starts to fade away

313
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:51,000
 He's like no, I don't exist at the time. There was no guy named joshua la flor. There was a la flor family

314
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,280
 They were very very influential members of the Choctaw community. They were half french half Choctaw all of that stuff checks out

315
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,360
 But there was no captain joshua la flor that person did not exist

316
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,320
 There was a jackson la flor, but it was born after the events

317
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:10,200
 So we have all these different little details that don't add up that make you go

318
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,840
 The story's fake when you talk about people riding and shooting monsters in the middle of the woods

319
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,960
 Which is really what the the monsters are eating children

320
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,160
 Heroes show up shoot monsters into story

321
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:26,440
 When you're talking about a story that's fanciful your details need to be on point

322
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:33,480
 And it's funny because had they left out the name of joshua la flor or the types of rifles

323
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:40,200
 The story would be much harder to just flat out debunk and say it didn't happen because these details didn't happen

324
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,680
 But I think there's a more interesting

325
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:47,960
 Let's assume that a version of the story happened that it wasn't humans fighting bigfoot

326
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,320
 Which is possible because you figure that humans fought neanderthals for thousands of years

327
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:58,520
 We had constant struggles with other species other humanoid species on this planet

328
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:03,160
 The idea of a bunch of people in the wild wild west shooting at bigfoot isn't

329
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:08,520
 Super out of the or like if you believe in that type of stuff. I mean, obviously it's not like a scientist

330
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:13,720
 It's like you're right Jason that isn't out of the ordinary. In fact, it's quite plausible like I'm not saying that but

331
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:19,800
 If you believe in this stuff anyways, then but I think there's actually a more interesting question to this

332
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,680
 I think there's actually a more interesting theory to this. So let's assume that the events themselves are true

333
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:29,480
 They didn't use the rifles joshua la flor is isn't in it. It's some other dude

334
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:35,720
 People are getting attacked pushed by the river children go missing search party shows up

335
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:40,840
 And they see in this wilderness a bunch of people run off and they see three

336
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,880
 mighty men left behind

337
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,320
 Tall men seemingly covered in hair

338
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:53,640
 Almost supernaturally strong and these three men turn and fight to the death

339
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,600
 With this band of 30 native warriors

340
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,760
 One theory that's been put forth is that these guys were vikings

341
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:06,600
 These were a band of vikings that had long lived in america as a separate

342
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,920
 little civilization

343
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:15,000
 And this is how they lived they raided other people. They took what they wanted like they did in europe

344
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,120
 but this time they got tracked down and

345
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,920
 Three of them decided to make a stand

346
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,880
 While the rest of them took off

347
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:30,360
 I think that idea is way more honestly bad ass than the bigfoot like yes bigfoot

348
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:36,520
 I'm getting shot in the head, but I think I think the idea and I've always found this idea intriguing

349
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:41,560
 I know they came out of that movie pathfinder, which was okay, but the idea of vikings versus

350
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:48,120
 Like native americans. I find absolutely like visually stunning. I think that is such a not for them

351
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:53,000
 They're like, oh i'm getting stabbed i'm getting stabbed and the other guys the vikings getting shot with arrows

352
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,120
 It's not visually stunning for them, but you have two basically the two most alpha

353
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:03,880
 Relations on the planet like I'd like to see ninjas fight as tech warriors

354
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,040
 I'd actually like to see ninjas

355
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,040
 Fight knights from medieval times

356
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,480
 I'd like to see like as tech warriors fight

357
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:16,760
 You could have as tech warriors fighting vikings. Anyways, that's another point. The point is is like

358
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:23,720
 Wait, it's it's kind of the point the point is is that I think it's awesome when you have two societies

359
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,880
 fight

360
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:31,640
 But not like I don't I mean I don't really care about like russia and syria fighting turkey

361
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,600
 That's not as interesting. I want to see

362
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:41,800
 Like those ancient civilizations clash in ways they never did so to me. It's more exciting and exhilarating

363
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,440
 To thank that in 1855

364
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,920
 Some dudes were running up on some vikings that were eating children

365
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:56,920
 And a viking a human turned around and punched a horse so hard the horse died and then the viking kept getting stabbed

366
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:03,560
 I'm not saying the vikings a good guy in this scenario either. Don't get a twist and I'm not like yay go vikings

367
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,800
 He's deserved to die because he's eating children, but

368
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:14,760
 I just find that idea more interesting than the bigfoot but either way either way if this story happened

369
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,760
 Something very very dark happened children went missing and were eaten

370
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:25,800
 A brave man died trying to seek out vengeance

371
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,440
 and three men

372
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,000
 Or beasts or both

373
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,800
 Were killed in that glen

374
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,760
 but

375
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:40,280
 Remember a bunch of them got away and just because we got no further reports in that area

376
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,600
 doesn't mean

377
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,680
 That they didn't continue their reign of terror

378
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,160
 somewhere

379
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,160
 in the american west

380
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:57,160
