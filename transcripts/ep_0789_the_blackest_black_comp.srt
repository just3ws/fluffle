1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
 My home may become the setting of a new horror movie as I've realized something is

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,080
 living in here with me and

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,860
 Then we meet a man who during the times of COVID

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,440
 Does not wear a mask outside

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,720
 But what happens when the voices in his head tell him he has to?

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,240
 And then we meet a young woman who was simply trying to get a good night's sleep

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,400
 Instead she wakes up and finds herself surrounded

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,320
 In a darkness blacker than black today on Dead Rabbit Radio

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:45,600
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter

 Or maybe you're in like a little igloo, but I hope you're having fun no matter where you're at

13
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:02,840
 Someone who always has fun someone who always brings the party going to the igloos coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our

14
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,800
 Thanksgiving livestream

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:10,900
 YouTube donators give it up for Nicole Magenta everyone give a big round of applause for Nicole do a little bow

16
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:17,680
 If you can't support the patreon that's fine too. I totally understand that just helps spread the word about the show really

17
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,080
 Really helps out a lot now you guys have heard the intro

18
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,600
 We got a ton of stuff to cover this episode so Nicole

19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,920
 I'm gonna toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Dune buggy. We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command

20
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,080
 We're headed all the way out to my place

21
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:42,680
 Nicole driving us out over the dunes back to my place apparently I live in the Sahara so I've lived here for about 11 years in this place and

22
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:50,920
 In those 11 years, I have never I've never written a mysterious word on my wall and then repaint it over it

23
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:58,060
 I've lived here for 11 years and about three days ago. I'm sitting here. I'm hanging out and I look over and I see

24
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,840
 clearly a

25
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,600
 Word written on my wall that's been painted over

26
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,660
 Starts with an S can't see the other letter looks like maybe a T in the middle

27
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:14,600
 That's larger than the rest of the word can't see the letter after that and then the last letter appears to be R five letter

28
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,360
 word S maybe a T and an R and

29
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,420
 I'm looking at that and I'm thinking here's the logical explanation. I

30
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:27,960
 Just recently replaced three light bulbs in my apartment which right there

31
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:33,000
 I never even made the connection that that could be paranormal related because electrical right I just replaced three

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,920
 Light bulbs in my place in like the past week and I replaced old CFL ones with those new LED ones

33
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,760
 So the lighting has changed in the apartment

34
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,280
 and

35
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,400
 So the logical explanation was this was written here before I moved in and I never really saw it with just the way the light

36
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,880
 Interacted with my place

37
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,960
 Now that if she's light bulbs I can clearly see it plus I used to have more

38
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,040
 I used to store more stuff on that side of the but I don't anymore

39
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,480
 But I stopped storing stuff there a couple weeks ago. So why is it appearing now?

40
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,680
 That brings us to the paranormal answer right that brings us to the paranormal answer

41
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,120
 I've talked a lot about my apartment being haunted on this show

42
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,760
 I'll try to find some episodes to put in the show notes

43
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,680
 But I've mentioned it so many times about my apartment being haunted, but it's been a long time since I've had anything

44
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,120
 substantial happen here

45
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,160
 But like I said, I was talking to old friends and I said hey, do you recognize this on the wall?

46
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,200
 And they don't they don't remember seeing that before

47
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:39,560
 So did something right on my wall did something some force come in and right on my wall

48
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:46,360
 And I got to say when I looked over at it. I immediately knew what that word meant. I immediately was like are you kidding me?

49
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:52,840
 Because it's either a trick of the light it could be absolutely nothing could be a painter drying off his paintbrush

50
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,320
 It could be always have been there and it painted up this word back then which would still be concerning

51
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,720
 I'm looking at that and I go if it says anything that says Seder

52
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,480
 saty r which are the half-horse

53
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,960
 permanent erection nature gods that

54
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,240
 Just ran around banging animals and women and I swear I swear out of all of the paranormal creatures

55
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,240
 I could possibly meet

56
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:24,400
 That is the low that's the lowest I do not want to hang out with the dude with a permanent erection

57
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,580
 I'll let me back up here. I hope he just wants to hang out right?

58
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:34,360
 He's manifesting into this universe with a giant horse erection. I'm out. I'm leaving

59
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:43,680
 So you only get one good horror movie in you right like you never hear about anyone who escaped from the serial killer and then

60
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,220
 Got got trapped in a haunted house and had to do an exorcism you get one good horror move

61
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,240
 So people get none and that's probably the best thing

62
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,120
 But if you are gonna have one you get one can my horror movie not be

63
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,880
 Come on movie not be about a Seder running around my apartment

64
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,960
 That'd be so annoying. Maybe it's a Harry and Henderson's thing

65
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:06,000
 Maybe we teach him how to and maybe teach him how to not bang animals and random women and he teaches us

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 the values of love

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,320
 How much he loves banging animals in random women?

68
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,840
 So anyways, I will keep you updated on Seder gate if the word continues to appear then

69
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,840
 Moving if I start to make horse noises very very accurately on this podcast

70
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:29,200
 I might have been taken over by the Seder, but I will keep you guys updated on this possibly totally natural phenomenon or a

71
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:35,800
 Very disap... very very disappointing haunting. Nicole, I'm gonna go and attach you the keys to the dead rabbit dirgeable

72
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,280
 We're gonna say goodbye to my place. See you later, bro. And take us up up and away and we're headed out to

73
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,040
 a small town in suburban America

74
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:53,560
 The reason why we're headed out here is I recently came across this post online

75
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,440
 This person starts off I say and I want to get all the political stuff out of the way

76
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,080
 I'm neither pro mask or anti mask

77
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,360
 But this story involves masks, so just I just want to make it clear to everyone

78
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:14,320
 I do not care about your opinion on a mask this story involves masks. So that's how the poster of this terminal plan

79
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,440
 Layed it out. I don't care about your opinion

80
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,200
 I'm let me just talk about masks for two minutes. They go on to say so I have a mass exemption

81
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,600
 That's why I really don't care about it. I can't wear one anyway, so I'm constantly having to deal with that

82
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,800
 So what happened was a few weeks ago this guy. Let's call him Terry

83
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,840
 So Terry explains the story a couple weeks ago

84
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,160
 He's sitting at home with his mom and his dad just hanging out watching the old boob tube

85
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,000
 They actually were probably all doing their own separate thing with headphones and smart devices, but

86
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,160
 He's sitting there and all of a sudden he hears a noise coming from the kitchen and he turns and he looks and the kitchen is empty

87
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,000
 He's just staring off in there

88
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,920
 What he hears is the sound of a group of people talking in his kitchen his empty kitchen

89
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,440
 He looks at his mom and his dad and they don't seem to be bothered by it. It's almost like they can't hear this very very loud

90
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,720
 conversation

91
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,400
 Now Terry can't place what the voices are saying

92
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,160
 He just you know how you kind of hear that rumble like when you're in a club and you're in the bathroom

93
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,960
 And you can still hear the noise from the club on the other side of the wall. It's like that

94
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,720
 He hears this sound. He can't understand what they're saying, but he knows their sound and

95
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,760
 He said it sounds like it was coming through an old PA system. It wasn't clean. It wasn't crisp

96
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,920
 It was staticky crackling

97
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,200
 But it was voices

98
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:48,240
 On December 3rd 2021 so just a few days ago for us Terry sitting in his computer working

99
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:55,840
 And he hears a voice a singular voice this time

100
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,160
 Whisper in his ear

101
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:05,040
 It's a voice he recognizes as someone familiar but

102
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,080
 He can't place it

103
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,640
 He's heard it before but he doesn't know who it comes from and this voice says clearly in his ear

104
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,080
 Wear a mask

105
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,560
 He didn't have his speakers playing he had no headphones on he was sitting there quietly in his room and he heard a voice go

106
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,120
 wear a mask

107
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,600
 Now

108
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:35,760
 This thread after he posted this it immediately became what he tried to avoid it became an argument over

109
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,440
 Masking and mask mandates and pro-mask and anti-mask and

110
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:45,800
 He wrote tired of hearing about that we just want you wrote ghost stories even when we're reading them online

111
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,760
 So but that was what they were trying to avoid that's what happens

112
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,560
 But then a lot of the other posts and I will agree with this a lot of the other posts were

113
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,640
 You might want to go to a doctor and get that checked out and I agree even though we talk about the paranormal when you do have

114
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:06,400
 Concerns about your sanity or your hearing voices or maybe you think you're sane, but you are hearing voices are hallucinating

115
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:13,480
 Yeah, it doesn't hurt to go talk to someone. I can almost guarantee that it's stress. I when I'm really stressed out I hallucinate smells

116
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,620
 Auditory hallucinations happen. I will smell raw garbage raw

117
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:21,400
 smelly sewage

118
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,640
 When I am

119
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,120
 Really really stressed out first thing I do is look make sure there's no Arby's around me and I go okay

120
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,840
 So it smells not coming from there. It must be

121
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:37,800
 Conn's there's no other place that smells like raw sewage other than my imagination and America's least favorite roast beef restaurant

122
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:43,400
 So it's probably stress you can you can hallucinate voices and stuff like that get it checked out

123
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,320
 But looking at the conspiracy theory angle here

124
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,680
 I recommend getting checked out before you listen to the next five minutes of this podcast because I'm gonna go real deep into some

125
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,320
 paranoid

126
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,840
 delusions

127
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,840
 You could go with a dystopian

128
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,720
 idea

129
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:09,200
 That this is the first test of a system to beam messages into the people who don't do what the government says

130
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,320
 Like what if he's not the only one experiencing this?

131
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,840
 auditory hallucination

132
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,440
 What if the government has now realized everyone who's not doing what it says and

133
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,880
 They can beam these messages into people's heads

134
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,360
 Until they follow what the voices say

135
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:35,760
 Far-fetched. Yeah, would the government do it over masks? No, but if you were simply testing out the technology

136
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,400
 Just to see what the long-term ramifications are

137
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,080
 What better time to do when people are already fearful

138
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:50,080
 So you monitor so many see they're not wearing their masks in this sector of town and that sector of town the amount of information

139
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,320
 Private companies have on us is mind-boggling and the government just scoops that stuff up. They know where we're at

140
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,320
 They know what we're wearing. They know what we're doing

141
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:05,520
 And by all appearances they tend to leave us alone, but what if that's not the case like what if this is a trial run?

142
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,520
 There's been a long-standing

143
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:13,720
 Long-standing history in the conspiracy theory community in schizophrenia, and I'm not saying that as an insult

144
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,520
 I'm not saying schizophrenics who are conspiracy theorists or conspiracy theorists who are schizophronyx when deep conspiracy lore

145
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,600
 There is a lot of talk

146
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,560
 I don't know how much proof there is proof is a slippery word in conspiracy

147
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:31,720
 But a lot of talk that a lot of people who are quote-unquote crazy are driven crazy by the government or private institutions

148
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:39,120
 There are they hearing voices because they have schizophrenia or do they have schizophrenia like symptoms that are induced

149
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,160
 by a powerful adversary

150
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:49,440
 That's classic conspiracy theory lore going all the way back to the 60s where when you got metal fillings in your teeth

151
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,840
 You could pick up Russian radio waves like that was a common trope

152
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:59,080
 That's how you trolled conspiracy theorists back when I was growing up 80s 70 80s 90s stuff like that

153
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:06,560
 The tinfoil hat and the picking up the radio waves on their teeth. Oh when I said that I know a lot of older listeners a lot of listeners my age

154
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,080
 They go I remember that that was really popular now. It's a flat earth

155
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,400
 You're just a flat earth there are things like that Q and I you're just a Q and on guy

156
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,280
 And that's how they dismiss you back then it was you get radio waves from the Russians in your teeth. So

157
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:26,040
 The idea of hearing voices is it a I'll tell you this right now medically if you do hear voices

158
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,400
 Please go get it checked out. I'm not saying that the government's trying to take you over

159
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:36,280
 I'm saying definitely go get that checked out 99.99%. It's a medical thing that can be treated. I want to make sure I say that

160
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,360
 But the other point zero zero zero one percent is this and this guy's a test for that

161
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,480
 And we can also be we can have our conspiracy cap on and be a little more optimistic

162
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,420
 It's possible that by not wearing a mask this particular gentleman may be

163
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:55,480
 Going to catch something in the future and it's a time traveler or an angel, right?

164
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,640
 I mean, I guess that's kind of I explain this entire dystopian future. I'm like or angels

165
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,280
 It could be a warning to for him to wear a mask for an upcoming event

166
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:09,820
 Maybe there'll be a maybe there'll be a very vicious pipe fight going on and he will choke on the cream

167
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:15,080
 Unless he has that mask on so I don't know it's probably just a stress

168
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:20,360
 I would recommend going to the doctor if you if you do start thinking the government's talking you

169
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,160
 I hope that I didn't put it in your head and be prepared for that pipe fight Terry

170
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,040
 I think was your name that I gave you

171
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,600
 But whether it's biological or paranormal or more time traveler or an angel

172
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,480
 Definitely an interesting story. Nicole. I'm gonna toss you the keys to the world famous carbon recovery

173
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,380
 We're leaving behind this boys bedroom. We are headed all the way out to blue Springs, Missouri

174
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:53,600
 On September 25th 1981 in blue Springs, Missouri, there is a 15 year old girl trying to fall asleep

175
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,880
 It's 10 p.m. The Sun has set

176
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,880
 Little owls are like hanging out on trees doing their thing this 15 year old girl will call her Margaret

177
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,480
 Now I hate that name this 15 year old girl will call her

178
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,320
 Michelle

179
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,080
 Michelle is laying in bed. She's trying to go to sleep and she hears a sound coming from her closet

180
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:22,000
 She's she's trying to fall asleep and it sounds like there's a squirrel in there. I don't know much about Missouri

181
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,280
 I barely know how to pronounce it, but

182
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:30,120
 That's super bizarre if that's that's not normal in any other part of the United States, right?

183
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,760
 I'm not the only one he's never woken up to a squirrel in my closet and

184
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,560
 To not be surprised because she just goes on I'm gonna go back to sleep

185
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,600
 If I found a squirrel in my closet, we would become the best friends, dude. I would be feeding him nuts

186
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,640
 I'd be like getting like peanuts and stuff

187
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,520
 I'd be getting him like walnuts nuts

188
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,920
 He never had before almonds and we'd like hang out in the closet all day long back

189
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,920
 That would be dope and he'd be one of those pets that you wouldn't have to like potty train because he would go

190
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,280
 outside and poop outside and then

191
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,720
 You also sew my clothes you can mend to my jacket with his little tiny sewing hands

192
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,200
 So I would jump up with joy if there was a squirrel in my closet

193
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:11,240
 Even if I was trying to get to bed, but she tries to go back to sleep and then she starts to hear the sound of paper crinkling

194
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:17,920
 There's more like the matrix disintegrating but she's hearing that sound and

195
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,200
 She realizes okay squirrels

196
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,700
 Jason has a squirrel fetish. She watched too much rescue Rangers back in the day

197
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,920
 But she goes squirrels aren't squirrels aren't known for their paper crinkling abilities

198
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:36,440
 And at that point she begins to hear voices in her room and actually didn't plan this

199
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:42,600
 I sometimes pull these stories randomly. She all I did not plan that she also hears voices like it's a big party going on

200
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,240
 But this is not coming from the kitchen or somewhere else. This is coming from her bedroom

201
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,560
 now she's laying there on her

202
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,160
 left side and

203
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:59,040
 She's kind of looking into the left side of the room. She's laying there and when she hears all of these voices

204
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:05,960
 She's thinking about getting up and walking to look out the window because she's thinking it must be coming from outside

205
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,960
 Obviously there's nothing in her room and

206
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:16,880
 Right as she's thinking that right as she's thinking about getting up off that bed. She hears of I didn't I forgot these stories are so similar

207
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:23,440
 Right when she's thinking about getting out of bed. She hears a voice clear as day in her right ear

208
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:34,620
 It says a whole sentence, but she only understands the last two words the gun

209
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:45,280
 She immediately rolls over to face the noise within a split second she's in a pitch black void

210
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:54,520
 She's flat on her back and her right arm is extended all the way out and up

211
00:16:54,520 --> 00:17:00,120
 She's completely paralyzed

212
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:08,080
 She says the room is so black she looks up and she can't see the tips of her fingers

213
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:13,000
 Her whole body begins to hum with a painless electrical cure and

214
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,760
 She starts to levitate off the bed

215
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,880
 She's spinning around

216
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:30,840
 Right this part sounds kind of fun other than the horrible things that are going on she begins to slowly spin like counterclockwise

217
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,800
 above the bed

218
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:39,920
 So as far as she's concerned, she's an absolute pitch black void at this point

219
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,680
 There is nothing around her, but she feels her body slowly spin around and

220
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:49,840
 Then once she is realigned with the bed once the head is aligned with a pillow

221
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:56,640
 The paralysis is done and she falls to the bed her body still feel without electrical current

222
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,840
 But she can move and the first thing she does is she grabs her phone

223
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:06,840
 Grabbed her landline phone. This is back in 1981 and when she picks it up. It's a dial tone. It doesn't work

224
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,600
 Michelle jumps off the bed and is now standing in this void

225
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,600
 But it still feels familiar to her it still feels like her room

226
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:25,360
 So she begins running towards where she knows the door is and when she gets to the door

227
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,600
 It's gone

228
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:36,640
 Instead is a pitch black tunnel leading into oblivion

229
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:44,360
 Michelle steps backwards and looks at this tunnel that is so

230
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:49,280
 Black so dark so devoid of anything

231
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:56,240
 It is blacker than the void that surrounds it. It is impossibly dark

232
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,880
 Michelle screams and

233
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:08,480
 Her voice is nothing but an electronically distorted vibration coming out of her body

234
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:16,400
 *Dramatic music*

235
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,840
 She throws her hand over her mouth in shock

236
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,320
 No, no one intended. She throws her hand over her mouth in shock

237
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,520
 And then she's back in bed

238
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,080
 Laying on her left side

239
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,920
 The room has returned to normal

240
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,160
 Her voice has returned to normal

241
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,400
 The time is 10 10 p.m. I

242
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:48,120
 Got a story from think about a docs calm one of the best repositories of UFO paranormal lore

243
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:54,040
 They got it from the National UFO Research Center, which also is compiles all this information really really good database

244
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,040
 If you're into this stuff, which you should be because it's totally awesome

245
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,680
 So this is the third time on this show

246
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:07,480
 We have covered a similar story about someone waking up in their room being this pitch black void and I'm

247
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,480
 It's that's really interesting to me

248
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:16,120
 It really really is and there have been other black bedroom stories have come across recently that I haven't covered because it's kind of just the

249
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,920
 Same thing we've talked about and I'm starting to wonder how common this event is

250
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:27,000
 Now fair enough. They could just be dreaming. It is a phenomenon called the black bedroom

251
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,040
 It takes place at night in bedrooms where people are known for sleeping and dreaming. That's a true

252
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:38,840
 But we've now covered three stories on this show about people who get up and they're moving around their own bedroom

253
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,960
 And it's pitch black. They can't see anything and the walls seem impossibly far. They can't get out

254
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,320
 I'm starting to wonder how common this is

255
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,680
 Because this shows

256
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,600
 just how

257
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,440
 This is a common theme this week

258
00:20:53,440 --> 00:21:00,160
 We talked on Monday about how the giant came to the vulgar region in Russia and it was making the people feel sad and it was kind of

259
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:08,400
 Affecting their moods and it was causing miscarriages and I said then that shows how powerless we are in the face of these beings and

260
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,120
 This kind of good. I don't know why I'm finding these stories all of a sudden

261
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,720
 I don't know why they're popping up

262
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,280
 Maybe it's to warn me that I will be powerless to stop the satyrs lust

263
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,120
 But we had this story now as well

264
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:26,560
 Where there was nothing she could do to prevent this

265
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:34,520
 Once it was in action everything was moving so no pun intended like clockwork that there was no way she could break out

266
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,760
 Until they wanted to let her go

267
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:46,360
 She's lost in this void she can't speak she can't feel she can't see

268
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:51,640
 Powerless powerless

269
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,800
 But one thing I didn't intend was the similarities between the two stories

270
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,600
 So let's put on our conspiracy caps and wrap it up like this

271
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,200
 What if other people who are trapped in these black rooms?

272
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:11,600
 One common theme among these black rooms is that you can't get out of them. You can't find the door

273
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:17,200
 But what if some people do and they walk through that?

274
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,920
 unbelievable blackness

275
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,400
 Into eternity

276
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,920
 They may show up that they just died in their sleep

277
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,520
 Their lifeless body still laying in bed. They went peacefully

278
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:35,840
 But what if a darker answer is still out there as

279
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,560
 They fly through the void

280
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,200
 Screaming in electrical pain

281
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,000
 Their voices are heard

282
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,880
 Across the globe

283
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,880
 It's the sounds of madness

284
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:54,760
 The sounds of humans crying out

285
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,100
 Lost souls seeking new lost souls

286
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,280
 Misery may love company

287
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,640
 But madness

288
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,200
 Demands it
