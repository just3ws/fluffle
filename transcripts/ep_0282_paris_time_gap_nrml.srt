1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 The mystery of Jeffrey Epstein deepens as a bizarre photo surfaces online.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 And then finally we discuss a conspiracy so obscure it's not even on the iceberg.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 What happened in Paris on December 29th 1902?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 What caused the Paris time gap today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 I'm a walkie-dove.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 We got some more patrons.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Is it Patreon's?

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 We have Jeremy Davis,

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Caden S,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 William Herman,

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 and Reese's Pieces,

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Delicious Candy.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 They've done a lot of stuff with Reese's.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 I don't think the candy itself is now one of my patrons,

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 but they've done some delicious,

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 he might be,

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 no that's the M&M,

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 the big talking M&M,

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 but he may be made of Reese's Pieces.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 What I'm trying to get at is they've done a lot of interesting things with Reese's Pieces over the years.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 They've stuffed him another candy.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 I had a Hershey's Bar with Reese's Pieces in it the other day.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 It was quite yummy.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 So thanks again,

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 and again not the candy.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 The candy itself is not supporting the show,

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 but again if it is,

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 it's a delicious treat.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 So thank you for supporting the show.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Thank you, thank you very much.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 We got a lot of stuff to cover today,

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 so we're gonna just jump right into it.

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Now, the first story we're gonna talk about

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 was sent to me by my buddy Carson,

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 and he said,

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 "Have you heard about the newest wrinkle in the Jeffrey Epstein case?"

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 I don't know if he put it like that.

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 I don't know if he's like,

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 "Oh good chap, have you heard?"

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Like he just, he just sent me a link actually.

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 I don't even know if he commented on it.

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 But thanks Carson for the link.

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 What it is, is that,

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 so Jeffrey Epstein is dead.

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 And the official story is he killed himself.

49
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 They said that his neck,

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 part of his neck bone was broken,

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 which often happens in strangulations,

52
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 but it can happen when you commit suicide.

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Who knows?

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Like, there's no videotape that they've released

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 of anyone walking into the cell, if it exists.

56
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 That is still a mystery going on.

57
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 But another mystery is that Jeffrey Epstein had,

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 and let me say,

59
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 if you're not familiar with who Jeffrey Epstein is,

60
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 I did an episode on him a while back,

61
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 but Jeffrey Epstein was a millionaire financier in America

62
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 who had a side gig of trafficking young girls

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 to very, very powerful people.

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 And he got arrested,

65
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 and he was sitting in jail waiting to be tried,

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 and then he dies.

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 People have thought that a powerful person had him killed.

68
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 People think that he killed himself.

69
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 And there's always the option that he did kill himself

70
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 because he was being threatened.

71
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Like, if you don't kill yourself,

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 your loved ones will be killed.

73
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 So there's a couple different variations

74
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 of what could have went on there.

75
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 But that's the backstory.

76
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 So anyways, he had an accomplice named Guy Laine,

77
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Guy Laine Maxwell.

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 And she is currently being sought after by the authorities.

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 They want to talk to her because you,

80
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 here's the thing, someone has to pay for those crimes.

81
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Justice Department doesn't want the case to just go away.

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 The victims who are trying to sue her

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 and one of them successfully did sue her,

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 got a settlement out of court.

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 They want to see justice done.

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Since Jeffrey Epstein's out of the picture,

87
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 she's the next target.

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 People are looking for her.

89
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 And well, last week, a photo of her appeared online.

90
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 And it's her sitting at what appears to be some sort of,

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 like, burger restaurant, some sort of restaurant in LA.

92
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 And she's sitting there, she's facing the camera.

93
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 The way she looks, it's really weird.

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 You know, there's people who look at the camera

95
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 when their photo's being taken.

96
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 And then there are people who, like, stare into your soul

97
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 as the photo's being taken.

98
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 That's this picture.

99
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 It's really hard to talk about a photo on a podcast,

100
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 but she's really, you look at it and it looks,

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 she looks alive in the photo.

102
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 It's quite odd. Quite odd.

103
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 But anyway, so she's sitting at this burger restaurant

104
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 and the story behind the photo is

105
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 someone was sitting at this burger restaurant as well,

106
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 and they recognized her and they pulled out their iPhone

107
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 and snapped a quick picture of her.

108
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 But a lot of details have come to light

109
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 that make that story very, very, very suspect.

110
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 So there's a photo before that photo was taken.

111
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 There's a photo of her kind of, like, rustling,

112
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 like, looking through her purse or something like that,

113
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 kind of looking down.

114
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 But that's not the first photo that surfaced.

115
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 The first photo that surfaced was the one where she's staring

116
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 at the camera.

117
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 But in between the photo, when she's not really paying attention

118
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 and the one that she's gazing into your soul,

119
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 she changes her hairstyle, which is, I mean, it's not like

120
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 it doesn't go into, like, a beehive.

121
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 It's not super drastic, but you can tell she did her hair.

122
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Excusable.

123
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 If you know someone's taking your picture,

124
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 you might kind of, you know, not going to take time

125
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 to put on your makeup, but you may kind of fix your hair.

126
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 But in the first photo, there is two people eating.

127
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 She's surrounded by about three tables.

128
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 We see three different groups of people eating

129
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 in this outside restaurant.

130
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 In between the time the first photo was taken

131
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 and the second photo was taken, the people directly behind her

132
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 have changed.

133
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 So a couple of minutes would have had to pass

134
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 between the two photos.

135
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Again, not entirely suspicious, but odd nonetheless.

136
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 How much time was there between these two photos?

137
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 At the table she's sitting at, there's two trays

138
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 with two soft drinks.

139
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 So people are wondering, who was she there with?

140
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 Did she buy, would they have like a buy one, get one free?

141
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 And she just loves a good bargain.

142
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 So she got both of them.

143
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 People know where this location's at,

144
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 because they can see all the landmarks behind her.

145
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 And the authorities are looking for her,

146
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 and then internet sleuths are looking for her,

147
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 people who represent the victims are looking for her.

148
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 So they start digging into this,

149
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 and they want to know when the photo was taken.

150
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 At the bus stop behind her, there is a movie poster

151
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 for a movie called "The Good Boys,"

152
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 which I guess is some new movie coming out,

153
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 came out last weekend or something like that.

154
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 And someone goes, you know what, let's find out

155
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 when that movie poster was put up,

156
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 so then we have a earliest date

157
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 that this photo could have possibly been taken.

158
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Taken a month ago, it's not too much of a lead.

159
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 But if it's been taken after Jeffrey Epstein died,

160
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 now we have something.

161
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Somebody calls up the advertising company,

162
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 it says, hey, we want to know when the poster

163
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 for "The Good Boys" went up at this bus stop,

164
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 when they save the location,

165
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 and the advertising company goes,

166
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 "The Good Boys? Why?

167
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 That poster died a hundred years ago today."

168
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 No, what they said was actually a little weirder.

169
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 The advertising company says that poster has never been there.

170
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 About six weeks ago, there was a contract for a hospital ad

171
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 to be on the side of that bus stop,

172
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 and it's been up ever since.

173
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 It's still up today.

174
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 And before that, we didn't have a contract

175
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 for the "Good Boys" poster.

176
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 So somebody photoshopped that poster into the picture.

177
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Hmm? See, now it's getting weird.

178
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 First you're like, dude, she's doing her hair. No big deal.

179
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Somebody took an image of the "Good Boys" poster

180
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 and digitally inserted it into the picture.

181
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Now, there's two reasons why somebody could have done that.

182
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 The logical reason is this.

183
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 The photo was taken quite a while ago,

184
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 and the bus stop may have had an ad for an older movie,

185
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 like "Endgame" or "Child's Play" or something like that.

186
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 And the photographer said,

187
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 "I need to make it look like this was taken more recently

188
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 to get more attention," so they digitally inserted

189
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 in the "Good Boys" poster.

190
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 Just assuming no one would ever check on it.

191
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 The second one is a little less likely,

192
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 but considering the type of people we're dealing with,

193
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 might be true.

194
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 We've talked a lot.

195
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 I did an episode on Kevin Spacey's "Weirdo Christmas" video

196
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 or Thanksgiving. It was Christmas. It was Christmas.

197
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 It was his "Weirdo Christmas" video where he was talking about,

198
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 like, "I'm gonna get--holy y'all!" in that "Weirdo" voice.

199
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 And I got a lot of flack on that video,

200
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 'cause I said he's just a big weirdo,

201
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 and people were like, "No, no, it's Illuminati.

202
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 See, Tanik, he's sending all these coded messages.

203
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 See how he washes his hands three and a half times?

204
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 That's a Masonic number."

205
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 But this one, you have this photo

206
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 that you know is going to be very popular.

207
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 It's gonna be shared all over the media.

208
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 You could include hidden messages in that photo

209
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 that only select people who would understand what that message was.

210
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 So you have this image that's shot very, very well.

211
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 That's another thing that's said, this was not--

212
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 this photo was not taken on an iPhone

213
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 because of the depth of field,

214
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 the way that--I don't know anything about photography,

215
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 but they were saying the way everything is picked up by the camera,

216
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 you would need a professional camera to do this.

217
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 It's not something you could pull out your iPhone 6 and take a picture.

218
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 It's just--it doesn't have the lens capability for this.

219
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 I don't know if that's necessarily true,

220
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 but that's a statement that's going around.

221
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 But you could have someone--you could have Maxwell saying,

222
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 "Listen, I gotta get a message out to somebody."

223
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 And the code word is "good boys" or "boys."

224
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 So I have to have that phrase somewhere in there.

225
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 She could be starting--I mean, you're talking about someone who, allegedly,

226
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 she was involved in child trafficking,

227
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 and now she's sitting behind a poster that never existed

228
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 that says "the good boys."

229
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 So she could be starting a side business.

230
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 She could be sent--that could be a code word

231
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 for somebody else that she needs help,

232
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 or "good boys," you take "GB," that means she's in Great Britain.

233
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 You could have all sorts of stuff.

234
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 You have all these little clues in this picture

235
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 that will slide over most people.

236
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 If someone hadn't tried doing due diligence

237
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 and finding out that poster never existed,

238
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 people would just think it was the correct movie poster.

239
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 But the fact that we know that that movie poster

240
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 wasn't there when that picture was taken

241
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 means they're either trying to make it look like

242
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 she was there more recently,

243
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 or it is a coded message that somebody in the know

244
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 would know how to decipher.

245
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Weird stuff.

246
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 The story of Jeffrey Epstein, I think, is going to be going on

247
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 for quite a long time.

248
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 There's lots of weird stuff going on.

249
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 There are lots of powerful people involved,

250
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 so we'll see how that shakes out.

251
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 But let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

252
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Now, our next story--we are in France,

253
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 and we are in the year 1902.

254
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 It is December 29th,

255
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 and it's 1.05 a.m.

256
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 And there's some dude across town

257
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 named Pierre.

258
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 And at 1.05 in the morning,

259
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 he wakes up with a start,

260
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 and he goes, "Oh, my stomach.

261
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Mmm."

262
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 "Man, must have eaten some bad cheese and bread last night."

263
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 "Oh, or earlier in the night, whatever."

264
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 "Whatever will make the narrative make sense."

265
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 And so he's like, "I better drink some wine.

266
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 I better drink some wine. I'll feel better then,

267
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 'cause I'm French."

268
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 He starts walking through his house,

269
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 going to his wine room.

270
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 So he's walking by this big grandfather clock

271
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 in his living room,

272
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 and he notices that it stopped.

273
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Like, "What? That's weird."

274
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 And he's looking at it, and the pendulum is no longer swinging.

275
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 He's like, "Hmm."

276
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 So he gets to the bottom of this mystery,

277
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 "I'll need to drink some wine."

278
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 So he starts drinking some wine, and he's like,

279
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 "Oh, man, I love you, pendulum."

280
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 But the next day, he's telling his friend that he goes,

281
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 "Yeah, it was really weird. I woke up in the middle of the night.

282
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 I got super sick."

283
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 And the guy's like, "You drink wine, right?"

284
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 He's like, "Oh, yeah, I drink a ton of wine,

285
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 but I still didn't feel good."

286
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 And to top it off, my clock stopped working.

287
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 At that point, his French buddy spits out the wine.

288
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 That's shocking, because...

289
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 I should be doing a French accent this whole time,

290
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 but I didn't know that. That's shocking,

291
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 because my clock stopped at the same time.

292
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 That sounds like Count Dracula.

293
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 It sounds like the Count of the Sesame Street.

294
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 My clock stopped at the same time.

295
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 One! Ho-ho-ho! One!

296
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 It stopped at one.

297
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 And the guy's like, "Dude, just knock it off.

298
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Quit doing that crazy accent." He's like, "Sorry."

299
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 His clock also stopped at 105,

300
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 and he also woke up in the middle of the night,

301
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 not feeling good.

302
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 So the story started to spread through the city of Paris,

303
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 that a good amount of people in the city

304
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 woke up around 105,

305
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 sick to their stomach.

306
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 People who were awake at that time

307
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 got sick to their stomach.

308
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 And across the entire city,

309
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 all the pendulums stopped swinging at 105 a.m.

310
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 In Paris, there's this thing called the "Fo'Colt's Pendulum,"

311
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 or "Fo'Colt's Pendulum."

312
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 It's in a place called the "Paris Pantheon."

313
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 And it is a pendulum that moves its pendulum,

314
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 so it swings back and forth,

315
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 but it's based on the rotation of the Earth.

316
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 The energy of the Earth rotating

317
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 is what makes it move ever so slightly back and forth.

318
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Now that one, you wouldn't actually be able to tell when it stopped,

319
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 but all the clocks, all the pendulum clocks,

320
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 stopped at 105.

321
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 If you had a clockwork clock, if that makes sense,

322
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 that kept going.

323
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 So you had this mystery in the city of Paris

324
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 of a good amount of the population becoming nauseous

325
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 and the pendulum stopping at 105 a.m.

326
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 That is the story of the Paris time gap.

327
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 Now, I had read that story online,

328
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 and I thought, "That's interesting."

329
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 So, of course, I started digging into it more.

330
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 And what I find almost immediately

331
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 is that people say,

332
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 "This story is made up. It never happened."

333
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 This story appeared on a Netflix show

334
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 called "Top 10 Secrets and Mysteries."

335
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 And people were like,

336
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 "That show makes stuff up.

337
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 It tells stories, tells some stories that are true

338
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 and some stories that are false.

339
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Some stories that are exaggerated

340
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 because it's basically a clickbait type show on Netflix.

341
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 "Top 10 Secrets and Mysteries."

342
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 And this was on the episode "Big City Mysteries."

343
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 So I was like, "Okay, I will have an episode

344
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 about once again a story that is made up

345
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 infiltrating the real-life, paranormal,

346
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 and conspiracy world

347
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 and how people get confused about these things,

348
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 myself included, like lone pine devils and things like that.

349
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Stories we come across that are 100% fake

350
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 and were made up very, very recently

351
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 that are starting to filter into the lore

352
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 of the conspiracy realm.

353
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 And I went to bed.

354
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 And last night, the book of Giants episode

355
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 was running late because it was much longer

356
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 than what you guys heard.

357
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 I took out a bunch of stuff.

358
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 And I went to bed late,

359
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 and I laid there on the couch,

360
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 and I couldn't sleep.

361
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 And I go, "You know what?

362
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 Since I can't sleep anyways,

363
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 I'm gonna find out what the earliest reference is

364
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 to the Paris Time Gap.

365
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 Because if there is no reference to the Paris Time Gap

366
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 before the airing of that show or nearby it,

367
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 then Netflix didn't make it up.

368
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 But if I can find something predating the show,

369
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 there's another mystery going on here.

370
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 I started looking more into the Paris Time Gap.

371
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 And again, people are saying this is a Netflix show.

372
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 You go to Quora and they're like, "Is this true?"

373
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 No, it's--

374
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Because you'll find a lot of articles

375
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 that talk about the story I just told you.

376
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 And then when people ask more about it,

377
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 it dead-ins at Netflix.

378
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 Some people have said,

379
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 "Well, there was an H.U. Wells story

380
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 back in like 1898 or something like that

381
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 called 'The Man Who Stopped the World'

382
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 and it could have been based on that as well.

383
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 But there was no reference to "Pingeloms" in it

384
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 or Paris or anything like that

385
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 that I could see that no one else pointed out.

386
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Everyone just said this was a Netflix show.

387
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 So I looked up how to start off with this.

388
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 The Netflix show aired on March 15th, 2019.

389
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 That's the first time you could download it.

390
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 It was season two of that show.

391
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 So I figured maybe there was a reference to it

392
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 a little bit before that time

393
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 as Netflix did make up the story

394
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 and they're trying to create a little coverage for them.

395
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 They could throw up a couple blogs

396
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 and then they release the episode.

397
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 What I found is a bunch of the stories that talk about this

398
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 took place after the airing of that episode

399
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 with two exceptions.

400
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Because even if one of the--

401
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 like I said, even if one of the stories had appeared

402
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 a couple months before that episode,

403
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 I would figure it was just them creating the mythology.

404
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 But December 23rd, 2016,

405
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 so well before the show came out.

406
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 I think that's even before the first season of the show came out.

407
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 There was a poster called "Moonchild"

408
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 on the Amino website,

409
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 which is kind of like a blogging type website.

410
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 You put up whatever you want.

411
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 "Moonchild" specifically does short articles

412
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 about paranormal and conspiracy events.

413
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 Ghosts, Bigfoot, Spectre, stuff like that.

414
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 There's an extra detail in her version of the story.

415
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 She says that this whole story was documented.

416
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 The reason why people know about it today--

417
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 and I would argue nobody knows about it.

418
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 This is one of the most obscure conspiracy theories

419
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 that I've come across that was aired on television.

420
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Because, well, you know, monkeys don't exist

421
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 as an incredibly obscure conspiracy theory.

422
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Forests aren't real.

423
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Those are both obscure conspiracy theories.

424
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 They have no mainstream appeal.

425
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 They do, but the mainstream doesn't know about them.

426
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 This one was aired on Netflix.

427
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 A lot of people are talking about it now.

428
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 She goes, "This first came to light

429
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 in a journal called 'The Bulletin of Knowledge.'

430
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 It was a French journal and it was published in 1903.

431
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 I began looking for the Bulletin of Knowledge.

432
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 I couldn't find anything like that.

433
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 Now, a part of it could be that the fact

434
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 that it's over 100 years old at this point,

435
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 part of the fact is there's going to be translation issues.

436
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Because if I'm typing, I was googling now at this point,

437
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 it's 2 in the morning, I'm typing,

438
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 'Google-ing Bulletin of Knowledge 1903.

439
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Nothing's coming up.

440
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Bulletin of Knowledge 1903.

441
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 France, trying to all this stuff, can't find anything.

442
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 So we have that and everything else

443
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 was the version of the story I just told you.

444
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 And then she goes, "Oh yeah, and it came to light

445
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 because of this Bulletin of Knowledge."

446
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 I ended up messaging Moonschild on Amino,

447
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 asking for more information,

448
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 but the last post she made on that site was in 2017.

449
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 So I doubt she even uses that site anymore.

450
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 If she ever responds to me, I'll let you guys know.

451
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 But that is not even the earliest mention of this story.

452
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 So this popped up on March 30th, 2016.

453
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 So same year, but a couple months earlier.

454
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 There's a site called Prezi, which I believe is Russian

455
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 because the author was writing in Russian.

456
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 I had to run translate on this step.

457
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 Prezi does sound like a Russian word as well,

458
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 but there's a Prezi website.

459
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 And what it is, is that you create PowerPoint-esque presentations

460
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 on the website.

461
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 So then when you tell someone,

462
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 "Hey, check out this presentation,"

463
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 they just go to your web address.

464
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 It's actually kind of a cool idea.

465
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 I don't know if they have that in English or other countries.

466
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 That way you don't have to send over a PowerPoint file.

467
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 You can just say, "Hey, watch this presentation,

468
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 click this mouse, and I'll go through the slides on this website."

469
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 And there's different graphics going on.

470
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 This person's name is Terasenko Evgesha.

471
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 This is the oldest reference.

472
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 I was looking all the way back to 2001.

473
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 This is the oldest reference I could find on it.

474
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 And usually before 2001 is really when the search engines were kicking off.

475
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 That's usually, unless I'm looking for something really old,

476
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 that's usually, "Well, I'll stop because you won't get much results."

477
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 And going all the way back to 2001,

478
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 and I put a limit that I couldn't find any mentions of it before 2019,

479
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 is where I found these two guys,

480
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 was where I found these two sites.

481
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 It was just these two that I could find before the Netflix show aired.

482
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 This is what it says on this website.

483
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 There's a little tiny PowerPoint display,

484
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 and then there's the text of the PowerPoint display

485
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 listed underneath the graphics.

486
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 And this is what it says.

487
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 There's going to be some translation errors,

488
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 some grammatical issues,

489
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 but it just makes it even weirder.

490
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 "Paris fail."

491
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 That's the title of the presentation.

492
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 "Misterious and unexplained phenomenon."

493
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 "Observed in Paris on the night of 29 to 30 December 1902."

494
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 "History."

495
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 "That night, in many places in the city,

496
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 in five minutes one o'clock,"

497
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 which is five minutes after one,

498
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 so again, there's some translation errors here.

499
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 "That night in many places in the city,

500
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 in five minutes one o'clock,"

501
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 "simultaneously stopped wall pendulum clock."

502
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 "At the same time as written,

503
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 'Herald of knowledge,' many people feel nausea, dizziness,

504
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 and fainting proximity."

505
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 "To this day, no one can unravel the mystery of this mystical event."

506
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 "Paris fail."

507
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 "Why?"

508
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 Bizarre.

509
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 And I'm reading this as I'm starting to get...

510
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Now I'm starting to get tired.

511
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 It's almost like a fever dream, reading that thing.

512
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Because it has the elements of the other story.

513
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 The "Herald of knowledge" in the version that comes out months later

514
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 is known as the "Bulletin of knowledge."

515
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 So I don't know if the French bulletin was called the "Herald."

516
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 I don't know if that is a Russian to English translation,

517
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 or like a French to Russian to English translation,

518
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 "Herald versus Bulletin."

519
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 But we see the "of knowledge."

520
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 This is the earliest recording of this supposed event.

521
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 And nowadays people are going...

522
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 Since the Netflix show came out, people have said,

523
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 "What could have caused it?"

524
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 And these are the theories that popped out.

525
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 There was a gravitational flub.

526
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 There was a glitch in the gravitational area around Paris.

527
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 And what was making people nauseous would be the equivalent of a drop on a rollercoaster,

528
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 and your stomach goes into your throat.

529
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 That's what was making people feel sick all of a sudden.

530
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 And because of that gravitational sudden push or pull,

531
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 all the pendulum clocks, which require gravity to help assist that little thing,

532
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 go back and forth, they stopped.

533
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 People have said maybe there was a small earthquake.

534
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 That's the most likely...

535
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 If this thing existed, people would say that's the most likely scenario.

536
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 There was a small earthquake that kind of rumbled everyone's tummy,

537
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 and stopped the clocks.

538
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 But there have been other earthquakes around the world,

539
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 and we haven't seen these two things happen back and forth.

540
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 Then we get into the weird thing.

541
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Some people say that we were hit by a miniature neutron star,

542
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 and I don't know how you wouldn't have seen that,

543
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 but the density of this new object coming into the Earth

544
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 again affected the gravity of everything around it.

545
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Some people say it was some sort of alien experimentation gone wrong.

546
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Or right, maybe.

547
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 But we're left with two questions.

548
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Actually, we're left with a lot of questions with this story.

549
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 The first one is, "Did it happen?"

550
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 And that one is something that we'll probably never be able to figure out.

551
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 But I think the story behind the story is equally interesting.

552
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 So this person who put up this Prezi website,

553
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 does this person, is this person the only one who ever knew this story before posting it?

554
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 This person did do an other Prezi presentation,

555
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 and it was about the Russian language and synchronous city.

556
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 I couldn't make heads or tails of it.

557
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 It was about the circular logic of Russian language.

558
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 Because then, I mean, this was a very, very long essay,

559
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 and there was a bunch of translation issues.

560
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 I couldn't make heads or tails of it.

561
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 So they put up two presentations.

562
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 The other one wasn't about ghosts or spookiness or aliens or anything like that.

563
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 So you have that, and you have this.

564
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 Now, it's possible that this was a joke they came up with,

565
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 that this was some sort of short-form science fiction story they wanted to tell.

566
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 Who knows?

567
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 I have no way of contacting this person.

568
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 I tried searching for them, and I couldn't find anything.

569
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 I was like, "Is there... do you have a Facebook?"

570
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 Whatever. I couldn't find anything on this person.

571
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 Obviously, when you're in the conspiracy realm,

572
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 there's one thing that I immediately went to when I heard this story.

573
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Actually, when I first heard the story, I was like,

574
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 "That's an interesting thing. I wonder what caused it."

575
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 But as I started digging into it,

576
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 and I realized there was a huge disconnect between the people who heard the story,

577
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 and the people who said the story was fake,

578
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 and it appeared in the Netflix special.

579
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 And then you wonder where the Netflix people got ahold of it at?

580
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 I would find it odd that Netflix, who's running two seasons of a show

581
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 with all these mysteries, and they could have done anything about big city mysteries,

582
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 they happened to find this one article written by Moonschild on Amino,

583
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 and said, "Let's do a segment on our show about that."

584
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 And I find it hard to believe that Moonschild was on Amino,

585
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 and then one day she stumbled across the website on Prezi,

586
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 and said, "Oh, I'm gonna flesh that out. Harold of Knowledge? I'll change that to Bolton of Knowledge."

587
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 Obviously, those are the most likely logical answers.

588
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 As a skeptic, it is not impossible for that chain of knowledge to have taken place, at all.

589
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 It's unlikely, but not impossible.

590
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 It's far more possible than the theories that I'm about to throw out.

591
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 As I started to delve into the story, I started to think,

592
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 "You know what this kind of seems like? It almost seems like a Mandela Effect-type event."

593
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 Mandela Effect is basically when people shift, or entire groups,

594
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 millions of people shift from one reality to another,

595
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 and everything is pretty much the same except for small details.

596
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 And stick with me for a second, this is putting on my tinfoil hat here.

597
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 What if those two glorious words for all of us who enjoy this type of stuff,

598
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 what if Terasenko was doing a short history project on Prezi?

599
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 Terasenko had been taught about the Paris time gap since they were a kid.

600
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 They always knew what it was.

601
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 It was this weird event. It was a Tunguska-level event that everyone kind of knew about

602
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 and people had questions about and so on and so forth. No one could explain it.

603
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 But that event is unknown in this reality. Never ever heard of it.

604
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 But Terasenko remembers it, and when they have to put together a little history presentation,

605
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 this is what they talk about.

606
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 Is it possible that Moonschild 2 is from a reality where this happened

607
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 and it was detailed and you'd be able to Google it and you'd find mysteries of Paris?

608
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 And they talk about the catacombs and they talk about these ghosts and they go,

609
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 "Remember that time, but in our reality, those webpages don't exist

610
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 because in our reality that never happened."

611
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 And you have enough people who shifted from that reality into ours

612
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 who remember it as a weird event.

613
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 In their reality, they may come from a reality where there was no Tunguska event,

614
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 where there was no D'Otloff pass.

615
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Some of our crazy experiences we've had, they have no idea.

616
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 When they hear about them, they go, "What? I've never heard of that story before."

617
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 And you're like, "Really? It's kind of famous."

618
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 A bunch of hikers wound up in mountains.

619
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 A known, compelling force squished them all.

620
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 And you're like, "Oh, that's really, really interesting."

621
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Have you ever heard of the Paris time gap and you'd be like, "What are you talking about?"

622
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 But because we talk about such obscure topics, it is common for us to come across stuff

623
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 we've never heard about before.

624
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 But this might be the oddest thing I've stumbled across.

625
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 Because I thought it had an easy answer and it turns out that there's more questions now,

626
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 not just about the event, but how we know about the event in the first place.

627
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 It would only take a handful of people to shift from one reality to another

628
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 to start posting stuff, to spread these stories.

629
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 And then eventually, they get told around enough forums

630
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 that Netflix decides, "Oh, that's a weird story," and throws it into their special.

631
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 But because everyone without a doubt today could say that never happened,

632
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 one person was saying, "Listen, I'm a European history major.

633
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 I've studied France. I've never heard of this story before. It has to be made up."

634
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 People who have smitten their entire life in this reality would, to the death, say that story never happened.

635
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 But to the refugees from that reality, it was a very, very well-known event.

636
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 Sometimes it's not a question of, "Did the event happen?"

637
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Was it faked? Is this some sort of clickbait thing?

638
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 Sometimes the question is, "Why did it happen? Was it a neutron star? Was it an earthquake?

639
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 Was it some sort of gravitational mishap?"

640
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 But this one, this one almost defies these questions.

641
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 From a PowerPoint website to a Netflix show to being a growing, mysterious story

642
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 that's being easily debunked because everyone just goes back to Netflix.

643
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 The story of the Paris time gap has a lot of mysteries.

644
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 Whether it happened or why it happened is almost irrelevant at this point.

645
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 I think the question is, "Why do we know about it?

646
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 Is this just a fictional tale? Is it clickbait?

647
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 Or is it a sign that people from another reality are here

648
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 and they're wondering why no one else remembers one of the biggest mysteries of their lifetime?

649
