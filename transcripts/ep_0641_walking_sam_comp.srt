1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 In a world that is constantly at war between the forces of good and the forces of evil,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 can a super powerful creature remain neutral?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 And then we travel to South Dakota, where a mysterious spirit currently resides.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 Is there any truth to the story of a creature so malevolent,

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 it encourages young men and women to hang themselves today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys have some awesome plans for the weekend.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 We are headed towards the end of season 13.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 We're going to have two weeks left of episodes and then here's some news for you guys.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Normally I take a week off every 50 episodes.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Going forward, I'm going to take two weeks off every 50 episodes.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 It's just a week off is not enough to recover from doing this show.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 I love doing this show, but it is a lot of work.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 That means we are going to have two weeks of classic episodes.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 So Patreon supporters, make sure to post or email me however you want to do it.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Let me know what your favorite episodes are.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 So I will cover those and all of the classic episodes have like another 20, 30 minutes of bonus content at the ending.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 It's behind the scenes stuff or story updates. All sorts of really cool information.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 So I hope you guys stick around for the classics episodes.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 So we're going to do two more weeks.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Then I'm going to take two weeks off and we are then headed into season 14 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Can you guys believe that?

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 I can't believe it.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Another thing I can't believe.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Coming in right now, writing in a, I don't know, I'm running out of stuff for you guys to come in.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Writing in a cloud car with a bunch of carabairs.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 It's one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Hoots Cheech, everyone give a round of applause to Hoots Cheech.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 He has a little carabair symbol on his thumb.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 He's basically, I turned him into a carabair for this.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 He's like, oh great, I love carabairs.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Come on in Hoots Cheech, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon or if you're not a race of animated bears, that's fine too.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Just helps read the word about the show.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Really, really helps out a lot.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Everyone give Hoots Cheech tummy, a little rub, and as he shoots out a carabair stare, dude.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 His little symbol is actually the hair hang glider.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 He made the hair hang glider appear.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Everyone grab onto his furry little feet.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Hoots Cheech, take us out of Dead Rabbit Command.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 We are headed to Northern Africa.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Probably not great to hold onto a three foot tall bear's feet for an transatlantic journey,

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 but hold on guys.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Hair hang gliders flying out to Northern Africa.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Specifically, we're headed out to Eastern Algeria.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 All the information we're about to cover actually got from the website Cabos.com.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 They specialize in Islamic cryptids, Islamic paranormal activity.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 It's a really cool website.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 And this article is written by Abdel Rezak Tora.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 So thank you so much for putting this out.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 And while we're in Eastern Algeria, we have to take a bus, right?

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 The hair hang glider crashed.

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 It's not great to have a carabair flight, one of those things.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 We end up having to catch a bus into town.

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 We're sitting at a bus stop.

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 We look over and a man walks up and sits down next to us.

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 He just kind of nods and then is trying to mind his own business.

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Well, we start to notice some interesting things about this man.

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 He's white, not Caucasian.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 He actually is, like his skin is very, very white, almost like chalk white.

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 He has blue eyes and yellow eyelashes.

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 We're just kind of staring at him.

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Very, very rude people.

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 We're staring at this man and he's just kind of sitting there.

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 We also noticed that the entire time, even walking up to the bus stop,

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 his hands have been in his pockets.

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 We're just sitting there, we're looking at him and we go, "Oh, that's kind of weird."

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 He's kind of chalky, hands in the pockets.

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 We're thinking, "That's kind of weird, right?"

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 I mean, it's not really for the point of the story.

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 He's a chalky white man with his hands in his pockets and we're thinking,

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 "Hmm, immediately the man stands up and disappears."

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 But not so much disappears.

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 We actually start to see him run and then he's gone in a flash.

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 You know who else is going to...

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 The Flash from Zack Snyder's Justice League.

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 No, he runs away.

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 What we've just met is an all-rubon.

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 He's a half-man, half-gen.

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Now, what's interesting about this guy?

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 We actually covered a parallel to this dude in Morocco.

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 I'll put the episode in the show notes.

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 These were people known as the Zahori.

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 They were half human, half-gen.

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 They had all sorts of indicators that they were not all human.

87
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 And one of them was markings on their hands,

88
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 the way that they would have certain lines on their hands.

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 And there's a Hori were children who were half human, half-gen,

90
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 who were raised on Earth.

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 So they were raised with all the human customs,

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 but they actually had gen blood in them.

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 And you could actually force these children,

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 or use magical spells on these children,

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 or really what's...

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 It's a real crime wave they're having in that country.

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 They would torture and murder children, hoping that their blood

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 would lead people to buried treasure.

99
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 What's interesting is we have a parallel to that in eastern Algeria,

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 but this time it's the all-rubon.

101
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 And in this one, it is a half-human, half-gen.

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 It is a gen who mated with a living person.

103
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 But the child was taken to the gen dimension and raised there.

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Instead of being raised by loving human parents,

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 and getting to play Nintendo and watch "Punky Brewster,"

106
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 and eventually have to outrun people,

107
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 trying to kidnap you and use you to help find treasure,

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 these kids are actually raised in a dimension of smokeless fire.

109
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 They're like, "Great."

110
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 They're watching through the void.

111
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Everyone else playing Nintendo, they're like,

112
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 "Mom, Dad, can I have a Nintendo?"

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 They're like, "You have a Nintendo."

114
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 It's just a pit of despair.

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 They're like, "Oh, man."

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 When they grow up, though, they are allowed to leave

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 and go to our world.

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 And they show up and they're like,

119
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 "The first thing I'm gonna do is play every video game ever."

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 You ever see someone who's an avid collector of anything child-related?

121
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 Toys, games, comic books?

122
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Most likely they lived in a gen dimension most of their life.

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 They're experiencing it all for the first time.

124
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 The reason why the gen kick 'em out of the dimension when they become adults,

125
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 because they're not true gen.

126
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 They're not real gen, so after they've been raised in the gen world,

127
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 they're kicked out, they're sent back here.

128
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 And they said, "One of the reasons why is because they're not full gen,

129
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 there's actually some conflicts with them."

130
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 One of the things, gen love to eat like bones and stuff like that,

131
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 which can't be very nutritious, right?

132
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Are you really getting all your vitamins from those human bones?

133
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 They eat waste?

134
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 I don't know if that's actually like human waste or just garbage.

135
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 It doesn't really matter.

136
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 If I saw someone eating a diaper and then I see someone else eating rotten food,

137
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 I'm like, "Oh, that guy with the rotten food.

138
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Now that is a guy I'm lying out with."

139
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 They're both disgusting.

140
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 Also, apparently, gen love to eat leftovers.

141
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 And normal humans don't, according to this article I read.

142
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 And I was like, "What?

143
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Leftovers are the best.

144
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 As long as they're not dirty diapers or rotten food.

145
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 Day old spaghetti, I'm down with."

146
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 So, when they come to our planet, they love to eat,

147
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 they love to eat like real human food,

148
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 because all they've been raised on for the past 18 years

149
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 is bodily fluid food and garbage.

150
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 But the reason why they hide their hands is that's one of the ways to identify them.

151
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 Obviously, like the chalky white skin, they see in the yellow eyelashes,

152
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 you've got to be real close to someone to see the color of their eyelashes.

153
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 And if you saw someone with chalky white skin,

154
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 you just think it was that dude powder or Michael Jackson hanging out in your neighborhood,

155
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 which would raise a whole bunch of questions because powder is a fictional character

156
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 and Michael Jackson is dead, but you wouldn't immediately think it was a half human, half gen,

157
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 but their hands also have markings on them, which apparently are easily identifiable.

158
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 The article didn't say what the markings were,

159
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 but they're so identifiable that the Al Ruban walks around with their hands in their pockets.

160
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 And the reason why he got up and ran away just when we were thinking,

161
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 "Well, that's weird," he can read minds.

162
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 One of the self-defense mechanisms that these guys have is they can tell when they've raised suspicion.

163
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 The second somebody starts to question their existence, they run away.

164
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 The Zahori were human children who had gin blood in them, who were raised in our world,

165
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 and they were just used as basically dowsing rods to find treasure.

166
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 They had none of these supernatural defenses.

167
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 The Al Ruban, because they've been raised in the gin dimension, at least have telepathy.

168
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 At least they could know when someone's sneaking up behind them.

169
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Why would someone sneak up behind an Al Ruban?

170
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 Unfortunately, the same reason why they kidnapped the Zahori in Morocco.

171
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 If you take one of these Al Ruban in eastern Algeria, you take a prisoner,

172
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 they will have to show you where underground treasure is.

173
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 So even though we're in different parts of Africa and there's different origin stories for these beings,

174
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 the end result is the same.

175
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 It's basically a leprechaun now that I think about it with more torture and blood.

176
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 If you capture one of these guys, they will lead you to treasure.

177
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 But the Zahori are just children who get kidnapped in the cars, and that is a real crime that is happening.

178
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 These guys at least have the ability to run away at super fast speeds and the ability to read minds.

179
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 They are much, much harder to catch.

180
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 I also find the idea of a neutral, supernatural character very interesting.

181
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 I thought about doing this story for a while. I was supposed to do it a week or two ago.

182
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 I was supposed to do it when I did this Zahori story.

183
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 I was supposed to do it the next day and then it got pushed back.

184
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 Then I was going to do it the next week or two.

185
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 I mentioned it on an episode, it got pushed back.

186
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 And I've been wanting to cover it because we do have stuff.

187
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 I guess Bigfoot is a neutral spirit.

188
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Bigfoot sometimes attacks people, but a lot of times just kind of walks through the woods.

189
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 But Bigfoot doesn't really have... he can't do anything.

190
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Sure, he's super strong and he can teleport.

191
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 I mean, that's more than I can do, right?

192
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 Waiting for Bigfoot to show behind me and start beating me up.

193
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 "How's this, podcast man?"

194
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 I'm like, "Ah, but he just kind of hangs down the woods."

195
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 You never run into Bigfoot in any other sector.

196
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 This guy, and people want to catch him, but they kind of just want to throw a net over him or take pictures.

197
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Or maybe shoot his children. I don't know. They do want proof of him.

198
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 But the Alru Bon, there's an actual reason behind hunting this guy.

199
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 He has superpowers. He has telepathy. He has super speed.

200
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 And he wants nothing.

201
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 These Alru Bon, they just want to be left alone.

202
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 They don't want to be known. They don't want to be identified. They don't want to be steadied.

203
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 They just want to exist and be left alone.

204
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 A lot of times cryptids are out hunting humans.

205
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Yesterday we covered Satan's head rolling around.

206
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Things like that. Ghosts, spooky ghosts.

207
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 And I guess there are neutral ghosts as well.

208
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 I don't know why the idea on this one, I think because he has the ability.

209
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 An Alru Bon. I mean, like a ghost is just like, "You come into the house, it messes with you."

210
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 And then maybe if it's a demon, it leaves. But the demon is malevolent.

211
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 If it's a neutral ghost, normally they're just a recording in a specific location.

212
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 An Alru Bon, just with the power of telepathy, they could have a huge effect on the world.

213
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 And they just want to be left alone.

214
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 They were raised in a hell dimension for 18 years. Now they're finally out on their own and they don't want to make waves.

215
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Find that very odd. I think it would actually be a powerful ally for the forces of good to team up with one of these guys just because of the telepathy.

216
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 And then if you need to get anywhere fast, you just hop on his back.

217
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 He's like, "I'm not super strong, bro. You're 280 pounds."

218
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 I'm like, "Mush, mush, Alru Bon." He's like, "Ugh."

219
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 You could also see the forces of evil wanting to align with these guys.

220
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 Because they can blend in perfectly with humans other than the chalky white skin.

221
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 They could blend in perfectly in a Michael Jackson lookalike contest.

222
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 And they have telepathy and super speed.

223
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 So I could see both of these sides, good and evil wanting to align themselves with them.

224
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 But they just want to be left alone. They don't have any lust for power.

225
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 They just have a lust for life. They just want to hang out and try all those Nintendo games they missed growing up.

226
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 So should we leave them alone or should we try to recruit them?

227
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 That is the question. If you ever find yourself in eastern Algeria sitting next to a chalky white man who keeps his hands in his pockets,

228
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 just say, "I'm one of the good ones."

229
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 And then put a butterfly net over his head and catch him and bring him to dead rabbit command.

230
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 Maybe when the time comes, they will join the side of good and help us in the eternal war.

231
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 Especially the eternal war against this next guy.

232
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 This next story is super creepy.

233
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 "Who's Cheech? Use your Care Bear Stare to shoot out a beam."

234
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 "Who's Cheech?" It's like, "Dude, I don't even know what a Care Bear is."

235
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 As we rub his little fuzzy hair.

236
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 "Use your Care Bear Stare to make a Carbenter copter appear."

237
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 It's all cartoony and cloudy and pretty dope looking.

238
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 "Who's Cheech? We're going to pick you up and put you in the pilot's seat."

239
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 "Take us out of eastern Algeria. We are headed out to South Dakota."

240
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 Rainbow. Rainbow. Cartoon rainbow trailing behind the Carbenter copter.

241
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 On Monday's episode, I said that I recently found a Reddit post and it was like an "Ask Me Anything" or whatever.

242
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 It was "Spooky Stories About Native American Legends."

243
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 We've covered two so far this week and this is the last one.

244
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 This one I got from a Reddit user named LakotaGirl.

245
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 So thank you so much for pointing this out. This is a truly terrifying story.

246
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 I want to say this actually before we start the segment.

247
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 We're going to be talking about suicide during this segment and I want to let you guys know that

248
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 if you are struggling with issues of suicide, if you're struggling with issues of thoughts of harm in yourself,

249
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 don't do it. That is not the way to do it.

250
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 I want to give you this number, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

251
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 This lifeline. Use it when you need it. They will help you.

252
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 It's 1-800-273-8255. That's 1-800-273-8255.

253
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Don't. It's not worth it, guys. It's 100% not worth it.

254
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 1-800-273-8255. If you're having any thoughts of self-harm or suicide, please call that number.

255
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 We care about you.

256
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 HootsCheech is flying us out to South Dakota.

257
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 And as we're going out there, I have to share some very grim statistics with you.

258
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Overall, in the United States, suicide is considered the ninth most common form of death.

259
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 It's a real problem.

260
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 But in South Dakota, between the ages of 15 and 24, it is the second leading cause of death in the state of South Dakota.

261
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 They have a massive problem with suicide.

262
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 When you look at the native population of South Dakota, the native Americans who live in South Dakota,

263
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 it is 2.4 times higher than the Caucasian population of South Dakota.

264
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 And so you ask why? Why are we seeing this massive difference between the native Americans who are living there

265
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 and the other ethnic groups that are living there?

266
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 And people can point out, and they have pointed out, lack of jobs, high amounts of adult alcoholism,

267
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 you have kids being raised in really, really disrupted households, economically depressed area.

268
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 And those are all real factors. Those are all 100% real factors.

269
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 But even in the communities of South Dakota, there are whispers that have turned to cries for help

270
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 about a creature known as "Walking Sam."

271
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 HootsCheech landed us at the South Dakota Aglala Lakota Reservation.

272
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 And at this reservation, there are stories of this creature known as "Walking Sam."

273
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 It's a 7 foot tall, stick-like shadow wearing a little top hat.

274
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 His limbs are long and spindly, and he whistles as he walks through the darkness.

275
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 It's a very, very typical idea of a shadow person.

276
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 We've definitely seen shadow people with the top hats, generally called the "hat man."

277
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 There is a Native American legend of a race of shadow people called "stick Indians"

278
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 because they are basically stick figures, shadow people but are stick figures.

279
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 But this one, "Walking Sam," has a particular lust for blood, and a very cruel way of getting it.

280
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 His arms are long and thin, but when he raises them out, you see underneath his arms,

281
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 from his armpit to his wrist are dozens of nooses, and from those nooses hang his trophies,

282
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 the bodies of suicide victims.

283
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 You can't hide from "Walking Sam," whether you're in your house, out in town,

284
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 or walking across the pitch black field.

285
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 He will find you, obviously as a shadow figure, he waits till night.

286
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 But even if he can't get physically close to you, you'll hear him.

287
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 And I'm not talking about the whistling, you'll hear his voice tell you.

288
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 "No one loves you."

289
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 "There's nothing left here for you."

290
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 "Look at your father."

291
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 "Do you want to end up like him?"

292
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 "You know a cheat."

293
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 "Do you want to end up like him?"

294
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 "You know a cheat."

295
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 "You know a cheat."

296
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 "Joy me."

297
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 "Joy me."

298
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 [Dogs barking]

299
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 He convinces these young people that they're worthless.

300
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 There's just no hope.

301
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 So why not just get it over with?

302
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 This isn't an obscure myth. This isn't some creepypasta that I'm telling you to be super spooky.

303
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 This is a very well-known story in this region.

304
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 And it's been around for a long time, and now it does have a high-tech twist.

305
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 This is-- I want to be 100% clear on this.

306
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 This is not a story that Lakota Girl said, and it's just some creepypasta.

307
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 There are town meetings about walking Sam.

308
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 And there are huge issues with suicide in South Dakota, especially among the youth.

309
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 Parents and guardians and teachers are finding Facebook videos shared among the youth in South Dakota

310
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 on how to make nooses, how to perfect killing yourself.

311
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 There have been cases where adults have caught news that there is a mass suicide planned.

312
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 And they ran out into the forest and were able to stop a group of kids before they hung themselves.

313
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 This is recent news. This isn't ancient stuff.

314
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 But this ancient story of walking Sam is getting wrapped up in these new stories.

315
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Between December 2014 and May 2015, in South Dakota, in these Native American reservation areas,

316
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 103 suicide attempts from December to May, nine of them, unfortunately, were successful.

317
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 There's also a report in the area of the police getting wind of a tree out in a field

318
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 where several nooses were already prepared, just swaying in the breeze.

319
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 The police saw that as an open invitation.

320
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 Someone had made those nooses and hung them from the tree

321
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 and was sharing the location of the tree on Facebook

322
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 as an invitation for those who couldn't perfect making the noose themselves.

323
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 At Pine Ridge, that's a city in South Dakota, is where we had these town meetings

324
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 and people were bringing up walking Sam.

325
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Citizens of Pine Ridge were saying they were actually seeing walking Sam physically moving through the community.

326
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 The seven foot tall shadow man was in that town.

327
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 You start to get more and more reports of walking Sam trying to convince the youth of Pine Ridge to join him.

328
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 One woman asked the police, "You guys need to keep an eye out for him."

329
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 And she believed that by using police scanners you could pick up his whispers.

330
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 You could pick up his sales pitch, convincing the children to kill themselves.

331
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 Whether or not walking Sam was actually in Pine Ridge, this was declared a state of emergency.

332
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 The Aglala Sioux Tribe in the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation received a grant of $400,000 to combat suicide in their town.

333
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 We're talking about an area where 70% of the population drops out of school and 75% of the adults are alcoholics.

334
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 And in this entire region, six mental health professionals.

335
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 $400,000 honestly seems like a drop in the bucket.

336
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 But they're fighting the best that they can to convince these children that suicide is not the answer.

337
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 But you still have people in the community who believe that yes, we do need to work on these social issues.

338
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 And yes, we do need to come together as a group, as a people, and save everyone.

339
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 But walking Sam is also a factor, and we can't spend our way out of this creature's grasp.

340
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 They're not saying nor the social problems, they're not saying ignore the fact that they need more mental health counselors.

341
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 But you also need to look at the spiritual side.

342
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 But just when you thought the story couldn't get any creepier,

343
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 just when you thought the story could not get any more bizarre than the fact that we have a real life suicide epidemic,

344
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 and it may be connected in part.

345
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 I mean, again, there are serious social issues going on in this region, but part of it may be a spiritual component.

346
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Just when you thought you couldn't get any more bizarre,

347
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Lakota Girl in her Reddit post added a new wrinkle to this whole story.

348
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 Hoots Cheech, let's hop back in that carbonicopter, we are going back in time, and we are headed out to Minnesota.

349
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 [Members singing]

350
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 We're now back in the year 1862, and we're on the front lines of the Dakota War.

351
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 Minnesota was recently made a state, and you had the Sioux Tribe and all these other Native American groups in Minnesota,

352
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 and they had set up treaties.

353
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 And if anyone is familiar with US history, the treaties were not considered really worth anything.

354
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 The US government goes, "Oh, the thing we signed? Ah, no, that was an accident."

355
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 We fell on the table and our pen accidentally made our name, but we're actually not going to honor them.

356
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 So these treaties weren't being honored. You had more people coming into Minnesota and the tribes that were there already were like,

357
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 "Hey, you're supposed to pay us for this land, you're supposed to pay us for this use."

358
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 They weren't getting their paychecks, so there was an uprising, like anyone would do.

359
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 It only lasted from August to September, however.

360
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 Most of the warfare was Native Americans versus settlers.

361
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 But then eventually the federal troops came in and that's what ended the uprising.

362
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 And they ended up catching and imprisoning a lot of these Native Americans.

363
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 But the federal troops end up leaving the area, and the local authority goes,

364
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 "Well, what do we do with all of these captured prisoners? I know we'll put them on trial,

365
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 but they don't really put them on trial. They put them on military trial."

366
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 And these were actually, there's a lot of controversy about this even back then.

367
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 These were people having an armed uprising which made them combatants.

368
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 And you can't really charge someone with murder if they're fighting a war.

369
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 You may not like the fact that they're killing the enemy, but there are, there's basically war laws, there's war crimes.

370
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 And fighting and killing other people isn't a war crime.

371
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 But there's no federal authority here right now. You have the local militias taking these guys and holding military trials.

372
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 There was 400 trials in one month. Some of the trials were only five minutes long.

373
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 And by the end of it, 303 of them were sentenced to death.

374
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 But you, like I said, there was controversy. So people were appealing this, people in the area, other politicians are like,

375
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 "Well, you can't charge them with murder." Two people were charged with rape, and everyone was like,

376
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 "Whatever happens to them, that's fine. They deserve it."

377
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 But they were like, "All these other people, these 303 people, you're going to sentence to death for murder, but they're fighting a war."

378
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 They lost, and we don't agree with the war. Like, we agree we're doing the right thing, but you can't charge them with this.

379
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 It sets a bad precedent. So this basically starts getting appealed up, and eventually it gets to the highest level of government,

380
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 and they say, "You're right. We can't sentence these guys to death for war-time killings."

381
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 But there was 39 of them who were, they looked at it and they go, "No, these people are going to be killed."

382
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 These people actually committed crimes. We're not going to let them go.

383
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 Two of those guys were the rapists, and the other 37 were basically being sentenced for murdering during war, which there was still controversy about that.

384
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 But 303 names were commuted, and that does not mean they were sent free. It means that they were going to be imprisoned, but they were not going to be killed.

385
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 The 39 people, they are going to be executed. The rest of them are sent to prison for three years.

386
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 One third of them die in prison, just due to disease. And then the rest of them, when they get out of prison, because the treaties were broken,

387
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 because of the uprising, the federal government took all the indigenous people in that area and forced them to move, kicked them all out of Minnesota.

388
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 So you had people coming out of prison, they had a one in three chance of dying in prison, they get out, their families, their friends, their tribes are gone.

389
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 The other 39 people whose sentences weren't commuted were hung.

390
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 To this day, it is the largest mass execution in U.S. history.

391
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 Now, when I said the trial transcripts were sent up the federal ladder, they actually were sent all the way up to the desk of Abraham Lincoln.

392
00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 And he said that he read every trial transcript of all 303 people, and the 39 that were not commuted, the 39 that were hung, he personally signed their execution order.

393
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 He read the trial transcript and says, "These men must die."

394
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 Remember when I said the prisoners were let go after three years and everyone had been forced out of Minnesota?

395
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 They were sent to South Dakota, and that's where they remain to this day.

396
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 Pine Ridge, the small community that's having such a problem with suicide and having a problem with walking Sam, is an hour and a half away from Mount Rushmore, a sacred native location that has the head of Abraham Lincoln carved into it.

397
00:28:42,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 The same president who ordered the largest mass execution in U.S. history, having them hung all in one day, and then having their families pushed out of the state, pushed out of the land they existed on for hundreds, for thousands of years.

398
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 And now, where their descendants live, a tall man with thin limbs and a top hat walks through their community, nooses dangling from his arms, trying to take more souls.

399
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 Is it possible that walking Sam is not just a random shadow man, but the doomed soul of America's 16th president, Abraham Lincoln?

400
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 It's a bizarre theory, of course, that America's 16th president is now a shadow man who's convincing young native men and women to hang themselves.

401
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 Some might say it's tasteless, but in the world of the weird, anything is possible.

402
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 Even a man like Abraham Lincoln, in death, could be cursed to walk the darkness.

403
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 Whether or not walking Sam is Abraham Lincoln, it's an interesting, unnerving twist to the story.

404
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 It's already so bizarre and it's just a weird element to it, but whether or not walking Sam is Abraham Lincoln is kind of moot, really.

405
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 I mean, if this creature is walking through your neighborhood, walking through your state, it doesn't matter where he came from at a certain point.

406
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 It's like you're not concerned about the lightning bolt that sets the forest on fire.

407
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 You're not like going, "What cloud did that come from?" You have to put out the fire.

408
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 And that's what they're trying to do in this area now. They're just trying to put out these fires.

409
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 But here's the thing. You do need more mental health counseling. We do need to address dropout rates.

410
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 We do need to address drug and alcohol rates. We do need to address social issues.

411
00:30:51,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 But you can't pray your way to become a millionaire and you can't spend your way out of that hole inside of you.

412
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 You can't spend a billion dollars and try to fix that depression that exists in your soul.

413
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 If you want to be a millionaire, you have to use materialistic means.

414
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 And by looking at things like poverty and social injustice, you can use money to start to build a framework to get out of those,

415
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 but you have to heal the soul of the individuals. And that takes a spiritual set of tools.

416
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 You have to heal both.

417
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 Walking Sam may just be a personification of suicide, of loss, of depression.

418
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 It may be a metaphor that people have made real through their stories.

419
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 Or walking Sam could be a demon.

420
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 That is feeding on the deaths of young people.

421
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 You have to fix both the material world and the spiritual world to completely cure a human.

422
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 You have to do both.

423
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 If we ignore the existence of walking Sam, if we say he's nothing but a fairytale,

424
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 and don't address that at all, the only one who wins is walking Sam.

425
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 And he will continue his campaign of mayhem until his arms are full of nooses.

426
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 But there's always room for one more.
