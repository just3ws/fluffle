00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 When a fire breaks out in an apartment complex, all the residents rush to save each other.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 But when the firefighters show up and they begin to douse the flames, that's when the mystery begins.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 And then we travel to Belize to ask the question, "Can a serial killer kill someone they've never met?"

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 [Music]

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. I'm feeling a lot better too, so hopefully that is apparent in my voice.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Feeling much, much better.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Someone who always makes me feel better, always giving me a ride around town.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Everyone stand up and give a round of applause to one of our Thanksgiving live stream contributors.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 It's Church Going Mule. Everyone give a big round of applause for Church Going Mule.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 I'm riding around on his back. Wee!

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Church Going's also sent in a ton of stories as well.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Long time supporter of the show, long time listener of the show.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Church Going Mule, you're going to be the captain of the pilot this episode.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 If you guys cancel by the Patreon, I totally get it. Trust me, I get it.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Just help spread the word about the show. That helps out so much.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 I understand not being able to give money financially.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 But if you can just tell your friends and family about it, or put up flyers, like I have in the show notes,

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 that also really, really helps out the show. I really appreciate it.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 So, oh, and we are going to do Christmas Eve live stream. It will be 5pm Pacific Standard Time.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 If you want to join us for that, it will probably be about an hour long, I'm thinking.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 So, Christmas Eve live stream, and I think that's all of the general notes that I have to start off with.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Church Going Mule, I'm going to go ahead and get ready to catch them in your clumpers there.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Church Going Mule, I'm going to toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit dirgible.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We're headed all the way out.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 To Mexico.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,000

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Church Going Mule, I'm going to go ahead and get ready to catch them in your clumpers there.

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Fabiola and her husband kind of look at each other like there was someone there just a couple minutes ago.

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 So after the firefighters do their job and they go away,

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 (Fabiola and her husband mumbling)

79
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 they wait until the sound effect stops before everyone else kind of shuffles back into the apartment complex.

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 The more curious among them including Fabiola and her husband.

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Go upstairs, I think it was taking place like on the fourth floor.

82
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 So they go up to the apartment and they open the door and it's wet and it's charred.

83
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 The place is pretty charred up. The fire didn't completely destroy the place.

84
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 But it was empty. There's no furniture, no television, no PlayStation, nothing.

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 All that was there was a bucket, a charred nightstand,

86
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 which I'm assuming was a normal nightstand before the events of the night.

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 A little bench, a mirror, and because this story was reported in Spanish so there's a bit of translation errors.

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 But in a velodora ahumada, a velodora ahumada,

89
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 which directly translates as a smoked candle.

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 So I don't know what that is. I mean obviously I'm going to guess it's a candle that was used, a used candle.

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Which would point out how the fire started, these used candles.

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 But other than that there was nobody there.

93
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 And the residents now believe that in some sort of odd way, if I'm just so fascinated, the residents kind of believe,

94
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 I won't say all of them, maybe 30% of them, we didn't take a poll, but

95
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 there are residents now who believe that Fabiola and her husband are really all the people who were thrown water into the apartment.

96
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 They rescued a ghost. This was a ghost trapped in this apartment.

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 And she's now free to wander the world, to go buy a slurpee, whatever.

98
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 Fascinating story for a couple different reasons.

99
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 One, what we're looking at is the traditional Phantom Hitchhiker type story, right?

100
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 A couple driving down the road, they see a girl, she looks like she's a teenager, maybe on the way to her prom,

101
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 or she got dumped by her boyfriend, whatever, and you drive her home and then when you get to your house,

102
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 she turns back and all that's left is a soaking wet jacket.

103
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 If I left a detail out, usually this happens at night in the rain, and the guy gives the girl the jacket,

104
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 and then when they turn around, they pull up to the girl's house, they get her there, and then when they look in the back seat,

105
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 there's just a soaked jacket, and then they go to the house and they ask, hey, that girl, she totally ruined my jacket.

106
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 And the people in the house go, oh, our daughter Ann died on a horrible night just like this, and I killed her,

107
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 I'm confessing I the dad killed her, but no, you know, she died on a car crash,

108
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 or she's headed prom, got her head chopped off by maniac, and so this is a Phantom Hitchhiker story, they're very, very popular.

109
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 I think it's one of the first urban legends kids really here.

110
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 They have that in a different setting, because that's essentially what this is, if it's a ghost story,

111
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 we have someone being rescued from a location they don't want to be in, and being set free.

112
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 So on a simple urban legend, and this has been reported in the media, so I'm not saying like this is an urban legend,

113
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 but from a simple urban legend standpoint, it sounds like that.

114
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 I came across a story on coast2coastam.com, which is one of the seven websites they check every single day.

115
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 I love it, I get a ton of good stuff from there.

116
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 And they got it from millennio.com, which is a Mexican news website.

117
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 But we have this, obviously it's a couple different ways we look at it.

118
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 We have the rational way that there is a used candle in an abandoned apartment, and this woman was squatting there.

119
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 She was on the run from like the IRS or her ex or whatever, or she's some assassin,

120
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 and I mean whatever whimsical or tragic backstory you offer this woman, and she knocks over the candle,

121
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 she causes the fire, gets trapped, she's rescued, and then when she's outdoors, she's like, "Oh, I'm out of here, do not."

122
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 "I'm on the run, I gotta keep doing what I'm doing, running."

123
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 She disappears into the darkness, it's 4 AM when this all happens.

124
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Or the idea that it is a ghost, it's a phantom hitchhiker type story, but I was reading the story and I go,

125
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 "Dude, what if it's both, kind of, right? Because I'm a contrarian, I just can't handle it being cut and dry."

126
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 I was reading the story and I thought, "Okay, so there is a smoked candle, a used candle, whatever it is, in the room."

127
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 And that might have started the fire, but it seemed to be a pretty big fire.

128
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 I don't know what else would have been combustible in that room.

129
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 And the way it was described now, again, maybe I described it as this roaring inferno and it was just a slight fire.

130
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 There's really no such thing as a slight fire. We don't know how much room of it was, how much surface area was on fire.

131
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 But again, again, one square foot or ten square feet, I'm out of there.

132
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 But I was reading this and I thought, "Dude, what if?"

133
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Conspiracy cap fully on.

134
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 What if this woman is on the run, this wasn't where she normally lives, she's not a ghost, she's kind of a squatter,

135
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 and she was there performing some sort of ritual.

136
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 And she's there, I mean, to be the perfect place, right? If you're going to summon some sort of horrible demon or do something that, you know,

137
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 you're going to do something that could be risky, you're not going to do it at your own house.

138
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 I mean, you could. You'd be adult.

139
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 You definitely lower the profit value when Baphomet is always sitting on your toilet.

140
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 So imagine someone, and I started thinking, I wonder how often this happens at empty real estate houses and things like that,

141
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 where you break into this house, you perform your ritual there.

142
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 A mirror, a candle, a bench.

143
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Those are all things humans use, right?

144
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 But those are also things, those are also things that are used in rituals.

145
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 I just find that so fascinating.

146
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 I mean, that's what you would do if you were dealing with high level magic, high level summoning.

147
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 You go to a place that's not yours, you're doing this ritual, it goes wrong.

148
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 The room, it goes so wrong, the room erupts in flames.

149
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 The ritual's gone wrong. You leave the scene.

150
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 You get out of there and you leave.

151
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Well, if she did open something, did she close it?

152
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 What's the repercussions of her performing this ritual wrong?

153
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Is that next door apartment to Fabiola and her husband no longer abandoned, no longer empty?

154
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Instead, there's something there, some primal force sitting in the dark apartment,

155
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 waiting for someone to open that door again.

156
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 I mean, in that scenario, you would want it to be the ghost, right?

157
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 You would definitely want it to be the ghostly hitchhiker in a scenario like that.

158
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 But that's what I was thinking when I was reading this article, I thought.

159
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 It's going to be something far darker than just someone on the run,

160
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 or a phantom hitchhiker type story, this could have been someone trying to summon something.

161
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 It went sideways. She left and that rift, that door, still there.

162
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 It's always creepy to think, I mean, you have no control over what your neighbors do.

163
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 Whether or not they're squatters or just regular neighbors, they could be working with dark forces.

164
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 Either accidentally or on purpose, but even if their kids are just goofing off with a Ouija board,

165
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 they're right next to your really thin walls. You're sharing a single wall with some 13-year-old girl's room.

166
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 And you're on a friend's constantly doing Ouija boards and they're like, "What? This doesn't work.

167
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 This is lame." And you're constantly being possessed in your house.

168
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 "Bobby will not ask you to dance." "I need you flipping out. Your eyeballs are bulging out."

169
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 But you just never know, right? You never know what your neighbors are up to.

170
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 And that's really a good segue for our next story.

171
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Church going mule, I'm going to toss you the keys of the Carbenter Coptor.

172
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 We're leaving behind Altamira. We're headed all the way out to Belize.

173
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 [imitates carbenter]

174
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Church going mule is flying us over to Belize. And as he's doing that, I'm going to turn around.

175
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 I'm going to look at you sitting in the backseat of the Carbenter Coptor.

176
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 I'm like, "Okay, so I got to warn you, this story's really creepy."

177
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 This story's really creepy. I'm getting the emails. I get these every...

178
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 I probably get them at the end of every season. "Hey Jason, the show's getting a little too dark."

179
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 And I don't know why that happens. I kind of just report the stories that I find.

180
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 But this story, this story intrigued me so much that I actually postponed other stories.

181
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 They're not going to get done until next season. It's going to be two weeks because I'm taking my season break.

182
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 This story's really creepy and it is really dark, so I'm giving you this warning.

183
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 But I just sometimes you just got to cover them. This story is so bizarre.

184
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 But if you don't want to hear something really disturbing, I will see you Friday.

185
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 I mean, again, it is Christmas time. We're probably going to plan that out better, but man, the story's nuts.

186
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 Church going mule, bring us over Belize City.

187
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 That's in the Belize district, in the country of Belize.

188
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 I don't know. They just must not have a really good naming team over there, a marketing team or whatever.

189
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 It's September 8th, 1998, and in Belize City, there is a young girl named Cherily Nicholas.

190
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 She's 13 years old. She's walking to school. She never gets there.

191
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 And the parents start looking for her, and the police start looking for her, and the neighborhood starts looking for her.

192
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 And no one can find Cherily Nicholas.

193
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 October 9th, 1998.

194
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Cherily Nicholas is found in a pool of water off the highway.

195
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 She suffered 40 stab wounds. One of her arms was almost completely severed.

196
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 And before she was killed, she was raped.

197
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 When the police get to this body, they're investigating the scene, trying to process it, both in a mental way.

198
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 How could this even happen, as well as just process the evidence?

199
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 And they come across an alarming discovery.

200
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 Cherily is not wearing the clothes that she wore when she was abducted.

201
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 So they go, they must have kept her alive for a period of time. But how, for how long?

202
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 She's not wearing the same clothes she was wearing when she was abducted.

203
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Must have taken her shopping or had clothes available for her.

204
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 And as they're continuing to process this scene, someone points out, "Sir, sir, the clothes that she's wearing, the clothes that Cherily Nicholas is wearing right now,

205
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 those are the clothes of J Blades."

206
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 The officer goes, "Who, who's J Blades?"

207
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 And the cop says, "J Blades is a nine-year-old girl who went missing two days ago."

208
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 So the cops now believe that Cherily was most likely kept alive from September 8th to just two days ago.

209
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 When whoever this maniac was kidnapped another girl off the street.

210
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 A replacement? Who knows.

211
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 J Blades was missing until around six months later when her skull and a few of her bones were found in the wilderness,

212
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 sitting next to Cherily's backpack.

213
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 March 23rd, 1999, Jackie Fern Malick, 12-year-old girl.

214
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 She's playing at her school playground. She disappears.

215
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Later found dead.

216
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 June 26th, 1999, Erica Willis, 8-year-old girl.

217
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 Missing, murdered, bodies found.

218
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Libby Wary, 15th, 2000, Noemi Hernandez, 14-year-old girl.

219
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Suffers the same fate as the previous four. Five children in total.

220
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Kidnapped, raped, murdered, body dumped in the middle of nowhere.

221
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 This serial killer is known as the Belize Ripper.

222
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Like, they really can't name anything that doesn't have the word "Belize" in it, but he's known as the Belize Ripper.

223
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 AKA Jack the Butcher, because what he was doing to these kids.

224
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 And I'm leaving out some of the most-- I'm trying to make it as least gruesome as possible.

225
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 But he was-- it was bad. What he was doing was awful.

226
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 So the police are hunting for him, but they never caught this guy.

227
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 They never have ever solved this case. It's actually considered the nation of Belize's biggest cold case.

228
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Who was Jack the Butcher?

229
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Look, I had a couple suspects, right? They arrested a couple people, but nothing ever really panned out.

230
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 And so we always have to go down this route with serial killers, because they never seem to stop on their own.

231
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Whenever a serial killer kind of drops out of the hunting grounds, the authorities always go, "Well, he may have moved."

232
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 He may have died, killed himself or got killed in a car accident, or he might be in prison.

233
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Like, those are always-- you could look at the slight possibility of someone like the BTK killer who took a break,

234
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 who didn't do anything for years and years and years of their own volition. It's super rare, though.

235
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 You always got to look at, "It's this, that, and the other thing."

236
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 But to me, that's not even the creepiest part of what we're going to talk about.

237
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 It's a true crime story. I hate to say a standard true crime story, but we do have these.

238
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 We have serial killers running around doing atrocious things to people.

239
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 But that's not the reason why I basically stopped the presses on the other episode I was going to do to tell this dark, dark story.

240
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 At the height of the Belize Ripper slain's, the police started investigating similar crimes.

241
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 They're trying to look at any clue of who this guy could be.

242
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 And on November 6, 1998, near the Old Civic Center--

243
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 Apparently, if you're in the area, maybe you know where that's at, but near the Old Civic Center--

244
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 Samantha Gordon, a 15-year-old girl, goes missing.

245
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 She's found two days later.

246
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Her bruised and bloody body is found floating in the sea.

247
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 She was stabbed to death.

248
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 So the police believe that she might be part of the Jack the Butcher murder spree.

249
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 So they go out there and they check on it, they're investigating it, and he had nothing to do with this murder.

250
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 They ended up arresting four young men and convicted them for this murder.

251
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 Now, was that--was the death of Samantha Gordon a copycat, or was it just--was this woman unfortunately going to be beset upon by these four men, no matter what?

252
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 And they just happened to kill her in a way that was kind of reminiscent.

253
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 It's interesting because when we look at the slain's of Jack the Butcher, his bodies are found way after the children are initially missing.

254
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 But with this Samantha Gordon one, it was only two days.

255
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 So I think that probably keyed the officers off that this might not be related, and it wasn't related.

256
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 February 15th, 1999, in Corosal Town, and this is another part of the country of beliefs,

257
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Becky Gilhary, 13-year-old girl, goes missing.

258
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 She is found dead.

259
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 She was strangled.

260
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Is this him?

261
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 Is this him changing his MO back in February 15th, 1999?

262
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 The police officers investigate this.

263
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Family friend of the Gilharies, family friend of Becky's family, Robert Hill, 22-year-old man, murdered her.

264
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Took this 13-year-old girl and strangled her, friend of the family.

265
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 So now you're starting to think, is this some sort of copycat thing?

266
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 Like the first four guys, we don't have much information on them.

267
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 They could have been hooligans.

268
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 I'm not excusing it, but there are unfortunately different stages of murder, right?

269
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 There's a bunch of money to the mob type of murder, and then there's abducted from your playground murder.

270
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 And that's just, it's an unfortunate striation of the way you have victims.

271
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 I don't know what the first girl's thing was.

272
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 She could have burned them on a bad drug deal.

273
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 I don't know.

274
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 She could have just been a random...

275
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 If she was a random choice, I would think they were trying to do a copycat murder, is what I'm saying.

276
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 But with, we have this, I don't think Becky Gil-Harry owed money to the mob.

277
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 13-year-old girl goes missing, and we know she didn't, because we know more information about this murderer.

278
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 Robert Hill, family friend, 22-years-old, what was it, a copycat?

279
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 June 1999, in the town of Orange Walk, Karen Cruz.

280
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 If I chase him please, just let this episode stop, bro.

281
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 You've been naming off these, I know, I know, trust me, this is the last one, we're gonna wrap it up here.

282
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 And this is the doozy for me, this is the one that, phew.

283
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 Karen Cruz, a 10-year-old girl, goes missing.

284
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 She is raped and murdered, and left out in a field.

285
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 And again, the police are still investigating this, as has Jack the Butcher struck again?

286
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 It was her uncle, her uncle who lived next door to her.

287
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 He was obsessed with this 10-year-old niece.

288
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 The neighbors, that's what they said, they go, "Yeah, dude, he was super creepy with her, he's always watching her."

289
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 His name was Antonio Beza, he's 38-years-old, tried and convicted for the murder of his niece.

290
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 This is so terrifying to me.

291
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 I can wrap my head around a serial killer, I can wrap my head around someone being so broken,

292
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 that they can't function in normal human society, so they figure that it is not them that is the little one,

293
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 it is not them that is the child among giants, it's, they're the giant, and the rest of the world are children,

294
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 and man was meant to be hunted, and if only we could coal the weak and let the rain wash down on the centers,

295
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 all of that stupid delusional nonsense that basically they never grew out of their 12-year-old edgy phase,

296
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 that's a serial killer, and I can wrap my head around a serial killer, I can wrap my head around lunatics,

297
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 I can wrap my head around people snapping as much as I hate it as much as that's the scariest story for me, someone snapping,

298
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 but what I find so weird and so creepy about this is there's a couple different ways we could look at this.

299
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Antonio Beza, 38-year-old man living next door to his niece, Karen Cruz, 10-year-old girl.

300
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 It's possible that this dude was always a sicko, it's possible that from day one this dude was a sicko,

301
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 and he might have moved next to the house so he could be close to Karen, and he'd been stalking her for the longest time,

302
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 and then he couldn't handle it anymore, he went after her, took her life.

303
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 And I can wrap my head around that, not saying it's good, but I've seen evil like that in the world,

304
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 so if I just saw that as a headline I'd be like, "That's a tragedy, but it wouldn't shock me."

305
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Right, that's unfortunate, it doesn't shock us anymore.

306
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 Then let's look at a paranormal answer, that what happens when you have evil come to town?

307
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 What happens when you have raw, unfiltered, malignant darkness show up at a location?

308
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 When you shine a light, the light spreads, you have the flashlight, it makes the perfect circle,

309
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 but the light is more than that, the light branches off everywhere, and you can see, it doesn't just light up what you're looking at,

310
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 it kind of lights up everything around you, you know you're aiming the light right here.

311
00:24:50,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 Do we see the same thing with evil? It could be encased in a single man, it could be this possession, this darkness encased in this human being.

312
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 If he went to a Jamba Juice, and he's not actively murdering anyone right now, would other people feel that?

313
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Would that evil kind of infest off of him? Is that a word?

314
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Would the evil just kind of crawl off of him, ooze off of him, almost like a Venom symbiote type of thing?

315
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 Leaving little patches of it, leaving little, we've actually talked about it, I don't even remember the episode about it,

316
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 but we talked about it on a past episode about, can you leave emotional or psychic or magical landmines?

317
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 Damn it, what episode was that? That was a good one, hopefully one of you guys remember that one,

318
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 but I can't put it on the show, I have no idea what it was, but we create this stuff by being so evil, so is it possible?

319
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 Because we have at least three other victims that Jack the Butcher never saw, but I'm making the...

320
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 But I'm making the claim that he is responsible for their deaths, because I think they probably were copycats,

321
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 even the first one, it may not have been, but I'm thinking these were copycats, right?

322
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 And it wasn't because this man was walking around the leaves, murdering and butchering these children,

323
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 and it was just letting off so much psychic energy, it was infesting other people.

324
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 These dudes would have never done this, never ever thought about doing any of this stuff.

325
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 Antonio Beyes was totally innocent, never had any creepy dark thoughts until he became infested with this stuff.

326
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 But that's not even the creepiest... When I was reading this, and I was thinking of the paranormal,

327
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 now you guys see how I read articles, my mind's just kind of going off in all sorts of ways,

328
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 but even when I was thinking of this paranormal answer, I go, "That's not even the creepiest answer,"

329
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 because even though I hate the stories about people just snapping and then like losing it,

330
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 that's not even the creepiest version, stepping on some sort of psychic landmine, yeah, it's disturbing,

331
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 but the creepiest version to me is most likely the truest one.

332
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 What I honestly think was going through Antonio Beyes's head was this.

333
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 He was obsessed with that little girl. He was obsessed with his 10-year-old niece.

334
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 He was a creep, he was a pervert, he was a weirdo, like I said in the first example,

335
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 but instead of just not being able to contain that anymore, not being able to contain this madness anymore,

336
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 he lashed on this girl, he was methodical about it.

337
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 He knew for years he was going to violate and murder his niece.

338
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 He fantasized about it, he wanted it, but he couldn't have it.

339
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 It was just so close yet so far away.

340
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 It's just so creepy that this guy with the niece, this guy was living next door as this uncle,

341
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 I'm sure he seemed to be the friendliest guy.

342
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 I'm sure even neighbors might have told Karen's parents, "Hey, that uncle's kind of creepy,"

343
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 and generally they'll just be like, "Yeah, Uncle Antonio, he's kind of a weirdo, ha ha ha."

344
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 And the neighbors are like, "No, you don't understand, this guy's like totally like pervin' on your kid."

345
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 A lot of times families will kind of brush that stuff off, always to their detriment.

346
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 But imagine that, imagine living next to someone, imagine having this guy in your family who's sitting there at the dinner table,

347
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 seeming to be the funnest guy in the world, hanging out, volunteering a babysit,

348
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 and he wants to do the unspeakable to your child, and the only thing that's stopping him is he thinks he will get caught.

349
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 So he lets those images and fantasies and feelings simmer inside of him,

350
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 until one day a string of murders is publicized all over.

351
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 The news, the television, newspaper, he's watching these programs and he's reading the paper and he thinks,

352
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 "Now is the time."

353
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Absolutely terrifying, a string of serial killings happening in this city,

354
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 and six more other people who have nothing to do with those crimes are arrested for murder, similar murders.

355
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 Time bombs, time bombs in human society just waiting to go off,

356
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 just looking for a moment that they believe they can kill someone and get away with it.

357
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 So as the holidays begin, and you gather with your family, you travel, maybe across the city, maybe across the country,

358
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 to go see your loved ones, just remember,

359
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 behind every firm handshake, behind every smiling face,

360
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 you may be standing next to a monster,

361
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 a monster who hides themselves so well you can never imagine the dark images that crawl within their mind.

362
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 And hopefully you'll never get to know that,

363
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 hopefully you'll never have to see into their mind or see the actions they lay upon the earth.

364
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 But whether it's a serial killer who has perfected their craft,

365
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 or just a pervert uncle sitting on the porch staring at his niece as she plays with her friends,

366
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 you never really know who you're standing next to.

367
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 You never really know who you call a friend.
