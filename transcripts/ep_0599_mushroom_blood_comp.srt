1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
 What happens when the world of true crime and perverts collide?

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,500
 It makes a big mess.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:13,500
 And then...

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,500
 And then we take a look at the story of a man who loved drugs so much,

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,000
 he turned himself into one, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,500
 I don't know what to say, actually I'm a lot bigger.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 *Music*

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,500
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,500
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,500
 Hope you guys are having a great day too, hope you guys had a great weekend.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,500
 It's actually still Thursday for me here.

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,500
 I'm recording some episodes up, so I can take a little vacation this weekend.

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,500
 I'm just gonna read, just gonna spend the whole weekend reading and getting stuff ready for future episodes of Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,500
 And we couldn't have future episodes of Dead Rabbit Radio without people who support the show.

15
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,000
 And speaking of supporters right now, there's a little red dot on my chest.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,500
 It's moving around, give a round of applause for the man who's about to shoot me, it's Sniper.

17
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,500
 Sniper is our newest Patreon supporter.

18
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,500
 Sniper, go ahead, you don't have to shoot me, you don't have to shoot me.

19
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,500
 Come on down from your perch, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,000
 You guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,500
 Another great way to help support the show is to spread the word.

22
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:26,500
 Let your friends, family and co-workers know about the show that also really ensures the future of the show.

23
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,500
 So Sniper, go ahead and take off your night vision goggles, 'cause we're gonna do some day driving.

24
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,000
 I'm gonna toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy and we are going to head on out, too.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 New Orleans in Louisiana, eeeww, car is driving down the road.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,500
 You know, every show often I get the criticism about the show.

27
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:50,500
 The people go, "The show used to be better, the show used to be better back the first 50 episodes or better or whatever."

28
00:01:50,500 --> 00:02:00,500
 And that's fine, I can take criticism, but I don't understand, I think there's a kind of a difference between what the show is and how some people view it.

29
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,500
 It's like a news show.

30
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:08,500
 I report the stories that are presented to me, either that I find or people recommend.

31
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:14,500
 And whenever I hear that criticism or that it's not really a criticism, it's just that that's their opinion.

32
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:21,500
 To me it's the same thing as if you walked up to a journalist and said, "Hey man, I really like the news better back on September 11th.

33
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,500
 It was super exciting. I was glued to my television for like two weeks. September 11th, 2001.

34
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,500
 How come you don't do news like that anymore?"

35
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:35,500
 The journalist would go, "Well, because thankfully it doesn't happen that much or at all, nothing that big."

36
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,500
 So it's the same thing. The show is the stories that are presented to me.

37
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:45,500
 So yeah, sure, I had like ageless travel back then, the ocean at night, I had some classic episodes.

38
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:55,500
 But I don't do ARGs. I really don't, I'll touch on creepypastas every once in a while, but I do the stories that I find and I generally do them while I find them.

39
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,500
 Again, it's a valid opinion, but I just think there's a disconnect between what the show is.

40
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:08,500
 And I think people do kind of confuse it sometimes with shows that cover ARGs or like these long myth building episodes and things like that.

41
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:23,500
 That being said, that all being said, Sniper, go ahead and pull outside of this house in New Orleans, Louisiana. The year is 2019.

42
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,500
 And there's a young babysitter walking into a house.

43
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:34,500
 Now, apparently there's a thing called a babysitter app where you can pull, it sounds like something a serial killer would design, right?

44
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:40,500
 It's like Grubhub, but for serial killers, you can order babysitters to come to your house. That's terrifying.

45
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:46,500
 Why would anyone create this app or use this app? But apparently there are babysitter apps where you can order babysitters.

46
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,500
 They're so, so spooky.

47
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:55,500
 There's this guy. His name is Rutledge Diaz IV. He's 29 years old and he has a younger brother named Corey.

48
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,500
 He's a 17 year old younger brother who unfortunately severely disabled.

49
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:08,500
 He can't bathe himself. He has to wear a diaper. He can't really go anywhere. He's just this disabled dude who's like mentally disabled and physically disabled.

50
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:15,500
 And Rutledge can't really take care of him, so he calls up his Grubhub for babysitters and orders a babysitter.

51
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,500
 I can't even say without laughing. It sounds like something Dracula would use.

52
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:27,500
 Rutledge, though, is not Dracula. He has this babysitter come to take care of his younger brother Corey, because he has to, you know, make money.

53
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,500
 Babysitters aren't free. So using this app, Corey is actually able to get the help that he needs.

54
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:40,500
 So, I mean, he's 17 years old. He's almost an adult, physically, so you have to carry him around. He's pretty heavy.

55
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,500
 I'm complaining about it. That's why I'm not a babysitter. I'm like, "Aw, it sucks. You're too heavy. Loose some weight."

56
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:52,500
 You have to carry him around. They have this giant car seat for him to go in and pick him up, put him in the car seat, drive around town.

57
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,500
 Maybe he just likes to, like, look out the window. It doesn't say. They just say that he has a giant car seat.

58
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,500
 I don't know why that details in this story, but I just find it amusing.

59
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,500
 And he wears diapers all the time. Now, he's constantly pooping his diapers, and he can't get mad at them, right?

60
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,500
 He doesn't know any better. Babies, like, has the mind of a baby. Babies don't know better. He's constantly pooping his diaper.

61
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,500
 But there's a lot of babysitters that use this app. There's a lot of babysitters that take care of Cory.

62
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:22,500
 Kind of gets known in town that Cory can be a little difficult, but overall, he's probably a good guy.

63
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,500
 November 13th, 2019.

64
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,500
 Police! We have a warrant!

65
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,500
 They kicked down his door. Rutledge Diaz is like, "What's going on? What's going on?"

66
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,500
 Cops come storming. I don't know if it was that dramatic. He just knocked and he opened the door.

67
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:44,500
 But in my version, psssh, breaking through windows and knocking over piles of diapers and making a little barricade.

68
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,500
 Rutledge is hiding behind a giant car seat. What do you officers want?

69
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:59,500
 There is no Cory, apparently. It doesn't exist. It's not like Joker's fake girlfriend, like all the babysitters, just hallucinated this giant baby.

70
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,500
 Plot twist. Rutledge is Cory.

71
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,500
 Rutledge, allegedly, is a big old pervert.

72
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,500
 Definitely, there's a heart allegedly on that one.

73
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,500
 Rutledge allegedly came up with this plan.

74
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,500
 I really, really like pooping my pants.

75
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,500
 And I bought this giant car seat and I don't know what to use it for.

76
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:28,500
 If only there was a way I could combine my love of pooping and being cleaned with this app that I discovered.

77
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,500
 That I could order women to come into my house.

78
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:40,500
 Aha, I have it. So he begins, he's coming up with an idea, he's pooping his pants, he's like, "Aha, an idea has come to me instead of a light bulb, it's just a big brown load in his pants."

79
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,500
 He loves, again, this is all a legend. This last song will say it, but he loves pooping his pants.

80
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,500
 You definitely have to say allegedly before that. And he loves women cleaning it up.

81
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:56,500
 So he actually thought this would be a great idea to combine the two, like Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.

82
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
 But you don't want to know where the chocolate's coming from.

83
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:07,500
 Babysitters are constantly, this goes on for a while, but eventually one of them, she visited the house 10 times and she thought this doesn't, this seems a little suspicious.

84
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,500
 I went over to his house, I realized he was really good at Super Smash Brothers.

85
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,500
 But then like he's like, "Gah, gah, goo goo?" and he's pooping his pants.

86
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:21,500
 Like I thought it was bizarre that he was able to make a martini, but I don't know, maybe that's the one thing this baby can do.

87
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,500
 So the cops do arrest him and apparently in Louisiana, I did not know this.

88
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:37,500
 Good to know if you live in Louisiana and you're thinking about being a criminal, if you commit labor fraud in Louisiana, basically if you hire someone under false pretenses, that's human trafficking.

89
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:47,500
 That's a 10 year charge. If you tell someone, "Hey, why don't you come over, I'll pay you to like wash my car," and they get over there and you're like, "Oh no, I want you to paint my fence instead, Tom Sawyer."

90
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,500
 That would basically be human trafficking.

91
00:07:50,500 --> 00:08:00,500
 He was facing 40 years in prison for this scheme. He was basically charged with sexual battery because while he was pooping his pants, the women were cleaning him and he was getting gratification from that.

92
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,500
 So that's where those charges came from.

93
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:08,500
 He got charged with four counts of human trafficking and one count of possession of a controlled dangerous substance.

94
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,500
 I'll give you one guess as to what drug he was on.

95
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:17,500
 So if you ever go over to a house and there's a giant baby smoking meth, could be this guy.

96
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,500
 Actually, I just realized I don't have to say allegedly, he actually got sentenced on this.

97
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
 Five years probation.

98
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,500
 We do have another story, another similar story in Phoenix, Arizona.

99
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,500
 I'm not going to go into too much detail about it because it's pretty much the exact same story.

100
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,500
 But I did think it was weird. This guy also used the babysitter app.

101
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,500
 I think that's going to be a huge issue forward.

102
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:44,500
 If I just learned out that you could order a babysitter to your house and if I know about it, then there's a whole bunch of lunatics.

103
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,500
 There's a whole bunch of weirdos who happened to be reading the news that day.

104
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:52,500
 They found out about this as well. But this guy was using the same thing. His name is Paul Anthony Machaka.

105
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:58,500
 A 30-year-old man, he told people he had Down syndrome and pretended to be his mom through the babysitter app.

106
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,500
 He was hiring babysitters and the mom, quote-unquote, the mom was saying,

107
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:09,500
 "My son, he's such a good boy, but when he poops his pants, you better punish him and give him a nice long bath."

108
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
 Babysitters are like, "What?"

109
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,500
 But hey, you know, it's whatever. It's $18 an hour.

110
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,500
 And it was this weird scheme. His parents did not know he was doing this. He was living at home.

111
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:24,500
 The mom, the fake mom, would say, "My son's going to be at some random location in Phoenix, Arizona."

112
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,500
 It's like, "Where's Waldo?" But involving a pervert.

113
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,500
 "My son's going to be at some random location in Phoenix, Arizona."

114
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,500
 "We'll tell you where he's at. You don't actually have to go searching for him. There's like a time where he's in the world."

115
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,500
 "This is Carmen San Diego."

116
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,500
 "You find him at this random location."

117
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,500
 "You don't find him. We tell you where he's at."

118
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,500
 He's basically say, "Pick me up at the mall. Take him to a neutral location."

119
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,500
 Doesn't say for sure, but I'm assuming like a hotel room or something like that.

120
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,500
 And if you pooped his pants, you punish him. You put him in the corner, but...

121
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:56,500
 And then give him a nice long bath. And then you drop him off at another random location.

122
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,500
 They're using random not-a-cut-a-find-this-guy. They're just imagining a pervert.

123
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
 And it's all, "Bing!"

124
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,500
 He does this for months. He does this for like... He gets away with this for like 10 months.

125
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,500
 And three different babysitters are washing him. And a lot of times when they're washing the bathtub,

126
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,500
 he's like, "More, more washy wash! More washy wash!"

127
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,500
 And he would get like, "I don't know if he made baby voices."

128
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:22,500
 But he was getting really mad and they had to vigorously wash his genitals.

129
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,500
 And one of the babysitters finally goes, "Listen, this is super suspicious."

130
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,500
 "I got me a lot of money doing this, but now I'm suspicious."

131
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,500
 And so she followed him home. She followed another babysitter dropping him off.

132
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,500
 She followed him home like straight up Nancy drewed this dude.

133
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,500
 And when he walked into his house, she went up and knocked on the door and was like,

134
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,500
 "Hey, I'm your son's babysitter. I just want to be clear. Your son does have Down syndrome, right?"

135
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,500
 And you want us to punish him when he poops his pants.

136
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,500
 And the mom, the mom answers the door is like,

137
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,500
 "Hey, Paul! Paul, I think we have something to talk about."

138
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,500
 This woman's telling me that you're a bad, bad boy when you poop your pants.

139
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,500
 He has not been sentenced yet. So allegedly, all that stuff was alleged.

140
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,500
 He got arrested on 2018 and hasn't been charged yet.

141
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,500
 So I don't know if he's putting it off, because you know, a lot of times when you get arrested,

142
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,500
 you have the chance to drag the trial out as long as possible.

143
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,500
 You have the right to a speedy trial, but if you have a lawyer and you have money,

144
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,500
 you can make it last as long. Like, you can keep doing delays.

145
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,500
 And if you're free on bail, why rush it? Why rush the trial?

146
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,500
 So you just keep delaying it over and over again if you have the money for it.

147
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,500
 So that could be what he's doing. It's all alleged.

148
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,500
 Maybe he is a good boy and not a bad boy. I don't know.

149
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,500
 I don't want to determine that, because I might give him a boner either way, allegedly.

150
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,500
 But that is that story. Kind of piggybacked on the other one.

151
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,500
 A bunch of perverts running around in diapers.

152
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:50,500
 Now, it's time to end pervert land. There's not a button to do that, you idiot.

153
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,500
 Tumblr disappears.

154
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,500
 Sniper, I want you to get us out of pervertville.

155
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,500
 Call in that carpenter copter.

156
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,500
 [imitates carpenters]

157
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,500
 We're all jumping on board. Got the machine gun's man in case a bunch of babies--

158
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,500
 human babies are chasing us. [imitates carpenters]

159
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,500
 World War Z. They're like pooping. They're making a giant poop mountain towards us.

160
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:16,500
 Sniper, go ahead and take us out of here. We are headed out to Nebraska.

161
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,500
 [imitates carpenters]

162
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:23,500
 This story was sent to me by Mason, a long-time listener of the show, long-time supporter of the show.

163
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:30,500
 And I don't know if even he understood the gravity of this story.

164
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,500
 Really, really appreciate it. He sent me a lot of good stuff. Really big supporter of the show.

165
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,500
 But I don't know if even he understands the gravity of the story, because I didn't get it

166
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,500
 until maybe 10 minutes before recording this podcast. Check this out.

167
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:49,500
 All the information I got from this is from a website called IFLCcience.com.

168
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:56,500
 It's an article written by James Felton, and it's based on a medical report that was recently written by a bunch of doctors.

169
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:02,500
 So in Nebraska, there is a man--we don't have his name because this was written in a medical journal--

170
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:08,500
 we're going to call him Alexander. He's 30 years old, and he has had some difficulties with his life.

171
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:16,500
 He's an opioid addict. He's suffering from major depression, and he has decided to stop taking his bipolar medication.

172
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,500
 His family obviously is not happy with that. They want to support him.

173
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,500
 But they're starting to notice he's having these wild mood swings around the house.

174
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:31,500
 Dealing with all of that stuff isn't fun, and then not taking your medications, really just compounding it.

175
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:38,500
 But he's decided, like many people who suffer from mental illness, he's decided to self-medicate.

176
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:44,500
 He doesn't want the pharmaceutical medications. No, he's going to self-medicate using recreational stuff.

177
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:51,500
 He decides to try magic mushroom tea, and that's where you take one of those special magic mushrooms, the cyclobin, blah, blah, blah,

178
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:59,500
 Latin stuff, mushrooms, and you pour hot water over it, and it makes a psychoactive tea, a magic mushroom tea.

179
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:06,500
 So he's like, has his legs crossed, has a little Mr. Miyagi moment, he's pouring Mr. Miyagi super-driven out, he's catching flies that don't exist.

180
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:13,500
 He's pouring the little teapot over the magic mushrooms, and he's brewing this tea, and he's like, "Hmm, yes."

181
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:22,500
 Now, recently they just passed a law on organ, allowing veteran groups to be able to use magic mushrooms for depression therapy.

182
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,500
 There's actually a lot of studies. I'm not a huge fan of hallucinogenics. I don't use them.

183
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:32,500
 I have a lot of friends who do, and I don't judge them for doing it, but I'm not a hallucinogenic fan myself.

184
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:41,500
 But they passed a law saying, "We can use this for therapy." There are a lot of studies showing that it works for depression and drug abuse, drug addiction.

185
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:46,500
 So it would make sense that he was suffering from depression, he's suffering from an opioid addiction.

186
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,500
 He thinks, "Maybe I can help alleviate that by drinking this magic mushroom tea."

187
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:59,500
 Specifically, he was looking at the idea of micro-dosing, where you take tiny, tiny, like super-tiny amounts of it over time so you don't get the full effect.

188
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,500
 Microdosing, the science is still out on that.

189
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:09,500
 But someone who already has a drug addiction, it's probably not the best path to go on, because you start off micro-dosing,

190
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:14,500
 eventually you're mega-dosing because you're a drug addict, you're just changing your drug of choice.

191
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:19,500
 But maybe magic mushrooms will end all of that, right? That's the idea, they'll have an awakening.

192
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,500
 So he bruises magic mushroom tea.

193
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,500
 Now that might have worked if he had gone about the standard plan.

194
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:33,500
 Like an organ, you can do the magic mushrooms, but it has to be in a controlled environment, it has to be given out by a certified doctor or something like that.

195
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:38,500
 He takes this tea, he smells that the steam's coming off the tea.

196
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:45,500
 This tea is psychoactive at this point, and he goes to take a drink and he goes, "No, no, that's where the norm is."

197
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:51,500
 He puts the tea cup down, he gets a little cotton ball, he pulls out a syringe.

198
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:58,500
 He puts the syringe in the tea and filters out the impurities through the cotton ball.

199
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,500
 "Eeeehhh."

200
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
 Syringes make that noise, don't you know?

201
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:07,500
 He injects himself with the magic mushroom tea.

202
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,500
 It begins to flow through his veins.

203
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
 [Gasps]

204
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,500
 A couple days later, his family finds him.

205
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,500
 He's laying on the floor.

206
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:22,500
 [Groans]

207
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,500
 I have in my notes extreme confusion, that was the best way I could say extreme confusion.

208
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,500
 He was lit, he was gone.

209
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,500
 He was so high days later and he can't talk, he's just kind of flopping around.

210
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:41,500
 Obviously the family's immediately alarmed by that, but he's also yellow.

211
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
 He's turned yellow.

212
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,500
 The area's full of diarrhea.

213
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:51,500
 Those two guys from the first story, they're like taking notes, they're like, "What was his recipe?"

214
00:16:51,500 --> 00:17:02,500
 He was yellow, he was pooping everywhere, and as the family comes in, he can't talk, he's extremely confused, he looks at them, and he begins to vomit blood.

215
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,500
 This isn't creepypasta, this isn't a medical journal.

216
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,500
 They obviously call 911, he's taken to the hospital.

217
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:18,500
 His organs are failing, his lungs are failing, he has septic shot extreme liver damage, which is what gave him jaundice.

218
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:23,500
 Also one of the symptoms they noted was nausea, that's the least of your problems.

219
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:30,500
 When you're having diarrhea and throwing up blood at the same time, do they really need to put down his tummy hurt?

220
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:39,500
 We know he has nausea, his organs are failing, and on top of all of that, the doctors realized this dude is tripping balls.

221
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,500
 This dude is out of it.

222
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,500
 Now they can obviously figure out that he injected this tea.

223
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:50,500
 I don't think he injected the tea and was like, "Oh, now I'm going to watch a couple episodes of The Simpsons."

224
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:55,500
 And then maybe I'll start going to conspiracy websites, like I like that he got lit right away.

225
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,500
 So they would have found the syringe, they would have found the tea, the mushrooms, all of that stuff.

226
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,500
 But he's in the ICU at this point, he's totally messed up.

227
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:09,500
 The doctors are trying to figure out how to save him, how to reverse all this stuff.

228
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:14,500
 And they start to notice clots in his blood, and they're like, "Right, who knows what is going on now?

229
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,500
 Like he's done all this damage, knows what's going on."

230
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,500
 So they start taking blood samples and they start looking at it through the microscope.

231
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:26,500
 They notice this is so insane.

232
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:32,500
 In his blood, he is growing mushrooms.

233
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:40,500
 When he was making the tea, when he was putting the boiling water over the mushroom, it was releasing spores into the tea.

234
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:48,500
 And he injected the spores into his veins and they could tell that the fungus was growing in his bloodstream.

235
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,500
 And they think that is why he was still high.

236
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,500
 He turned himself into a magic mushroom.

237
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:14,500
 It is unclear, because they don't know for sure, but they wrote in this report, it is unclear whether active, intravascular infection with a psychoactive fungus may prompt persistent psychoactive effects as seen with ingestion of the same species.

238
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,500
 Unquote.

239
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,500
 So it's in him, and it's not going away.

240
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,500
 The fungus is growing in his bloodstream and keeping him high.

241
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:31,500
 Until you're able to kill the fungus in there, you're going to be tripping balls.

242
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,500
 He turned himself into a magic mushroom, full of spores.

243
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,500
 He was in the ICU for eight days. They released him from the ICU.

244
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,500
 He was in the hospital for another 22 days, and now he's still being treated.

245
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,500
 He's out of the hospital, he's doing fine, he didn't pass away, but now he's still being treated.

246
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,500
 He basically took the ultimate trip and became a drug.

247
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,500
 Now, the first question you asked yourself, this is a question I wrote in my notes.

248
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,500
 Could you get high off this guy?

249
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,500
 Basically, right?

250
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:07,500
 If he was still in a vegetative state and the doctor's like, "Oh dude, I have a party guy, I have a party going up, and I didn't bring any snacks. I know what I'll do. I'll bring the drugs."

251
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:14,500
 And he's pulling blood out of this dude. Could you smoke his blood? Could you dry it? Could you drink it? Could you inject?

252
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
 Don't inject it yourself, there's just more spores.

253
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,500
 But could you get high off this dude's blood?

254
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,500
 If you gave him a kiss, if you gave him a big old wet, slavvy kiss, would you get high off this saliva?

255
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:30,500
 Could you... Because he basically is full of magic mushroom spores.

256
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,500
 Now, he would eventually die if he didn't cure him, but before he died, or like right before you're like,

257
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,500
 "No, don't do the cure yet, don't do the cure yet."

258
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,500
 Ah, yes. Get high off your own supply.

259
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,500
 But then as I was getting ready to record this episode, I remembered something.

260
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,500
 Maybe about a hundred episodes. I'll put it in the show notes.

261
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:52,500
 A hundred and a hundred fifty episodes ago. You guys will know where I'm headed with this now. I'm sure Mason's like, "Oh yeah."

262
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:58,500
 I covered a story called "Skin." It was on the Arrowid database. It was this woman who was writing it.

263
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
 It was great. I love that episode.

264
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:06,500
 Check it out. It'll be in the show notes. It's a story of a young couple who decides to start to experiment with meth,

265
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:14,500
 and she believes that their drug dealer's trying to turn them into drugs, because the effects are so bad.

266
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:21,500
 She could squeeze her stomach and Crisco, like oily clumps of Crisco, would pour out of her skin.

267
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:29,500
 Half the story is just her sitting in the sauna, and black ooze is coming out of every part of her body.

268
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:35,500
 And she believed that if you scraped off the Crisco, the darkened Crisco grease,

269
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:40,500
 sorry if you're baking right now, you're like, "Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. Can't wait for these cookies to get done."

270
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:46,500
 As you're scraping off the grease, her psychotic belief was that you could smoke it. You could get high off that.

271
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,500
 She was thinking that this drug dealer was actually trying to turn her into this drug.

272
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:55,500
 She was going to get trapped in a basement or something like that and just be used to get other people high.

273
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:02,500
 And it's funny, because I reported that story, and everyone was just kind of creeped and grossed out by it.

274
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:08,500
 But it seems so fantastical, a woman in the midst of a meth psychosis, and then we have this.

275
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:14,500
 It's possible to turn a human being into drugs.

276
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,500
 I wonder if she was right.

277
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:29,500
 I wonder if there are people out there that are doing this on purpose to other people.

278
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:36,500
 Because you can talk about Adrenochrome all day long. This is a hundred times worse.

279
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,500
 A hallucinogen that is cultured in a human body.

280
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:50,500
 That would have to be incredibly potent. And even if it wasn't more potent than normal magic mushrooms,

281
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:58,500
 just the idea that it came from a human body in your mind would make it more valuable.

282
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:05,500
 If you were a drug dude, you're like, "Hey, dude, you're like chasing a smoke weed all the time.

283
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:12,500
 I don't want my weed to come out of some dude, but you know what I mean? Let's say you're some high-level, rich celebrity person."

284
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,500
 And someone's like, "Hey, man, have you ever tried Jerry?" People are like, "No, what's Jerry?"

285
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,500
 And they're like, "Jerry, it's this new drug that we actually make in human bodies."

286
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:27,500
 You hold up a little red vial and be like, "Dude, it's going to get you lit. Don't inject it. Don't inject it."

287
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:33,500
 Or you might become the next Jerry. But you smoke this, you snort this, you drink this, you're going to get high.

288
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:38,500
 It's the best trip you've ever had. Try a little bit of Jerry.

289
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:43,500
 This story is real. This story has scientific proof behind it. This story actually happened.

290
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:53,500
 And the story of skin just seemed, it seemed like it could have been a fake story, or it could have seemed like it was a woman's psychotic delusion.

291
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:58,500
 But it may turn out that this, that her story may have actually been real. She may have dodged a bullet.

292
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:04,500
 She may have honestly been experimented on to be turned into a drug.

293
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:13,500
 This guy's attempt to leave his own depression may have opened a window to a world of drugs that most people don't even know exist.

294
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,500
 Drugs cultured and manufactured inside the human body.

295
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:22,500
 Everyone thinks it's a new crazy chemical from some lab in Germany.

296
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:33,500
 But it's actually the blood of a young woman who went missing, a young man whose family never stopped searching for him, a child who got lost, and nobody knows what happened to them.

297
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:43,500
 The designer drugs of the future may be made from the men and women who have gone missing in the past.

298
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:48,500
 So, warning to all you psychonauts out there looking for the next designer drug.

299
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:53,500
 You spent years trying to find the next big high.

300
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:58,500
 It turns out the next big high was in you all along.

301
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:03,500
