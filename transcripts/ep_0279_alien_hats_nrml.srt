1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
 Does whistling at night attract ghosts?

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:10,240
 And then we head to the workshop of Michael Minkin, a man who has finally perfected the

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,920
 tinfoil hat.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,000
 If you're being abducted by aliens, he has your cure.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,600
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:28,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,240
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,360
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,960
 You know what's funny?

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,880
 Because I constantly am checking the stats for the show.

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,440
 I view it as if I own a small business, you're constantly wanting to know how much money's

12
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,440
 in the register.

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,240
 I check the stats of this show multiple times a day and I have different ways to do it.

14
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,040
 I look at the iTunes charts, we're doing pretty good on there.

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:55,360
 I look at YouTube stats, I look at the websites provider stats.

16
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,680
 One interesting thing that I've noticed is that I get a lot of hits in Nigeria.

17
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,880
 And it's funny because they're probably the 14th country.

18
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,280
 I have a lot of stats for this show, this ranking list.

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,640
 And they're listed 14th out of the world.

20
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,560
 We get a lot of downloads from Nigeria.

21
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,760
 And it's funny because I thought, is there a server farm there?

22
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,480
 Why am I getting so many hits from Nigeria?

23
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:24,280
 But because obviously I underestimate this show.

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,320
 A young kid from Nigeria asked me to be his Facebook friend.

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,280
 And he's not a prince.

26
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,280
 Just cutting to the chase.

27
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,880
 Actually did look at his Facebook profile and was like, oh, this is a legit kid.

28
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,240
 And I'm assuming the two things are related.

29
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:43,840
 I'm assuming that the Facebook and the Nigerian listens to the show are related.

30
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,840
 But maybe they're not.

31
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,560
 Maybe he's just some random kid who walked in and he's like, hey, I wonder who's living

32
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,800
 in the river.

33
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,080
 But AO, AO from Nigeria.

34
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,000
 I have some stories for you and stories to share with the rest of you.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,960
 You can listen to the episode if you're not AO.

36
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,520
 And I actually had prepped this before when I saw all the Nigerian downloads.

37
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,920
 And I was like, I sat on it for a while.

38
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,720
 But then I was like, hey, today's a good day to do this.

39
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,920
 Now we're going to look at some Nigerian myths.

40
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,360
 I don't think I've come across anything like these.

41
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,160
 I don't think I've come across in my journeys through the paranormal.

42
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,520
 Something quite so mundane/bizarre.

43
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,720
 Like it's just both.

44
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,480
 So first off, let's go walking through Nigeria.

45
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,760
 I have no idea what the geography is like at all.

46
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:36,200
 But we're going to be walking down the part of the planet known as Nigeria.

47
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,360
 And like you always do, you want to whistle.

48
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,360
 But we're not just whistling walking through Nigeria.

49
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,640
 We're whistling at night.

50
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,560
 We got our flashlights in front of us and we start whistling.

51
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,560
 I can't whistle.

52
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,000
 I can suck in.

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 No jokes.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,120
 I can do this.

55
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,120
 Like that.

56
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,600
 But I can't go.

57
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,160
 I guess I can kind of blow out.

58
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,320
 But mostly I actually, I remember one summer I kept going all summer long.

59
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,640
 It was just some weird habit I got.

60
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,960
 And my grandma's like, I was staying with my great-grandma at the time.

61
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,440
 She's like, you better stop doing that.

62
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,440
 It's going to be a habit.

63
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,440
 I think it was along to the third grade.

64
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,440
 I'm like, no, what are you talking about?

65
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,040
 And I'd just be watching television and I'd go, whew.

66
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,880
 And then I remember like the first week of school I'd be sitting in class and I'd go,

67
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,880
 whew.

68
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,880
 I'd be like, oh no, my great-grandma was right.

69
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,360
 Who would have thought that a 70-year-old woman would know anything?

70
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,960
 I have to break myself of that habit real fast.

71
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,600
 I look like a total weirdo sitting in class going, whew.

72
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,600
 Anyways, we're walking through Nigeria and we are whistling.

73
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,760
 And that's when we hear someone from the bushes whistling back.

74
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,080
 We're like, what?

75
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,760
 Where's that coming from?

76
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,640
 And you're like, I think it's coming from the bushes.

77
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,000
 Now when you hear the whistling from the bush, the funny thing about this myth is it's none

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,040
 of the stuff I would ever do in real life.

79
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,040
 One, I don't whistle.

80
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,040
 I've made that apparent.

81
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,040
 I can't.

82
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,440
 This might have worked in the third grade.

83
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,080
 I don't feel compelled to whistle in the first place.

84
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,880
 I definitely don't like drawing attention to myself at night so I wouldn't whistle in

85
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,000
 the darkness.

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,360
 And the other component of this myth, or this legend, is that when you hear whistling from

87
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,560
 the bushes, you go and you investigate.

88
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,960
 I would not do that either if I'm walking down a dark street and I hear whistling in

89
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,960
 any street.

90
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,360
 I could be walking through Beverly Hills if I'm here whistling in the bushes.

91
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,160
 I won't investigate.

92
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,600
 But anyways, what happens is if you investigate the bushes, the ghosts get you.

93
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,860
 See the dead whistle back at you is really the point of this story.

94
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,800
 You whistle the dead whistle back at you.

95
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,880
 The creepy component.

96
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,000
 So it's fairly mundane whistling in the dark.

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,440
 I guess people do that.

98
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,680
 But if they get you, I thought this part was creepy, if they get you, you then become

99
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,520
 a lurking ghost like sitting by the side of the road with haunted eyes, just waiting

100
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,600
 for someone to walk by and whistle so you can drag them into your hellish reality.

101
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,480
 So every time someone loses this game, their army of whistlers gets stronger.

102
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,680
 I always think stories like that are creepy.

103
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,440
 People are like "and then you die" and I'm like "yeah, I could die eating a subway

104
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,440
 sandwich like I could choke on a piece of bread or something like that.

105
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,640
 That's not scary."

106
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,640
 But what if when you died you then had to work in a subway for the rest of eternity?

107
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,640
 That's scary.

108
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,640
 That'd be pretty scary.

109
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,640
 It would smell good.

110
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,640
 But it would be scary.

111
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,440
 Stories where you get sucked into the hellish dimension.

112
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,400
 We covered the night marchers from Hawaii a couple of episodes back.

113
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
 The same thing.

114
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,080
 I don't like being turned into a monster.

115
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,080
 Who does?

116
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,080
 Who does?

117
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,080
 Who does?

118
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,080
 Who does?

119
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,080
 Who does?

120
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,080
 Who does?

121
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,080
 Who does?

122
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,080
 Who does?

123
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,080
 Who does?

124
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,080
 Who does?

125
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,080
 Who does?

126
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,080
 Who does?

127
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,080
 Who does?

128
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,080
 Who does?

129
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,080
 Who does?

130
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,080
 Who does?

131
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,080
 Who does?

132
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,080
 Who does?

133
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,080
 Who does?

134
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,080
 Who does?

135
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,080
 Who does?

136
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,080
 Who does?

137
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,080
 Who does?

138
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,080
 Who does?

139
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,080
 Who does?

140
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,080
 Who does?

141
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,080
 Who does?

142
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,080
 Who does?

143
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,080
 Who does?

144
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,080
 Who does?

145
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,080
 Who does?

146
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,080
 Who does?

147
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,080
 Who does?

148
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,080
 Who does?

149
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,080
 Who does?

150
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,080
 Who does?

151
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,080
 Who does?

152
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,080
 Who does?

153
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,080
 Who does?

154
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,080
 Who does?

155
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,080
 Who does?

156
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,080
 Who does?

157
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,080
 Who does?

158
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,080
 Who does?

159
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,080
 Who does?

160
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,080
 Who does?

161
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,080
 Who does?

162
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,080
 Who does?

163
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,080
 Who does?

164
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,080
 Who does?

165
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,080
 Who does?

166
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,080
 Who does?

167
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,080
 Who does?

00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,080
 Who does?

169
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,080
 Who does?

170
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,080
 Who does?

 Who does?

174
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,080
 Who does?

175
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,080
 Who does?

176
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
 Who does?

177
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,080
 Who does?

178
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,080
 Who does?

179
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,080
 Who does?

180
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,080
 Who does?

181
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,080
 Who does?

182

 Who does?

612
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,080

00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,080
 Who does?

616
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,080
 Who does?

617
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,080
 Who does?

618
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,080
 Who does?

00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,080
 Who does?

00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,080
 Who does?

00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,080
 Who does?

00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,080
 Who does?

625
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,080
 Who does?

626
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,080
 Who does?

627
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,080

628
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,080
 Who does?

629
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,080
 Who does?

630
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,080
 Who does?

631
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,080
 Who does?

632
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,080
 Who does?

633
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,080
 Who does?

634
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,080
 Who does?

635
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,080
 Who does?

636
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,080
 Who does?

637
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,080
 Who does?

638
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,080
 Who does?

639
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,080
 Who does?

640
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,080
 Who does?

641
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,080
 Who does?

642
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,080
 Who does?

643
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,080
 Who does?

644
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,080
 Who does?

645
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,080
 Who does?

646
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,080
 Who does?

647
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,080
 Who does?

648
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,080
 Who does?

649
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,080
 Who does?

650
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,080
 Who does?

651
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,080
 Who does?

652
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,080
 Who does?

653
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,080
 Who does?

654
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,080
 Who does?

655
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,080
 Who does?

656
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,080
 Who does?

657
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,080
 Who does?

658
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,080
 Who does?

659
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,080
 Who does?

660
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,080
 Who does?

661
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,080
 Who does?

662
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,080
 Who does?

663
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,080
 Who does?

664
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,080
 Who does?

665
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,080
 Who does?

666
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,080
 Who does?

667
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,080
 Who does?

668
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,080
 Now, I'm bought all those materials.

669
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:53,080
 Let's explain a little bit about how these hats work and testimonials.

670
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,080
 That's what you've been waiting for, right?

671
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,080
 People who have actually worn these hats out in public, how they have dealt.

672
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,080
 He wears it.

673
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,080
 Several photos of him wearing this hat.

674
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,080
 He wears it all the time.

675
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,080
 So, here's the thing.

676
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,080
 Aliens come down.

677
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:12,080
 You know, like looking around, you're in a house all of a sudden, you're like, "Oh, no.

678
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,080
 It's dark.

679
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,880
 You're covering your mouth so you don't accidentally whistle.

680
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,600
 Aliens walking up behind you."

681
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,080
 And they're using telepathic powers against you.

682
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,120
 See, and I've made this comment several times on this podcast.

683
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,600
 You could wreck an alien.

684
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,360
 I don't care who you are, man to man or man to thing.

685
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,240
 You could defy physically defeat an alien.

686
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,520
 It's the telepathic powers that actually take you out.

687
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,640
 So if you can wear this hat, that's what I love about these testimonials, because there's

688
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,760
 a lot of one-on-one alien action coming up.

689
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:52,400
 When you wear the hat, the aliens can't use their psychic telepathic alien powers against

690
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,400
 you.

691
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,800
 So when it's like, "Ahhhhh!"

692
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,800
 Coming up behind you, you can just turn around, punch it right in its big old gray head, punch

693
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,400
 it right in the eyeball, dude.

694
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,080
 It's like, "Ahhhhh!"

695
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,640
 Falls backwards.

696
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:10,280
 You basically remove their greatest tool outside of their hyper-hyper-warp-drive starships and

697
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,760
 space-age weaponry.

698
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,000
 Now they can't beam thoughts into your head and they can't paralyze you, so that's the

699
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,200
 good point of these hats.

700
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,360
 Now, they also say, or he also says, and we actually know other people have said this

701
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,040
 too, aliens absorb nutrients through their skin.

702
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,560
 They stick their hands in water to drink.

703
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,080
 They don't drink it like a normal human being, because they're not.

704
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,040
 So he says, another good defense against aliens is perfume.

705
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,920
 Really smelly perfume.

706
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,520
 Because what happens is when they grab onto you, it sucks the nutrients.

707
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,720
 Basically, they're basically drinking all the time.

708
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,400
 So if you're covered in smelly, smelly scents, they're absorbing it into their skin.

709
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,240
 So the Axe Body Spray.

710
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,960
 So I think the shorthand is he wants everyone to go get Axe Body Spray.

711
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,240
 You know what, I'll tell you this.

712
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,280
 This is one of my Jason Is Amoron story.

713
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,720
 I consider myself not the smartest guy in the world, but also not the dumbest, pretty

714
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,520
 moderate intelligence.

715
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,960
 Back in the probably late 90s, I remember watching, I can't believe this.

716
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,640
 I was watching television and I saw a commercial for Axe Body Spray.

717
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,920
 This is the first time I'd ever even heard of this stuff.

718
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,160
 I saw a commercial and I go, I got to get me some of that.

719
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,240
 And the very next time I went to the store, I went and bought Axe Body Spray.

720
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,000
 I'm not the most easy person to manipulate, but for whatever reason, that commercial looks

721
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 so cool.

722
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,120
 I bought that.

723
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,120
 I bought Axe Body Spray.

724
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,280
 I think I actually bought a couple of cans of it over the next couple months and I was

725
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,280
 like, this doesn't work.

726
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,640
 This is, girls aren't all over me.

727
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,140
 Like it was dumbest.

728
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:36,240
 It was probably one of the dumbest decisions I've made in my life.

729
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,280
 Like not on the level of like life changing, but I remember just, I don't think I've ever

730
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,000
 had that experience before where I've watched the commercial and then gone out and bought

731
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 something.

732
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,760
 Anyway, that embarrassing story is, right?

733
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,640
 Spraying with Axe Body Spray that also helps if you don't have your hat handy, which becomes

734
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,920
 an ongoing problem.

735
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,640
 See this is why he says the leather aviator cap is the best because it straps underneath

736
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,920
 the chin.

737
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:04,120
 The aliens hate these hats so much, they will steal them from you.

738
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,800
 They'll take them right off your head.

739
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,480
 So he recommends the leather aviator cap so they can't do that.

740
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,680
 However, if you can't wear one of those in public because you look like an idiot or a

741
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,240
 time traveler, you can get a baseball cap or any other hat.

742
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,960
 And there is a photo of this 60 year old man wearing a woman's bonnet, by the way.

743
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,200
 I did not expect to see that, but so a bonnet works as well.

744
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,000
 But the baseball cap, he says you can wear it, but you should attach string or tape it

745
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,120
 to your head.

746
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,720
 So you're kind of defeating the purpose.

747
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,720
 You're in a business meeting, guy gets up, he's the baseball cap, and you're like, "Hey

748
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,720
 Larry, you probably shouldn't wear your baseball cap here, but you definitely shouldn't have

749
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,720
 a tie to your chin."

750
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,040
 And he's like, "Listen boss, I'd really like to take it off my head, but aliens."

751
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,840
 Assuming that the aliens aren't working at the building next to you, I think you'd be

752
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,360
 fine with just the baseball hat.

753
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,800
 But when you go home by yourself, you should switch to a leather aviator cap or tie it

754
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,600
 to your head because they will take it off you while you're sleeping.

755
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,720
 Because they hate these caps.

756
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,840
 Once you remove the cap, they can actually start to use their mental powers against you.

757
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,040
 So this was one of my favorite parts of this website.

758
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,280
 It was just listed as directions.

759
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,280
 Directions.

760
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,360
 The first and only direction really should be wear a hat.

761
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,280
 Wear one of my hats.

762
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,760
 But he actually has a whole webpage dedicated to directions.

763
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,120
 So here's a couple of his directions.

764
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,600
 One, prepare for a fight.

765
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,640
 That's an attention-grabbing direction.

766
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,040
 He said, "Aliens will fight you for your hat," like we were talking about.

767
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:34,160
 And then he goes on to say, here's a quote from the website, "Before you make one, they

768
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,560
 may try to influence you that you don't need one."

769
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,920
 Which is fair.

770
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,640
 I think that's your own judgment coming into question.

771
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,080
 And you spent two and a half hours making this hat.

772
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,240
 You got an hour and a half left.

773
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,360
 And you're so envelosed at to your third-eye blind tour hat that you got back in 1999.

774
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,160
 And you think, this is a waste of time.

775
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,160
 I can't believe that I'm actually wasting this and ruin my third-eye blind hat.

776
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,760
 That's the aliens telling you, you don't need that.

777
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,320
 You don't need that.

778
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,920
 I think that's just your better judgment.

779
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,520
 I think that you go, and there are better things I can do in my time than making this

780
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,480
 hat and then having to wear it.

781
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:13,400
 He also stated that sometimes, oddly specific, sometimes the aliens, when you're making

782
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,160
 the hat, they don't want you to-- because they're watching you at all times, obviously.

783
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,240
 They're aliens, right?

784
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,480
 If you're making the hat and they don't want you to make their hat, they will kill your

785
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,720
 pet.

786
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,320
 So there's a story, a reader testimonial, where this woman was making these hats and

787
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,080
 she-- her dog died.

788
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,600
 And she took it to the vet and they said that its spine was surgically cut from the inside.

789
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,760
 And the vet couldn't explain that.

790
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,440
 And then she lost two more dogs.

791
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,120
 And I'm thinking, this woman's killing these dogs.

792
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,920
 This woman's totally killing these dogs.

793
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,480
 And so, like, why is the alien killing the dogs?

794
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,040
 Why isn't it like knocking down your house or killing you, taking your brain out, putting

795
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,200
 it in a jar so they can do whatever they want to?

796
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,680
 Like, it just isn't why your dog-- that woman was most likely killing her own animals.

797
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,160
 But that's a bold claim.

798
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,960
 But anyways, she's anonymous.

799
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,960
 I don't even know her name.

800
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,720
 So I could say stuff like that, I hope, legally.

801
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,000
 So it's a joke otherwise.

802
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,680
 This was one of my favorite quotes on this website, though.

803
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:14,600
 And this really sums up this whole group of people, because you have people who exist

804
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:20,320
 in a reality where they believe that by putting packaging material in a hat, they can protect

805
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:28,160
 themselves from travelers from beyond our solar system, who have perfected light drive,

806
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,640
 hyperdrive, whatever you want to call it.

807
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:35,320
 They come here and you can put packaging material in a hat and you can defeat them, versus everyone

808
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,800
 else who goes, "Hey, aliens might exist.

809
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,000
 People may get abducted by aliens."

810
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,080
 That's the camp I'm in.

811
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,400
 But I don't think your hat's going to stop them.

812
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,640
 This is my favorite quote that really shows the divide from the website.

813
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,880
 They are good at manipulating your spouse to have a conflict with you about wearing the

814
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,200
 helmet.

815
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,920
 So basically, you have a guy who's making a helmet.

816
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,920
 He's at home.

817
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,920
 He's 44 years old.

818
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,640
 Father of two kids.

819
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,480
 He's making this hat and he wears it all the time.

820
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,720
 And his wife's like, "Jerry, will you take off that hat?

821
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,160
 You're so embarrassing me."

822
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,520
 And he's like, "Honey, if I take it off, the aliens are going to get me."

823
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,240
 And she's like, "You look like an idiot.

824
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,360
 You're about to get fired from your job.

825
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,440
 I heard you had tape on your hat.

826
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,080
 When you were in a business, you had a hat on in a business meeting."

827
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,680
 He's like, "The aliens, honey.

828
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,680
 The aliens."

829
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,680
 According to...

830
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:26,280
 So, what basically Michael's saying is she, your wife, or your husband, is mad at you,

831
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,840
 not because your hat is stupid and you're giving the family a bad name, but because the

832
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,000
 aliens are influencing them to make you take the hat off.

833
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,120
 That is a dangerous statement.

834
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,960
 That's a very, very dangerous statement.

835
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,320
 He makes quite a few more coming up.

836
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,600
 So it's no longer this charming, like, "Hey, look, I think when we start off, I said,

837
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,520
 'Hey, the guy's not trying to make money off of it.

838
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,520
 He's making this hat.

839
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,520
 He's not really harming anybody.'

840
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,840
 But as we go through this website, he makes some dangerous statements and that's one

841
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,840
 of them.

842
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,040
 The reason why your loved ones are telling you to take off the hat isn't because they're

843
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,980
 worried about you and they're kind of afraid of your mental decline or they think you're

844
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,720
 getting too delusional.

845
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,840
 It's because they're being controlled by aliens.

846
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,200
 I'm afraid that aliens are abducting me so I'm going to go to these extreme measures

847
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
 to stop them.

848
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,400
 And when someone is trying to be rational towards me, I think you're an alien too."

849
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,360
 That is not something you want to put into the head of someone who is possibly struggling

850
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,600
 with mental illness at this point.

851
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,240
 So yeah, that's just a bizarre statement to make in the first place.

852
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,560
 But you want to know more directions, right?

853
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,280
 You want to know more about this hat.

854
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,840
 You need to have a locked container.

855
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,600
 So when you're not wearing that, a lot of times the hats will disappear.

856
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,000
 A lot of times the hats will disappear.

857
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,320
 And most people go, "I woke up one day.

858
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,320
 Hat wasn't on my head.

859
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,840
 The aliens must have taken it."

860
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,200
 Again, I know who's taking it.

861
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,920
 It is the people closest to you who are saying he needs help.

862
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,680
 This one guy came home and said, "My hat had a hole punched in the middle of it so aliens

863
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,680
 didn't."

864
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,120
 I can almost guarantee that what happened was one of his, like his spouse or brother

865
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,480
 or whatever like that punched a hole through the hat and was hoping he wouldn't notice.

866
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,840
 So then one day when he's like, "Yeah, my hat really works."

867
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,920
 The guy goes, "Hey look, I put a hole in it.

868
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,920
 The hat doesn't work."

869
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:09,080
 Like those are things that people, that's kind of a dick move, but there are things

870
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:14,840
 people will do to try to stop this delusional behavior, to stop this kind of insane behavior.

871
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,480
 Again, this is different than believing in aliens or saying people who say they've had

872
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,920
 abduction experiences.

873
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,920
 This is full blow and delusion where you think that every single day you're being hunted

874
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,080
 by aliens and it affects your life.

875
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,840
 This is gangstalking with a sci-fi twist.

876
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,200
 We had another direction, another thing.

877
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,200
 I love this one.

878
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,200
 There's a quote.

879
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,000
 "Don't let the aliens lure you out of your location.

880
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,360
 Stay where you are if you think aliens are close by.

881
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,520
 They will make noises by banging on walls to lure you out, but don't do it.

882
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,840
 They also may use lights outside to lure you outside."

883
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,180
 I can imagine these people at home and they hear banging on their walls and they see lights

884
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:55,360
 outside and they're afraid aliens are out there.

885
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,320
 In fact, what it is is people are outside saying, "This is the police.

886
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,680
 Please open up."

887
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,680
 Or "Sir, your wife sent us here to help you."

888
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,960
 But anyways, anyways, so there's more directions, but they're basically stuff that I've covered

889
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,400
 already like tape the hat to your head.

890
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,200
 Make the helmet quickly because you'll be under telepathic attack.

891
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,880
 But let's end it like this.

892
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,880
 Let's end it like this.

893
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:20,520
 I want to talk to you about one of these testimonials, one of these stories that someone who's worn

894
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,600
 the hat has sent in to him.

895
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:28,320
 In Pennsylvania in July 2008, this woman writes in to Michael and says, "This is what happened

896
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,320
 to me.

897
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,600
 This is my experiences with your hat."

898
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,600
 Here's a quote.

899
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,740
 This is a great quote.

900
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,720
 This is the beginning of the description of the testimony.

901
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,720
 So this is Michael.

902
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,040
 Michael does not ease us into this at all.

903
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:43,440
 This is how the testimonial begins describing this experience.

904
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:50,400
 In July of 2008 in Pennsylvania, a woman abductee who was teaching...

905
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:57,120
 A woman abductee who was teaching two alien hybrids how to drive her SUV at night had

906
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,000
 her helmets forcibly removed from her.

907
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 You can't...

908
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 That is not how...

909
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,640
 I want to know that story.

910
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,720
 Why was she teaching them how to drive?

911
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,640
 Did she know that they were hybrids?

912
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,440
 Oh, I guess I should say right now.

913
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,280
 The whole point of these aliens, according to Michael, the whole point of aliens abducting

914
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,720
 people is to harvest their sperm and their eggs to make alien hybrids to take over the

915
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,720
 planet.

916
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,040
 That's the whole point.

917
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:24,480
 So all of his stories involve people getting their eggs and getting their semen sucked

918
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,480
 out.

919
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,960
 So anyways, that's why there's a bunch of hybrids showing up.

920
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,440
 Now, I'll tell you this right now.

921
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,040
 Hybrids, they're actual...

922
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:36,960
 Everyone I'm going to talk about in this testimonial are real humans interacting with this woman.

923
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,360
 I can almost guarantee that none of them are alien in any way, shape, or form.

924
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:46,440
 So the two alien hybrids she was teaching to drive most likely were just her teenage

925
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,640
 sons or something like that.

926
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,240
 They were not 100% at all half human, half alien at all.

927
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,080
 So she's teaching two human beings how to drive is really what that sentence should have

928
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,080
 said.

929
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,520
 So her hats were taken from her two times, right?

930
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,520
 Here we go.

931
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,360
 So, again, real people.

932
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,120
 Real people are interacting with her.

933
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:14,360
 This woman is led into a room and she goes in there and there is a hybrid hiding behind

934
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,360
 the door.

935
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,400
 The other hybrid leads her into the room and once they get in there, they forcibly

936
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,320
 remove the hat from her head.

937
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,800
 And they take the hat and never give it back.

938
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:30,480
 That sounds like something that someone would do who was fed up with their loved one wearing

939
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,480
 a hat.

940
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,480
 A little aggressive?

941
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,480
 Yes.

942
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,480
 Manhandling this woman?

943
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,480
 Absolutely.

944
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,920
 But it almost seems like someone was just at the end of their rope that their mom or

945
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,560
 their aunt or whatever would not stop wearing this stupid hat.

946
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,240
 It was a delusional crutch.

947
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,160
 They forcibly took it from her.

948
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,520
 And then as she's laying on the ground and she looks up at him, she's like "hybrids!"

949
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,200
 When in fact they weren't, they were people, they were other humans.

950
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,360
 So she ends up writing Michael after this and saying "Hey, a couple of hybrids took

951
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,920
 my hat and he's like those damn hybrids.

952
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,920
 Here's a trick.

953
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,280
 Here's a thing that you'll need.

954
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,720
 You got led into that room, right?"

955
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,280
 And she's like "Yeah, I got led into that room."

956
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,720
 He goes "Okay, I'm going to send you a new hat for your charge and I'm also going to

957
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,480
 send you some aviator goggles."

958
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,200
 So now you have this woman who was previously just wearing a hat full of packing material,

959
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,680
 is now wearing a leather aviator cap and goggles, aviator goggles at all times.

960
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,080
 So she's fully off her rocker at this point.

961
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,640
 Like there is no doubting that this woman has some problems.

962
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,360
 She's wearing the goggles now, she's wearing the hat.

963
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,720
 So what do you think is going to happen?

964
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,920
 Some people have already taken the hat off of her.

965
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,600
 What do you think is going to happen now?

966
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,760
 Second time, she had recently had back surgery.

967
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,640
 Only from the attack, the first hybrid attack, but she had recently had back surgery, right?

968
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:51,280
 Michael says this in his website that one hybrid quote came up behind her going through

969
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,520
 the wall and back of her.

970
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,000
 So Kool-Aid Man style?

971
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,840
 Did he like bust through the wall?

972
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,920
 Is her grandson Colossus?

973
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,480
 Was the hybrid able to phase through the wall?

974
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,600
 Which I would argue, if these alien hybrids can actually phase through walls, they can

975
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,120
 get through tape and string.

976
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,840
 Did I mention the locked cabinets earlier?

977
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,840
 I don't think I did.

978
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,160
 You have to have a locked cabinet because aliens don't know.

979
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,160
 I think I quit.

980
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,600
 I think I moved on to another topic.

981
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,600
 You have to put it in a locked cabinet because aliens are telepathic, therefore they trust

982
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,600
 each other.

983
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,600
 So nothing on their home planet is ever locked.

984
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,360
 They don't know the concept of what a lock looks like.

985
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,240
 So if you lock stuff away, aliens can't get it.

986
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,280
 That's the logic he says.

987
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:35,920
 If you put one of these hats in a locked cabinet, these aliens who have perfected bending time

988
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:39,840
 space don't know how to open a lock because on their planet we don't have locks.

989
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,640
 Aren't all your doors and windows generally locked?

990
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,880
 They go through the roof, right?

991
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,320
 So can they just reach their hand into your thing and break it?

992
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,320
 It doesn't...

993
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,320
 None of this makes sense.

994
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,680
 If you think about it for a second, it just doesn't make sense.

995
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,840
 But anyways, that's why I said a locked cabinet earlier.

996
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:59,000
 Anyways, so Guy, oh yeah, breaks through the wall, grabs her.

997
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,360
 Other hybrid, pulls her hat off.

998
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,080
 Now if these are real humans, they're incredibly strong to break through a wall.

999
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,800
 I think most likely someone surprised her.

1000
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,640
 But that hat's gone as well.

1001
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,480
 Now this is where we get incredibly dangerous with this guy.

1002
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,840
 Like the originally saying your loved one was an alien was bad enough.

1003
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,040
 This is far, far worse.

1004
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,400
 This is a quote from the website.

1005
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,000
 This is how he wraps up this story.

1006
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,800
 This is the first case of an abductee being forcibly restrained by very human looking

1007
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,320
 and 'cause they are human...

1008
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,680
 Okay.

1009
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,280
 By very human looking and acting alien hybrid.

1010
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:41,040
 So even he's agreeing that these people are indistinguishable from humans.

1011
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,040
 Okay?

1012
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,520
 That's going to be very important for what's coming up.

1013
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,800
 Forcibly restrained by very human looking and acting alien hybrids and having their helmet

1014
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,640
 subsequently removed.

1015
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:58,480
 If the woman had a weapon, such as a gun or rifle, she could have tried to shoot them.

1016
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,840
 But she hardly put up a fight.

1017
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:08,040
 He's now recommending that these people open fire on hybrids.

1018
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:14,240
 He is now recommending that if this poor woman who recently had back surgery had a gun or

1019
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,720
 a rifle, she could have shot both of these hybrids dead.

1020
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,760
 So we can talk all about not wanting to take money, scams, stuff like that.

1021
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,280
 He seems to be doing it out of the goodness of his heart.

1022
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:30,320
 But he's now recommending that these people, these delusional people who are wearing these

1023
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:37,240
 hats, armed themselves at all times to shoot the hybrids who are trying to take their hats

1024
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,520
 away.

1025
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:44,840
 And if you think that is chilling, tomorrow we're going to get into some more hat stories.

1026
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:50,760
 I have a couple more testimonials of people who did actually engage these hybrids.

1027
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:57,520
 And then we move on to the second part of the story of Michael and his hat.

1028
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:05,960
 He believes that not only can his hat cure autism, but autism itself is caused by alien

1029
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,840
 experimentation.

1030
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:18,360
 Dangerous, dangerous theories from a man giving away free hats.

1031
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,360
