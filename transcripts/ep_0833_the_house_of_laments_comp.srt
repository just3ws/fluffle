1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
 How do you save a ghost trapped in a terrifying time loop?

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,220
 And then we travel to Mexico to take a look at a horrible story that crosses the lines

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,280
 of true crime and the world of the paranormal.

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:22,920
 When a man misses his dead wife so much, he begins to butcher people at random in hopes

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,480
 of seeing her again today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:36,880
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,160
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:44,200
 Hope you guys are having a great day too and I gotta say this guys, I am so honored.

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,960
 This is such a fun job.

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,760
 I love putting this podcast together for you so I don't know if I ever really say it

11
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,400
 but I appreciate you guys listening to this show.

12
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,000
 I mean I have so much fun putting it together and I'm glad you are enjoying it as well.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 That's so true.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,400
 I was thinking about that today, how much I love this show and how much I hope you guys

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:07,480
 get out of it as well just for some fun entertainment for a while.

16
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,680
 Really really feel blessed that this is part of my life honestly.

17
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,680
 Speaking of blessed inflotes being carried by a thousand cherubs, one of our newest Patreon

18
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,480
 supporters flying into Dead Rabbit Command right now, give it up for Walter Bonnet.

19
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,000
 Wooo everyone give him big round of applause as he's floating off show off.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 You can't walk in like a normal person.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,360
 Walter you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

22
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,440
 If you guys can't support the Patreon I totally understand.

23
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,960
 Just help spread the word about this show.

24
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,120
 That really really helps out a lot.

25
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,240
 Now Walter and your army of angelic babies, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys

26
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,920
 to the Dead Rabbit Dune Buggy.

27
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,640
 We're gonna go ahead and leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

28
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,800
 We are headed all the way out to Cascade County, Montana.

29
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,240
 [Demonic sounds]

30
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,960
 Specifically we're gonna be in the area of Highway 87.

31
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,200
 This is out in the Black Horse Lake area.

32
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,240
 If you are listening to this podcast in Colorado, there's a chance you're driving down this

33
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,400
 road right now.

34
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,160
 And in this area there's been a very peculiar ghost sighting for years.

35
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,480
 Some people say it's an urban legend, some people say it's an authentic event, an authentic

36
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,480
 paranormal event.

37
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,760
 Either way it's quite terrifying.

38
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:26,480
 If you drive down this road headed towards Fort Benton at night, you may see a hitchhiker

39
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,800
 on the side of the road.

40
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,120
 He'll have his thumb out waiting for a ride.

41
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,120
 A lot of people describe him as looking like a Native American.

42
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,360
 He has long black hair and then he's wearing denim jeans and a denim jacket.

43
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,880
 So just find those clothes alone.

44
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,480
 I think we can put this ghost origin somewhere in the 70s, 80s, something like that.

45
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,880
 He's walking down the street.

46
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,920
 He's wearing denim jeans and a denim jacket.

47
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,520
 And as you're driving down this road, you may see this man holding his thumb out.

48
00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:00,760
 But as you get closer to him, whether or not you actually thought about picking up a hitchhiker,

49
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:06,280
 driving down the road, this man has his thumb out and as you get closer to him, he suddenly

50
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,200
 steps in front of your car and you hit him.

51
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:16,800
 And he will tumble across the hood of your car, smash into your window and then fall

52
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,880
 off.

53
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,440
 When you stop the car, which you should, right?

54
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,440
 You ever hit someone?

55
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,800
 We talked about this on yesterday's episode, never pull off a hit and run.

56
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:31,880
 You hit this guy, he thumps across your car, you hear it, you see it, you feel it, your

57
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,520
 car will actually shake when you hit this phantom.

58
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,680
 You're like, "Jason, you keep saying it's a ghost.

59
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,920
 Are you sure this isn't a real guy?"

60
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,960
 This is what makes him a ghost.

61
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:48,400
 You get out of your car and you look and there's no body anywhere and any damage you thought

62
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,120
 that he did to your car is gone.

63
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,840
 So if you thought that you totally ruined the front end of your car or that your window

64
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,400
 got smashed, when you get out, there is no body, there is no damage, there is nothing.

65
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,880
 You're standing on the roadside and it's just you.

66
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:11,040
 Unless you had passengers in your car and then it's them as well.

67
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:20,080
 But the idea is there is this phantom out in this area that gets hit by a car constantly.

68
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,800
 This is really, really fascinating because what we're having, there's old stories about

69
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
 the phantom hitchhiker.

70
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,800
 This is one of the most popular urban legends in America and actually it's global.

71
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,800
 All over the world there are sightings of a phantom hitchhiker.

72
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,160
 But when you pick up this hitchhiker and you're taking them back to their place of location

73
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,320
 or the prom or wherever they ask to go, right?

74
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,120
 When you pull up to the destination, you turn around and they're gone.

75
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,960
 There's some versions of this story where you pick up a young woman, she's hitchhiking,

76
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,400
 you take her home and she's gone and then you go to the house, you knock on the door

77
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,720
 and the father opens the door and you go, "I just picked up this young woman down the

78
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,600
 street and now she's disappeared."

79
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,720
 I had nothing to do with it.

80
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,280
 I didn't bury the body or kill her or anything like that.

81
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,720
 And the guy at the door goes, "Oh yeah, our daughter died 30 years ago and this happens

82
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,040
 and this happens all the time.

83
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,040
 I'm so used to it.

84
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,040
 I just stay up late.

85
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,440
 I just stay up late on Saturday nights assuming someone's going to go knock on my door."

86
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,280
 Sometimes the phantom, like you'll give them a jacket because they look cold and when

87
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,400
 they disappear they take the jacket with you.

88
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,120
 That's a version of the story.

89
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,720
 Sometimes they leave puddles of water in your car.

90
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,840
 And this is a variation of that, but the violence involved in it, right?

91
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,000
 The hitting of the hitchhiker and thumping across your car.

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,120
 Sometimes it'll fall underneath your car and you'll drive over it.

93
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,640
 That's insane.

94
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,080
 Think about the force it takes to rattle a car.

95
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,080
 What is car?

96
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,280
 Half a ton?

97
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,040
 And when you hit something, you feel it.

98
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,800
 I don't know how many of you guys have been in car accidents.

99
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,560
 I've been in quite a lot.

100
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,400
 And it takes an impact of another car hitting you, you hitting a car, crashing into a wall,

101
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,280
 whatever, to make that car shake.

102
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,040
 I want you all to test this theory right now.

103
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,200
 Go out and start trying to shake your vehicle.

104
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,160
 Put your hands on it and start pushing it from side.

105
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,560
 This is your homework for today.

106
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,640
 I want you to be out in the parking lot of your work and people are like, "What in the

107
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,880
 world is that guy doing?"

108
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,320
 And you're just running up and hitting your car, elbowing the car.

109
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,680
 It takes a lot to make the car vibrate.

110
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,400
 But this story involves that, the amount of sheer force it would take.

111
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,920
 Hitting a normal human body, hitting someone who's like 180 pounds, it's going to make

112
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,920
 the car shake.

113
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,680
 This isn't a body, this is a ghost.

114
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,160
 So how much energy is being put out by this poltergeist?

115
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,480
 This is fascinating.

116
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,000
 Most ghosts can't flick a light switch.

117
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,160
 Most ghosts can't open a door.

118
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,360
 Sometimes you'll have ghosts turn on water faucets, which that takes a bit of force.

119
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,680
 But remember, most ghosts are sightings.

120
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,200
 Or actually most ghosts are smelling it or you sense it.

121
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,440
 Then you have a subset of ghosts that you actually see, either it's a full body apparition

122
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,000
 or a screaming head or a hand.

123
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,880
 We've covered a couple of stories recently where they're just seeing hands floating around.

124
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,880
 That's in the minority.

125
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,640
 A ghost that can actually physically manipulate things, very rare.

126
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,720
 And a ghost that can shake an entire car.

127
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,600
 I can't really think of any other case where this has happened.

128
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,800
 That's why I wanted to cover this.

129
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,520
 Getting your jacket stolen by a ghost.

130
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,840
 Where do all those jackets go actually?

131
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,840
 Now they think about it.

132
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,360
 All those fanamidgikers, they just have a collection of jackets.

133
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,160
 They have this matrix like closet that goes on forever and ever.

134
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,520
 Puddles of water left in your car, things like that.

135
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,960
 That is also exceedingly rare.

136
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,520
 But for a ghost to be able to move your car is insane.

137
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,200
 Even if you look at the legends of the, like if you, we've covered this before too.

138
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:59,360
 Where you stop your car at the bottom of a hill where supposedly a school bus of children

139
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,520
 got hit.

140
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,600
 The car will move and reportedly like you can see the hand prints of the little kids

141
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,800
 on your car and stuff like that.

142
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,380
 It takes a school bus full of little kid ghosts to push your car and a lot of times it just

143
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,360
 turns out that that is a physics thing.

144
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,800
 The hill looks like it's at an incline.

145
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,880
 It's like a weird mystery spot type of thing.

146
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,520
 And the lawyers from back one.

147
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,720
 I can't think of another ghost that has this level of power.

148
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,760
 And what's awful is that this is not something you want to keep reliving.

149
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,520
 A ghost who's stacking chairs in your living room.

150
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,160
 Well, at least that's kind of fun, right?

151
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,160
 But this isn't.

152
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:39,880
 There's no fun part about getting hit over and over again.

153
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,120
 This is a ghost that nobody knows the origin of him.

154
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,600
 The only thing they can think of is what it appears to be.

155
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,320
 There was a Native American dude hitchhiking through the area and he got hit by a car.

156
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,640
 And his phantom is set to replay that every so often.

157
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,360
 Terrifying, right?

158
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,640
 Terrifying.

159
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,120
 It would be one thing if the car passed through the ghost, but for it to interact with it

160
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,600
 at that level, you have to think if you were out there on foot, could you communicate with

161
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
 this thing?

162
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,400
 Because that's such a high power level.

163
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,440
 And it could be that this thing is seen so infrequent.

164
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,600
 First off, it could be that this thing doesn't exist, right?

165
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,680
 And it's just an urban legend that older brothers told their siblings to scare them to not drive

166
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,680
 down this road.

167
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,800
 But if it does exist, the power level to be able to manipulate that much matter, you would

168
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,800
 almost think this would be one of the strongest ghosts that you could encounter.

169
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,960
 So if you went and could you talk to it?

170
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,280
 Could you have a conversation with it without a Ouija board, without a medium, no seance,

171
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,280
 or anything like that?

172
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,960
 Could you actually communicate with it?

173
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,320
 Because it has such physical power, would it also have such spiritual power?

174
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,120
 Very, very fascinating and creepy ghost story.

175
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,200
 Because if you're going to get caught in, there are ghosts that walk around like Elizabethan

176
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,800
 times, they got their head chopped off.

177
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,400
 And I think like Anne Boleyn's ghost is apparently like in her prison cell, still there and it's

178
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,640
 like crying at night.

179
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,640
 Yeah, that sucks, right?

180
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,560
 You don't want to be in that area, but at least she's not physically getting her head

181
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,280
 chopped off all the time.

182
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:09,640
 This guy is getting hit by a car and reliving his death over and over and over again.

183
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:17,400
 Fascinating and very, very powerful spirit if this story is accurate.

184
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,960
 But let's stop driving down these dark roads while trying to hit it.

185
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,640
 There's actual hitchhikers out there, like there's the ghost, there's the ghost, they're

186
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,000
 like no, no, they're trying to run away from our car.

187
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,600
 Hey man, this ghost is really active, look it, he's been running for 50 yards.

188
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,840
 I've never seen a ghost travel this fast and sweat and scream out.

189
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,880
 But that one did.

190
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,640
 Walter, I'm going to toss you the keys to the carbonic car.

191
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,280
 We're going to leave behind this crime scene.

192
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:48,960
 We are headed all the way out to Mexico.

193
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,240
 This story we're about to cover, it's one of those, when I finish it, I'm surprised this

194
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,560
 isn't more common.

195
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,280
 I'm surprised that this doesn't happen more often.

196
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:03,280
 It's one of those stories that I think we see a lot in the media, but this is the first

197
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,920
 time I can remember covering this on the show, something of this level.

198
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,680
 And according to all accounts, this is true.

199
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,920
 Like people have really dug into this and they go, yeah, there's not a lot of information

200
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,320
 on it, but it's true.

201
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,160
 So very, very creepy story coming up.

202
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,480
 Specifically we're headed out to Guanhato, Mexico, Guanahato, Mexico, people are shaking

203
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,120
 their heads, they're like no, wrong on both counts.

204
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,720
 Guanahato, Mexico.

205
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,360
 And as we're walking through this city, we're buying apples and stuff like that, eating

206
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,640
 them up, running over hitchhikers, really gets the appetite going.

207
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,960
 We're walking through the city, it's a very nice town, people are waving to us and then

208
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,640
 running out of the way as our car is veering towards them.

209
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,800
 We're walking through the town, we go into a shop and we're like, hey, we're a bunch

210
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,800
 of ghost hunters and we like talking about this stuff.

211
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,840
 Do you know of any haunted places in town?

212
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:04,280
 And the shopkeeper looks at us and then just kind of points across the street and we turn,

213
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,640
 we're like over there and we turn back and the shopkeeper, we expected the shopkeeper

214
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,160
 to disappear that they were a ghost to.

215
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,480
 I was like, oh man, I just gave that shopkeeper my jacket, he looked cold.

216
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,600
 We turn back and he's still there and he goes, if you guys want an authentic ghost story,

217
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,360
 that is tied directly into the world of true crime, across the street there.

218
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,720
 We turn and we look at this house, it just looks like any other house in the Guanhato

219
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,800
 area.

220
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,720
 But this house is now a museum.

221
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,600
 So we're like, oh, does it have like haunted relics in there and stuff like that?

222
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,440
 And the shopkeeper is like, no, no, and thanks for this jacket.

223
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,280
 And he kicks us out of the store.

224
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:49,440
 We walk over to Casa de Los Lamentos, which means the house of regrets or the house of

225
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,160
 wailing or the house of laments.

226
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,560
 It's all kind of the same depending on the translation.

227
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,360
 But Casa de Los Lamentos, I've seen different versions of it, is standing before us.

228
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:06,400
 This house was built back in 1890 and it traded hands through a couple owners, but eventually

229
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:17,880
 it was owned by Tadillo Fulgencia Mejia and his wife, Maria Constanza de la Rivera Olmeido.

230
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,760
 And when I say eventually, like very shortly, like the house was built in 1890, they were

231
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,320
 living in it like 1893, 1894.

232
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,680
 They were one of the earliest owners and spoiler alert, the last owners basically.

233
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,640
 It's a museum nowadays, but people do not want to live in this house.

234
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,440
 This was a couple that was truly in love.

235
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,080
 Tadillo and Maria loved each other so much they knew how to pronounce each other's names

236
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,080
 correctly.

237
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,960
 It was that kind of love.

238
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:52,760
 But shortly after they moved in, Maria is walking through the streets of Guanahanto and

239
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:59,560
 someone jumped out and either randomly attacked her or it was a robbery gone wrong, she was

240
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,200
 stabbed to death.

241
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,920
 And this destroyed Tadillo.

242
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,480
 He absolutely could not live without her.

243
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:13,480
 And all the locals figured, maybe he'd get over the brutal murder of his wife, it's

244
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,560
 life, you'll get over it buddy, but he didn't.

245
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:23,160
 He starts to really, really lose his grasp on reality and he decides that he wants to

246
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,560
 contact her from beyond the dead.

247
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,800
 Listen, I've never lost anyone super close to me.

248
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,080
 I don't know, I imagine that I would want to do the same thing.

249
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,200
 I imagine a lot of people will sympathize with this story.

250
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,200
 I do, right?

251
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,680
 He takes it a little too far, but to lose the person you picked out, like, you know,

252
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,760
 your family you're kind of born into and your friends, you kind of choose your friends.

253
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,680
 But when you find that special someone who completes you, who you feel like this, now

254
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,840
 I'm a whole person because I have them in my life and you lose them very tragically,

255
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:03,880
 I totally understand the urge, the need, the drive to do whatever it takes to contact

256
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,880
 them.

257
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,400
 I wonder how atheists do that.

258
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,120
 Like obviously I believe in the afterlife, so I believe like maybe the old ghosts will

259
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,440
 come to me or I could contact them using like a medium or Ouija board or something like

260
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,440
 that.

261
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,440
 I wonder what atheists do.

262
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,280
 If they're just like, "Eh, whatever, I'll be dead, I'll stop existing soon enough."

263
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,120
 That's not a facetious question either.

264
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,360
 I'm actually curious about that.

265
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,720
 I have a friend, Lana, she's an atheist and she's just like, "Yeah, people evaporate

266
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,080
 when they die and that's what makes life so beautiful that it stops existing at some

267
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,080
 point."

268
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,080
 And I'm like, "Eh, that's horrible.

269
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,920
 That's a horrible way to live in the world."

270
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,920
 I mean, it works for her.

271
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,200
 I just don't, I don't know.

272
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,200
 I don't know.

273
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,200
 Again, I'm not being facetious.

274
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,240
 I'm not saying that atheists are dummies or anything like that.

275
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,760
 I think that helps me deal with loss, knowing that I'll see them again.

276
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,960
 It would be weird to think, "Well, I'll never see that person again."

277
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,240
 And that their personality just evaporated.

278
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,640
 That is super weird.

279
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,720
 But anyways, feel free to fill out my YouTube comments with that.

280
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,320
 I'm genuinely curious of how that works.

281
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:11,160
 But to deal, a man after my own heart, just for this first part of the story, can't deal

282
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,920
 with the fact that he lost the love of his life.

283
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:20,980
 So he goes and he consults a local witch and he says, "I need to be able to talk to my

284
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,980
 wife."

285
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,360
 This is something that we see to this day.

286
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,360
 People will go to mediums.

287
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,760
 They'll go to ghost whisperers.

288
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,920
 I don't think that's an actual profession that was on television show.

289
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,440
 But they'll try to make contact and I totally get that.

290
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,160
 So he goes to this witch.

291
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,160
 Now this witch was an actual witch.

292
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,840
 This witch wasn't some psychic who was running a scam or someone who actually had these gifts.

293
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,640
 She did have some sort of gifts.

294
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:52,600
 But when he goes to see her, she immediately goes, "Oh, you want to talk to the dead?

295
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:57,240
 Here's a bunch of black magic rituals to perform."

296
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,320
 So it's not like she was throwing chicken bones in a pot and saying, "Your wife says

297
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,600
 that she loves you and it's time to move on."

298
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:08,120
 She gave him spells to cast.

299
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:12,240
 But these weren't like berry a potato underneath a full moon and then the ghost of your wife

300
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,840
 will show up in a mirror.

301
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:19,080
 If you really want to talk to your wife, here's a set of dark rituals for you to perform.

302
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:23,320
 And they involve human sacrifices.

303
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,600
 So this is where I think me and today, I think this is where me and today and most people

304
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,280
 would kind of veer off.

305
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,400
 You know, I'm not going to go out and murder a bunch of people to talk to my dead loved

306
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,400
 one.

307
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,960
 Again, I've never been in this situation though.

308
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,960
 Maybe I would.

309
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
 I don't know.

310
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,960
 I don't know if you're listening to this future jury.

311
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,200
 I thought these bodies racked up, but I'd say right now I wouldn't murder anyone to talk

312
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,480
 to a missing loved one.

313
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,760
 But he does.

314
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,800
 And apparently this is an actual true crime story.

315
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,200
 There's not a lot of information on it.

316
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,960
 A lot of the stuff is in Spanish and translated.

317
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:03,080
 But he begins snatching young men and women off the streets of Guanajuato and is sacrificing

318
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,080
 them in his house.

319
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:11,960
 He's bringing them down, killing them, performing these dark rituals to speak to his wife.

320
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,520
 And he would then burn the remains.

321
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,520
 He'd burn everything.

322
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,240
 He'd smash the bones and then grab somebody else.

323
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,680
 There's not a lot of info on this.

324
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:29,960
 The most essential piece of info I think is did the rituals work?

325
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:36,360
 But back in the 1890s, he's taking these people, he's gutting them, these young men and women,

326
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,360
 performing these rituals.

327
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,560
 Eventually, the townspeople start to realize there's not a lot of young people around anymore.

328
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,680
 There's less than there should be.

329
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,880
 Where's Johnny?

330
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,880
 Where's Joseph?

331
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,320
 Where are these people going?

332
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:56,880
 So apparently, again, there's some breaks in the information that we have.

333
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:03,280
 At a certain point, he falls under the suspicion of locals or authorities and they go to his

334
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,960
 house and they find a bunch of dead bodies.

335
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,560
 They find human skulls.

336
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,560
 They find bones and they find evidence that he'd been cremating these bodies.

337
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:17,560
 To this day, we have no idea how many people today are killed.

338
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:22,840
 And before he could answer any questions, he shoots himself.

339
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,200
 Now you figure you could probably figure out how many people he killed by we had this many

340
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,560
 people in town, this many young people in town and now with this next census, we have

341
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,480
 less people, less young people.

342
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,240
 But then you're also, you know, he could have been capturing people who were wandering through

343
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,240
 town.

344
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,240
 He could have been leaving.

345
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,160
 He could have been like, "It's a beautiful day for a road trip!"

346
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:49,440
 And driving to another nearby town and kidnapping people, taking them back home and sacrificing

347
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,440
 them.

348
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,880
 You can visit this place now.

349
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,800
 We know it's real because it's a museum and when you walk into one of the rooms, Atlas

350
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,760
 Obscura did a write up on this.

351
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,520
 You can go into this museum and there is an old, there are old framed photos of Maria

352
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,040
 and Tadeo just kind of standing there and dust all over the pictures and maybe like today

353
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,480
 Tadeo is like throwing a football.

354
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,400
 Maria is going long, going long as she's catching it.

355
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,400
 I don't know.

356
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,560
 I don't know if they didn't actually describe what was going on in the photos.

357
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,320
 They're winning a pie eating contest.

358
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,200
 But you go in and you can look at this room of these photos and then also in this room

359
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:32,800
 are chains, chains that he used to restrain these people, implements of black magic and

360
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:38,040
 sorcery laid out on this table and human skulls.

361
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,840
 It does not say that they are replica human skulls.

362
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,960
 Apparently these are the skulls of some of his final victims.

363
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,840
 He's like, "Oh, I'll dispose of those bones tomorrow, but first off, I'm going to take

364
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,560
 a nap."

365
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,720
 So that's the story of Tadeo.

366
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,160
 It's so far back any sort of newspaper would be written in Spanish.

367
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,120
 So again, we don't have a lot of information on this.

368
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:09,080
 This isn't an urban legend.

369
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:19,000
 I'm surprised this doesn't happen more often.

370
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,240
 I really am.

371
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,240
 We see this happen in movies, in television shows.

372
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,240
 Supernatural, when a demon wanted to contact hell, they'd have to slit the throat of a

373
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,720
 human and pour their blood in a cup and then that's like a little radio.

374
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,240
 It's like two tin cans and a string for demons.

375
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,680
 It's a common trope, right?

376
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:42,040
 Demonic sacrifices to be able to talk to the dead or be able to talk to the devil.

377
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,680
 But in the real world, there's not a lot of examples of this.

378
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:53,040
 There's a lot of examples of people sacrificing humans to gods or to devils and things like

379
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,040
 that.

380
00:21:54,040 --> 00:22:00,440
 But this particular motive, sacrificing a human to talk to a loved one, I can't think

381
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,840
 of another story we've come across like this.

382
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,400
 Most people will turn to a medium or turn to the Ouija board or sayons.

383
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,760
 Now the medium or if they talk to a witch or something like that may demand like I have

384
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,560
 to sacrifice a chicken or something like that.

385
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:23,080
 But the idea of the DIY, do it yourself, human sacrifice to talk to your dead wife, I can't

386
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,880
 think of another example of this.

387
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:31,160
 And I'm surprised it doesn't happen more often because I was thinking about it like this.

388
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,440
 You could, I'm not encouraging this.

389
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,680
 If you are currently dealing with a loss of someone, I'm going to make this sound, I'm

390
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,840
 going to make this sound quite easy to do.

391
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,000
 I'm not encouraging this.

392
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,400
 Imagine this.

393
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,800
 You snatched someone off the street and then you tell them a message.

394
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:53,840
 You say, tell Maria that I love her very much and that I miss her and the dude is like sitting

395
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,360
 there in a chair taped up and he's like, whoa, who's Maria?

396
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,520
 Why are you telling me this?

397
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,440
 You give a message to your victim and then you kill them.

398
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,080
 Wouldn't that ghost then be all floating out and be like, I'm not dead.

399
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,400
 I might as well go find Maria and tell her that stuff.

400
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,600
 He wasn't just killing them to send messages, right?

401
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,520
 He's trying to talk to his wife.

402
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,840
 So you figure he's not just killing these people.

403
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:23,720
 He's performing this ritual, this black magic ritual that we don't have access to.

404
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,640
 You perform this ritual, you kill the person and then you get to talk to your wife.

405
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,840
 And we don't know if it was successful or not.

406
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,640
 We don't know how many people he killed.

407
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,440
 He could have been getting wrong the first couple of times, but then finally he is able

408
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:44,320
 to actually perform the ritual, kill the person as part of the ritual and then did his wife

409
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,760
 ever communicate with him.

410
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,880
 It's creepy because even though I've never lost anyone close to me, I've lost grandparents

411
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,800
 that I loved very, very much, but they're much older.

412
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:02,480
 If I lost someone when they were young and they were a part of me and I was completely

413
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:08,840
 unexpected, I could see wanting to do whatever it takes to communicate with them.

414
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,520
 But constantly taking these human lives, this is why I think it might have worked.

415
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,960
 Constantly taking these human lives, it's not easy to kill someone.

416
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,720
 And when you're taking these human lives, by the eighth or ninth person, when you hadn't

417
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,080
 had any communication with your wife, you probably would give up, right?

418
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:30,480
 But if it did work, if he did get the ritual right and then his wife is communicating with

419
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:36,280
 him, if this black magic spell actually worked and you realize that you could slash open

420
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:43,400
 this innocent person and work this ritual and then the ghost of his wife did show up

421
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,880
 and said, "Oh, Tadeo, I love you so much."

422
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,720
 You want to continue this call?

423
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,640
 Slot her another person.

424
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:57,000
 And actually, now that I say that, I hadn't thought about that, it's quite likely, it's

425
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,120
 actually the most likely scenario, that something did appear as Maria, but it wouldn't have

426
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,800
 necessarily been Maria, right?

427
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,880
 Do you think Maria, I mean, we don't know if these guys were Mickey and Mallory Knox

428
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,440
 and they were going to murder anyone anyways, but I can't imagine Maria in the world of

429
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,000
 the dead would want this.

430
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,520
 So imagine that he does get the ritual right and Maria, quote unquote, "Maria" shows

431
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:25,760
 up, it's actually a demon in disguise and it's like, "Oh, I love you so much.

432
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,920
 You know what would make me love you even more?

433
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,920
 Continue this.

434
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,920
 I want to talk to you today.

435
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:36,600
 Oh, I want to be a part of your life, but you're going to have to keep killing people."

436
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:43,360
 And then in the end, when the noose is starting to tighten around his neck, when people are

437
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:50,240
 starting to suspect something's going on at this house, this Maria shows back up and says,

438
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,920
 "Oh, today, now it's time for you to join me.

439
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,880
 Now it's time for you to come to the other side and be with me."

440
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:03,920
 And he shoots himself, kills himself, leaving all of these questions unanswered.

441
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,480
 How many people did he kill?

442
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,920
 I guess that's really the only question.

443
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,920
 That would be the question that law enforcement would have.

444
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,640
 The fine question as a paranormal investigator would be, did it work?

445
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,640
 Did this ritual work?

446
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:20,200
 But again, even if it did work, we don't know whether or not it was actually Maria.

447
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,160
 Terrifying, terrifying story.

448
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,200
 And I'm surprised it doesn't happen more often.

449
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,640
 We covered that story recently that I feel really went under the radar.

450
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,120
 I'll put the episode in the show notes.

451
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:35,440
 I'm surprised sometimes by the stuff the paranormal community does not cover.

452
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,600
 There's a lot of stuff out there.

453
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,920
 I know they want to do an eight-part series on the Bermuda Triangle, but I'm shocked at

454
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:45,560
 some of the amazing things that come out of the world of paranormal that does not get

455
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,560
 covered.

456
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,640
 We covered this last season about this is 100% true.

457
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,120
 This guy is in trial.

458
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,920
 He's arrested right now.

459
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:58,200
 He murdered two women for winning lottery numbers.

460
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,880
 He made a deal with the devil.

461
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,420
 He wrote out this contract.

462
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,800
 This is not an urban legend.

463
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:09,920
 There's photos of the contract signed in blood by him saying, "I will kill two women every

464
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,640
 two months," or something like that to make this deal with the devil, or a particular

465
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,560
 demon is what it was.

466
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,880
 And it should be a huge true crime story as well.

467
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,160
 He hid in the bushes.

468
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,200
 There was like an outdoor late-night birthday party.

469
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,000
 And he hid in the bushes for a couple hours.

470
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,240
 And there's photos of the women.

471
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,040
 The two women stayed after the birthday party and they were having funds.

472
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:34,360
 And the camera was set on an automatic timer just snapping photos.

473
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,720
 And the second to last photo or whatever it was was them looking off into the distance

474
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,600
 because they saw this guy.

475
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,960
 How is this not a bigger paranormal story?

476
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,320
 He walked and he butchered these two women and dragged their bodies to the bushes and

477
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,120
 then thought that was going to give them winning lottery numbers.

478
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,280
 And when the police were investigating this, they found the contract to this demon saying,

479
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,720
 "I'm going to murder a woman every so often."

480
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,480
 And then there were some lottery tickets that were not winners, shockingly.

481
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,840
 I'm surprised that's not a bigger paranormal story, really.

482
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,480
 But we do have, this is why I love doing this show, because we get to talk about stuff that

483
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,000
 nobody else is talking about.

484
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,880
 But here we have stuff like that, right?

485
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,320
 People sacrificing lives for great riches and stuff like that.

486
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:24,160
 But this one, this guy killing people to talk to his wife, I'm shocked this doesn't happen

487
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,920
 more often, which makes me think it may.

488
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,000
 We just haven't found them yet.

489
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,640
 You can kill 100 hobos before anyone really figures out what's going on, especially if

490
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,800
 you're passing through areas.

491
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,520
 The world's a big place and there's a lot of people in it and a lot of people can disappear

492
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,600
 and nobody knows.

493
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,360
 Workers, migrants, stuff like that moving through areas.

494
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,800
 Maybe this does happen a lot and it's just not being covered.

495
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,080
 This story is from the 1890s and I had never heard about it.

496
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,440
 Well now, the story is 120 years old at this point, 130 years old.

497
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,000
 But if you live in this town, you can visit this museum.

498
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,320
 You can go and you can look at these human skulls and you can look at the place where

499
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,440
 he killed these people.

500
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:10,200
 You can go to Casa de Los Lamentos and obviously this place is considered haunted nowadays.

501
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,200
 Apparently, you can hear screaming late at night coming from the building, which at a

502
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,240
 certain point you would just stop.

503
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,640
 You would just stop sending cops in there.

504
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,160
 And first you would go, "Oh, we better go check out maybe the dude came back."

505
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,960
 He's still kidnapping people, but at a certain point you're like, "No, it's just the ghost

506
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,960
 of the dead.

507
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,560
 There's nothing we can do for them."

508
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:32,560
 Creepy, creepy story.

509
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:40,400
 And I'd say we pretty much know how this story ended by committing these horribly evil acts

510
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:45,720
 and then killing himself when he did join the world of the dead.

511
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,280
 Do you think Maria would embrace him?

512
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:56,360
 The real Maria, her spirit who's watching her husband commit these horrible crimes in

513
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:02,920
 her name and then watching this demon taking her form and going down and getting him to

514
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:08,320
 murder more people, assuming that hypothesis that I made up works, conspiracy cap fully

515
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,480
 on.

516
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,560
 What happens when he did kill himself and the real Maria is there?

517
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,840
 Would she forgive him?

518
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,240
 Would she accept him back into her arms?

519
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:25,840
 All these horrible things he did in her name was all of those sacrifices not only to appease

520
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:32,760
 a dark spirit, but each one actually pushed his true love further and further away from

521
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,760
 him.

522
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:42,600
 Till eventually he finds himself in a reality that he is locked in this hellish dimension.

523
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:48,200
 He performed all these black magic rituals and piece by piece his soul fell into the

524
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,560
 clutches of dark forces.

525
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:58,080
 So when he finally put that gun to his head and pulled the trigger, he saw Maria again,

526
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,480
 but she was unreachably far away.

527
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:11,600
 And he is now a servant, now a vassal, now a slave to the satanic forces he called upon.

528
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,880
 Had he continued to live out his life normally, never forgetting the love that he had for

529
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:26,800
 Maria, but moving on and not enslaving himself to this murder spree, he would have been with

530
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,440
 her again.

531
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:36,440
 They would have been apart for a short time on earth, but spent forever together.

532
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:41,680
 And his heart is shattered because he also knows he has brought eternal torment to Maria

533
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,180
 as well.

534
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:50,600
 Because while he is trapped in this pitch black reality of his own making, Maria watches

535
00:31:50,600 --> 00:32:05,720
 from heaven, weeping every day for the lover she will never hold again.

536
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,240
