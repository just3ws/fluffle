1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,040
 When a man leaping from a helicopter has a parachute malfunction, it's going to take

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,880
 an act of God to save him now.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,400
 And then we travel to Claremont, California to take a look at a bizarre haunting that

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,780
 makes us reevaluate what nature is.

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:22,440
 Is it possible we are living in a Grand Theft Auto game?

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:35,840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,840

 Let's go ahead and give a shout out to one of our newest Patreon supporters.

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,440
 Get them hands ready.

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,440
 We're going to be touching this.

15
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,440
 We're going to be touching it.

16
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,440
 He's like, no, no, please don't.

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,440
 I have a bad immune system.

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,440
 Everyone give a big round of applause.

19
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,440
 I have a bad immune system.

20
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,920
 Everyone give a big round of applause for a scared breakfast Rubik's Cube.

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,920
 Woohoo.

22
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,920
 Yeah, come on in.

23
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,920
 Come on in.

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,920
 You're like, why are we touching this guy?

25
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,680
 Because he's a Rubik's Cube, bro.

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,360
 We're like all trying to make all the colors fit.

27
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,720
 His arms are all getting mixed up.

28
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,720
 Rubik's Cube.

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,720
 Rubik's Cube.

30
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,720
 Rubik's Cube.

31
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,720
 You're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

32
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,960
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

33
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,960
 I do.

34
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,640
 It just helps spread the word about the show.

35
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,360
 That really, really helps out a lot.

36
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,360
 Rubik's Cube.

37
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,360
 Come on.

38
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,360
 Sit in my lap here.

39
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,360
 I'm going to be, I'm going to be handling you for the rest of the episode.

40
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,040
 You're like, no, no.

41
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,680
 Rubik's Cube, while I'm doing that, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,520
 Rabbit Dreadnaught, our battleship.

43
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,000
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,760
 We're sailing all the way out to the Soviet Union.

45
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,760
 The battleships go.

46
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,320
 I want a little skipper outfit.

47
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,520
 I'm going to dress up like Donald Duck.

48
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,800
 I always tell that joke.

49
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,960
 But I love, was Donald Duck actually in the Navy?

50
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,720
 Why does he wear that little outfit?

51
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,800
 But anyways, I'm walking around no pants and a blue shirt and I have Rubik's Cube.

52
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,800
 I keep touching him.

53
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,840
 We're headed back to the year 1974.

54
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,040
 And at this point, we're headed specifically to Ukraine, which was part of the Soviet Union

55
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,760
 in 1974.

56
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:16,160
 And we're going to the Lvov region of Ukraine.

57
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,600
 It's June 1974.

58
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,720
 It's a nice summer day.

59
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,360
 Sun is in the sky.

60
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,280
 Clouds are way high up there.

61
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,920
 You can't don't be thinking about me and no caribers.

62
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:32,280
 The reason why I'm kind of painting this picture is because we're about to have a mass witness

63
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,440
 event.

64
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,160
 You have people at all different levels.

65
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,200
 You're going to have people on the ground and you're going to have one guy in the sky

66
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,360
 who all saw the same thing on a pretty clear day.

67
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:51,400
 We're about to meet the Soviet Army Captain Alexander Alexandrov and he's sitting there

68
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,600
 in the helicopter and he has like on his helmet and his little little parachute thing.

69
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,580
 And he's sitting there and they're currently doing an airborne exercise.

70
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:06,720
 So what's going on is these helicopters are flying over the Lvov region and the Soviets

71
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,720
 are jumping out.

72
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,720
 I didn't know you the parachute out of a helicopter.

73
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,720
 Honestly.

74
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,720
 I know you can.

75
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,600
 The story is totally made up.

76
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,080
 People are like Jason you can't.

77
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,600
 I figure if you jump off you can parachute off a building.

78
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
 You can parachute off a cliff.

79
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,600
 I imagine as long as you don't open your parachute right underneath the rotors of the helicopter

80
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,360
 you're you're good.

81
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,280
 But anyways these helicopters are flying overhead and Captain Alexander is like okay guys let's

82
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,280
 go we're going to jump out of this helicopter.

83
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
 Wee!

84
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,880
 I don't actually think they're having fun.

85
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,760
 I think they probably were a little more professional than that.

86
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,760
 Anyways wee!

87
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,200
 He jumps out of the helicopter and he begins plummeting towards the earth.

88
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,800
 That's how it always starts.

89
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,600
 But then some other things are supposed to happen.

90
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:56,560
 He's falling down and he pulls his chute and it doesn't open properly.

91
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,440
 So it's like kind of like whins kind of getting it but he's still falling and he's like uh-oh.

92
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,720
 His chute won't activate.

93
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:11,880
 He's like okay don't worry just yet I have this automatic device that will trigger my

94
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,160
 backup chute.

95
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,660
 So I'll still not die.

96
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:21,680
 So he's plummeting towards earth and his backup device doesn't work either.

97
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:29,040
 When it pops it gets tangled up and then he's falling towards the planet.

98
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,640
 So if you guys ever read that story about the dude who got an occurrence on Al Creek

99
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:40,880
 Bridge where the guy is going to get hung by the Confederates and he's like not today

100
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,880
 and he jumps off the bridge and he's swimming away and like the Confederates are shooting

101
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,880
 at him.

102
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:51,400
 He's like swimming away and I remember reading it in college and he's like swimming and

103
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,400
 he like the fish when he's in the water the fish are kind of like waving to him.

104
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:01,000
 He's like hey fish and then he gets up on land and he sees like each grasshopper on

105
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,160
 a blade of grass and he's like what's up?

106
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,280
 The Confederates are so shooting at him.

107
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,800
 He's like hello grasshoppers how are your days?

108
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:15,040
 His world is super like detailed when he jumps off the bridge and he's like running through

109
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,280
 the grass and he's still being shot up by the Confederates.

110
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,320
 To be honest he might have been shot up by Union soldiers.

111
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,320
 I don't remember.

112
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,960
 I actually have been a Confederate but he's running and he sees like each blade of grass

113
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,440
 and there's like a ladybug on one like holding her children like shielding him from the gunfire

114
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,400
 and he sees like a squirrel like dropping all of his nuts and running away and he takes

115
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,320
 in every detail on this forest and he's running and he's running and the soldiers are after

116
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:47,120
 him and then he runs home which is why he might have been a Confederate.

117
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,800
 I think it was this giant palatial estate this antebellum estate.

118
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,080
 He's like finally I got home time to go see what my slaves are up to and he's running

119
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:03,920
 home and then he sees his wife and all of a sudden his lifeless body is swinging from

120
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:10,800
 the noose on Alcrete Bridge and it's not a spoiler warning.

121
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,440
 The story's about as old as the country of the United States.

122
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,200
 It's super old.

123
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:22,760
 What it was was that he died like and he imagined getting away and seeing his wife one more time

124
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:27,840
 and because we were in his imaginary world he everything was hyper realistic.

125
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,720
 The reason why I bring that up is cool story.

126
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,240
 It scared me as a kid.

127
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,280
 I was actually in college you know I was in my twenties I was like oh it's kind of creepy

128
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,200
 like how do you know like right now when I'm sitting here recording this podcast and having

129
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,720
 a blast you know everything's going really good.

130
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,400
 How do I know I'm actually not hanging from an oak tree somewhere.

131
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:54,640
 I know I'm actually not a Union soldier in 1862 and I'm dying and then I've imagined

132
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,640
 all of this stuff.

133
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,800
 So every so often I'll be sitting there and I'm like hey man things are really good what

134
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,600
 if I'm actually dead and this is just false memories.

135
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,200
 The reason why I bring that up the reason why that's not a that's not a segue coming

136
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,320
 out of nowhere is as he's falling towards earth I thought this was a really interesting

137
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,400
 detail.

138
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:20,920
 He sees the grass below him getting closer and closer and closer and then he sees he

139
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:29,320
 says in his narrative Alexander Captain Alexander's narrative he actually sees the mice start

140
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,920
 to run away from where he's going to impact.

141
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:39,200
 Now that's impossible even what I'm about to talk about is impossible because this is

142
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,440
 just starting off the story but to be plummeting towards earth and to actually see mice go

143
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,840
 "Ahh" and they're like running around and they're like you couldn't see that.

144
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:55,920
 You would have to be maybe what five to ten feet off the ground and he's not he's still

145
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:02,320
 very very high up but in his memory he had a hyper detailed hyper realistic view of what

146
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,320
 was going on.

147
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,480
 He could see the grass kind of blown in the wind you could see that but you couldn't see

148
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,720
 the detail of each blade of grass and you see in the little and also how would the mice

149
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,040
 know where he was going to land.

150
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,880
 Anyways that's not even the weirdest part of the story that's not the end of the story.

151
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,880
 As he's coming down and he sees this he sees all these mice running away from where he's

152
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:26,360
 about to impact all of a sudden he is jerked upwards.

153
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:33,120
 In an instant he is hovering in darkness he's floating through this impossible void which

154
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,400
 at what point you would think he would died right now you're kind of floating through

155
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:47,600
 this void and out of the darkness he sees these two giant hands appear and they grab

156
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,960
 his parachute and hold it open.

157
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:56,000
 Now this is the backup shoot it's still a little tangled but these hands grab the parachute

158
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:04,280
 and actually pull it enough in such a way that he begins to slowly descend.

159
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:12,160
 At this point he sees there's this giant what he described as a man shaped alien and the

160
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,040
 reason why he thought it was an alien were in the year 1974 so we're past Roswell we're

161
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,120
 past all of the science fiction movies and things like that you kind of have an idea

162
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,640
 that this guy might be an alien because he's wearing a space suit.

163
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:33,720
 He has a transparent globe like helmet like you would imagine a cosmonaut to be wearing

164
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:40,240
 and he had these large glowing eyes that had this very solemn look he was just staring

165
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,200
 at Captain Alexander and yeah he goes this guy was huge he's very broad shoulder had

166
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,960
 these giant hands that were holding up my parachute and he had like a he had the transparent

167
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:56,480
 helmet on and then he had a transparent cloak that hung off the back the rest of him he was

168
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:03,680
 wearing a very tight fitting suit with a triangular device near its neck with little blinking lights.

169
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,200
 At this point Alexander is out of the void he's actually now back into the blue skies

170
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:16,400
 of the world and this creature is holding up this parachute and they're both slowly

171
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:26,920
 descending and he feels one of the hands kind of start to rub along the back of his neck

172
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:33,200
 and he realizes that it's trying to completely untangle the parachute because right now he

173
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,760
 slowed his descent but it needs to actually be functional and then all of a sudden the

174
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:44,560
 whole parachute opens completely and Captain Alexander slowly descends to the ground and

175
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,000
 then makes a successful landing.

176
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,560
 The alien is now or whatever this thing was like who knows I mean it has a space suit

177
00:10:52,560 --> 00:11:00,880
 imagine it comes from space right but the alien is now standing in front of Alexander

178
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:07,720
 and the alien waves to the captain and says something in a unknown language he didn't

179
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:13,240
 know Captain Alexander couldn't make sense of what he said then the creature with the

180
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:23,920
 space suit flies away out into the clouds fly just goes wise way.

181
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,720
 What's interesting I mean the story itself is interesting but this was a mass event you

182
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,560
 had a bunch of other soldiers who were already out this was a military exercise did I say

183
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,360
 that in the beginning this wasn't a battle or anything like that this was a military

184
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:42,560
 exercise so you had a bunch of military observers on the ground you had locals coming out there

185
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,520
 to watch you what else are you going to do in 1974 in Ukraine you had a bunch of locals

186
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,080
 out there to watch everyone jump from these helicopters there was a lot of people who

187
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:56,080
 saw this and when they run up to Alexander they're like who was that so it's not like

188
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,080
 they saw his parachute get tangled up and then there was a miracle and it opened they

189
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:06,520
 saw the man with the giant hands floating next to him and fixing the parachute and then

190
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:12,440
 flying away they knew what happened they were wondering who that guy was and obviously he

191
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:19,420
 didn't have an answer for that but we might we might have an answer all these years later

192
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,480
 I've talked a lot about guardian angels on this show and I've questioned whether or not

193
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:29,120
 they are us from the future because some people are shaved by older versions of themselves

194
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,440
 when they're in horrible events I'll put those episodes in the show notes those are so fascinating

195
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,480
 to me who are the guardian angels and why doesn't everyone seem to have one and I'm

196
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:43,080
 thinking maybe it's because people in the future if a future you has access to a time

197
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,840
 machine they can do that but if a future you doesn't have access to a time machine you're

198
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,920
 going to get flattened by the steamroller you're going to fall off the cliff your parachute

199
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:58,000
 is not going to open well this alien said something in an unknown language but Alexander

200
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,760
 said that I didn't really understand what he was saying but it sounded like he said

201
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:14,280
 the words papa so is it possible we have a couple of options here one that there's an

202
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:19,320
 alien language where one of their words sounds like papa which might mean like you're welcome

203
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:26,160
 or something like that or you get better technology or this was a time traveler from the future

204
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,480
 this was captain Alexander so funny if it turns out that this guy actually did have

205
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,520
 a kid with giant eyeballs and they're like sir your kid he's allergic to everything

206
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,280
 so he's going to have to live in this bubble he's going to have to be in this suit and

207
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:44,600
 we're going to put this bubble helmet on him and captain's like oh man I got one of those

208
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,960
 kids I got one of those needy kids and the kids like rolling around in a bubble and who

209
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:56,320
 knows if that happened but is it possible that this was an alien or an angel right saving

210
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,760
 him or is it a future version of one of his descendants coming down and being like dude

211
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:07,520
 if you don't make it I don't make it the boy in the bubble needs to be alive so they go

212
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,480
 back in time they say I don't know that's just the theory the story itself is fascinating

213
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,040
 even without the time travel thing but and I got this from thinkaboutadox.com one of

214
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:24,680
 my favorite websites and they got it from a article called unknown world and that was

215
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:30,800
 written by Anton Anfalov in Karkov Ukraine number 28 is published back in 2001 we've

216
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:37,760
 come across that that name before Anton Anfalov UFO researcher so absolutely fascinating

217
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,480
 story he was saved he would have died there on the spot and almost felt like his mind

218
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,920
 was preparing him for that he was beginning to experience that hyper realization hyper

219
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:53,520
 reality view of the world but he survived and dozens of people saw this event as well

220
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,920
 very very bizarre story Rubik's Cube let's go ahead and give you the keys to the carbon

221
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:04,800
 or copter we are leaving behind Ukraine we are headed all the way out to Claremont

222
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:11,280
 California another one of my favorite websites I go to all the

223
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:17,280
 time is the shadowlands.net it's just a repository of ghost stories the same way that think about

224
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:22,960
 it docs.com is a repository of UFO stories very very fascinating I'll sit there and

225
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,680
 read it just read read read on my off time which I have no off time it's basically work

226
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,280
 work for the show but I do enjoy it we're headed to Claremont California specifically

227
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:38,080
 we're going to Thompson Creek and Thompson Creek is a place that's pretty well known

228
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,400
 to be haunted is one of those places when I find something on shadowlands.net the very

229
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,200
 first thing I do is try to verify it as best as I can are there local news stories regarding

230
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,800
 it are other people talking about ghosts in the area there's a lot of stuff I find on

231
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:58,600
 shadowlands.net that I only find there and it has to be an exceptionally good ghost story

232
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,200
 for me to report it if there's only that one source when we talk about a place like Claremont

233
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:09,320
 California when we talk about a place like this Mission San Xavier Del Boc or Nettleton

234
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:14,200
 High all these places have multiple ghost reportings but I find them on shadowlands.net

235
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:20,920
 first this is one of those places that when you go to there's a website that reviews haunted

236
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:26,160
 places there's a comment section so people talk about their own experiences and they'll

237
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,160
 rate it and stuff like that and so I start finding a ton of stuff about Thompson Creek

238
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,520
 in Claremont California so it's and there's YouTube videos of people walking around here

239
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:41,800
 it's very very well known in the area to not be a fun place to be it's a there's a creek

240
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:47,140
 according to the YouTube video I watched there's like you know a goalie there's like hills on

241
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:51,640
 both sides this guy's walking around and he's like yeah there's a lot of reports of not

242
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:57,560
 only ghosts out here but like satanic activity like people say don't be here after dark and

243
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:02,400
 it's not like don't be here after dark because there's a security guard it's don't be here

244
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:07,200
 after dark because something bad might happen to you again not just ghosts but physical

245
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:15,360
 harm coming to you but let's look at the ghosts side of this first off because the area is

246
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:23,120
 just considered to be cursed it has phenomenon like the trees bleed apparently the trees

247
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:29,000
 bleed blood not sap blood so you go out there and you see a tree and it's all like red and

248
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,680
 bloody and stuff you're like no no this is what you came here for you're looking for

249
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,080
 a ghost and stuff like that you're like yeah that's too much people say part of the legends

250
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:44,560
 that trees bleed one of the things I noted on hundredplaces.org there was a guy named

251
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:51,920
 Michael M and said it's a eucalyptus tree and I guess eucalyptus tree has red sap so what's

252
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,600
 interesting about that is even though that was debunked it shows that the phenomenon

253
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,680
 itself is true the observable phenomenon people for years have been saying the trees

254
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:05,120
 bleed people who know stuff about trees go oh no no that's totally normal however there's

255
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,960
 also a rumor that the cabins there's cabins in the area those also bleed I don't know

256
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,760
 if they're made out of eucalyptus trees cabins just built yesterday from eucalyptus trees

257
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,880
 but you have stories of the cabins in the area themselves bleeding lots of stories about

258
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:25,080
 shadow people walking through this area it's fairly remote right it's not like you're I

259
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,480
 mean there are cabins but it's not like that you turn a left and there's a 7-11 right there

260
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,400
 so it's not a place you would want to be whether there's real life st worshippers or shadow

261
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,080
 people following you around we've covered shadow people a lot on this podcast it's a

262
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,360
 real phenomenon I mean if you believe in the paranormal it's definitely as real as a ghost

263
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:48,800
 or a alien or UFO then we look at stuff this is interesting because you you this is where

264
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:56,280
 I'm kind of like apparently if you're walking through this area every so often you look up

265
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:02,360
 keep looking up no no no pass the ridge keep looking up into the sky and there's a cloud

266
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:14,840
 in the shape of a skull floating through the sky I don't I don't know maybe like that that's

267
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,840
 something I mean it would really have to be shaped like a school for me notice right it

268
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,960
 has like chattering teeth it's like the evil dead skull and the eyeballs are so moving

269
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,360
 I mean clouds look like a lot of stuff I don't know if I would even register that so either

270
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:36,120
 it does exactly look like a skull or it's interesting because people are already scared of this

271
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:43,240
 area things are really starting to just kind of but again if the if the cabins are bleeding

272
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,320
 you have to worry about the clouds you're like oh and you won't believe it there's a

273
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,080
 cloud that looks like a giant cat there's a bunch of clouds up there clouds look like

274
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,680
 everything what are you even doing looking up that high right I'd be like looking down

275
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,280
 looking for mice looking for mice if I see them in a hyper realistic way I'm about to

276
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:06,920
 die clouds in the shape of skulls a sense of being followed but the reason why I wanted

277
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:11,520
 to talk about this that's all interesting there's kind of reports about hauntings in

278
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:17,800
 this area the reason why I wanted to cover it though was the weirdest phenomenon we're

279
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,880
 used to ghosts right we talk a lot about ghosts talk a lot about demons shadow people stuff

280
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:30,800
 like that there are parts of the area there's parts of Thompson Creek that have invisible

281
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:39,760
 walls and you can't pass through them so you'll be walking through this creek and you'll go

282
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,320
 you know I want to take a left here I want to go look into these shrubs and you will

283
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,040
 be repelled by a force it's just like walking into a wall but you can't see it's an invisible

284
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:56,360
 wall we don't have any firsthand reports at least that I could find of that that is a

285
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:02,080
 detail that is talked about on just a few of the the ghost websites that I was checking

286
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:13,360
 but the idea of a invisible wall immediately brings into mind video games like the invisible

287
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,360
 wall is something that has plagued open world video games forever until people just said

288
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:26,080
 let's put the game on an island and possibly large ocean like Grand Theft Auto invisible

289
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,240
 walls you'd put up invisible walls really not even in open world games Halo would have

290
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,760
 these things right invisible walls the idea of an invisible wall immediately brings to

291
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:44,360
 mind video games and so when I read this I thought is this the border of reality now

292
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,080
 there's two ways to look at it three ways one that it doesn't exist and it's just you

293
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,280
 know a made-up ghost story but there's two other more interesting ways to look at it

294
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:58,360
 one that it is some sort of mystical barrier that's been put up there's something on the

295
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:04,760
 other side of that barrier that doesn't want you over there and is strong enough to put

296
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:10,200
 up a wall like this because I'm sure there's a lot of demons and ghosts and shadow people

297
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:16,320
 that don't want you going to a certain location but to be able to warp reality to the point

298
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:23,320
 where someone can't pass through it that's pretty rare that's actually pretty rare that's

299
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,920
 something we've been covering a lot on this show is the very very more rare phenomenon

300
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:34,800
 right you have this invisible wall there do you have these invisible walls to protect

301
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:41,240
 some other sort of creature or reality or something like that out there right you have

302
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,680
 that take a lot of power takes a lot of it doesn't take a lot of power to make it so

303
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,880
 you can't speak sound waves you can get a good pair of headphones and make it so you can't

304
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:55,080
 hear someone I personally encountered ghosts that have muffled my voice but that episode

305
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:00,040
 in the show notes and imitated my voice that's the same episode of that show notes that's

306
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:04,960
 pretty easy hallucinations are pretty easy it's pretty easy to fool the census a ghost

307
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:12,120
 makes you taste disgusting stuff you're like oh no not boiled peanuts again you the census

308
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,960
 seem to be fairly easy to trick hearing things that aren't there seeing things that aren't

309
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:22,480
 there but to physically stop a human body from walking I I'm sure I've run across the

310
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,160
 world before but I nothing pops in my mind of someone reaching a location and they can't

311
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,840
 get past it we did that story a long time ago where the people at the 3m factory accidentally

312
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:39,000
 made a force field where the fly flew in between these two big spools and it got stuck that

313
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,680
 was a good episode off of that one of the sound that's an old one I love that story

314
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:48,680
 but missed you know it was an accident and then the the manager of the warehouse said

315
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:54,040
 oh we'll fix it we'll fix this force field and then and then it doesn't work there anymore

316
00:23:54,040 --> 00:24:02,000
 but going back to this one it could be mystical or it could be the edge of reality it could

317
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,480
 be the end of where we can go and you go well Jason you can backtrack obviously it's not

318
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,800
 like you're like well I guess we can't go to Disneyland anymore it's on the other side

319
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:17,080
 of this invisible wall you can obviously backtrack and then you know go 30 feet down the creek

320
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,760
 and then cross the shrubbery and then go up on the hill and then walk behind it so it's

321
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:25,080
 not really the end of the world but just like how you can glitch out a video game just like

322
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,800
 how there'll be a mountain range in Halo you can jump jump jump up the mountain range and

323
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:34,760
 do like grenade launches or whatever and keep throwing yourself up you still you get around

324
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,840
 the invisible wall but it doesn't mean the invisible wall didn't exist in the first place

325
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:45,120
 now you're just on a different side of it we see the world in very 3d or really 4d terms

326
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:54,040
 right but that's not the way anything works the now I'm getting real deep but just because

327
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,800
 you can walk around the wall just because you can bypass the wall taken a long path

328
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:03,760
 that doesn't mean that that's still not the edge of reality we imagine reality is like

329
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,600
 a plane between two points and then you have the three dimensions and the fourth dimension

330
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:16,880
 time and all of this stuff but that's not even close to what reality is we have all

331
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:23,680
 these other quantum level things going on and and you know so just because you can backtrack

332
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:28,120
 and walk around the wall still doesn't mean that if you could if the differences is like

333
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,920
 I said you can grenade hop through video games and get up over the mountain range and maybe

334
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:40,400
 see an area that the developers did but you can't pierce that wall like you can't go past

335
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,240
 that wall that has been created you can hack your way through which goes all the way back

336
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:50,120
 to our episode of things like Michigan blue hell which is the idea that there is a warehouse

337
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:55,280
 in Michigan I think it was episode like 14 that you can clip through reality and no one's

338
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:01,240
 been able to find that building it's an urban legend and they go there's a building somewhere

339
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:09,880
 in Michigan where you can clip through reality we know where this is this isn't oh somewhere

340
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:18,080
 in the state of Michigan this is Thompson Creek I mean you could literally probably spend

341
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,720
 a good summer just hiking this area and find this wall maybe not even a summer I again I

342
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,800
 don't know how big the geographical area is people go there a lot it's popular hiking

343
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:38,040
 area during the day but you could find this wall and you could prove this if it's really

344
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:41,960
 there you could prove it now there could be other things like it's only there during certain

345
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:47,880
 times which would make it more mystical right if it's always there it would be something

346
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:54,260
 in the real world and would be guided by scientific even if it's unknown scientific loss if it's

347
00:26:54,260 --> 00:27:01,520
 only there during say the winter solstice or only there on Sam Hain then it's mystical

348
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,920
 then it's a mystical force I would put my money on that because it's definitely keeping

349
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:12,720
 unwanted eyes out of that area but really we're quibbling over nothing if there is an invisible

350
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:19,600
 wall whether there is a powerful force creating that wall to keep people out or it's showing

351
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:25,860
 us that yes reality may be a simulation it may be that invisible border that the developers

352
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:32,300
 created and we can't get past either way it's an absolutely astonishing phenomenon and it

353
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:38,060
 begs the question you know this is a popular area for people to hike down do these walls

354
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:45,420
 exist in other areas that people never go to or people go to so rarely there's whole portions

355
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:49,100
 of the United States I know I get people get upset when I say this but there's whole portions

356
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:55,000
 of the United States have not been fully mapped we have not had a person walk across every

357
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:01,600
 square foot of the United States I would I honestly think it's possible that somewhere

358
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,360
 in the United States there is okay this is kind of so ridiculous but there is a hidden

359
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:11,840
 group of like pilgrims so who knows where these and that's just talking about the United

360
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:18,280
 States right who knows if there are other borders out there like this and we can actually see

361
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:23,740
 like this is the end we can't get past the sure we can walk around it but with the way

362
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:28,900
 the quantum nature of the universe it's still this is the border and could you imagine if

363
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:34,100
 we can map them out I mean now I'm going full on speculative sci-fi imagine if you could

364
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,620
 say like here's this invisible border and here's this and it's almost like if you crumbled

365
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:41,820
 up a piece of paper all the lines would match when you flattened it out it would just look

366
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:47,000
 like chaos but when it's crumpled it makes sense you could see where this line connects

367
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,500
 to this line and this line I don't know fascinating phenomenon is it mystical in nature is it

368
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:59,700
 a natural phenomenon which would show that the universe is nowhere near as orderly and

369
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:06,820
 clean as we think it may be either way either way actually now the thing about the areas

370
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:11,540
 has a lot of hauntings right you could have this feeling of being watched and shot away

371
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:17,080
 figures because this is the edge of reality things are passing in and out of it fascinating

372
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:23,840
 story and if you live in the Claremont California area maybe go check out if you can find the

373
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:33,200
 edge of the world we have no idea what's out there even just 10 20 miles from established

374
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:38,520
 cities you don't have to go deep into the Death Valley or into the heart of the Amazon

375
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:45,540
 these places are next to human civilizations is the edge of the world or one of the edges

376
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:55,020
 of the world in Claremont California and if that is the case what happens if you try to

377
00:29:55,020 --> 00:30:04,340
 glitch out of it what happens if you try to hack the game to see what's on the other side

378
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:12,600
 of this border would you fall into a Michigan blue hell type scenario you go past the wall

379
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:19,000
 and just fall into an infinite void or could your adventurous spirit actually do even more

380
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:26,720
 damage as you push through that barrier you just don't hack your way through it you crash

381
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:34,080
 the game you thought you were gonna have an adventurous ghost story in Thompson Creek

382
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:41,720
 you thought you were gonna come back and post on YouTube how you found the invisible wall

383
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:51,460
 but instead because you pushed past what is reality you crashed the game and deleted the

384
00:30:51,460 --> 00:31:12,120
 universe.

385
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,120
 you

386
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,120
 you

387
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,120
 you

388
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,120
 you

389
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,120
 you

390
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,120
 you

391
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,120
 you

392
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,120
 you

393
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,700
