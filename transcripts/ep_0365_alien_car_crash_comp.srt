1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Everybody wishes they could see into an alternate reality.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 But what if I told you there are some people who actually can?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Then today is the start of a new segment.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 A little segment I would like to call 1988.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 We'll see how it goes.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 And then we travel to India to meet a man who on the surface seemed to love his family very much.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 But when he meets the ghost of his father, he realizes that demons are attacking the family

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 and there's only one way that he can stop the madness.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 [Music]

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 I'm having a great day.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Hope you guys are having a great weekend.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 You know what?

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 I didn't announce this in the beginning, but let me say this now.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 I know I have a lot of listeners who are younger than me.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 I know I have a lot of listeners in the United States.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Take this to the bank guys.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 We are, this is not World War III.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 We will not, this is not going to be, you're not going to get drafted,

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 quit panicking about World War III.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 And let me tell you this, a lot of people online, I guess in life in general,

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 but a lot of people in entertainment, a lot of people online don't like to talk about their age.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 I'm very upfront about it.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Very upfront about my age.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 I do it for a particular reason.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 It gives me a little bit more weight when I talk about issues like this.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 I'm 43 years old.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 I have lived through so many worries about getting drafted.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Once I was out of high school, Clinton, Bill Clinton was talking about putting troops in Kosovo.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 He's concerned about that.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Obviously we had, ish, my older brother had a worry about the first Gulf War.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 I was worried about the second Gulf War.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 I actually went to enlist, but I was too fat.

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 But you have these things, people are going to freak out about them.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 We may go to war with Iran.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Don't get me wrong, but I don't even think that's going to happen.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Iran has a whole host of issues.

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Their economy's falling apart.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 They're having protests.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 You think the Hong Kong protests are rough.

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 We see those.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 There's protests going on in Iran that's not even getting out.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 They constantly have to keep shutting off their internet to prevent the protests.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 The government's on its last leg.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 That may make them want to start a war to divert attention from how crippled their government is.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 But the idea of a world war breaking out because Iran is absolute nonsense.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 They have almost no allies.

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 They might be able to count on Russia.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 But even then, Russia has bigger things to do.

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 China wants nothing to do with them.

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 China's putting all their money in Africa, building up that continent.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 I know you guys just want to hear a ghost story, but just to let you guys know,

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 don't freak out about getting drafted.

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Also, the US Army, if you are getting drafted, there are troops landing on our soil.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 The US military loves a volunteer army.

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 You get the best of the best.

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 When you're randomly drafting in hundreds of thousands of people,

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 you may get some cool people who normally wouldn't join the army.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 But for the most part, modern armies do not use the draft.

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 So don't worry about the draft.

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Spend this time not worrying is basically what I'm saying.

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Because I saw that trending.

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 I saw World War 3 trending and I was like, "Why? What?"

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 "Oh yeah, the Iran thing. Yeah, these kids think this is the end of the world. Don't worry about it."

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 "We may put troops over there. There may be a shooting war in Iraq."

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 "Maybe us and Saudi Arabia and Israel versus Iran."

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 "Maybe. Maybe that'll happen."

71
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 But I don't even think that'll happen.

72
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 But don't worry about it. You're not going to get drafted and nothing like that.

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Let's go ahead though, now that you are at peace,

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 now that big Papa Jason is giving you a little bit of peace,

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 let's move on to our next real story.

76
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 That wasn't even a story. There's this thing about it over the weekend.

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 I was like, "All these young people out there are so afraid."

78
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 "I've been through a hundred of these things in my lifetime."

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 "I grew up thinking nukes are going to fall at any moment."

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 "I know that school shootings are a thing and I know that people driving trucks through crowds of people are a thing."

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 "And those are both awful things."

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 "But I spent my entire childhood imagining nuclear annihilation at any moment."

83
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 "And it didn't happen."

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 "Or it might have in an alternate reality."

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 "Ooh, that's a good segue."

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 So, I said there are some people who can see in alternate realities and I believe that.

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 I believe actors, this is going to be weird.

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Actors who don't get cast in movies can actually see what their life would have been like if a different path had been taken.

89
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 So let me preface this with this and this is going to be really short.

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 I'm a pop star, you're a pop star.

91
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 I'm Britney Spears, you're Christina Aguilera.

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Our styles are different enough that if your career takes off and mine doesn't,

93
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 you're not really going to go, "Oh, if only I had sang 'Hit Me Baby' one more time."

94
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 It's different with musicians.

95
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Same thing with authors.

96
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 If I'm writing gothic fantasy novels and you're Stephanie Meyer and you write Twilight,

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 it's hard for me to say, "Oh, that should have been me."

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 I mean, you can say that, but the writing style is different, stories are different, things like that.

99
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 As an actor, you are basically a movable piece that's put into a puzzle.

100
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 You already got the producers and the directors and the set designers and the script writers and all this stuff,

101
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 the orchestra and everything.

102
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 They just need you to doop, stick you in.

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 Now, your interpretation of the character may be different than other people.

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 That's why we have an audition process.

105
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 But for the most part, you're a cog in a machine, more than any other art form.

106
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 A painter paints.

107
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 An actor does what somebody tells them to do and shuts up when they're supposed to shut up.

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 You are the paintbrush, not the painter as an actor.

109
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 And I'm an actor, I can say that.

110
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 So as an actor, because you're such a movable piece, it's so weird.

111
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Think about this for a second.

112
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 You can actually see into alternate realities.

113
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Doug Ray Scott was a young actor.

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 He's still alive.

115
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 He's still probably young, I don't know.

116
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 But Doug Ray Scott is an actor as of recording this podcast.

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 And back in 2019, 1999, he was given a choice.

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 He was given a choice between two movies.

119
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 He was given a choice between being in the Patriot with Mel Gibson,

120
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 a big blockbuster film with one of the biggest stars of the time,

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 or an independent kind of independent film made by a director who'd made one or two movies beforehand

122
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 with a pretty much no-name cast, two big stars, but not super big stars, genre stars.

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 A little movie called X-Men.

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 So you're going to play a character named Wolverine,

125
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 some guy running around in tights with claws, you're going to have claws come out of your hand,

126
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 and a Pac-Man was going to be there.

127
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 She had done some movie about geese or something like that.

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Patrick Stewart, you know, the guy from Star Trek.

129
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Yeah, yeah, the bald dude, he's in that.

130
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Ian McKellen, yeah, I don't know who he is.

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Apparently some big British actor or something like that.

132
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 There's just a bunch of no-buddies.

133
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 You can do that movie, you know, run around in tights.

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 It'll be like that movie with the black dude, I think it was Blade or something like that.

135
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Yeah, I made money, but you know,

136
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 you can do this movie called X-Man, or X-Men, whatever it is,

137
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 or you can do this movie with Mel Gibson.

138
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Doug Ray Scott, obviously, chose to do X-Men,

139
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 and he went on to become one of a big Doug Ray Scott as an A-list actor.

140
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 He's still making movies today.

141
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 He did that musical, The Greatest Showman,

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 but in an alternate reality he did.

143
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 That's what's so weird, so he decides in our reality,

144
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 in Earth 616, he goes to do the movie I just said.

145
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 I don't remember the Patriot, I went and saw it at the theater.

146
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 It's hilarious, so bad.

147
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Such a bad movie, sorry Mel.

148
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 But then you get this little guy, no-name actor from Australia,

149
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 and Hugh Jackman does it.

150
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 A-list actor now.

151
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Sexiest man alive, multiple times,

152
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 and he's only been alive once, so that's quite the achievement.

153
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 You can actually see that twist, that's so weird to me.

154
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Glenn Howerton, it's always sending in Philadelphia, Dennis.

155
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 He was up for the role, he was one of the last four people

156
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 during the audition process for Star-Lord in Guardians of the Galaxy,

157
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 against another guy coming off of a cult sitcom.

158
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Parks and Rec wasn't a huge hit, it's always sending in Philadelphia.

159
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Four superior sitcom in my opinion, I don't mean to get political

160
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 because I know I just lost as much viewers by saying that.

161
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 I do love Parks and Rec, but it's always sunny, I feel,

162
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 as a better constructed sitcom.

163
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 You can listen to my other podcast about that.

164
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 He's up for it against someone basically at the same level of fame and talent.

165
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Chris Pratt's a good guy, and Chris Pratt gets it.

166
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 So they're both starting off equal, and then Chris Pratt gets Star-Lord

167
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 and goes on to do Jurassic World.

168
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 They're talking about him being like an Indiana Jones reboot,

169
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 which I think would be a really good idea.

170
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 He's doing the Kids Choice Awards and all this stuff,

171
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 and Glenn Howerton has to just be sitting there with his head in his hands

172
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 going, "What happened? What happened?

173
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 My life could have been that. I could have been at Kids Choice Awards.

174
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 I could have had a surfboard."

175
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 That's so weird.

176
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 I honestly think it would mess with your head, actually.

177
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 If you were an actor and you lost to a big role like that

178
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 and you saw someone's life and career change.

179
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 Now, Glenn Howerton and Doug Ray Scott, they're not nobody's.

180
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 I mean, you may not know who they are, but they're still acting.

181
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 They're still doing television shows.

182
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 They're talking to Lana about this, and she says,

183
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 "Some people aren't chasing the fame. Some people aren't trying to be successful."

184
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 But maybe.

185
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 But when your choice is, "I'm now doing Seal Team 6 on CBS,"

186
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 or, "I could be headlining these big, giant movies,"

187
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 and be a famous actor,

188
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 I think most people are going to pick the famous actor.

189
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 I think that would really mess with your head.

190
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 I actually have a close friend of mine. I'm not going to say who it is,

191
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 but really close friend of mine.

192
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 She auditioned for this Honda ad, this nationwide Honda ad.

193
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 It wasn't just one ad. It was an advertising campaign.

194
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 She would have made bank.

195
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 You want to make money as an actor. You do ads, because you get paid.

196
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Every single time that ad is shown, it would have changed her life.

197
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 So you know where this story is going.

198
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 It was down to her and another girl, and she didn't get it.

199
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 She didn't get it.

200
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 She has all sorts of theories in her head why she didn't get it,

201
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 but the other girl got it, and then she ended up going on to do the Bachelorette.

202
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 Not a life-changing thing to be the star of a ABC reality show,

203
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 but it is would be life-changing, actually.

204
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 So my friend can actually look and go,

205
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 "I could have been handing out roses on this chlamydia-filled reality show,

206
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 but no, instead I'm friends with Jason,"

207
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 which I must say is much more fun,

208
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 and you have a 0% chance of catching chlamydia from me,

209
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 because we don't sleep together.

210
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 I am rife with sexually transmitted diseases.

211
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

212
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Now, our next story, I've talked about this before.

213
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 I found a website that lists UFO sightings,

214
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 UFO encounters, by year.

215
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 And I started off in the year 1988,

216
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 because I recently did a story about reptile aliens going into a girl's dorm at a college,

217
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 and that's where I found that story.

218
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 And I found a bunch of them.

219
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 A lot of them are really short, and there's really no extra information,

220
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 but I think we're going to be doing an occasional new segment called 1988,

221
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 because there's a lot of weird stuff happening during 1988.

222
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 And this is the first one.

223
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 It's January 1988.

224
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 It's Washington, D.C.

225
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 It's two in the morning.

226
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 These two women are driving down the road.

227
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 [humming]

228
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 Apparently they're driving to a wedding.

229
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 They're listening to the wedding song as they're driving.

230
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 They're like, "Oh, I can't wait till they play this song.

231
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 It's my favorite song."

232
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 They're driving down the road.

233
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 It's 2 a.m.

234
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 They see in the middle of the road, they see like a six car pile-up.

235
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Now, when I was a kid, I thought when car, when they'd say like a 20 car pile-up,

236
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 I thought it was like an actual pile.

237
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 I could never figure out how cars got up that high.

238
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 And then someone goes, "No, you idiot."

239
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 It just means like 20 cars rammed into each other.

240
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 But anyways, that's what's going on.

241
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 They're driving, and they see in the middle of this intersection,

242
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 they see a six car pile-up.

243
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 It's 2 a.m.

244
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 There's no one in any of the vehicles.

245
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 There's no medical personnel around, no fire engines, nothing.

246
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 It's just a normal intersection.

247
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 They're not in the middle of nowhere, but they haven't been to this side of the city before.

248
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 So they're not out in BFE.

249
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 They're in Washington, D.C.

250
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Six cars completely empty, but they've all wrecked.

251
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 They started to feel weird about it, and they just slowly drove away.

252
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 But over time, these two women would be like, "Isn't it weird that night when we were driving?"

253
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Like, it stuck with them.

254
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 It was such a weird experience to stumble across this,

255
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 and there's no one in the car, there's just six cars wrecked,

256
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 and it's just desolate street.

257
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 One of the women eventually gets it in her head to get hypnotized.

258
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 They'd have a regression therapy figure out what happened.

259
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 During hypnosis, which again, take this with a grain of salt,

260
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 because hypnosis can either be completely accurate,

261
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 or the person could totally be making it up.

262
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 One, the story could be made up to the hypnosis person.

263
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 The hypnotist, is the word I'm looking for, could implant the story in the person,

264
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 but we'll assume for the sake of entertainment value that this story is true.

265
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 It definitely was true when it was reported in a UFO journal,

266
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 and it's in the show notes below as well.

267
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 This woman, this is what is revealed during hypnosis.

268
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 The car stopped in the middle of the street in Washington, D.C.

269
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Both her and her passenger are completely frozen,

270
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 and some great aliens are now standing in the middle of the street.

271
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 She's just staring at them.

272
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 They walk over to her, open the car door,

273
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 and so with the cribkeeper's car, they pull out the driver,

274
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 put her in some sort of bubble,

275
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 and then lift her up into a ship floating over the city street.

276
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 Up there, they begin doing medical examinations on her,

277
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 and then they tell her,

278
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 "You're only going to remember one thing about this.

279
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 You're only going to remember a six-car pileup."

280
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 I think this story is creepy because...

281
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Let's assume that it's true again.

282
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 I think it's creepy because how mundane it is.

283
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Right?

284
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 Like, how many times have you been walking down the street

285
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 and you've seen something odd?

286
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Maybe not a six-car pileup.

287
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 I don't know why six cars, I don't know why a pileup.

288
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 I don't know why the aliens wanted them to remember anything.

289
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Maybe it's because they...

290
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Actually, this is interesting.

291
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Maybe the aliens have started to queue on the whole idea of lost time.

292
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Aliens abduct you for four hours and then drop you back down.

293
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Dude, I just blow my mind now that I'm thinking about this.

294
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Aliens abduct you for four hours, right?

295
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 And they drop you back down.

296
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 And to you, five minutes have passed,

297
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 and then you get home and people are like,

298
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 "Dude, where were you? You were supposed to be home four hours ago."

299
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 And you're like, "Ugh."

300
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 Maybe the aliens have figured out.

301
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Wait a second.

302
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 We beam them up, we work on them for four hours,

303
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 then we implant them, they saw them in in black,

304
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 and they're like, "Oh, dude, that's a good idea.

305
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 We should learn to implant memories."

306
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 We abduct them for amount of time,

307
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 and then we put a false memory into them,

308
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 not just trap magically putting them back on Earth,

309
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 but make them go to the circus for four hours.

310
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 And that way, when they go home,

311
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 they're like, "Where were you? I was at the circus."

312
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 And they're like, "Dude, it's two in the morning.

313
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 What circus is it two in the morning?"

314
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 And your answer would be the best damn circus ever.

315
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 But I wonder if they have 24-hour circuses.

316
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Don't go to one.

317
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Those are only in horror movies.

318
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 When you go in the fairgrounds open at 3 a.m.,

319
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 I would be so dope, dude, I would totally go.

320
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 I would go, you don't go, only I can have fun.

321
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 I'm like, "Weee!"

322
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 On the ferris wheel all by myself.

323
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 You're like, "Come on, let me go."

324
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 I'm like, "No, dude, it's too spooky. It's super spooky.

325
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 I think there's a guy with a knife up here."

326
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 You're like, "No, I can totally see there's not a knife."

327
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 I'm going around.

328
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 I can't hear you on the ferris wheel.

329
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 You have to climb up it like that dude in the notebook.

330
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Anyways, that was okay.

331
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 Now you're proposing to me.

332
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 I'm like, "Oh, a hero."

333
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 And then we outrun an evil clown.

334
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 But the point is that whole bizarre fantasy aside,

335
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 the point is this, is that what if they've whized up?

336
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 Now they know how to fight time loss by creating new memories in you.

337
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Actually, originally I thought it was creepy because

338
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 there's a lot of times like you're walking on the street

339
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 or you're driving.

340
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Most humans drive.

341
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 I walk everywhere, but you're in motion down the street

342
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 and something catches your eye and you kind of look

343
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 and you see like a squirrel and he's looking kind of shady at you

344
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 and you're like, "Oh, that's weird.

345
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 What did I ever do to that squirrel?"

346
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 And he's like hiding his nuts.

347
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 And then you would never think to get, you're like,

348
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 "Hmm, that was odd.

349
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 Maybe I should visit a hypnotist."

350
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 And it turns out that as you were driving down the street,

351
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 you didn't actually see a squirrel looking suspicious.

352
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 You saw like a gray alien like poking around the corner.

353
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 You're staring at you.

354
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 And so something about it made you feel weird and off

355
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 and your mind or alien device made it seem like

356
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 it was something more normal and something more mundane.

357
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 So anyways, you have that idea that when you see something

358
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 simply a little out of the ordinary, it could be something evil.

359
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 But now I'm thinking it could also be that people could be getting

360
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 abducted way more than we think the aliens have wised up

361
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 and figured out a way to basically make us not notice things are missing.

362
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 So you go to work, you come home, you're sitting in your living room,

363
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 and then you wake up the next morning.

364
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 And the aliens implant the memory of you watching The Mandalorian.

365
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 And going that last step, dude, the last episode of Mandalorians sucked.

366
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 It was so bad.

367
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 It was action packed, but it was bad.

368
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 So they maybe show, everyone online seems to think it was the best episode ever.

369
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Maybe I watched it and I was like, oh, this is the best episode ever.

370
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 Oh, got abducted by aliens.

371
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 They did all sorts of experiments on me and then they go, oh, we got to implant those false memories.

372
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 And someone goes, you know, it'd be hilarious to make them think that episode was terrible.

373
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 So now I live with the memory of a really bad episode of a show I enjoy.

374
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 But you would never know.

375
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 You would never know.

376
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 You could be getting abducted every single night.

377
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 What if dreams are what aliens put in your brain?

378
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Okay, that's a little too far.

379
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 That's a little too far.

380
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 But let's dial it back.

381
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 Let's dial it back.

382
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 You could be getting abducted all the time when you were by yourself.

383
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 And then you would never know because the aliens are putting false memories in.

384
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 That's what this story kind of points to.

385
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 It kind of points to two things.

386
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 One, that they could have figured out a way to account for lost time.

387
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 If they were doing like a 30 minute procedure on these women,

388
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 and it took them 30 minutes to kind of figure out,

389
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 sus out what's going on with this car accident,

390
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 that'd be totally fine.

391
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 It was a quickie.

392
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 But it could also be, I also think it's creepy the illusion of things.

393
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 Because if you came across the six car pile up, you're like,

394
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 what? This doesn't make sense.

395
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 How come there's no lights?

396
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 In reality, great aliens are creeping towards you,

397
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 but you can't comprehend that sheer horror that awaits you.

398
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 So either the aliens are inducing a image,

399
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 or your own brain is just shutting down and not letting you know what's going on.

400
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 I honestly think, when you're getting tortured to death,

401
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 I have no experience in this.

402
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 I've never been tortured to death.

403
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 But I don't think you probably are even aware in the moment what's going on.

404
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 Sure, you're probably going to yell and bleed a lot and cry and stuff like that.

405
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 But I bet you anything, your mind is doing something else.

406
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 Don't put that theory to a test.

407
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 Don't torture someone and go,

408
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 where are you? Where are you? Don't do that.

409
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 But I'm thinking that the human brain, when it's presented with so much horror,

410
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 just can't comprehend it.

411
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 So you could be getting tortured to death,

412
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 and you may be screaming and crying,

413
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 but in reality, you're kind of just sitting at a picnic,

414
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 hanging out with like, you know, cartoon characters or something like that.

415
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 So who knows?

416
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 But this would actually be proof of that as well.

417
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 That as these aliens are creeping towards you,

418
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 you may be listening to this podcast right now and sitting in a very comfortable place.

419
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 There could be something walking towards you that you can't see,

420
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 and your mind is basically blanking it from reality,

421
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 until you feel those long, grey fingers wrap around your throat.

422
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 So, sleep tight, kids.

423
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 But yeah, the idea that the horror level of things can be hidden

424
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 in the mundane existence all around us,

425
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 I think is more terrifying than just bright lights in the sky.

426
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 Because bright lights in the sky, you can go,

427
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 "I don't know what that is, that might be an alien saucer."

428
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 You may actually see a metallic alien saucer coming towards you.

429
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 You may actually see the grey aliens get off the saucer

430
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 and begin walking towards you.

431
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 But as long as your mind can comprehend that,

432
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 you can deal with it.

433
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 You can figure out your fight or flight response.

434
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 But if all of that is covered up in a false reality,

435
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 if that spaceship is coming towards you, you don't even see it.

436
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 If that grey alien is walking towards your house right now,

437
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 and you're not even aware, it can see you, but you can't see it.

438
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 You just, something kind of catches your eye out there in the shadows,

439
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 and you go, "That's weird, I thought I saw something, but it's nothing."

440
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 To me, that's far more terrifying.

441
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 If you see the grey alien, you can figure out a fight plan.

442
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 But for all we know, we've all been abducted multiple times.

443
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 We just brush it off those weird experiences,

444
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 those little minutes that we lose here and there.

445
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Those times we see something off in the distance or up close.

446
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 That doesn't really make sense, and then we kind of look at it again,

447
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 and it goes, "No, no, it's fine. It's nothing. It's nothing."

448
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 All of those things could be just proof that we are all just experiments

449
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 for our grey alien overlords.

450
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 So when you see that bizarre thing out of the corner of your eye tonight,

451
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 just ignore it.

452
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Don't look too close.

453
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 Because if you understand the true madness that is right outside your field of vision,

454
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 things are only going to be worse.

455
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Just let the aliens do what they want to do.

456
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Just let it-- No, don't do that. Just put some punch in.

457
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 Just if you see anything out of the corner of your eye, I'm not giving up.

458
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Just throw a punch. Every time you see something weird, don't do that either.

459
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 You're going to hurt yourself or somebody else.

460
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 But if you heard an alien, that's totally cool.

461
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 DeadRabbitRadio@gmail.com is going to be our email address.

462
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 We're not doing the India story, by the way.

463
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Hey guys, this is actually Jason from the future, so I just got done editing this episode,

464
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 and it clocked in at like 22 minutes, which is like super, super short.

465
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 I don't like them to go over, and I didn't have enough time to tell the Indian family story.

466
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 That'll be coming up later in a different episode, not this one.

467
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 But I didn't want to leave you guys with just 22 minutes either.

468
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 I felt that was too short.

469
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 So I have another short little mystery for you, and a short little creepy story.

470
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 So we're leaving behind the alien pile up.

471
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 The women are like, "Help us, are you going to help?"

472
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 They're getting abducted. We're like, "Nah, nah, you guys got it handled."

473
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 They're like, "No, we don't, no, we don't."

474
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 They're like, "That'll be fine here, screaming from the spaceship."

475
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Don't look, don't look, don't look through the portholes.

476
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 You see just a hand, and it slowly gets dragged away.

477
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 We're driving to the middle of nowhere,

478
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 aka Luna County, New Mexico.

479
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 The year is 1999, it's May 27th,

480
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 and you got two power line workers walking through what I assume is a desert,

481
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 because it's in New Mexico.

482
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 So we're going to put on our little hard hats and our little zip.

483
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 We're going to zip up our overalls. We're walking with them.

484
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 We're newbies. We're the new hires on the job.

485
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 And they're explaining to us, "Listen, this job is really boring,

486
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 but it pays well. We're going to walk. We just look at power lines."

487
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 And then we check them off on a list.

488
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 This power line is fine. Then we go to the next one.

489
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 Now, I don't actually know what their job entailed.

490
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 I just know that they check power lines.

491
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 It may be super technical. They may have climbed up them,

492
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 but we're not going to do that. We're not going to do that.

493
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 What they don't know is this isn't actually our first day on the job.

494
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 We actually brained two other dudes who were getting ready for work.

495
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 We broke into their houses, knocked them out. We're putting on their uniforms.

496
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 And we're just following them.

497
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 And as we're walking, you see me holding a wrench behind my back.

498
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 You're like, "Jason, no. No, we already have the uniforms.

499
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 You don't have to do it again. You don't have to do it."

500
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 I look, "Are you sure?" You're like, "Yeah, dude, dude, seriously, don't go."

501
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 You're super nervous. You're sweating.

502
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 It's not the sun in New Mexico that's making you sweat.

503
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 You don't know if I'm going to-- I need more uniforms.

504
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 I need all the uniforms in the world.

505
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 So anyways, we're walking with these guys, and we see a power line up ahead.

506
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 And this power line, you can tell from a distance, the bottom half of it has been burned.

507
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 So that's a bad sign. I mean, we're not professional power line inspectors.

508
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 We're not even amateur power line inspectors. We're imposters.

509
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 But even we know that that's probably not a good thing.

510
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 The thing that supplies electricity, you don't want it to have been on fire.

511
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 The two power line workers don't seem super concerned about that.

512
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 It probably happens every once in a while.

513
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 What they're concerned about is the object leaning against the pole.

514
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 [imitates engine noise]

515
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 Our boots are like walking on the dirt.

516
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 Little lizard runs away. Stop, selects at us.

517
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Runs away a little more.

518
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 I have my wrench and ready to bash its head in.

519
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Hmm, I could always disguise myself as a lizard.

520
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 You're like, "Jason, no, don't."

521
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 What they're seeing against the power line is a slumped human body.

522
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Long dead.

523
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 Authorities believe he'd been dead for six months leaning against this pole.

524
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 And leaning is a bit of a misnomer, because what we do is we have a human body.

525
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 It's pretty much mummified by the elements.

526
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 The dry, new Mexican air. Is it New Mexican or is it always just New Mexico?

527
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 The environment around New Mexico that dry air mummified this guy's body.

528
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 They don't know who it is. They don't know how old he is.

529
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 They don't know how he died or really when he died, other than they can say about six months ago.

530
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 The report says one or both hands are missing.

531
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 And you figure that they should be pretty certain on that.

532
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 There either is one hand missing or two hands missing, but one or both hands are missing.

533
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 The reason why the body isn't just collapsed on the ground is because around the neck

534
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 and around the pole is a chain that's padlocked together.

535
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 So in the middle of the desert of New Mexico, far past the outskirts of civilization,

536
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 there stood a telephone pole.

537
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 And to that telephone pole, an anonymous person was chained to it

538
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 and either left to die, burned alive, or murdered in some other way.

539
00:26:51,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 And for six months stood there undisturbed, the sun rising and setting on this man's body.

540
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 Having back in 1999 to this day they have no idea who this was.

541
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 Authorities will say he could be a man named Rodney Jones,

542
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 but nobody knows if that's even a real name.

543
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 When they start asking people in town, they go, "Is anyone missing?"

544
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 And people go, "Well, there was a guy named Rodney Jones who used to be around here."

545
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 But it wasn't really a local, somebody passing through.

546
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 Like Rodney Jones doesn't even seem like that's a real person.

547
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 The authorities aren't then following the Jones families.

548
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 They're not like calling up Aqua and say, "We know that you know Dr. Jones, but do you know Rodney Jones?"

549
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 This isn't like they have no other lead.

550
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 So it may be Rodney Jones, it may be some totally random person.

551
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 They don't know how old they are.

552
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 The age is age 30 to 50.

553
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 And it's a man. That's all they know for sure.

554
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 So Rodney Jones, I think, maybe it was just a guess.

555
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 A 21-year-old mystery, a man who will never be truly identified.

556
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 A murder victim means a murderer.

557
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 Who was the victim? How was he killed?

558
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 Who did it? And why?

559
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 Really the most important question is who did it.

560
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Because I can almost guarantee the person who did it is still out there.

561
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 And if they're still out there, you have to wonder how many other people did this happen to?

562
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 But their bodies weren't stumbled across.

563
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 Their bodies were lost out in the wilderness, decayed, devoured by scavengers,

564
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 and spread across the desert of New Mexico.

565
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 And the only sign of them may be a chain with a padlock wrapped around a power line somewhere.

566
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 Something that if you stumbled across and looked at it, you might think it was odd,

567
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 but you wouldn't think of it as an instrument of murder.

568
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 And that also lies in the dust and the dirt, eventually rusting, breaking, falling to pieces,

569
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 and disappearing into the vast desert surrounding it.

570
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 How many murders will never be solved?

571
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 Because time simply destroyed all the evidence.

572
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
