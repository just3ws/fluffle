1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,700
 Is it possible that time travelers from the future are using sci-fi technology to steal our apples?

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,380
 And then we travel to India to take a look at a doctor who made a pledge to take care of

3
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:21,480
 everyone rich or poor no matter how much they could afford he would provide medicine to them.

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:28,560
 He took this pledge so seriously he continued it after he died.

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,920
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:43,320
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,280
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,680
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,880
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you are doing.

10
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,880
 Let's go ahead and get this episode started by giving a shout out to one of our legacy

11
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,880
 Patreons walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

12
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,880
 Give it up for Chazz.

13
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,320
 Woohoo yeah come on in Chazz.

14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,080
 Long time supporter of the show.

15
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,720
 You deserve more clapping than that.

16
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,720
 Chazz you're gonna be our captain.

17
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,160
 It's just a couple more claps that's as much as you deserve.

18
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,360
 Chazz you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,640
 If you guys get to work with the Patreon I totally understand.

20
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,560
 Just helps spread the word about the show that really really helps out a lot.

21
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,280
 Now Chazz let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

22
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,840
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

23
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:34,640
 We're gonna fly all the way out to the East Coast.

24
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,640
 Long slow leisurely journey out there and it should be leisurely because we need to

25
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,840
 save our strength.

26
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,400
 We're gonna try to unravel a mystery and we're not gonna eat any apples while we're

27
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
 doing it.

28
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,640
 You're watching no one eats apples while they're doing a mystery.

29
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,640
 You didn't know that?

30
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,640
 Sherlock Holmes.

31
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,640
 That was what he always said.

32
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,520
 He goes before I solve this murder give me an apple.

33
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,520
 They edited those parts out.

34
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,840
 People are like do that's dumb take it out of the book.

35
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,120
 Chazz is flying that carbon decopter so long the audio quality changed.

36
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,160
 I had to change locations.

37
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,360
 It took a nap.

38
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,760
 My allergies are so bad.

39
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,760
 I'm taking so much bit of drill.

40
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,760
 I took a little nap.

41
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,880
 I took a little nap in the back of the Dead Rabbit Durgible but I'm awake now and I'm

42
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,000
 recording in a different location.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,680
 And speaking of different locations we finally arrived at our destination.

44
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,760
 We are at an unnamed suburb somewhere on the east coast of America.

45
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,400
 I found this story online so we don't get a lot of details but we have that.

46
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
 We have that.

47
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,720
 We have east coast of America in a suburb and we're in the year 2008 and we see this

48
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,520
 little house and this house has an apple tree.

49
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,040
 Now like I said I found this story online.

50
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,280
 It was posted by someone under the name Moody for Foodie and they said this house had been

51
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:57,040
 in our family for generations and along with this house came this giant apple tree.

52
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,800
 Now it's not the type of apples you can eat.

53
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,800
 I probably should have said that before you got a ladder out and he started filling a

54
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,080
 basket full of apples.

55
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,440
 Apparently there's a difference in apples.

56
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,400
 I didn't know this.

57
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,720
 They're Granny Smith apples but they're really bitter.

58
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,080
 They're basically like Johnny Appleseed originally planted this tree kind of apples.

59
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,800
 The apples he planted weren't super edible either apparently.

60
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:25,240
 People used them to make cider or apple pies and that's what this one's for.

61
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,800
 It's this giant apple tree that you can just pull the apples off and then you look at it

62
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,000
 and you can't take a bite out of it.

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,880
 You got to chop it up and cover it in brown sugar and then pastries and have an apple

64
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,880
 pie.

65
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,200
 So technically it's an apple pie tree.

66
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,840
 But this apple tree in the land that it's on, the house and everything, has been in

67
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:49,320
 this family for generations and in the late summer of 2008 the tree had a larger amount

68
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,720
 of apples than usual.

69
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,800
 And you're just, again these aren't apples you can eat.

70
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,520
 The only time you would really pick the apples is when it was time for a pie.

71
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,080
 And how many apple pies can you eat in a year?

72
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,600
 They're like guess what's for dinner?

73
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,640
 You're like pork chops?

74
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,000
 Yes, yes.

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,120
 And a side of apple pie and apple pies with everything.

76
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,720
 Every time it's not for Christmas if you're any friends of this family they're going to

77
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,720
 give you apple pies.

78
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,760
 You're like wait a second I'm pretty sure apples don't grow and winter.

79
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,680
 How long have you had this apple pie sitting on yourself?

80
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,560
 Jason Biggs keeps breaking into the house and banging the pies.

81
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:34,920
 This year it had way more apples than it normally did and then overnight all of the apples disappeared.

82
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:43,760
 Every single apple was gone including the rotten, the rotten, decaying apples laying

83
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,760
 around the tree.

84
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:51,320
 I don't know much about apple trees but from reading this story and doing research on

85
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,720
 some they seem like more trouble than they're worth.

86
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,840
 You can't eat the apples right off the tree but they thought it was great they've had

87
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,320
 this tree for generations right?

88
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,520
 It's been there for 50 years.

89
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,880
 Every apple's gone from this tree even the disgusting rotting ones on the bottom and

90
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,760
 everyone's puzzled by this.

91
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:16,240
 Everyone in the family's puzzled by this but the dad becomes obsessed with what happened

92
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,000
 to his apples.

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,680
 He just couldn't figure it out.

94
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:29,280
 Now if you go online and type in all the apples disappeared on my tree overnight it's shocking

95
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,640
 how many articles and how many people have asked this question over the years.

96
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:41,080
 Apparently this is a phenomenon that is repeated over and over again and despite the fact that

97
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,880
 it happens a lot there is no clear answer.

98
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,120
 And when Moody for Foodie posted this a lot of people were chiming in with their answers

99
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,320
 as well.

100
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,320
 Warthogs.

101
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:56,080
 Apparently he lives in the Lion King.

102
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,400
 He's just warthogs everywhere.

103
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,400
 And Moody for Foodie goes no no no I live in a suburb we're on the east coast that's

104
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
 how we got some of this information.

105
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,640
 There's no warthogs running around.

106
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,720
 There's no wild boars running around.

107
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,000
 People started saying squirrels, raccoons, horses.

108
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,720
 Again in the suburbs on the east coast not it's on horses.

109
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,440
 A lot of raccoons and squirrels but an entire tree disappeared and when you search this

110
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,440
 up on Google those are the same answers.

111
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,360
 People say it may be birds, it may be raccoons, things like that.

112
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,680
 But even then no one has given a clear answer.

113
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,720
 They'll be like set up a trail cam.

114
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,280
 Set up a trail cam that we'll record from now until the next apple harvest to see what

115
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,000
 it could be because it doesn't always happen to the same tree every single season.

116
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,560
 So that's what would make it weird to be wildlife related right?

117
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,880
 They would just keep coming back to the same tree.

118
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,800
 Now my personal theory is that I don't think it all happened overnight.

119
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,760
 I think over time these apples were disappearing and you noticed it one day.

120
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:09,640
 The same way that when someone loses a substantial amount of weight someone loses 50 pounds and

121
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,000
 you hang out with this person once a week maybe you see him at work maybe you actually

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,600
 see them five days a week.

123
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,520
 One day you look over at him and you go whoa dude what happened you've lost a ton of

124
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,520
 weight.

125
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,920
 They didn't actually lose 50 pounds overnight.

126
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,320
 They lost it every time you just noticed it on a particular day.

127
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,000
 That's my personal theory on this.

128
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,320
 But again in this story that might have happened but every single story because again this

129
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,320
 is common.

130
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,320
 Now none of this is really the interesting stuff.

131
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,760
 Like Jason gets on some travelers we don't care about raccoons.

132
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,480
 We do care about warthogs they're pretty cool they sing cool songs.

133
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,080
 But get to the time traveler stuff that you said in the intro.

134
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,280
 So that was the dad's theory.

135
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:59,880
 The dad started to come up with this theory in all seriousness that there was a future

136
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,800
 where you had two big events going on.

137
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:09,320
 One the introduction of time travel every human's dream right to be able to go back

138
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,240
 and fix the things they did wrong.

139
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,160
 And apples apples right.

140
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,160
 Apples.

141
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,040
 You have a future with this sci-fi technology where you could basically go back in time

142
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:28,040
 and rewrite history and you have a world with no apples.

143
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:34,520
 Something went tragically wrong in the future and apples ceased to exist or they were exceedingly

144
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,960
 rare you couldn't find them.

145
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,640
 So they go back in time and they steal apples from other people's trees.

146
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,880
 Now Moody for Foodie says here's the thing.

147
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:52,040
 My dad previous to this went through a string of horrible tragedies and started to have

148
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,160
 a mental breakdown.

149
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,280
 It seems like they're doing fine right now but he was in the throes of this serious mental

150
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:03,360
 breakdown when you're already trying to make sense of the randomness of the chaos of the

151
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,560
 unfeeling cold strings of fate.

152
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,040
 You wake up and you're like only one thing will care about this mental disease.

153
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,520
 An apple pie.

154
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,760
 And then you walk outside and all your apples are gone.

155
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,640
 You're like no my medicine I'm supposed to eat an apple a day.

156
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,560
 So I'm not making fun of this guy's mental illness although I'm laughing even as I'm

157
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,560
 saying that.

158
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,520
 I feel very very bad for him when you have that string of tragedies or even just one

159
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,440
 tragedy.

160
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,320
 But he was dealing with these tragedies and all of his apples went missing and he couldn't

161
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,680
 figure it out.

162
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,960
 He could not figure out how something would take every single apple in one night.

163
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,760
 Despite my theory I could be wrong right?

164
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,680
 They could have all disappeared over one night.

165
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,640
 Cause multiple people are talking about this not just in this thread but all over the internet.

166
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,000
 So the only thing he could think of.

167
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,120
 Well it wasn't the only thing he also thought aliens might have taken his apples.

168
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,680
 Because there was no ladder marks.

169
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,040
 They said that the tree was right next to the house.

170
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,920
 Right next to a bedroom window.

171
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,840
 Nobody heard anything.

172
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,920
 There's no animal droppings.

173
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,200
 There was no ladder marks.

174
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,440
 So like a human climbing up a ladder, a normal of our time human taking every single apple

175
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,440
 off the tree.

176
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:19,000
 There's no other evidence and like Occam's razor said, when in doubt, time travel.

177
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,280
 So that is where the father went and to this day the father still can't figure out where

178
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,280
 all those apples went.

179
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,640
 I'm sure that the tree is back to producing apples.

180
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,880
 But he still can't figure out what happened there.

181
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,760
 And that was in the throes of his mental struggles.

182
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,840
 He believed that it could have been time travelers.

183
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,760
 Two really interesting things to talk about with this story.

184
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,900
 One is obviously the mental illness.

185
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,760
 How it impacts our rational thinking.

186
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,560
 To think that there is a future where there's no apples.

187
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,480
 And so people would use this technology.

188
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,560
 Go back in time and I don't know get some apple seeds.

189
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,120
 Go back in time and actually abduct Johnny, apple seed himself and you time down in a

190
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,120
 chair.

191
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,120
 Tell us your secrets.

192
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,120
 He's like, I would have told you the secrets.

193
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,040
 I would have planned to the trees myself of Vienna and tied me down to this futuristic

194
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,320
 chair.

195
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:17,800
 That would be more rational than time travelers coming back and constantly stealing apples.

196
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:24,120
 But when you're having these mental health struggles, that makes sense.

197
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,120
 It's as insane as it sounds.

198
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,360
 It couldn't make sense.

199
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,080
 The only thing that could have possibly taken all these apples in one night without leaving

200
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,960
 a piece of evidence is humans from the future.

201
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:39,840
 But then because we talk about paranormal stuff on this show, we should also address

202
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:45,000
 the possibility that there is a future without apples.

203
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,760
 What I actually love about the time travel theory, even though it came out of a man's

204
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,520
 struggles with tragedy in his life, is that this tracks, right?

205
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,760
 I knew a dude.

206
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,760
 Let me back up here.

207
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,400
 Let me back up here, FBI.

208
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,640
 I never met the guy.

209
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,040
 I didn't know the guy.

210
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,040
 I never met the guy.

211
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,800
 I don't know his name.

212
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,280
 But my grandpa, who is deceased, knew a dude who was a counterfeiter.

213
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,560
 He counterfeited money.

214
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,640
 I don't know where this guy is.

215
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:19,240
 I could not tell you where he is or even if he's still alive because my grandpa knew

216
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,720
 him and then my grandpa passed away, unfortunately.

217
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,720
 Probably fortunately because now the feds might be looking for him.

218
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:33,200
 My grandpa knew a dude who counterfeited money, but he only counterfeited $5 bills because

219
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:39,360
 he figured if he's ripping someone off, he's only ripping someone off for five bucks.

220
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:46,000
 Now if you have a thousand counterfeit $5 bills, that's you're ripping off $1,000 worth of stuff,

221
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 right?

222
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 He had a bunch of these things.

223
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 I never met the guy.

224
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,400
 I don't know his name or anything about him.

225
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,440
 But the only counterfeited $5 bill is because that way he's only ripping someone off of

226
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,680
 $5.

227
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:03,120
 If you were from the future and you knew you had to steal something, you would, I think,

228
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,040
 spread out the theft, right?

229
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,880
 You wouldn't want to keep coming back every year and stealing the same guy's apples.

230
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,760
 That might actually even disrupt the time stream.

231
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,560
 That guy who keeps stealing his apples.

232
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,360
 He was supposed to walk out one day and look at an apple and go, "You know what?

233
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,160
 That apple reminds me to not become a terrible dictator and take over the world."

234
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,160
 Thanks, Apple.

235
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,400
 But if his apple disappeared that day, it would corrupt the timeline.

236
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,480
 And the next thing you know, he's marching through the streets of Washington with his

237
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,920
 doom troopers.

238
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,400
 So they're hitting different orchards.

239
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,920
 They're hitting different trees over the years.

240
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,200
 So they don't turn basically everyone is one apple away from becoming a dictator.

241
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,520
 You didn't know that?

242
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,840
 That was in a Sherlock Holmes novel.

243
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,960
 I think that might track.

244
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,600
 I think that might track that if you're going to steal apples, you would not want to keep

245
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,600
 stealing from the same person.

246
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,720
 Although that would be super hilarious in their entire life.

247
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,880
 They're like, "Oh man, why do women have this apple tree?"

248
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,640
 You cut the apple tree down and they go back in time and they replant it.

249
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,200
 You cut down the apple tree, you come out.

250
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,200
 It's even bigger this time with even more apples.

251
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,800
 You're like, "Ah!"

252
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:17,040
 So anyways, it's possible that there are time travelers coming back from the future to steal

253
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,040
 our apples.

254
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,400
 It's possible, right?

255
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,480
 In the world of the paranormal, really anything is possible.

256
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,240
 And this is a phenomenon that is going on.

257
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,800
 And people always say it's probably pests, set up a trail cam, but I don't think anyone's

258
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,840
 ever caught footage of every single apple disappearing from a tree in a single night.

259
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,840
 Ever.

260
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,200
 Despite the fact that there are a lot of reports of this.

261
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,680
 So it might be something that it's so mundane you would never think that it had a paranormal

262
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,680
 explanation.

263
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,080
 This probably happens more than is reported too, right?

264
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,800
 People see it and they're like, "Ah shucks!

265
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,800
 That's weird!"

266
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,160
 And then they don't go on the internet and talk about it.

267
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,160
 It just happens.

268
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,160
 Who knows?

269
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,240
 Apples disappearing from a tree overnight could be more common than cattle mutilations.

270
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,740
 Jason probably is.

271
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,480
 It's probably a bunch of raccoons.

272
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,560
 Who knows?

273
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,560
 Who knows?

274
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,280
 It's a bizarre mystery.

275
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,280
 No one knows exactly what causes it.

276
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,360
 There's been no proof of the usual suspects taking all the apples in one night.

277
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,840
 Interesting conspiracy theory.

278
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,560
 Maybe he's onto something.

279
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,240
 Maybe he was just looking for any answer.

280
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,400
 Something to make sense at a time when life was not making sense at all for him.

281
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,080
 But an interesting mystery nonetheless.

282
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,200
 Chaz, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonicopter we're leaving before

283
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,720
 taking a bunch of apples.

284
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,680
 We're flying around in the carbonicopter.

285
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,680
 We're grabbing them.

286
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,120
 We're grabbing these apples so they can't see any ladder prints.

287
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,400
 We've stole all their apples.

288
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,720
 We're making apple pies in the back right now.

289
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,520
 Fly us out in this carbonicopter.

290
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,400
 We're headed all the way out to India.

291
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,240
 [imitates gunshots]

292
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,160
 Have you guys seen Top Gun yet?

293
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,840
 A spectacular action movie.

294
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,800
 This is another story that we find online.

295
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,160
 So again, not a ton of details to locations and dates and times and stuff like that.

296
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,160
 Here's the thing.

297
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,600
 It's like Feaster Fam and when you're doing paranormal research, sometimes you get a

298
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,940
 street address.

299
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,280
 Sometimes you get photographs and Google Maps and all sorts of stuff.

300
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,080
 Other times because these stories are so weird, people don't like giving out that information.

301
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,920
 And I understand.

302
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,720
 It makes it seem more concrete when we have street addresses and stuff like that, but

303
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,000
 it's just part of the game, unfortunately.

304
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,960
 So we're in India, which is one of the biggest land masses in the world and has one of the

305
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,520
 biggest populations in the world as well.

306
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,680
 And as far as the time period goes, this story takes place in the past, but we're not talking

307
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,680
 like the 1800s.

308
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:47,720
 It seems to take place, if I had to guess, 90s?

309
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,960
 Early 2000s even.

310
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,240
 I don't think it took place that long ago.

311
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,080
 I want to give a shout out to Oplagosh for telling this story.

312
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,080
 Very, very interesting story.

313
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,040
 There's a lot of ramifications for the world of the paranormal, so let's go ahead and start

314
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,000
 digging into this.

315
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,800
 This story is about Oplagosh's great-grandfather.

316
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,280
 And his great-grandfather was a homeopathic doctor.

317
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,280
 And we don't have his name.

318
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,440
 We're going to go ahead and call him Dr. Saul.

319
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:21,480
 Dr. Saul, by all accounts, we only have the one, but Dr. Saul seemed to be the type of

320
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,200
 guy who you would want to work in the medical field.

321
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,320
 He was not only very, very good at his job, but he was also kind.

322
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:36,080
 He was a deeply, deeply generous person.

323
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,320
 He treated the poor free of cost.

324
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,520
 And when they needed medicine, he gave it to him.

325
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,200
 Now again, it was homeopathic medicine, so he was like, "Oh, here's some mushrooms for

326
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,200
 you.

327
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,200
 Here's some mustard seed.

328
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,600
 Put it under your tongue three times a day and it'll cure your mustard seed addiction."

329
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,440
 But still, homeopathic medicine, I'm not a huge believer in it, but it's been around

330
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,960
 for thousands of years, right?

331
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,040
 I prefer a good old pill made in a laboratory, but I understand that a lot of people don't.

332
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,240
 And if it works, it works, right?

333
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,600
 If it works and it's healthy, it works.

334
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,560
 So Dr. Saul is very, very well known in his community.

335
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:20,520
 He helps out everyone, even the people who can't afford to pay him.

336
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:26,960
 So when he died, the entire community grieved.

337
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,600
 And of course, the family, they're in their own private mourning, but to see all the lives

338
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,040
 that Dr. Saul touched.

339
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:40,160
 A few months after he passed away, one of his granddaughters, we're going to call her

340
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:47,680
 Vicki, she's in her early 20s and she comes to visit the house that he lived in.

341
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,760
 And it's still in the family.

342
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,880
 She's not breaking and entering.

343
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,280
 Right now her uncle lives there and his family's there and everything like that, but she's

344
00:18:54,280 --> 00:19:00,040
 visiting this house and she's sitting at home one day and the phone rings.

345
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:06,720
 And she picks it up.

346
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,560
 She's like, "That's quite a menacing phone ring."

347
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,400
 She picks it up, "Hello?"

348
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,600
 And there's a woman on the other line.

349
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,960
 Vicki doesn't recognize the voice.

350
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,160
 She goes, "Can I talk to Dr. Saul?

351
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,560
 Is Dr. Saul it?"

352
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,720
 And I speak to him.

353
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,880
 Vicki's a little confused because Dr. Saul's been dead for quite a few months.

354
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,480
 She figured everybody knew this.

355
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,800
 And instead of saying that, Vicki goes, "Well, is there anything I can help you with?

356
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,800
 What's going on?"

357
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,800
 She just kind of sidesteps the question.

358
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,680
 And the woman goes, "I just wanted to say thanks.

359
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,440
 I really wanted to say thanks to Dr. Saul.

360
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,640
 My son, he's better.

361
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,640
 He got better.

362
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,080
 I'm so sorry that I called so late that night.

363
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:53,600
 But my son was sick and he was getting sicker and I was so worried and I knew from the

364
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,520
 past that Dr. Saul could help.

365
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,360
 So I called him up and again, I really, really apologize if I woke you up.

366
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:05,440
 But Dr. Saul told me exactly what I needed to do and my boy got better.

367
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,880
 He's better now.

368
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,800
 And I just wanted to tell Dr. Saul thanks."

369
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,440
 And Vicki is confused by this.

370
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,840
 She goes, "When did you call?

371
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,640
 When did you call?"

372
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:27,000
 And the woman goes, "I must have been just about three nights ago."

373
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:36,160
 And Vicki said, "I don't know how to tell you this, but Dr. Saul, he's been dead for

374
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,160
 a couple months now."

375
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:45,080
 And the woman on the other line begins to freak out.

376
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,200
 I talked to him three days.

377
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,200
 What are you talking about?

378
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,880
 I talked to him three days ago.

379
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,800
 And she starts screaming.

380
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,960
 She's terrified.

381
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,680
 Vicki can actually hear the fear in this woman's voice.

382
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:03,480
 The only thing Vicki can do is say, "I'm sorry, but sorry you had to find out this way.

383
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,960
 But I gotta go.

384
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,760
 You're just screaming in my ear at this point."

385
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:17,160
 And Vicki just ends the call as politely as you can as a mother is screaming in terror.

386
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:23,560
 Vicki tells her grandmother, Dr. Saul's widow, and she goes, "The weirdest thing happened

387
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,920
 to me the other day.

388
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,760
 I got a phone call from a woman."

389
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:34,840
 And she said that grandpa talked to her just a couple days ago and prescribed some medicine.

390
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,440
 It worked.

391
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:41,400
 The boy's doing better, but grandpa's been dead for a while.

392
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,760
 I don't know what she could have possibly thought.

393
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,080
 Did she lose track of time?

394
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,160
 How is that even possible?

395
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,760
 And grandma goes, "Yeah, yeah.

396
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:59,960
 That's been happening a lot lately."

397
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,960
 Vicki goes, "What?

398
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
 What are you talking about?

399
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,960
 What do you mean?"

400
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,320
 And grandma says, "Listen, this is kind of weird.

401
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:15,080
 I don't really know what to make of it, but I've been getting phone calls from people

402
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,840
 saying they're talking to my husband, to Dr. Saul.

403
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:24,960
 I've been getting these phone calls regularly for the past couple months.

404
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,800
 That they're calling this phone number because they have it, right?

405
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,360
 They've been patients.

406
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:35,360
 They're calling the phone number they have, and they're talking to Dr. Saul.

407
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,760
 But I've never heard the phone ring.

408
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:47,040
 I've never picked up the phone and talked to any of these people until they call later

409
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,040
 to say thank you.

410
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:55,520
 I've had people tell me I'm so sorry for calling so late at night or I'm so sorry I called around

411
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:03,640
 dinner time, but luckily Dr. Saul was there to give me that advice, and it worked.

412
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,240
 And grandma goes, "The phone isn't ringing.

413
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,480
 I'm not picking it up and giving advice.

414
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,040
 We never hear the phone ring the first time.

415
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,440
 We don't hear the phone ring late at night.

416
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,600
 No one's picking the phone up at dinner time."

417
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:24,680
 But patient after patient after patient is saying this is happening.

418
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:31,880
 We only hear the phone ring when they're calling back to say thank you.

419
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:37,760
 And what would happen is each time the grandma or whoever happened to pick up the phone,

420
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:44,200
 in this case it was Vicki, would say I'm glad that your child's doing better, but Dr. Saul

421
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,720
 passed away a few months ago.

422
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,840
 And the people would flat out deny that that was possible, and then it would start to sink

423
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,840
 in that this isn't some sort of elaborate prank.

424
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,360
 He did pass away.

425
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:07,240
 And this phenomenon continued to happen until the last of his patients was finally informed

426
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:12,520
 that he had passed away, and they stopped calling.

427
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:18,160
 It's not that his voice eventually floated away into the ether.

428
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,160
 It's not that he walked into the light.

429
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,880
 People stopped calling the phone number to ask for medical advice.

430
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:38,040
 Because why would you call the phone number of a dead man if you knew he was dead?

431
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:43,960
 It's a fascinating story because when we look at the world of the paranormal it makes sense.

432
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,240
 This is a guy who spent his life helping people.

433
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,960
 And if he somehow found a way to help people even after he died, he would.

434
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,920
 He went out of his way to help everyone that he could, even if they couldn't afford his

435
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,520
 medicine or his doctor bills or anything like that.

436
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,720
 He would help you.

437
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,880
 So why would death stop his generosity of anything?

438
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,880
 He can do house calls now.

439
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,200
 He's floating around like a little Casper ghost.

440
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,960
 But the phenomenon didn't end because so much time had passed and the ghosts had faded away.

441
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,960
 The phenomenon ended because people stopped calling the phone number.

442
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:28,600
 Which begs the question, if you called that phone number today, as you're picking up that

443
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:34,400
 phone and you're dialing that number and you have desperation in your heart, you need a

444
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,120
 cure right now.

445
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,000
 Someone you love is deeply ill and you need advice right now.

446
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,480
 You need a cure.

447
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:49,160
 And as that fear is welling up and you grab your phone and you dial that number and who

448
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,880
 will answer?

449
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,480
 All these years later, would a living human pick it up?

450
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,360
 Or even today is Dr. Saul waiting for that phone to ring.

451
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:07,520
 Waiting for a phone call from someone who needs his help.

452
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,660
 He's sitting in the darkness.

453
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,840
 He wants to help.

454
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,960
 He can help.

455
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:22,320
 But because nobody is calling that phone, he just sits there.

456
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:29,480
 Dr. Saul, if the story is true, seems like a man who would wait forever if he thought

457
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,800
 he could help one more person.

458
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:41,920
 He would put off the afterlife forever if he thought that staying by that phone could

459
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:47,600
 save one more life, could end one more day of suffering.

460
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:54,200
 In an era where the medical industry seems to put profits above patients, somewhere in

461
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:04,080
 this world there is at least a few doctors who put patients above even their own comfort.

462
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:11,880
 And there may be at least one doctor out there who loves his patients so much to this day.

463
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:27,800
 He still sits in the darkness waiting for a phone call that will never come.

464
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,360
