1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
 Just when you thought it was safe to walk from your living room into your kitchen.

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,720
 You got quite the terrifying story.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,280
 We got quite the terrifying story happening in four inches of a doorway that separates

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,720
 those two rooms.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:23,080
 And then we head back to Iceland to take a look at yet another dark spell that was once

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,080
 used and may still be used today in that tiny little country.

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:35,800
 And you know that you too can raise the dead, but I hope you're good at wrestling.

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,280
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:49,360
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,360
 I'm your host Jason Garvener.

11
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,360
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,360
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,760
 I hope you guys have tons of plans for the weekend.

14
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,240
 We're going to keep this episode a little casual because you know the show is already

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,040
 so structured every other day.

16
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,120
 We're going to be a little casual today.

17
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:09,880
 I had the craziest week, but someone who always helps me maintain my sanity even during the

18
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,600
 craziest week walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now.

19
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,800
 Everyone get on your feet and give it up for Patreon supporter and book buyer, Mizzie.

20
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,800
 Woohoo!

21
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,800
 Yeah, come on in Mizzie.

22
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,800
 Mizzie, walk on into Dead Rabbit Command.

23
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,360
 Thank you so much for supporting the show.

24
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,600
 Mizzie bought me off my Amazon wish list my Star Trek book.

25
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,600
 I love Star Trek.

26
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,600
 I love Star Trek.

27
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,120
 It's my favorite genre of literature.

28
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,720
 And she bought me the Neverending Sacrifice, which if I remember correctly is kind of the

29
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,240
 sequel or spiritual sequel to A Stitch in Time, which is one of my favorite books I've

30
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,240
 ever read.

31
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,840
 Not that Madeline Engel book.

32
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,840
 It's about Derek, his life story on Cardassia.

33
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,840
 It's a great novel.

34
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,440
 Anyways, Mizzie, thank you so much for sending me the Neverending Sacrifice.

35
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,640
 I really do love Star Trek.

36
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,920
 And Mizzie also said I have a bunch of Star Trek books in my house.

37
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,840
 If you want them, she goes come to my house.

38
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,640
 They're in a pit in the backyard.

39
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,840
 You're free to grab them, but you're never coming out.

40
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,120
 No, Mizzie, yeah, go ahead.

41
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,960
 If you want to send me more Star Trek books, just send them in my PO box.

42
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,120
 I would love that.

43
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,400
 So Mizzie, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

44
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,400
 If you guys can't build booby traps for me to fall into using my love of Star Trek books

45
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,560
 as bait, that's fine too.

46
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,760
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

47
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,840
 That really helps out a lot.

48
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,840
 It really does.

49
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,480
 And then look at this awesome fan art Friday we got.

50
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,480
 I love this one.

51
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,920
 I love them all.

52
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,200
 This one's from Valencia the Researcher.

53
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,320
 It's her take on the classic Dead Rabbit Radio logo.

54
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,320
 It's fantastic.

55
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,320
 I love it.

56
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,320
 So awesome.

57
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,320
 You guys are so talented.

58
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,320
 And Mizzie, let's go ahead.

59
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,880
 I want to give you the hair hang glider.

60
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,640
 We're not going to jump off of Dead Rabbit Commanders yet for our first story.

61
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,760
 I got to tell you guys very quickly about my week because that's more of a T.

62
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,760
 You know, people hate it when podcasters talk about their personal life, but it's been a

63
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,880
 very paranormal conspiracy and true crime week for me.

64
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,880
 Behind the scenes.

65
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,400
 I'm not going to go on for a long time about this, but I'm just dead on my feet.

66
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,800
 That's why this episode we're keeping it a little casual.

67
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,040
 It might even be a little bit shorter.

68
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,320
 Dude, so you guys know how I had COVID.

69
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,960
 This is your first episode.

70
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,960
 You're like already clicked off.

71
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,640
 You're like, this is chaos personified.

72
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,720
 But if this isn't your first episode, if you've listened for a bit, I had COVID a couple weeks

73
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,720
 ago.

74
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,760
 Well, then I got over that.

75
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,320
 That was totally fine.

76
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:45,280
 Then around Thursday of last week, I began to develop symptoms of blood clotting in my

77
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,280
 legs.

78
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,920
 Technically, to be specific, it was just one symptom.

79
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,440
 It's very weird in my left leg.

80
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,120
 So that was something that I had to deal with all week.

81
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,640
 I'm like, do I have this blood clot?

82
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,120
 My left leg keeps getting warm.

83
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,160
 It feels like someone's just putting a heating pad on my leg and it lasts for a couple minutes

84
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,160
 that goes away.

85
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:09,720
 And then it could not come back for 10 hours or it could come back 30 seconds later.

86
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,400
 That's a sign of a blood clot because of my weight and because of my age and because of

87
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,960
 COVID, which it causes inflammation and one of the things it does is could cause blood

88
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,960
 clots.

89
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,960
 Obviously, I'm concerned about that.

90
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,960
 That's what I did all week.

91
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,960
 I didn't do it all week in lung.

92
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,680
 But I was worried as making phone calls to the doctor and all that stuff.

93
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,080
 So finally on Monday, I got tested and no blood clots.

94
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,240
 So there you go.

95
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,240
 That's nice.

96
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,240
 But that definitely weighed heavy on me.

97
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,400
 And it kind of set me back because I'm not thinking clearly about all the blood clots

98
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,400
 in my brain.

99
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,840
 It just kind of was a bummer weekend.

100
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:53,720
 Well then today, the entire town of Hood River, which is where I live, otherwise I wouldn't

101
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,080
 care if it happened to somebody else.

102
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:03,680
 Every business in town got a stay in place, shelter in place alert because there was an

103
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,320
 active shooting down by the safeway.

104
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,520
 And so it's like a bummer.

105
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,160
 I mean, luckily, if something bad happened, I could run away.

106
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,800
 I don't have blood clots in my legs.

107
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,560
 Yeah, it was super weird.

108
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,560
 It just been over.

109
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:23,240
 And so I've just been exhausted in between the mad shooting and the blood clotting.

110
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,880
 No, apparently, we all got these calls from the sheriff's department and it was everywhere

111
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,880
 in town.

112
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,040
 They're like, "Don't leave your house.

113
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,440
 Don't leave your business."

114
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,080
 And we see these news reports saying there's an active shooter loose in Hood River.

115
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,000
 We're like, "Oh, no.

116
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,320
 That's not good."

117
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,240
 And then the news comes out and I don't fault anyone for this.

118
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,360
 They don't know what's going to happen.

119
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,240
 They were like evacuating houses and stuff like that.

120
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,840
 And then it was like, the most alarming part was when I got off of work, I had to go buy

121
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,840
 some tortilla chips.

122
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,200
 I'm like, "Oh, there's a mad shooter loose in the city."

123
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,160
 But I really do need my chips and salsa tonight.

124
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,840
 I had to go buy tortilla chips.

125
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,480
 I don't have a car, so I'm walking everywhere.

126
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,480
 I'm walking everywhere with police cars.

127
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,480
 No, see, that's the thing.

128
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:12,440
 I get, before I leave work, I get this message saying, "Shelter in space.

129
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,440
 Shelter in place.

130
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,720
 Do not get tortilla chips."

131
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,960
 And we haven't caught the guy yet.

132
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,960
 We don't know where this guy is.

133
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,720
 This is all coming from the news at this point.

134
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,560
 I'm going to the news website and it says we don't know where the guy is at.

135
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,280
 Here I'm walking around town, down, down, down, walking around town.

136
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,760
 And it's so funny.

137
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:37,160
 I mean, this is tragic, but I remember thinking, "I'm not necessarily scared."

138
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,920
 "That this maniac could be running around shooting out of the car."

139
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,400
 I mean, definitely that was, that was, I was thinking that.

140
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,200
 But I remember I didn't listen to my headphones.

141
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,160
 I didn't bring, I didn't put my music on.

142
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,280
 I go, "I'm not necessarily scared of getting shot by some random guy."

143
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,480
 I don't know what this guy looks like.

144
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,840
 I was like, "I don't know what this guy looks like.

145
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,840
 What if he looks like me?

146
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,840
 What if I'm walking around?"

147
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,600
 They're like, "Look how the suspect is very hungry."

148
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,160
 Repeat, "Very hungry.

149
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,000
 He likes tostitos."

150
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,440
 I remember thinking, I was like, "I don't know what this dude looks like."

151
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,040
 So I got to get my chips.

152
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
 I can't head straight home.

153
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,200
 I ended up taking this long route just so I could get some chips.

154
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,960
 Anyways, I eventually make my way back home and then I check the news.

155
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,760
 So at this point it'd been like an hour, not two hours since it all went down.

156
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,600
 Maybe, yeah, you know, it would have been about two, three hours since it all started.

157
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,680
 And they go, "Oh, he's not an active shooter.

158
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,560
 He's shooting out of his house."

159
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,760
 So it's not like he was walking around town to shoot.

160
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,000
 And I'm not faulting the police for overreacting.

161
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 They were reacting.

162
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,120
 I don't think they were over or under reacting.

163
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,120
 They were reacting the right amount when a man opens fire out through the walls of his

164
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,280
 house in a populated area.

165
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:57,320
 So the police, he wasn't like walking from house to house, but they were evacuating entire

166
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,120
 neighborhoods and things like that.

167
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,520
 He wasn't moving around.

168
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,320
 Apparently the police got a, I'll put a link in the show notes, but apparently the police

169
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:10,320
 got like a report that this guy was dangerous, which turned out to be correct.

170
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,480
 He began shooting at the police through the house, the walls of the house, and the police

171
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,680
 take up positions and then they didn't know if he was going to leave the house and start

172
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,440
 taking a tour of the neighborhood.

173
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,240
 And he didn't, and in the report, because that's when I was like, because I saw that,

174
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,000
 I eventually saw he was shooting out of his house at the police.

175
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 That came up.

176
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,920
 And then the other report going, they don't know where he's at.

177
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,920
 So be on the lookout.

178
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:39,960
 And I was like, how in the world did he start shooting at cops from your house and then

179
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,680
 get away?

180
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,560
 They're like, sir, sir, we can't find him.

181
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,280
 Apparently his house has what's known as a back door.

182
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,800
 We didn't put anyone back there.

183
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
 He just crawled over the fence.

184
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
 We don't know where he's at.

185
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,640
 And I was like, well, I mean, when I, you got to take the alerts for what they are when

186
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,360
 they're like, we don't know where he's at.

187
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,680
 We're looking for him.

188
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,040
 That's why we're shutting down the town.

189
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,920
 Some businesses were locking their doors.

190
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,520
 Some businesses were like, oh, I need my tostitos.

191
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,320
 I'm kicking through the door, making all this noise.

192
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,800
 We were like, you're just as dangerous as a lunatic downtown.

193
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,800
 I was like, I need them.

194
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,020
 I need my tostitos.

195
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,840
 Some of the businesses locked their doors, but stayed open.

196
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,040
 So when customers came to the door, they'd let him in.

197
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,600
 But yeah, no, he was in his house.

198
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,120
 He apparently he's still in his house.

199
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,640
 I actually just woke up from a nap.

200
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:35,600
 I'm exhausted in between the blood clots and the active shooting and just, you know, life,

201
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,760
 life in between those two things.

202
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,080
 I'm exhausted.

203
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,560
 So yeah, it's been a crazy one.

204
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,760
 I had done a segment earlier in the week talking about my concerns about the blood clots and

205
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,840
 then I edited it out because I thought it was what happened was I did it and I go people

206
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,760
 for the rest of the episode because this was before I got tested.

207
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,280
 I go, yeah, I think I might have blood clots in my legs.

208
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,200
 Okay, let's go ahead and hop aboard the dead rabbit toon buggy.

209
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
 You'd be like, wait, what?

210
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
 Well, then what?

211
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,800
 I can't even think about anything else.

212
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,920
 This dude that I'm listening to his legs may get chopped off.

213
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,760
 He may die before the end of the episode.

214
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,280
 So I just waited to figure out and if I had blood clots or not.

215
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,920
 Anyways, we have all of that.

216
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,440
 What a crazy we oh and like the active shooter guy didn't hurt anybody.

217
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,000
 So like that's the best that's the best outcome.

218
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,080
 The best outcome would be for no one to be opening fire from inside their house or outside

219
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,280
 their house to begin with.

220
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,920
 But apparently he didn't hurt anybody.

221
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,200
 And the last I saw before I took a nap and was sleepy time is that the police that surrounded

222
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,520
 the building and everything was fine.

223
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,160
 Here, let's take a look.

224
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,680
 I pulled up the news and it's like massacre.

225
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,400
 I think everything's fine.

226
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,480
 I heard River knows.

227
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,400
 Yeah, no, he's still there apparently.

228
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,640
 This is from five hours ago.

229
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,800
 He still surrounded the area.

230
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,280
 Anyways, hope everything turns out.

231
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,280
 Okay, hope everything's okay.

232
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,880
 Missy, you got that hang lighter ready.

233
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,720
 She's giving us the thumbs up.

234
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,360
 Everyone come over here and grab ahold of her ankles.

235
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,680
 She is jumping off the highest point of Dead Rabbit Command and we're going to glide lazily

236
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,480
 all the way out to a house.

237
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,400
 Not that house where this is currently taking place.

238
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,520
 Right away from that house.

239
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:30,160
 We're going all the way up to this other house.

240
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,320
 We go to this house and we're going to meet a young woman.

241
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,320
 She doesn't give her name.

242
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,520
 We're going to go ahead and call her Clarisse.

243
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,640
 Clarisse is at home.

244
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,600
 This is a very small, very short, simple story.

245
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,600
 That's why I picked it.

246
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
 A little casual today.

247
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,720
 But it's just so fascinating to me.

248
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:54,960
 Clarisse is at home and she is walking from her living room into her kitchen.

249
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,800
 She walks into her kitchen and she goes, "What was that?

250
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,880
 What in the world was that?"

251
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:11,600
 She turns back and she looks into her living room.

252
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,680
 She doesn't see anything.

253
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,920
 She's like, "What in the world did I hear?"

254
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:26,000
 Clarisse said that as she was walking from the living room into the kitchen, that short

255
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:35,680
 doorway, that entryway, as she moved through there, she said for a split second she heard

256
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:41,160
 what sounded like a party.

257
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,280
 And she used some very interesting, the way she described this was super interesting.

258
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:53,440
 She says, "It sounded like a large party going on, but you were in the bathroom.

259
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,000
 It sounded like a bunch of people talking, having fun, but you're in the bathroom and

260
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,680
 the sound is muffled through probably like two or three doors at that point.

261
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,840
 You have the stall door, you have the bathroom door, and then you may be a hall door or something

262
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:13,640
 like that, but two or three doors down the sound is being muffled of a large party.

263
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,840
 But you could still make out the rhythm of people talking."

264
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,600
 So it wasn't just like a chaos noise.

265
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,920
 It sounded like a bunch of people talking at once in a lively situation, but you're removed

266
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,800
 a couple doors away and it's that muffled sound.

267
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:35,680
 And she says, "I didn't realize what I heard until I was in the kitchen."

268
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,640
 She goes, "I stepped through the doorway and I heard this noise for just a split second."

269
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,560
 She goes, "I got a couple feet into the kitchen and I stopped and goes, 'What in the world

270
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,560
 was that?'"

271
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,640
 Like, it didn't even register with her while she was moving.

272
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,960
 It took a moment for her brain to go, 'Hey, there's a party going on, but there shouldn't

273
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,320
 be.'

274
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:02,200
 And this perplexed her so much, she began to walk around the house to see if she could

275
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,480
 figure out where the sound was coming from.

276
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,320
 She tried to replicate it actually first.

277
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,200
 She went back and she kind of walked back and forth between the living room and the kitchen

278
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,360
 and she couldn't replicate it.

279
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,240
 So then she began to look around the house to try to figure out what this noise was because

280
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,200
 it clearly was real.

281
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,280
 She was like, "100% I heard this.

282
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,320
 This wasn't a mistake.

283
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,440
 Therefore there must be something in my house that made that noise."

284
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,480
 She began to walk around the house.

285
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,480
 She couldn't find anything.

286
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,840
 And then she goes, "There has to be a party outside.

287
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,200
 There has to be a party outside."

288
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,680
 And it's funny because I think a lot of people would experience this and just kind of shrug

289
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,680
 it off.

290
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,360
 It's weird and one about their day, but she was 100% sold on the idea.

291
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,520
 There was a party so there has to be a logical explanation for this.

292
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,400
 I know what I heard even though it was only for a split second.

293
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,400
 I heard it.

294
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:55,440
 Clarice walks outside of her house and begins to snoop around the neighborhood.

295
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,840
 I don't know how far she went.

296
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,200
 She went a couple of blocks.

297
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:03,160
 She went outside of her house and she began looking around, listening for any signs of

298
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,040
 a party where her neighbors thrown a big shindig.

299
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,040
 Nope.

300
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:13,720
 She never found the source of that noise.

301
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,000
 Clarice when she wrote this, she didn't give a location.

302
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,200
 She didn't really give a time period or anything like that.

303
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,120
 She posted this under the name Luna Domha.

304
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,480
 And she entitled the post, "Did I walk through a portal in my doorway?"

305
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,040
 And that's kind of how she saw it.

306
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:36,640
 She's walking through this man-made portal, this construct of a doorway, but for a split

307
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:42,920
 second in that small gap, she actually heard this other thing.

308
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,320
 Something that did not exist in our reality.

309
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,480
 There was a party going on.

310
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,120
 It's a fascinating story.

311
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,040
 You would think, take the story at face value, she did hear something.

312
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,240
 She heard this noise, but you would wonder where the noise comes from.

313
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:05,080
 I think there's a big, and I'll try to keep this brief, because I could just go on one

314
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,080
 about portals.

315
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,600
 You don't know how much editing I have to do whenever I start talking about portals,

316
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,880
 because it starts to get weird.

317
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:20,040
 But we have, I think, a belief in general that a portal may move us through time, or

318
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,480
 a portal like this may move us from dimension to dimension.

319
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:29,400
 But this party noise, it's interesting to think that it's not necessarily that it is

320
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,480
 coming from her house in an alternate reality.

321
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,960
 It's not like at that same moment in an alternate reality, another version of Clarice was having

322
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,440
 a party.

323
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:48,840
 It's possible that what she was hearing is from Alpha Centauri 9 on an alternate universe

324
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:53,360
 where humans have already taken over the entire universe.

325
00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:00,480
 It's possible that the party was from 1807, and it was like an old-timey party, like some

326
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,920
 house of manner.

327
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,920
 How was that show called that everyone watched for a long time and nobody cares about it

328
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,920
 anymore?

329
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,920
 Downton Abbey.

330
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,240
 It could have been like a Downton Abbey situation.

331
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,640
 It could have been anything.

332
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:20,320
 It could have been a party that was happening in this reality at that same moment from Bulgaria.

333
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:27,320
 Where the portal is opening up, where she's hearing this, is fascinating to me.

334
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,960
 If we take it at face value that she wasn't hallucinating it, that she wasn't really tired

335
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:38,160
 and having a waking dream or anything like that, it's not necessarily just what the noise

336
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,160
 was but when the noise was and where the noise was.

337
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,560
 It really could be anything.

338
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:48,000
 Then also you've got to think it's very possible that these portals, I do think the portals

339
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,920
 are both ways.

340
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,400
 Even that's a binary.

341
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,200
 When you're talking about the multiverse, you can't really use the term both, but it's

342
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,480
 opening across thousands of different dimensions.

343
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:05,520
 What I find interesting is at that party wherever it was taking place, someone at that party

344
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:11,720
 may have been standing there drinking their Octurlean tea as they're watching the sunset

345
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:19,800
 over Rigel 7 and they hear the noise of a woman walking through a house.

346
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,120
 They're like, "What was that?"

347
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,800
 They hear footsteps or they hear a television set and they can't even place it.

348
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,440
 They have no context for it.

349
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,160
 But the portal would open up like that.

350
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,000
 So if she was watching Laverne and Shirley or something like that, someone at that party

351
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:45,720
 as they're having a good time could hear someone go, "Surely a big lung head!"

352
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,640
 And no one else in the party would have heard it.

353
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,800
 So just everyone was having a good time but someone was just standing in the right place

354
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:55,680
 at the right time to hear a signal come through a television set that leaks through this portal

355
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,640
 and it's for a split second.

356
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,080
 That would be a mystery on their end.

357
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,520
 They'd be like, "What in the world is that?"

358
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,520
 Fascinating story.

359
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,520
 I love portals.

360
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,600
 That's why I always have to, basically, set an egg timer.

361
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,600
 Basically set an egg timer.

362
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:18,480
 I don't talk about them too much, but I love mundane paranormal stories like this.

363
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,000
 I really do because it just shows how common the phenomenon may be.

364
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,040
 Mizzie, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonarcopter we are leaving behind

365
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,600
 this household.

366
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:39,720
 Take us all the way out to Iceland.

367
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,200
 Mizzie is at the controls of the carbonarcopter.

368
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,080
 She's flying through an ice storm.

369
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,840
 Windows are headed to Iceland.

370
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,440
 Windows are getting frosted up.

371
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,840
 I'm in the back with you guys and I go, "What the heater is?

372
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,840
 She's freezing to death."

373
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,600
 It's like, "Yeah, probably should have got a heater in the front too, but I didn't have

374
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600
 enough money."

375
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,600
 We're sitting in the back.

376
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,600
 It's fully heated and I go, "Listen guys, we're on a mission."

377
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:11,480
 We recently were in Iceland to look at the story of the Tilbury, a two-headed snake that

378
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,480
 you can tame.

379
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:19,720
 You create it first and then you tame it to steal goat milk from a widow.

380
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,960
 That was a very successful operation, ladies and gentlemen.

381
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,960
 Thank you for your support.

382
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,880
 The toast of goat milk to us all.

383
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,560
 We also mastered the power of the Necro pants in that very same episode.

384
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,280
 I'll put it in the show notes.

385
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:39,320
 Pants that give us unlimited riches, but the unlimited riches come out of the testicles

386
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,920
 of your best friend's skin.

387
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,280
 I was like, "Yeah, listen to the episode.

388
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,280
 It's a crazy one."

389
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,280
 It's cool.

390
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,800
 Actually, a longtime supporter of the show, Ampus Allen.

391
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,680
 He's been recommending stuff for years.

392
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,120
 Really cool guys.

393
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:59,720
 Ampus Allen is going to visit in person the Museum of Icelandic Sorcery and Witchcraft.

394
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,720
 So that's going to be pretty cool.

395
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,840
 I want to give him $100 if he breaks into the exhibit and steals me some Necro pants.

396
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:12,160
 And then Lansing Loki on the Patreon Discord has been posting photos from a book.

397
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,720
 He is reading about the topic, actually.

398
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,640
 He has been reading about Icelandic magic as well.

399
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,640
 So that's really cool.

400
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,480
 I love hearing that type of stuff from you guys.

401
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,480
 It's just cool.

402
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,480
 I can't do that stuff.

403
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,480
 I'm kind of stuck here.

404
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,360
 They put the whole city on lockdown.

405
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,480
 I can't leave, guys.

406
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,480
 I can't leave.

407
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,160
 But I love to see you guys have an adventures and everything like that.

408
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,560
 This is another story from Icelandic lore.

409
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:42,200
 And just like the Necro pants in the Tilbury, it's nuts.

410
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,480
 I wonder who figured this out.

411
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,800
 No, it's possible it was made up.

412
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,840
 Now, I'm not saying like the article I'm about to read.

413
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:56,440
 I got most of my information from an Atlas Obscura article written by Eric Grumthauser.

414
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,440
 So it's great.

415
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,440
 I wanted to give you credit for that.

416
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,640
 But I mean, he didn't make it up.

417
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,360
 Now, I'm saying like it's possible that some Icelandic shaman was just having a laugh one

418
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
 day.

419
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,440
 People were like, "Hey, can you help me with this?"

420
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,000
 And he's like just making dumb stuff up on the spot.

421
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,320
 He's tripping off shrooms.

422
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,400
 He's just making stuff up.

423
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,000
 But if it's real, it's like you would have to go through so many variations of this to

424
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 get it right.

425
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,720
 And you figure a lot of people would have died.

426
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,480
 A lot of people would have died trying to get this right.

427
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,720
 Let's take a look at this.

428
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:35,440
 Mizzy Land, the carbonic optor right here in Iceland, we're about to take a look at

429
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:42,520
 a curse because the Necro pants allowed you to pass on wealth from generation to generation.

430
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:48,280
 What if there was an equally powerful curse that could be passed on from generation to

431
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,720
 generation, not your family?

432
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:56,400
 I mean, you'd really have to hate your kids to destroy your own bloodline through a curse.

433
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,600
 This is what you would do to someone you didn't like.

434
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,680
 And they wouldn't go away for quite a long time.

435
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:07,520
 The best way wouldn't be to just do like an evil eye spell.

436
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,240
 Wouldn't be to like make a little voodoo doll of them, step on it, put them full of needles.

437
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,240
 No.

438
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,880
 I mean, I guess those are both ways to curse somebody.

439
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:24,600
 But what a better way to curse a bloodline than to raise the dead.

440
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,920
 So we're standing in this Icelandic cemetery.

441
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:33,760
 We all got a shovel and I go, okay, guys, get ready because we are about to create a

442
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,760
 zombie.

443
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,720
 Each one of you, this is an arts and crafts podcast now.

444
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,920
 Each one of us is going to go home with their own zombie they're going to create.

445
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:50,400
 First thing you do is you stand in front of a grave and you start to shout out this invocation.

446
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,360
 But it's interesting because I've seen different variations of this in the world of magic.

447
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:01,680
 There are some witchcraft wicca practitioners that say you don't have to get the actual

448
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,640
 pronunciation of the words right.

449
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,240
 It's all about the motivation or the spirit behind the words.

450
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,520
 So if you're speaking Latin, but you don't speak Latin, that's okay.

451
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,400
 As long as your intention behind the words is raise the dead, you don't have to get them

452
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,440
 exactly right.

453
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:25,000
 In Icelandic lore and in other like high magic levels, Kabbalah magic is also very particular

454
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,320
 about how you pronounce the words.

455
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,960
 You have to get them right, which would make sense.

456
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,960
 It really would make sense.

457
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:37,000
 I never bought the whole, well, you know, just have a good feeling about it and it'll

458
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 work.

459
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,240
 I figure magic is very akin to science.

460
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:46,040
 You just can't throw chemicals into a pot and go, well, I'm hoping it becomes an acid,

461
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,040
 but who knows?

462
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,320
 No, you got to get it right.

463
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,240
 Anyways, in Icelandic lore, you got to get this invocation right.

464
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,680
 They didn't publish the invocation online.

465
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:02,440
 I'm sure you can probably dig through the attic in the Museum of Icelandic Sorcery and

466
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,440
 Witchcraft.

467
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,440
 I'm sure they got it in a box and more.

468
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,320
 But anyways, you're at this grave and then everyone spit on the grave, just like that

469
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,080
 fabulous movie from the 1970s.

470
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,040
 One detail that I probably should have included when you first walked in front of this grave

471
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:23,600
 is you have to be very, very particular about whose grave you're in front of because not

472
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,420
 all zombies are created equal.

473
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:34,880
 It turns out that when you want to create a zombie warrior, you want it to be of a weak

474
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,320
 corpse.

475
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,840
 So I mean, you don't necessarily want like a 10 year old, you know, that's just kind

476
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,680
 of depressing to look at.

477
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,040
 He comes out and he's like, "What is your bidding master?"

478
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,320
 And you're like, "Oh man, he's breaking my heart buddy."

479
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,680
 No, but you want someone with the strength of a 10 year old boy.

480
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:58,920
 You don't want like a lumberjack because you would think if I'm going to summon this

481
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:03,240
 zombie fourth, the better the better.

482
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,240
 But that's not the case.

483
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,400
 You're all standing over the grave of Hacksaw Jim Dugan.

484
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,400
 No, you're doomed.

485
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,380
 You're doomed if you are in front of that guy's grave.

486
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:19,920
 It turns out that whatever zombie you summon will be nine times stronger in death than

487
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,400
 they were when they were alive.

488
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:31,200
 So if you went and stood in front of a lumberjack's grave or a farmer, a big farmer dude, that's

489
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,200
 not good.

490
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,200
 That's not good.

491
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,200
 You're chasing it would be awesome.

492
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,560
 I want the strongest zombie possible.

493
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:41,740
 I'm standing in front of the grave of a 19 year old weakling and all of a sudden he's

494
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,140
 like kicking the dirt up and digging.

495
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:48,300
 And I was like, "This guy totally was lame in real life.

496
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,700
 He got wedged all the time.

497
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,820
 I need to bully wedged him to death."

498
00:26:52,820 --> 00:27:00,060
 But he's crawling out of the grave and now I mean like if you were 120 pound weakling,

499
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:05,600
 now you have the strength of a 900 pound man.

500
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,120
 First step of the spell, find the graves.

501
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,760
 Second step, read the poem, read the invocation.

502
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,320
 Third step, spit on it.

503
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,920
 And now this dude's popping out of the grave nine times stronger than he was while he was

504
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,920
 alive.

505
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:21,920
 Step four, you have to wrestle.

506
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:30,040
 You have to wrestle this decaying corpse that just clawed its own way out of the grave.

507
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:35,780
 And I am still, even though I picked this weakling, I'm still now fighting a man who has the strength

508
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,180
 of a 900 pound man.

509
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:40,260
 Actually, no, it wouldn't be the strength of a 900 pound man.

510
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:45,480
 If he had the strength of one 10 year old boy, now he has the strength of nine 10 year

511
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,680
 old boys, which is still quite strong.

512
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:55,780
 Now those of you who stood in front of the grave of a lumberjack or a sea captain, hopefully

513
00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:01,320
 will resurrect you guys as zombies some days.

514
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:04,840
 I probably should have told you before you stood on top of your grave, you're like, oh

515
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,840
 the grave of Paul Bunyan?

516
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,840
 Oh, be a zombie warlord.

517
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,840
 No, no, you're dead.

518
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:13,560
 I should have told you you should have picked the infirm, someone who died of polio or something

519
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,280
 like that, because you gotta wrestle this guy.

520
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:23,320
 And it's not just enough, I mean you figure, you know, corpses generally aren't known for

521
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,680
 being able to stay in one piece.

522
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:30,060
 So you figure you could like rip his arms off and beat him with them, get him in a chokehold,

523
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:34,100
 which I guess probably wouldn't work because he doesn't need to breathe.

524
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:38,260
 But so if you did that and you just have a zombie with no arms, you're like, I didn't

525
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,500
 really think this thing through.

526
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,660
 Sure, I'm still alive.

527
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,660
 That's the plus.

528
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,580
 But now I have a zombie with no arms to do my bidding.

529
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:50,660
 Not only do you have to fight the zombie though, like fighting a 19 year old dead kid, I think

530
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,660
 most of us could take him.

531
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,660
 That's not it.

532
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,640
 It's not like you can just beat him down and you're like, I raced you from the dead to

533
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,640
 beat you back to the earth.

534
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,280
 No, you're wrestling with him for a purpose.

535
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:12,440
 When your zombie crawls out of the grave, you'll notice there is a thick streaming liquid

536
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,080
 pouring out of his nostrils and mouth.

537
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,840
 [Makes a noise]

538
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,680
 He's walking towards you.

539
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:26,140
 It's like the viscosity of snot pouring out of his nostril coming up through his esophagus

540
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:30,540
 and out of his mouth and it's just dripping down his face as he's lumbering towards you.

541
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:34,540
 [Makes a noise]

542
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:41,120
 And you're just watching all this goo bubble out and bubble up from his dead stomach, rotten

543
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,820
 flesh liquefying into this bubbling ooze.

544
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:52,640
 As he limbers towards you to wrap his fingers around your throat and kill you, you lean

545
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,600
 in close.

546
00:29:54,600 --> 00:30:02,640
 You lean in uncomfortably close because not only do you have to wrestle him, you have

547
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,080
 to lick up the goo.

548
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:15,800
 Sucking snot bubbles down your throat, this goo erupts from his innards and out the oaks

549
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,740
 open orifices of his face.

550
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,220
 You're just drinking it up.

551
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,220
 [Makes a noise]

552
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,900
 You're like, Jason, this is clearly not true.

553
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,500
 This is now just making stuff up.

554
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:33,260
 There is not a spell in the world where you're just trying to be gross.

555
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,660
 It's a Friday and you're trying to be gross.

556
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:41,340
 There is no spell in the world where you have to suck up the mucus of a dead man.

557
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:46,040
 And he just doesn't exist.

558
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,480
 It doesn't exist, Jason.

559
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,480
 While you're arguing with me, I'm all warm, warm, warm, warm, I'm eating all this goo.

560
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,480
 It's real.

561
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,480
 It's real.

562
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,800
 Well, let's say it's real according to this Icelandic text.

563
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,000
 I don't know if this works.

564
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,520
 Feel free to try it.

565
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,400
 Amphizellen is going to be out in Iceland for a while.

566
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,400
 Dig up a body.

567
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,400
 Dig up a corpse.

568
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,400
 Lick them up.

569
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,480
 That's what the spell requires.

570
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,780
 You get in there and you suck up all this rot juice.

571
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:15,100
 And it keeps pouring out of his nose and his mouth.

572
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:24,300
 And while he's trying to kill you, you have to lick up all of the mucus off of his face.

573
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,300
 And it keeps coming.

574
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,300
 This is not an easy thing.

575
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,900
 It's not just like a little snail trail.

576
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:33,660
 It keeps pouring out of his dead lungs and his rotten stomach.

577
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,940
 Just lick it up, bros.

578
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,940
 Just lick it up.

579
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,600
 It's one of those Domino's Maranara bread bowls.

580
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,600
 Just use your imagination.

581
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,100
 Put yourself in a better space.

582
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,280
 You're like, "Mmm, mmm, pepperoni flavor."

583
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,480
 And you realize that that was from the inside of his esophagus.

584
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,040
 You're like, "That's weird."

585
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,680
 The mucus was a little chewy that time.

586
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,160
 I think I actually ate dead flesh.

587
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,400
 But keep on licking.

588
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,840
 Warm, warm, warm.

589
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,720
 Why would you want to do this?

590
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,800
 Jason, why would you want to wrestle someone who's nine times stronger in death than they

591
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,000
 were when they were alive?

592
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:13,460
 So even a 19-year-old kid, even like some invalid or some old dude, basically he's nine times

593
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:17,780
 stronger and he has the experience of an old man, why would you want to do this?

594
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:23,340
 And then let's say you do in the fight, the victory lap is you sucking the mucus out of

595
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,900
 his nose.

596
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,900
 Why would you want to do this?

597
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,420
 This is actually a super efficient curse.

598
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,420
 I can't.

599
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:34,580
 I think in the realm of curses, a voodoo doll may work a little bit better.

600
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:39,560
 But this one, once you licked him clean, once you've sucked all of the mucus out of his

601
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:47,600
 nose and out of his mouth, he is now yours to command.

602
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,760
 And you can use him as a servant.

603
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,000
 That is one of the possibilities, right?

604
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,320
 You're like, "Oh, yes, I want to drive a car.

605
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,320
 You're now my chauffeur."

606
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,160
 He's like, "You're hitting up all the hot spots with this carcass in tow."

607
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,560
 And he's not constantly spitting out mucus the rest of the time.

608
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,020
 He's not going to embarrass you.

609
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,900
 He will probably smell like the dead.

610
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,020
 But other than that, you can go out.

611
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,700
 He can be your butler around your house.

612
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,980
 He could probably work your fields if you had some.

613
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:18,900
 Or maybe you just want someone to play chess with.

614
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:22,620
 But that's normally not what the Icelandic zombie is used for.

615
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:28,460
 What happens is you send him after someone you don't like.

616
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,940
 And on the one hand, this is where it would be handy to have a lumberjack, but they're

617
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,140
 just too strong to take down.

618
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,520
 He couldn't tame them in the first place.

619
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:40,920
 So you got to use this skinny old kid, and he'll go and he'll curse your enemy.

620
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,160
 And you figure, "Okay, well then what happens?

621
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,800
 Why doesn't my enemy just chop off this kid's head?"

622
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,640
 And I mean, I ate all the mucus for nothing.

623
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,960
 It's pretty easy to fight.

624
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,800
 I mean, even if he is nine times stronger, if I'm able to beat him, my enemy might be

625
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,960
 able to beat him.

626
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,160
 Apparently it's more complicated than that.

627
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,460
 This zombie will follow your enemy for the rest of his life.

628
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,220
 And I don't know if it's an actual...

629
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,140
 Well, you know what's funny now?

630
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:12,140
 To say that there is no way to kill this.

631
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:15,460
 Like looking at the notes, there is no prescribed way to kill one of these things.

632
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:19,980
 So even if your enemy did chop his head off, I wonder if he regenerates a new head.

633
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:23,180
 Or maybe it can't.

634
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,940
 Maybe it's actually indestructible at this point.

635
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,940
 We don't know.

636
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:29,180
 Well, the reason why I think it's indestructible is it will follow your enemy for the rest of

637
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,020
 his life.

638
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,720
 And I don't know if it's a metaphysical thing.

639
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:37,040
 Like when he closes his eyes, he sees a zombie lurching towards him.

640
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,200
 Or every so often out of the corner of his eye, he sees a zombie in the distance.

641
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,720
 It's like messing with his head, right?

642
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,360
 That could be the case.

643
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,840
 Or it could actually be like, "Oh, those are just hallucinations!"

644
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,440
 As he's ripping the lungs out of your enemy's chest.

645
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,360
 Could be a hallucination, because he's like mentally messing with you.

646
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,680
 He could be in the physical space.

647
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,040
 But I don't think you can kill him because not only will he curse your enemy until the

648
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,400
 day that he dies.

649
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:08,660
 It will also curse the next seven generations of that bloodline.

650
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,300
 So now we're talking deep evil.

651
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:17,100
 Like at that point, you're messing with people who weren't even born when you started tipping

652
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,100
 with this guy.

653
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:22,580
 You were walking up the street one day and he knocked over your fresh goat milk that

654
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,300
 you stole from a widow.

655
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,180
 You're like, "No!"

656
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,780
 By Odin's beard, I will curse you.

657
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:34,640
 You know you're sucking the mucus out of a dead man's beard and you now have the zombie.

658
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,640
 Then like his great...

659
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,640
 What?

660
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,640
 Seven generations?

661
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,640
 That's like great, great...

662
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,640
 It's a bunch of greats.

663
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:44,280
 It's a bunch of great grandmas past, right?

664
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:47,560
 The fascinating story and it's so overpowered.

665
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:52,200
 But it makes sense, because this would be a hard spell to master.

666
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:57,280
 You could easily die doing really any part of this spell, right?

667
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,500
 You could choke on the mucus and die.

668
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:04,980
 You could suffocate when the zombie crashes your windpipe.

669
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,740
 And this is one of those spells I think is so interesting.

670
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:09,900
 If it's real, it would be so hard to get right.

671
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,740
 What happened the very first time someone's like, "Hey, I came up with this incantation.

672
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,740
 Let's see if it works."

673
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:18,420
 And he says it and a zombie jumps out of the grave and rips the guy in too.

674
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:23,020
 Some of the incantation just collects dust for a couple hundred years and then someone

675
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:28,160
 goes, "Hey, remember that time when Joe tried raising the dead?

676
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,160
 I mean, it worked.

677
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,960
 The zombie jumped up and killed him.

678
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,840
 He was super strong.

679
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,840
 I saw him.

680
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,640
 He ripped that dude in half.

681
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:42,960
 So I'm going to try this incantation again, but I'm going to get some dead weakling.

682
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,040
 Whatever happened to Tony?

683
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,040
 Remember Tony?

684
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,480
 He died like a beast on them or something like that?

685
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,760
 Let's go and use this incantation on him.

686
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,000
 So now this guy jumps up and they're like, "Wow, Tony, you're really strong for a guy

687
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,240
 who's allergic to bees."

688
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,700
 But they're able to wrestle him, but then all this mucus is coming out of his face

689
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,620
 and they're like, "Dude, I don't know how to beat this guy.

690
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,460
 We've been wrestling for three days straight.

691
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,020
 I eat their own bees in them.

692
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,020
 That's not working.

693
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,020
 Either help."

694
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:10,980
 And that guy gets ripped apart because eventually you would just get tired of trying to eat

695
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,980
 breakfast.

696
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,660
 The zombie's still wrestling and you're like, "No, I need nutrients."

697
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:18,380
 And then eventually over time you'd be like, "Maybe.

698
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,380
 This is the only different guy.

699
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,060
 This is like 200 years after that."

700
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,980
 They're like, "Well, those other two guys.

701
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,980
 They've really raised the dead.

702
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,440
 They're both been ripped to pieces."

703
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,440
 What if?

704
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,960
 Now just hang with me for a second, guys.

705
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,480
 I'm going to sound crazy.

706
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:36,160
 Every time these zombies pop up, all this mucus is shooting out of their nose and their mouth,

707
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,160
 right?

708
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:40,600
 And the other magic users are like, "Yeah, that's what we've heard from the reports."

709
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,680
 And this guy goes, "Well, maybe.

710
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:49,480
 What if when one of these zombies, let's use the spell, we'll get a weakling like the last

711
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,480
 guy did because that seemed to work a little bit better.

712
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,980
 But when this guy jumps out of the grave, what if we suck the mucus off of his face?"

713
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:04,500
 The magicians are like, "Where did you make that connection?

714
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,820
 Why do you think that would make the spell more efficient?"

715
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,820
 He's like, "Oh, what?

716
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,820
 We're trying to make the spell more efficient?

717
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,620
 I just like sucking mucus up.

718
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,420
 That's my huge fetish."

719
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:18,060
 So he raises the dead and he sucks the mucus off of his face.

720
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:23,280
 And then the zombies are like, "You're bidding, master."

721
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:29,240
 He's like, "Wow, who knew that my crippling fetish that has kept me from building a bond

722
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,200
 with other humans would actually come in handy, right?

723
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:37,440
 I successfully not only raised the zombie and sucked up all the mucus I wanted to, but

724
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,440
 now it works.

725
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,440
 He's my slave.

726
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,440
 You would figure there would have to be steps.

727
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,760
 It's not like some guy walked out there with an incantation set at a zombie, jumped up.

728
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,180
 He picked the right zombie to begin with and then he started sucking the mucus.

729
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:51,060
 These spells would have to take place over time.

730
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,340
 Same thing with science, right?

731
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:59,620
 No one sat there a long time ago and goes, "Hmm, if I poured this vinegar into this baking

732
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:03,420
 powder or baking soda, I probably should get the terms right."

733
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,820
 Well, no, I'm sure at first the guy goes, "Hey, here's some vinegar and here's some

734
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,820
 baking powder."

735
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,820
 And he pours it in and he's like, "What?

736
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,020
 I don't know what I expected.

737
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,500
 I don't know what I expected."

738
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,200
 And he's walking around with a vial of vinegar and he's pouring it on different things.

739
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,560
 He's pouring it on people.

740
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,880
 He finds a squirrel in the woods.

741
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,880
 He's pouring vinegar on him.

742
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,760
 He's like, "Oh, man.

743
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,800
 The squirrel just runs away all wet."

744
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,920
 He's pouring it on apples and he's like, "I don't know what this vinegar is going to

745
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,920
 do.

746
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,920
 I don't know what I'm expecting.

747
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,920
 This I own vinegar.

748
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,920
 I own a vinegar store.

749
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:39,560
 I have unlimited supplies of vinegar and I'm a scientist on the side, but vinegar isn't

750
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,560
 doing anything.

751
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,760
 It's making things super tasty.

752
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,340
 A bear is eating that squirrel.

753
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,740
 He's like, "Yummy, yummy.

754
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,220
 Oh, man.

755
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,980
 I guess I'm not cut out to be a scientist."

756
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:53,700
 And then in a fit of rage, he knocks over all of his vinegar, all of his vinegar and

757
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,900
 starts a little flood.

758
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,620
 And then next door, the baking soda store just opens.

759
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,620
 Some guy's like, "Oh, my life's wandering.

760
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:03,460
 It's a store of nothing but baking soda.

761
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,460
 Oh, I love this.

762
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,460
 Oh, man.

763
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,460
 Mom's going to be so proud of me."

764
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:09,140
 And then a tidal wave of vinegar hits the store.

765
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,880
 He's like, "What's going on?"

766
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,480
 And then all of a sudden, everything starts bubbling up.

767
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,480
 Science.

768
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,880
 That's how you figure stuff out.

769
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,760
 You have to figure out these cause and effects.

770
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,480
 You have to figure out these things.

771
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,240
 It wouldn't come to you all in one blow.

772
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,080
 Although I will say, "Well, wrap it up like this."

773
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:31,520
 This casual episode ended up being the regular episode, which wasn't my intention.

774
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,960
 It's possible that, yes, it was trial and error to figure out that spell perfectly.

775
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:40,820
 It's also possible that they got the spell from somewhere else.

776
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,580
 Not necessarily like another book.

777
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:46,060
 Like the people, I'm talking about the people who discovered the spell.

778
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:50,540
 It's possible that it was given to them by infernal forces, right?

779
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:56,340
 If you're like a witch or a warlock, you're probably just asking demons, "Hey, I don't

780
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,340
 want to raise a zombie."

781
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:00,620
 You're probably not out there with a vial of vinegar trying to figure it out.

782
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,540
 You probably get it from a demon.

783
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:03,540
 Or it's also possible.

784
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,540
 I think this is interesting.

785
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:09,600
 I don't really talk about it a lot on the show, and I made a reference to it earlier.

786
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,600
 Drug use, right?

787
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:17,560
 I don't know if they have shrooms in Iceland, but I wonder, we talked a long time ago on

788
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:23,280
 the show about how did shamans, how did medicine men in the past figure out which foods were

789
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,040
 poisonous, which foods were medicinal, and which foods were edible?

790
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,760
 It would take a lot of trial and error.

791
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,280
 I think a lot of it would probably be observing animals and being like, "Yeah, probably shouldn't

792
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,280
 eat that."

793
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:39,220
 There's just a giant ocean of dead taper around a particular tree.

794
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,940
 They're like, "Yeah, stay away from that tree."

795
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,500
 And probably not eat these taper either.

796
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:50,620
 I wonder how much of it was like tripping off drugs, tripping off shrooms, tripping off

797
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:52,420
 natural hallucinogens.

798
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,140
 They would have these visions.

799
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:59,020
 They would have a vision of them raising the dead.

800
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,020
 You know what I mean?

801
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,160
 I wonder if there is an Icelandic...

802
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,120
 I wonder what type of drugs they have in Iceland.

803
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,120
 Not nowadays.

804
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,120
 Now they just have Trank.

805
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,400
 Now they just have Fetanol like the rest of the world.

806
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:15,920
 But back then, I wonder if it was shamans tripping on drugs and they're seeing this happen.

807
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,720
 They're seeing this spell and they're seeing all the components.

808
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:23,300
 Because yeah, just getting the incantation right would be difficult in and of itself.

809
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:29,560
 Possibly drug use, possibly a drug fuel trip, possibly demonic influences.

810
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,540
 For this particular spell, I don't think all magics would come from demons.

811
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:36,860
 I think you could argue different magic comes from different sources, but I can't imagine

812
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:40,500
 many guardian angels van like, "I am here to protect you.

813
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:45,100
 However, I do take a three week long break in the middle of summer, so I will teach you

814
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,140
 how to raise your own zombie warlord."

815
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:55,380
 I don't really see Gabriel or Michael letting the Icelandic wizards know all that stuff.

816
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,100
 But it's a fascinating story.

817
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,300
 And I hope you guys enjoyed it.

818
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:03,640
 I hope this episode's so casual it doesn't even have an ending.

819
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,080
 But yeah, I hope you guys have a great weekend.

820
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:10,680
 I plan on having a much better weekend this time, blood clot free.

821
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,840
 So yeah, everything's going great.

822
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,240
 And I hope you guys have a great weekend.

823
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:19,120
 This is lazy, so this might be the laziest anything I've ever done of Dead Rabbit Radio.

824
