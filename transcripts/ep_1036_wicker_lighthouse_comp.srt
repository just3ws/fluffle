1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,240
 A man develops bizarre conspiracy theories when an accordion player shows up in his neighborhood.

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:20,400
 And then we meet a homicide detective who's currently investigating a possible suicide.

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,200
 All evidence leads him to believe that this man did indeed kill himself.

4
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:33,280
 But it's the Wicker Lighthouse sitting on the mantle that makes him wonder if something

5
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,640
 darker happened to him.

6
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,400
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:49,640
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,800
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,800
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,200
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:59,440
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing out there in the world.

12
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,240
 We got a lot of stuff to cover so we're going to get started right away.

13
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:08,480
 First off, oozing into Dead Rabbit Command is one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

14
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,960
 Everyone give all 10 hands up in the air for a creamy squid.

15
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,960
 Woohoo!

16
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,960
 Yeah!

17
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,920
 You're like, "Why are we talking about 10 hands?"

18
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,080
 And oozing because it's a creamy squid.

19
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,480
 You're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

20
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,720
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

21
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,720
 I do.

22
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,640
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

23
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,680
 That helps out so much.

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,280
 Creamy, let's go ahead and talk to the hair hang glider and everyone else grab onto a tentacle.

25
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,880
 Jump off the highest point of Dead Rabbit Command Creamy and glide us all the way out

26
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,160
 to an apartment complex.

27
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,920
 I found this story online.

28
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,960
 We don't have a specific location.

29
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,960
 But who knows?

30
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,960
 Maybe it's your neighborhood as I told the story.

31
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,960
 You're like, "Oh yeah, that's not kind of familiar."

32
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,760
 I also have been highly annoyed lately.

33
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,840
 But not just annoyed.

34
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,760
 This isn't just about an annoying accordion player.

35
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,880
 There's something darker might be at work here.

36
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,880
 This guy didn't give his real name.

37
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,680
 We're going to go ahead and call him Mike.

38
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:19,480
 He said that last summer, this all started in summertime of 2022, something very bizarre

39
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,720
 has been happening in his neighborhood.

40
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,720
 It's been going on up until...

41
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,960
 Well, he posted this in January 2023.

42
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,640
 So it's been going on at least until then.

43
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,200
 He may have already gone mad or murdered this guy.

44
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,200
 We don't know.

45
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,760
 He could be in prison as I speak.

46
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:45,680
 But he said, "Listen, last summer, about 20 feet from my front door, an accordion player

47
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,400
 shows up every morning and begins playing the accordion."

48
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,320
 You're like, "That's not particularly supernatural."

49
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,440
 And I would say the same thing as well.

50
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,440
 Highly annoying?

51
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,440
 Yes.

52
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,120
 A little rude?

53
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,120
 Probably.

54
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,960
 Accordions, they're not the quietest instrument.

55
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,960
 It's not like someone showed up and was playing the triangle all day long.

56
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,320
 I guess that would probably get annoying too if just for eight hours someone was going

57
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:10,320
 "Ding-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de-ling-de

58
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:38,720
 to play the triangle.

59
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,560
 He uses the word apparition a lot.

60
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,480
 But let's take a look.

61
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,480
 Is he correct?

62
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,480
 Is this some sort of phantasmal force?

63
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,080
 Or is it just a big old weirdo?

64
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,080
 Let's find out.

65
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:55,960
 A lady sits there and within 20 feet of his front door, he lives in this apartment complex,

66
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:01,400
 20 feet away from his front door, she begins playing the accordion.

67
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,880
 And to make it in case she wants to irritate everyone in the area, her accordion is hooked

68
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,760
 up to a loudspeaker.

69
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,120
 So apparently they have that now.

70
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,560
 Some mad scientist was like, "How can I make this even more horrible?"

71
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,440
 She brings over a little loudspeaker.

72
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,440
 I don't think she's holding a megaphone in front of it.

73
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:30,200
 She hooks it up to this loudspeaker and she plays, when she's there, again, he goes when

74
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:35,280
 the weather was good during summer, it was every single day.

75
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,840
 And she played from 8am to 8pm.

76
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,400
 Now you can be like, "Jason, listen man, the accordion is a classic instrument.

77
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,280
 Classic German instrument, right?

78
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,400
 Bavaria, something like that.

79
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,040
 It's been played for centuries.

80
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,520
 You can play beautiful music on the accordion.

81
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,040
 You might be able to, right?

82
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,720
 You might be able to play some dope tunes with the accordion.

83
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,360
 She played four.

84
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,000
 So even if you are an accordion aficionado, right now you have a little monkey on your

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,840
 shoulder and he's like punching his own hand, you're like, "Yeah, we'll get on one of these

86
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,840
 days.

87
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,840
 Let's finish listening to this episode."

88
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:20,800
 Even if you do think accordion music is good, this woman for 12 hours would play the same

89
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,160
 four songs.

90
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,400
 So nobody can put up with that, right?

91
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,360
 Nobody can deal with that.

92
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,360
 She played.

93
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,120
 Some of these make sense.

94
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,120
 The Godfather theme.

95
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:38,120
 Actually, I think that's the X-Men theme.

96
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,280
 No, that definitely is the X-Men theme.

97
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,760
 You know the Godfather theme.

98
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,400
 No, that's not it either.

99
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,880
 But anyway, she played the Godfather theme on her accordion.

100
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,880
 That was song one.

101
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,360
 Remember four songs?

102
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,440
 Four songs in total.

103
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,800
 12 hours throughout the day.

104
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,160
 8am to 8pm.

105
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,880
 She played the Godfather theme.

106
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:10,600
 She played "Hallelujah," which I think is the song from, it was the song from the Watchmen

107
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,680
 trailer, right?

108
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,680
 Or Batman v Superman.

109
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,480
 Yeah, well yeah, yeah, they use it in the Justice League trailer.

110
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,480
 That song.

111
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,760
 Hallelujah, hallelujah.

112
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,920
 She's playing that on the accordion.

113
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,520
 She's playing, "My heart will go on."

114
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,960
 Right there, you're like, "Okay, okay, call the cops."

115
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,960
 Call the cops.

116
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:38,760
 I can handle those first two songs for 12 hours.

117
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,520
 So those are three of the songs.

118
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,640
 And the fourth song is an odd choice.

119
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,640
 Think about what we had.

120
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,640
 The Godfather theme, I'm pretty sure there's like an accordion in that.

121
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:54,880
 But I think I'm also confusing it with the theme song for the X-Men cartoon.

122
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,880
 So who knows?

123
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,520
 The Godfather theme, "Hallelujah," "My heart will go on."

124
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,480
 And then Despacito, what's the fourth song?

125
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,960
 Which listen, I could probably listen to that on accordion for 12 hours and be like, "I

126
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,320
 don't know what the name of that fourth song is.

127
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,680
 I can't place it."

128
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,160
 I've probably heard the song Despacito like three times.

129
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,520
 And that's not an exaggeration.

130
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,640
 And I've only heard the Justin Bieber version.

131
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,640
 I could not even try.

132
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,640
 Despacito, I have no idea what that song sounds like.

133
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,160
 You could hook that up to my ear and I'm like, "What song is this?"

134
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,600
 Because my head explodes because again, I don't want to be 20 feet away from an accordion,

135
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,640
 let alone have it hooked up to my head.

136
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,920
 So Mike goes, "Listen, man, I am in my apartment."

137
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,640
 This is so funny.

138
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,760
 I think this is so funny, but this guy kind of loses it.

139
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,840
 And this would make sense.

140
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,120
 He goes, "When she's out there," and again, most of the time she is.

141
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,160
 And during the summer, she's there every day and it's 12 hours long.

142
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,000
 No matter where you go in Mike's apartment, you can clearly hear this music, which would

143
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,880
 make sense because it's only 20 feet outside your door.

144
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:10,560
 And apartments, while very affordable and very convenient, they're not known to be the quietest

145
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,200
 of places anyways.

146
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,440
 The walls, right?

147
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,920
 They always skimp on the walls.

148
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,880
 Now you've got someone out there playing Despacito.

149
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,800
 But here's the thing.

150
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,440
 She's out there, she has her little cup, right?

151
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,440
 She's taking donations.

152
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,600
 That's why she's doing it.

153
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,200
 Like that is, well, as Mike would explain the cover story of what she's doing, she's

154
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,080
 out there with her accordion.

155
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,640
 She's playing the Godfather theme.

156
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,440
 Someone's like, "Oh, I really love that cartoon.

157
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,560
 I heard they were making new ones," flip her a coin.

158
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,120
 She's getting money for these songs.

159
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,120
 She's out there.

160
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,320
 She's basically a panhandler, right?

161
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,120
 She's playing these songs.

162
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,160
 But Mike realized something.

163
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,760
 When she's playing these songs, she's playing "My Heart Will Go On" on her accordion and

164
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,560
 someone walks up and goes, "Oh, that's my favorite song," and gives this lady a dollar.

165
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,440
 The lady stops playing the music.

166
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,040
 Obviously she has to take her hands off the accordion keys to get the dollar.

167
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,800
 But the music keeps playing.

168
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,680
 So it's like hooked up to a tape recorder.

169
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:22,040
 Apparently she's not even playing this stuff originally.

170
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:28,400
 Mike says she pretends to play the accordion and it's just a tape.

171
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:36,360
 It's the same four songs because it's pre-recorded, which to me would make it a hundred times

172
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:42,560
 worse because if it was her playing those four songs and she's doing it at random.

173
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,440
 So maybe she does Despacito twice, but you don't know what's going to come after Despacito.

174
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,400
 Maybe it'll be the god-foguling after her choices.

175
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,720
 But there would be...

176
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,720
 It's like watching the DVD thing bounce around the screen, the DVD screensaver, because it's

177
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,720
 random.

178
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,720
 There's a chance.

179
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,600
 I'm going to be sitting there with my buddies and be like, "What do we bet on next?

180
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,560
 We bet on all of us blowing our brains out because we don't want to hear any of it."

181
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,480
 But guys, guys, guys, let's just forget that bet.

182
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,240
 I bet you five bucks.

183
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,240
 The next song...

184
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,880
 Because you would think you have a one-in-four shot, but it actually...

185
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,160
 Because it's so random.

186
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,160
 Would it be?

187
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,160
 Would it be?

188
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,040
 Because I guess it would be one-in-four, but who knows?

189
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,840
 You can make a party game out of it.

190
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:35,720
 But if it's pre-recorded, it's the same four songs in the same order for 12 hours.

191
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,340
 So as you're listening to Despacito, you're like, "Oh no, there's only 32 seconds left

192
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,340
 of the song."

193
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,600
 And I'm like, "I'm not going to do that because I've listened to this song every day for

194
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
 12 hours for a month.

195
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,480
 I know there's only 32 seconds left of the song.

196
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,480
 Oh no."

197
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,120
 And then my heart will go on.

198
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,120
 We'll start.

199
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,280
 And that song is like five minutes and 44 seconds.

200
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,880
 You would know all of this stuff and there would be no stopping it.

201
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,800
 Just a pre-recorded on a loop.

202
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:09,400
 Well, it's funny that I say no stopping it, because here's the question about this.

203
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:16,300
 How much of this is true in the sense that I do believe there is a woman playing the accordion

204
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,460
 outside his house?

205
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:23,940
 The question is, is Mike delusional?

206
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:29,580
 Is Mike actually hallucinating the crazier parts of this?

207
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,580
 You know what I mean?

208
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,860
 Like, I'm wondering, because he says when she takes her hands off the accordion, the music

209
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,620
 still plays, is he all there?

210
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,240
 I guess it's my question that we don't know.

211
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,920
 Like, is he referring to this flesh and blood woman that other people are interacting with?

212
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,640
 She sets her stuff up, she takes money, she packs up and leaves at the end of the night.

213
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,200
 He calls her an apparition.

214
00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:00,320
 So I think it's a physical person doing a physical thing, but I think his paranoia is starting

215
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,920
 to get the best of him.

216
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,920
 She probably, when she takes her hands off the accordion, she takes the money.

217
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:13,420
 She does stop playing, but Mike is, his brain is so scrambled from hearing this for so long

218
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,700
 that in the absence of the music, he still hears the music.

219
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,780
 That'd be my guess, because he starts to have some crazy thoughts about this lady.

220
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:32,340
 He believes that this is psychological warfare, that she is not simply there to collect money

221
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:37,520
 for her talent, but she is there for a far more nefarious reason.

222
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,480
 He believes that this woman out there is up to no good.

223
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,400
 He says, you know, the music is so loud, we can hear it anywhere in his apartment, which

224
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,320
 is just so funny, right?

225
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,320
 No matter where he goes out in his apartment, he can hear it.

226
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,280
 It's so loud.

227
00:12:54,280 --> 00:13:00,800
 But he doesn't understand why nobody is doing anything to stop it.

228
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,540
 And it's interesting, he doesn't specifically say, well, I walked out there and talked to

229
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,060
 her a couple of times and told her to knock it off, it's too loud.

230
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:12,020
 As far as we can tell from this account, he hasn't done it either.

231
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,580
 He finds it all that nobody has.

232
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,060
 The apartment manager hasn't.

233
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,220
 Some of his more wily, excitable neighbors haven't walked out there.

234
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,500
 Hey, shut that racket off.

235
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,500
 Nothing.

236
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,340
 No one has ever complained about the music that's so loud.

237
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:29,300
 And it is an apartment complex, so everyone in his building would be hearing this stuff

238
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,300
 constantly.

239
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,000
 And we can't figure out why nobody is doing anything about it.

240
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,600
 And it's interesting because according to this account, he hasn't either.

241
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:45,160
 So he is almost like he sees this as some sort of anomaly.

242
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:50,040
 It is odd that someone can sit there and play the accordion for 12 hours and nobody, not

243
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:56,160
 only nobody complained people actively, giving her money.

244
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,640
 Maybe it's set up that only he can hear it all the time.

245
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,500
 People are coming from the other edge of the apartment complex and they're like, "Keep

246
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,500
 playing.

247
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,940
 Play Despacito twice as much this next hour."

248
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,860
 He thinks that it's psychological warfare.

249
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:15,060
 He says that when this person shows up, they plug their accordion into the loudspeaker,

250
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:23,940
 all of a sudden the atmosphere feels so thick that you can hardly breathe.

251
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,460
 And I think that's why he's calling this woman an apparition.

252
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:34,800
 Because she has some sort of, she's basically affecting the environment as if she was encrypted.

253
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,260
 The air becomes so thick you can't breathe.

254
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:41,800
 It's interesting because he said, "People in the, when she is playing, he says people

255
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,440
 in the area are overcome with fear and anxiety."

256
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:51,960
 So it's, you wonder, so are other people in the apartment complex complaining about her

257
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,960
 but not to her directly?

258
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,640
 Because he's saying that other people are kind of freaking out.

259
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,980
 Or again, is he having some sort of weird breakdown?

260
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:05,820
 Well, him and his wife, to be exact, because she's also in on this act, he said, "What

261
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:11,260
 we began to do is we began to keep a written document."

262
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,780
 We're tracking this.

263
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:19,860
 Whenever the accordion lady is outside playing, we track and monitor other people's behavior

264
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,860
 in the area.

265
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,860
 We're taking notes.

266
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,460
 We're watching how they react.

267
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,640
 And they're always amped up.

268
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,880
 They're always anxious, frightful.

269
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,840
 They seem to just want to get from one place to another as quick as possible, eyes darting

270
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,200
 in every direction.

271
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,560
 They're not well.

272
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:42,600
 But when the accordion lady is not there, everything is at peace.

273
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,600
 The other people walking by seem happier.

274
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,440
 I'm definitely happier.

275
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,200
 The air is once again easy to breathe.

276
00:15:51,200 --> 00:16:00,500
 We're documenting all of this to see if we can understand the phenomenon of the accordion

277
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:06,540
 apparition.

278
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,980
 It's super fascinating because the way I look at it is, I believe that this is real.

279
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:14,380
 An accordion lady is really doing this.

280
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,200
 And some of it may be exaggerated.

281
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,540
 Maybe she doesn't play for 12 hours a day.

282
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,960
 It wouldn't surprise me if she did, if she's panhandling.

283
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,160
 But that could be true.

284
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,840
 The part of the air becoming suffocating and everyone in the area being super nervous and

285
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,120
 anxious, but nobody talks to her.

286
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,240
 No one goes up to her and tries to tell her to stop.

287
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,520
 Almost again, like some sort of supernatural force is keeping them from doing that.

288
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:43,640
 I believe these are exaggerations of a excited mind.

289
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,120
 When you look at this, so we called him Mike.

290
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,300
 The name he goes by online is Morningstar360.

291
00:16:51,300 --> 00:17:01,140
 You look at some of his other posts and he posts a lot on a subreddit called Vagabond,

292
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:06,540
 which is basically travelers/homeless people.

293
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:12,140
 And he also has a couple posts about selling his plasma.

294
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:16,680
 So I don't know.

295
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,680
 I don't know.

296
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,880
 He's like, it's so weird.

297
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,880
 Every time after I sell my plasma, I come home.

298
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,920
 I have a hard time breathing and everyone around me is acting weird.

299
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:31,200
 I think he definitely has some lifestyle choices going on himself.

300
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,360
 But the reason why I wanted to cover this story was one, I find it fascinating.

301
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,080
 It does seem like psychological warfare.

302
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:43,380
 It does seem like some sort of government plot to artificially create a mass shooting.

303
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:48,020
 But at the same time, if it isn't, if this isn't some sort of government plot, if this

304
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:54,260
 isn't some sort of demon that's taking the form of this lady to drive people slowly mad,

305
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:59,540
 these are the beginnings of stories that we don't see when we're reading the news.

306
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:03,740
 And it's like a woman beaten to death with brick.

307
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:09,440
 You start reading the article and it's like a man came out of his apartment today and

308
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,080
 beat a woman to death with a brick.

309
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,080
 We don't know why.

310
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,080
 We have no idea why.

311
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,080
 That's the whole article.

312
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,080
 It's like three sentences.

313
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,080
 You're like, what?

314
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,080
 That's kind of weird.

315
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,080
 Did he get arrested?

316
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,080
 Is he still on the loose?

317
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,080
 Ah!

318
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:28,120
 Like this could easily be the beginning of one of those stories or just a man goes nuts,

319
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,080
 slaughters, homeless woman.

320
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,600
 You're like, huh?

321
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,780
 You don't know why.

322
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,380
 You have no idea why.

323
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:41,300
 And it's because she was playing the accordion for 12 hours a day and it's possible that

324
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,300
 there is no accordion play.

325
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:47,940
 Yes, the other thing is it could just be a full on elucination going on.

326
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,700
 Because yeah, parts of the story don't make sense.

327
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,140
 Why wouldn't other people be coming out there?

328
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:56,500
 It could be someone who blazed the accordion for 30 minutes and leaves.

329
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,900
 It could just be nothing.

330
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,960
 It could, to be fair, it could be an accordion player for 12 hours, which again would be

331
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,840
 the funniest option.

332
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,520
 But it's possible that this is all a hallucination and one of these days he's going to come running

333
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:15,880
 out of his apartment with a baseball bat and he's just going to splatter somebody at random

334
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,840
 and think they were the accordion player.

335
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,960
 It's possible, right?

336
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,640
 So basically the moral of the story is don't leave your house for the next couple of months.

337
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,820
 If you live in an apartment complex, especially, we don't know where this took place, but you

338
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,140
 might be neighbors with this guy.

339
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,260
 If you ever wake up in the middle of the night and you're like, "Dude, why is that dude stomping

340
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,260
 around, stomping around the house?"

341
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,260
 And you're like, "What?"

342
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,660
 He's dancing, he's dancing those songs of infected his head.

343
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,540
 He's just dancing to the Godfather theme and you're like, "What?

344
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,540
 This is weird.

345
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,420
 This is super weird."

346
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,180
 And then he's like, "I've finally given in.

347
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,980
 I've finally, I'm just dancing to the tune of the accordion lady."

348
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,060
 And you're like looking around, you're like, "What accordion lady?"

349
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:59,840
 And he's dancing, he's like, "The song's gonna change, song's gonna change in 30 seconds."

350
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:05,200
 And then he's dancing to Despacito and you're like, "What in the world is going on?"

351
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,200
 That's possible too.

352
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,200
 That's possible too.

353
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,200
 So basically don't talk to your neighbors for the next couple of months.

354
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,200
 I don't know.

355
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,200
 That's not scary.

356
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,720
 I don't know why I ended it with that.

357
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:18,600
 That'd be fun if your neighbor went psychotic, but he just danced, danced to songs that

358
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,840
 nobody else could hear.

359
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,320
 I mean, as long as he's not trying to slow dance with you till my heart will go on, you

360
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,380
 just be like, "Dance, dance, dance, buddy, dance."

361
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:30,700
 You're charging people to come in his apartment and he's like crying.

362
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,700
 His feet are bloody.

363
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,180
 He's like, "I can't stop dancing."

364
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:37,140
 And you're like, "25 cents to see the crazy man's bloody feet."

365
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,820
 So many people.

366
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,820
 There now that's scary.

367
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,940
 Now you're the bad guy in that one.

368
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,940
 A creamy squid.

369
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,140
 Let's go ahead and call in that carpenter copter where leave behind this dancing man and his

370
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,140
 bloody feet.

371
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,740
 Fly us all the way out to a police station.

372
00:20:51,740 --> 00:21:02,240
 We're walking into the police station and I'm like, "Okay, we need to get into the police

373
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,240
 station.

374
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,400
 I'm not just going to let us into where we want to go."

375
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,400
 So I grab you and I put your arms behind your back and I put handcuffs on you and I'm like,

376
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,400
 "I got him.

377
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,400
 I got him.

378
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,400
 I got that big old pervert.

379
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,400
 I got that pervert."

380
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,240
 He's been attacking people.

381
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,600
 He's been playing the accordion, all sorts of crazy stuff.

382
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,600
 And he's super perverted.

383
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,820
 And the cops are like, "Take him down the hall."

384
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,220
 And I was like, "Don't worry, buddy.

385
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,180
 I'll clear your name in a second."

386
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:30,060
 So we're walking down the hallway and I'm like, "Yeah, I'm drawing more attention to

387
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,060
 you."

388
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,780
 We stop by the jail and we're like, "Look at his face.

389
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,260
 This guy's a pervert, everybody."

390
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,260
 Don't worry.

391
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,260
 Don't worry.

392
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,260
 Don't worry.

393
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,860
 These prisoners have short-term memories.

394
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,860
 We walk in and finally we get to the office.

395
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:46,100
 After I took a loop, I drive to the local mall.

396
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,420
 Look at this pervert.

397
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:55,800
 Finally, finally after two days of introducing him to the neighborhood, we are at the desk

398
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,800
 of a homicide investigator.

399
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,840
 He didn't give his real name online, for obvious reasons, right?

400
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,200
 You don't talk about this stuff when you're in this profession.

401
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,760
 But we're going to go ahead and call him Steven.

402
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,840
 And Steven at this point, he's not a homicide investigator anymore, but he goes, "I used

403
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:17,760
 to be a homicide investigator and part of working homicide is you're also working suicides.

404
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,300
 We do treat suicides as-" because we don't know, right?

405
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,900
 We're just getting a call of a dead body.

406
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:29,100
 If it's some 98-year-old lady who died in her bed, we're like, "Yeah, case closed.

407
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,820
 We're all of her limbs have been removed."

408
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,420
 They're like, "Yeah, but she was 98.

409
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,100
 It's probably natural causes."

410
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:40,300
 Obviously, if you find an old person dead in bed, you're not going to be looking for

411
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,300
 suspects.

412
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,500
 But if she had like, literature marks or all of her limbs removed, that's a case.

413
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:50,240
 And he goes, "We do treat suicides as homicides until we know otherwise."

414
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,200
 And he goes, "It's actually pretty easy to tell for the most part."

415
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:03,720
 There's a lot of not just forensic evidence that points to a suicide, but personal evidence.

416
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,680
 He goes, "Obviously, you have the traditional suicide note."

417
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,640
 But he goes, "There's also a lot of stuff, especially with social media.

418
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:18,820
 People are posting what in hindsight seem like worrisome posts, but at the time, you're

419
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:23,700
 just like, "Oh, that's just Billy again posting just those crazy, crazy things.

420
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,300
 I'm going to kill myself tonight.

421
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,740
 Oh, Billy's been doing that for years."

422
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,940
 Sometimes it'll be things like that, like canceling plans.

423
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,500
 People are going to go to the concert in the last minute.

424
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,020
 I'm not going to go to the concert, and then you find that person dead.

425
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:44,360
 All of these things can be put together to say that this is a suicide.

426
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:50,320
 One of them may not, as far as the other things, like the social stuff, a lot of times people

427
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,680
 give stuff away, even minor things.

428
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,240
 Even like, "Hey, you want to come over and pick up those toys you've always been telling?"

429
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,400
 "Yeah, I know you love my Star Trek Deep Space Nine extra figures.

430
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
 Why don't you come by and pick them up?"

431
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
 "Are you serious?"

432
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,400
 "Yeah, yeah, yeah."

433
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,880
 I just don't have anywhere to put them.

434
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:11,580
 Something like that coupled with your body in a chair and a bunch of pills, a bunch of

435
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,940
 empty pill bottles, they'd be like, "Well, forensically, it looks like a suicide.

436
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,300
 We're going to do a drug test and find out if he took these pills."

437
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:22,180
 Plus added to these other things that he did, sometimes major or minor.

438
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,500
 It could straight up be a suicide note.

439
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:27,340
 It could just be signs that people were ready to move on.

440
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,060
 Both of those things can lead to it.

441
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:36,680
 Now some cases, though, only have forensic evidence of a suicide.

442
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:41,920
 He goes, "Those are more rare, where there is absolutely zero clue.

443
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,240
 There's no past attempts of suicide.

444
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,240
 There's no talks of suicidal ideation earlier in life.

445
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,240
 They haven't had anyone in their family ever kill themselves.

446
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,760
 No weird Facebook posts.

447
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,880
 No goodbye notes.

448
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,280
 Nothing."

449
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,980
 And they're sitting in their chair.

450
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,700
 All the pills are gone.

451
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:09,900
 And when they get taken to the coroner, he goes, "Yeah, he ingested like 300 Tylenol."

452
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,580
 That would be a forensically provable suicide.

453
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:19,900
 So you have this situation, this homicide investigator going about this.

454
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:26,460
 Stephen, and he goes, "I've had 10 cases, only 10 across his entire career.

455
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:33,760
 I had 10 cases that were suicides without any of the social moments, without any of

456
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:39,480
 the suicide notes, social media postings, giving things away, worrying concerns from

457
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,240
 loved ones, past incidents, talk of suicide, suicide attempts."

458
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,240
 None of that.

459
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,040
 He goes, "The only thing is that when you looked at the scene, it was forensically

460
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,560
 determined to only be a suicide."

461
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,280
 I've had 10 of those.

462
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,600
 They are very, very rare.

463
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,700
 There's usually at least one thing that even, it may not have noticed it at the time, but

464
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,500
 in hindsight you go, "Oh, that's why they posted that."

465
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,940
 You know, it's not always these super dramatic things.

466
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:10,060
 He goes, "I've had 10 cases like that."

467
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:21,620
 And he said, "My eighth case, my eighth case of a suicide like that, I walk into the scene.

468
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,800
 This person had killed themselves."

469
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,680
 And just looking at it, I can tell that that's probably what it is.

470
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,680
 That's most likely the corner report's going to come back, that this was a self-inflicted

471
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,680
 wound.

472
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,400
 This person had killed themselves.

473
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,400
 But again, there's no other proof that this person would kill themselves other than the

474
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,920
 forensic proof.

475
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:49,360
 I'm looking at this scene and I notice on the nightstand is a little decorative item,

476
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,940
 a little souvenir.

477
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,700
 It's a wicker lighthouse.

478
00:26:53,700 --> 00:27:01,140
 It's a little model of a lighthouse made with wicker and it's painted white and blue.

479
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,140
 And I never would have noticed that.

480
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,660
 Out of everything, you walk into somebody's house for the very first time, and most likely

481
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:11,820
 last time, you're walking into someone's house, you're doing your job, you show up, you're

482
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:15,700
 looking at everything in the house, you're being led into the room where this person killed

483
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:21,120
 themselves, and I saw that wicker lighthouse, that white and blue wicker lighthouse.

484
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:32,320
 And the only reason I noticed it was because I had seen it before on my seventh case of

485
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:37,760
 an unidentified suicide.

486
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:44,680
 Suicide that has no outward motive or suggestion that it was going to happen.

487
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:49,940
 The last time that happened, the last time that I was investigating one of these suicides,

488
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,300
 out of ten it was the seventh one.

489
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:56,740
 I remember I was in the room with the body and something caught my attention and I looked

490
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:05,060
 over and on the nightstand was a wicker lighthouse painted white and blue.

491
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,580
 And I noticed that when I was on that crime scene, but I mean I see a bunch of stuff on

492
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,580
 the crime scenes.

493
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,820
 I didn't really think anything of it.

494
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,040
 But now, you know, this isn't the only thing I do.

495
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:19,480
 I also investigate homicides, I also have filing police work, I'm probably doing a lot

496
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,680
 of court cases.

497
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:25,240
 There have been months in between these two suicides.

498
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,360
 And I've even investigated other suicides in that meantime.

499
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,680
 But these are suicides where there is no known motive.

500
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,840
 I mean other than to kill yourself.

501
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,840
 But you know what I mean?

502
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,400
 Like there was nothing to suggest that this person was going to kill themselves.

503
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,260
 I've now seen this at two of them.

504
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,260
 Two in a row.

505
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,260
 The seventh out of ten and now the eighth out of ten.

506
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,940
 And it's when I saw the second time when I go, "What in the world?"

507
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,940
 Like again, coincidence.

508
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:55,440
 Wait a second, when did it be on his eighth?

509
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,440
 If it's three.

510
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,780
 Let me take a look at this here.

511
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,780
 Then he goes away.

512
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:05,780
 Then as he's sitting, he's sitting next to this dead body.

513
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,180
 He goes, "Wait a second.

514
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,180
 Let me clarify something."

515
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:12,080
 I said, "I've only seen it on three cases."

516
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,320
 So I saw it in the eighth case that I worked.

517
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,840
 And now I've seen it on the ninth case I've worked.

518
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,960
 The one that I'm at right now in the other couple.

519
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,960
 Are you doing math right now, sir?

520
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,960
 And he's like, "Hold on."

521
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,400
 So he didn't see it on the seventh and the eighth case.

522
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,920
 He saw it on the eighth case that he had done in the ninth case he had done.

523
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,000
 And he goes, "Okay, hopefully that clarifies it."

524
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,560
 So some future podcaster doesn't have to edit that.

525
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,560
 Edit all that out.

526
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,740
 But anyways, so the first time he saw this was on the eighth case out of ten.

527
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,620
 Out of ten unexplained suicides.

528
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:50,020
 Now these are all forensically proven to have been suicides.

529
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:54,060
 They know these people did kill themselves, but they couldn't explain really why.

530
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:57,260
 The first time he saw it was on the eighth case, but he didn't really pay much attention

531
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,260
 to it.

532
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:02,780
 When he recognized it during his ninth case, that's when he made the connection.

533
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:07,060
 He goes, "Now I've had two suicides back to back, but spread out over a couple months

534
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:11,440
 and I've had other suicides and other homicides and a lot of work in between.

535
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,920
 But now I have two unexplained suicides.

536
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:18,400
 Both of them have had this same wicker lighthouse.

537
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,320
 But it must just be a coincidence."

538
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:29,240
 And that's what he believed until the very next unexplained suicide case he worked in

539
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:41,160
 the house was a little decorative wicker white and blue lighthouse.

540
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:45,080
 So out of ten unexplained suicides, he's seen it in the past three.

541
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:49,320
 They've all been separated by just a matter of months.

542
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:56,320
 So what he did was he began to go through, because now he's super in first time, you

543
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,960
 wouldn't even acknowledge it because there's all this stuff in the house.

544
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:05,880
 The second time you saw it at a totally different location, same type of unexplained suicide,

545
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,400
 you're going to go just coincidence, right?

546
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:13,800
 We live in a town, not everyone bought these chachkies, but people bought these chachkies

547
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,240
 and just a coincidence that you have two of these.

548
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:22,080
 But on the third one, now you have a phenomenon.

549
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:29,000
 So he began looking through crime scene photos of past suicides.

550
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,360
 Suicides that he was not able to explain.

551
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:39,480
 And out of the ten cases he worked, he saw the lighthouse in three of them, there are

552
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:49,920
 two other photos of past suicides that the lighthouse may have been in.

553
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:55,360
 He goes, "I'll be honest, I can't say for sure, I'm looking at these crime scene photos."

554
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:01,600
 And it looks like that lighthouse was in the photo, but he goes, "The angle wasn't perfect

555
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,400
 and there was stuff in the way so you couldn't really see it."

556
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:10,200
 But three confirmed sightings of this wicker lighthouse at three unexplained suicides and

557
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:19,120
 now possibly two more sightings in old photographs of two previous unexplained suicides.

558
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:27,800
 And it's possible that this lighthouse was in the other five unsolved, unexplained suicides,

559
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,480
 but it was in another room.

560
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,040
 It wasn't in the place where that person killed himself.

561
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:43,760
 And he goes, "He goes, listen, I...

562
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:52,120
 I think it's creepy, but I don't know what it means."

563
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:57,000
 And I was looking into it and trying to figure it out and then a couple months after I kind

564
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,520
 of realized this whole thing was going on with these wicker lighthouses I got transferred

565
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,600
 to another division so I just dropped it.

566
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:12,120
 Now I had real work to do, like I'm investigating this weird conspiracy that may not be a conspiracy.

567
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,840
 And what could the answer possibly be?

568
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:20,960
 People responded to this and they said, "Is it possible that this was like a serial killer

569
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,560
 killing people and making it look like a suicide and this was his calling card?"

570
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:30,000
 And Stephen goes, "You know, a lot of that's Hollywood magic."

571
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,120
 He goes, "Kind of breaking apart a little bit."

572
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:38,000
 He goes, "One, serial killers very, very rarely leave a calling card.

573
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 Like intentionally go like, 'I will leave the jack of hearts on this woman's lips.'"

574
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,960
 Like people do do that, but the amount of serial killers versus the amount that actually do

575
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,280
 that is super rare.

576
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,280
 It's rare.

577
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,840
 Usually the stuff they're leaving at the scene is stuff they don't mean to.

578
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,520
 We call it evidence.

579
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:05,640
 He goes also the ability to continuously stage suicides and make it look like a suicide.

580
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,600
 That's not super easy either.

581
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,920
 He didn't go into detail and again, it's none of our business.

582
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:15,120
 He didn't go into detail of how these people killed themselves or anything like that.

583
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:21,120
 I mean, it would be easier, I think, to hang somebody and make it look like a suicide.

584
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:26,040
 But again, at a certain point there's so much chaos going on, you'd have to control the

585
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,040
 scene.

586
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:32,280
 You'd probably need more than one or two people to control the scene so the dude's not kicking

587
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,840
 stuff over and being like, "I just be like, 'No, because you'll be like, 'Hang yourself

588
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,840
 or I'll shoot you.'"

589
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,240
 But no, I'm not doing either.

590
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,960
 And they're like, "Okay, no one ever told us no before.

591
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,040
 We don't know what to do.

592
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,040
 We leave."

593
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,520
 I know it's not that easy, but everything would be in disarray.

594
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:53,240
 You could obviously tell that a struggle happened between three adult men in the middle of this

595
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,160
 room and then I'm just hanging.

596
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,200
 All the posters are torn off the wall.

597
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,640
 There's punches through it and kicks and they can tell I took a guy and threw him through

598
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,840
 the window and then went, "See you later."

599
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,040
 As the other guy's putting the noose around the neck, I was like, "Oh, I probably shouldn't

600
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,920
 have had that witty one liner."

601
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,840
 Obviously, it'd be like, "Dude, it's totally obvious.

602
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:17,320
 There was a huge fight here with the guys covered in bruises and he's hanging."

603
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:21,560
 His blood and knuckles, like he was fighting somebody, would be that.

604
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:25,960
 That specifically I'm warning the CIA, "Don't try to fake my hanging.

605
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,960
 I'll beat you guys up."

606
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,440
 But yeah, so it's just such a...

607
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,720
 He goes, "I don't think it's a serial killer."

608
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:38,560
 He goes that and he's leaving the Wicker Lighthouse as a calling card.

609
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,640
 He goes, "I don't think it's anything like that.

610
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,160
 I don't know what it is."

611
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:47,280
 Which in a lot of ways is the most honest answer for paranormal stories.

612
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,440
 I don't know what it is.

613
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:56,800
 Sometimes in the quest for truth, in the quest for disclosure, we start to put on our conspiracy

614
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,520
 caps and start to really go like, "What if it's this?"

615
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,600
 And then we end up leaving out a bunch of possibilities.

616
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,160
 And it turns out not being what we think it is.

617
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,280
 Sometimes it's more honest to go, "I don't know."

618
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,160
 Other people are saying, and again, but it's fun to have theories, right?

619
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,320
 Other people are saying, "What if these Wicker...?"

620
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,480
 I tried googling Wicker Lighthouses.

621
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,920
 It's funny because that term, it's so weird.

622
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,920
 It's so weird.

623
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,240
 I was like, "What is it?

624
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,520
 I know what Wicker is and I know what a lighthouse is."

625
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,480
 I was able to find one on the internet.

626
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,840
 They sell them on eBay, but it wasn't white and blue.

627
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,040
 Plus, I probably don't recommend buying it.

628
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,440
 I should leave a one-star review.

629
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,440
 I don't know.

630
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,760
 I bought this and currently I'm about to kill myself.

631
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,160
 It wasn't painted white and blue.

632
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:48,800
 There are a lot of white and blue lighthouses, though, that you can buy and set up on your

633
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,720
 mantle or your nightstand or kitchen table or whatever.

634
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,480
 But people have said, "Maybe the Wicker got moldy and the people were breathing in the

635
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,480
 mold spores."

636
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,040
 They're like, "Oh, this is just like that show The Last of Us."

637
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,000
 I don't want to watch that show anymore and they kill themselves.

638
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,160
 People are saying, "Maybe they were being driven mad by the mold and the Wicker."

639
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,760
 Again, probably not.

640
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,480
 It's probably just better to...

641
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:19,400
 I mean, it's fun to have a theory, but I wouldn't call a mycologist tonight and go, "Is it possible

642
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,640
 that if Wicker got mold that I may kill myself?"

643
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,240
 And they'll be like, "What?"

644
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,240
 It's a theory.

645
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,240
 It's definitely possible.

646
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,640
 But, you know, Stephen, he posts online.

647
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:35,120
 He goes by the name Naren C. Naren C. He just goes, "I don't know what it was."

648
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,840
 It was something that I observed and was...

649
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:44,680
 I observed personally the last three unsolved suicides, unexplained suicides.

650
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:48,400
 He goes, "Forensically, all evidence pointed to it being a suicide.

651
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,200
 These were suicides."

652
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:56,040
 But they left none of the markers that most suicides leave.

653
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:01,880
 There was no indication of anything.

654
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,400
 And yet here they are dead.

655
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:09,040
 And in 10 of those cases that I had, three, I personally saw the Wicker Lighthouse.

656
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:14,080
 Two other ones may have been caught in crime scene photographs and the other five I was

657
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,800
 never able to find any connection to the Wicker Lighthouse.

658
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:23,600
 It's a really fascinating story because it's one of those mysteries that will never be

659
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,720
 solved.

660
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:31,760
 This was an on-the-clock homicide investigator just posting something online.

661
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,760
 We have no city.

662
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,240
 We have no time.

663
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:39,720
 When this all took place, we'll never get any answers from it.

664
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:46,320
 It does sound very creepypasta-ish or very SCP-ish.

665
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,880
 It's, again, in the end it wasn't like, and then one night I woke up and there was a giant

666
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,120
 Wicker Lighthouse at the edge of my bed trying to get me to kill myself.

667
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:58,640
 No, it's just something that a homicide detective noticed.

668
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,040
 And it may have been something.

669
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:05,560
 It may not have been something, but we'll never know for sure.

670
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,240
 It's an interesting story and it's a mystery with no answer.

671
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:14,360
 And we can wonder if they're a calling card of a serial killer, which again, I probably

672
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,360
 not.

673
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:22,680
 It's possible that it would be a pretty good way to get around serial killing people.

674
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,680
 It could be mold.

675
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,880
 It could be mold, right?

676
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,880
 People have gone crazy.

677
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,080
 You could have a little black mold in it and it's driving people insane.

678
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,080
 Could be cursed.

679
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,200
 They could be cursed objects.

680
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,600
 That's kind of what I was thinking of.

681
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:41,320
 That someone was mass producing black magic items and people were buying them and this

682
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,720
 is what's happening.

683
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:47,080
 It would be, see, some of the questions that I would love to know is, and this is, again,

684
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,080
 it's unknowable.

685
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:53,400
 We don't know, but what is the, what's the lead time between buying the Lighthouse and

686
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,520
 taking your own life?

687
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:04,160
 Like is it months, weeks, days, hours, or all of these brand new Wicker Lighthouses?

688
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,160
 We don't know.

689
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,520
 We don't have so many details to the story.

690
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,400
 And those are questions that the homicide detective wouldn't know to be fair.

691
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,280
 They even want to be like, and then I, then I dug through their credit card purchase history

692
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:18,280
 and found out that they were at the Wicker store on the, you know, we don't know any

693
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,280
 of that.

694
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:26,560
 And that's actually what kind of makes the story a little, I like stories like this.

695
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,440
 I like these open ended stories.

696
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:34,320
 Sure, I love stories that have a beginning, a middle, and an end, but this story really

697
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,520
 just has a middle.

698
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,840
 We don't know how these events started and he ended up changing his job.

699
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,880
 So he's like, whatever, I don't care.

700
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,280
 I did my job and I'm not, this is the thing I said at the beginning, you're not going

701
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,840
 to walk around station and be like, Hey guys, the Wicker Lighthouse investigation is heating

702
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,840
 up.

703
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,840
 Anyone else want to help me?

704
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:01,560
 They'd be like, dude, quit being aware, quit being aware to quit wasting time and just focus

705
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,360
 on all the, look at all those unsolved homicides you have, Steve.

706
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,920
 And he's like, I'm getting to that.

707
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,440
 But first I got to find the outlet Wicker outlet store.

708
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,500
 And they're like, dude, he probably shared this with a couple of his investigators just

709
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:19,280
 because cops love to trade weird stories, but not weird a.k.a.

710
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,280
 Fox Mulder.

711
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,900
 I'm going to obsess about type of stuff, weird stories, because we talked about this before.

712
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:28,600
 You want that person sitting in the car with you when you're driving around town to have

713
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:33,840
 your back and not be a big old weirdo worrying about shadow people or aliens abducting him.

714
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,280
 Because at the end of the day, someone might open fire and you've got to rip.

715
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,840
 You got to hope your partner isn't looking up at the sky looking for UFOs.

716
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,320
 I mean, if Bolton riddling his body, he's like, I see him.

717
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,120
 I see all the UFOs now.

718
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,120
 They don't do that.

719
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,960
 But obviously like, you don't want a crazy person in a life and death job that totally

720
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,960
 makes sense.

721
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,280
 You don't want to work at an industrial factory.

722
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,520
 And the guy next to you is talking about hollow earth.

723
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,080
 You know, focus on where this molten lead is going, Gary.

724
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,840
 You can talk about stuff off the clock.

725
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,800
 It's all you ever talk about is hollow earth.

726
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,640
 You probably talked to a couple people about it.

727
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:15,040
 Just thought it was a weird thing because cops do share weird stories.

728
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,640
 But I doubt the next investigator who came in, he's like, hey, listen, could you do me

729
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,640
 a solid?

730
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,240
 The next thing we come across is suicide and you aren't for sure.

731
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,400
 Look for a lighthouse and send me a radio.

732
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,880
 I doubt he did that.

733
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,360
 So it doesn't have a beginning.

734
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,480
 It doesn't have an end.

735
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:41,480
 It's just a story of probably a coincidence, but it could have been more than that.

736
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:45,120
 And it's crazy to think that it could have been a coincidence and Stephen would have

737
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:49,720
 kind of been laughed at had he said, let's continue this investigation of these wicker

738
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:55,480
 lighthouses because it sounds stupid.

739
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:03,360
 But you have to wonder how many lives out there would have been saved had they looked

740
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:07,640
 into it.

741
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:13,040
 Like had the police been able to draw a connection between the wicker lighthouses and three,

742
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:17,280
 four, five more of these unexplained suicides.

743
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,680
 And then at that point they're like, we need to find out who's making these wicker lighthouses.

744
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,360
 This is the very least it's a public health thing.

745
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:29,600
 Maybe we'll just, we can't go out and arrest someone for making supposedly cursed objects.

746
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:33,360
 But let's find out where these are coming from because now we're having a serious pattern

747
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:40,360
 and you wonder if lives could have been saved if they investigated this a little more seriously

748
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:44,520
 after Stephen left.

749
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,520
 But they didn't.

750
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,640
 As far as we know, they didn't.

751
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:52,040
 Stephen transferred to another job and another homicide detective took over.

752
00:43:52,040 --> 00:44:00,840
 And in that city there still could be unexplained suicides.

753
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,840
 They're not common.

754
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:05,280
 They do happen.

755
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,120
 And this new homicide detective, he's been working, he's new, but he's been there for

756
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,600
 years working this Stephen left long ago.

757
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,840
 And this new detective comes across another one of these unexplained suicides.

758
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:21,440
 It's only the sixth one he's come across, but it's weird each time.

759
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,440
 And as he's looking at all the evidence and having photographs taken and knowing this body's

760
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:32,880
 going to be shipped off to the corner, he doesn't notice the wicker lighthouse on the

761
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,360
 fireplace in the living room.

762
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:38,200
 It doesn't even catch his eye.

763
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:43,880
 It's just another little piece of decoration, another memento strewn about this home that

764
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:48,960
 this investigator will never visit again.

765
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,240
 How many more of these wicker lighthouses are out there?

766
00:44:53,240 --> 00:45:09,680
 And is it possible by simply having one in your home can drive you to take your own life?

767
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,040
