00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 When a young woman takes a taxi cab ride, he takes her on a journey into the Twilight Zone.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 And then finally we're going to India for sure today. For sure.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 A man has a family, a business, a life.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 But when he starts saying that his father's spirit is visiting him,

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 asking him to perform a bizarre ritual, people in the neighborhood begin to get concerned.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 But they have no idea, but they have no idea the madness that awaits today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 [music]

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 For our first story, we're leaving behind all of our custom vehicles like the Dead Rabbit Robote or the Carpenter copter.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 And we're just going to hail a taxi. That's me. That's me whistling. Apparently somehow.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 I can't whistle at all. I've told that story before. Hey you, taxi guy, come here, taxi shows it.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Actually it's funny because isn't everything uber now? I read this horrible story.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Not the story we're about to do, but I guess suicides are up in New York.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 And like Jason, this isn't why we're listening to your podcast.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 I guess suicides are up in New York because taxi cab drivers are killing themselves.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Because before, I guess taxis had to have a medallion. Like you had to have a taxi medallion.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 It's basically a license to operate a taxi in the city of New York.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Some of these go up to $200,000, $300,000 because the city only has so many of them to go around.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 So you would buy one as your retirement. You would buy one to be a taxi cab driver for a while,

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 ready to leave. You would sell your medallion to someone else who wanted to have another taxi in their fleet.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 You have to have one per taxi. So if you had 10 taxis, you'd have to have 10 medallions.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 If you were an independent operator, you just needed the one.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 But you would do it for a couple years, not a couple years. You'd do it for 10, 20 years.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 And you'd sell your medallion, $300,000. They're a limited amount.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Uber's completely destroyed that economy. So people are blowing their brains out.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Sorry, that's not what we're talking about. That's depressing.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 We're talking about, we're going to Britain.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 The year's 2019 in December, we're in Teeside, England.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 There's a taxi cab driver named Tony Cole.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 [singing]

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 He's gonna turn the radio down so he can talk to us.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Hey, mates! You know what? I'm not just any driver.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 I'm not just any old bloke named Tony Cole, 60 years old. Taxi...

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Wait, no, you don't have a taxi driver? That's not unusual.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 We're like, "Oh, this guy's a little out of it."

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 He's like, "I knew you were going to say that.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 I knew you were going to complain about me personality and the fact that I'm Irish now."

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 No, you see, I'm not just the taxi cab driver. I'm a psychic taxi cab driver.

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Let me tell you my story.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 I'm like, "Great. Out of all the taxi cab drivers in Teeside,

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 we had to get the one that is related to the topic of this show."

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 He's like, "I knew you were going to say that, too."

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 He starts throwing newspapers back at us. We're like, "Uh..."

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 He's been, there have been a ton of articles written about this guy over the years.

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 He is known as a psychic taxi cab driver.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 He actually classifies himself as the chubby brown of spiritualism.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Now, I know what all those words mean separately,

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 but when put in a sentence, I have no idea what that means.

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 I guess chubby brown is some sort of British comedian.

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Maybe I should watch some of his stand-up.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 But, you wouldn't have time. We're taking a psychic taxi cab ride.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 And he's driving. We hope he is.

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 He's in the backseat with us. We're like, "No, you're supposed to be driving."

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 He's like, "Oh, yeah, I'm very bad at my job. I forgot. I'll get back up there."

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 He's a psychic taxi cab driver. So, as he's driving, he's like,

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 "I can tell you what you did today."

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 And we're like, "Make bad decisions on choices of taxi cabs, then that would be correct."

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 He's like, "No, no, no, no, no. Jason, when you woke up today,

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 you got two and a half hours of sleep. You woke up, you went to work,

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 and you were super tired, but you did it.

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 And about halfway through the day, you ate a bunch of beef jerky

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 and two bags of frozen cheese chips.

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Would that be correct, Lattie? Is that what you did today?"

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 And I'm like, checking my breath.

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 I'm like, "Can you smell the beef jerky and the cheese chips?"

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 And you're looking at me, you're like, "Is that true?"

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 I turn to you and I go, "Yeah. Yeah, I did eat a lot of cheese chips today,

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 and I did eat some beef jerky. I didn't get a lot of sleep last night."

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 And we look, and Tony has a big old smile on his face.

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 He kind of looks a little bit--

72
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 "Sir, has anyone ever told you you look like the chubby brown of spiritualism?"

73
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 He's like, "I many have, many have my lad."

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 So Tony Cole, then he psychically tells you your future.

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 He told my past, he tells your future.

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 He says, "You are going to keep listening to this episode."

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 "Whoa, dude, where are these powers coming from?"

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 So Tony Cole has been reported on a lot in the British media.

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 The Taxicab Psychic.

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 But this year, not this year, December 2019,

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 has not been a kind year to Tony Cole,

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 because now the articles are about an unfortunate incident he had.

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 What happened this year was he was driving--

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 See, this is what he does. You get in his Taxicab, he tells you what you did.

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 He talks to ghosts.

86
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Okay, so let me give you his backstory here real quick, too.

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 He said he was just a normal bloke up until he was 40,

88
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 and then he woke up on his 40th birthday on that day

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 and ghosts were talking to him, and ever since then he's had a bit of the shine.

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 He's been able to communicate with spirits and been able to fight--

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 I don't think he can really read the future,

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 but he can definitely say that he can find out about your past,

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 which you've done and so like that.

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 It's probably a lot of guesswork, but who knows?

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 He was quite on with the made-up scenario.

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 The reason why he's in the news now, people getting his taxi

97
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 and he tells them what they were doing, well, this young woman,

98
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 she's like 18, 19, they don't give her age, they say she's a teenager,

99
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 but she's in college, so I don't think she's 14.

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 It's not Doogie Howser getting into the back of this car.

101
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Anyways, this girl gets into the taxi, right?

102
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 And they're driving and Tony's like, "Oh, yes, Milady, taking you to college.

103
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Hmm, I bet you I can tell you what you did this morning."

104
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 And the girl's like, "What?" He's like, "Yes, yes."

105
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 You woke up and you got dressed, but then you thought, "Hmm, that's not a good outfit."

106
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 So you took your clothes off and put on new clothes.

107
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 The girl's just dead silent in the back and he's like, "Oh, yes."

108
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 And then something about your brother.

109
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Now, Tony doesn't tell us what he said about her brother,

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 and we've never really heard from the girl, but what happened was,

111
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 when he drops the girl off at the college, she immediately goes to her teacher

112
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 and says, "Dude, I think this dude was in my house. I think I'm being stopped."

113
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 And the teacher, she says, "I took a taxi cab with this guy. It was like 60."

114
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 And he told me that he was right.

115
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 That I woke up this morning and I got dressed and I didn't like my outfit, so I changed my clothes.

116
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 And then he said something about my brother, which I'm not going to repeat.

117
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 And the teacher goes, "I think you might be being stopped."

118
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 I mean, is that true? And she's like, "Yes, absolutely. I did wake up, get dressed, change my outfit."

119
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 And these people are obviously skeptics. They don't believe in the paranormal.

120
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 They then report him to the Taxi Licensing Board of Middleboro.

121
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 And he's getting investigated because they're saying he was stalking this young woman.

122
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 He's like, "I'm not stalking her. I'm just psychic."

123
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 So that's where we're at. He also, and I love this quote in this article,

124
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 so you have that right there and you go, "Oh, you know, maybe he is a lovable old psychic."

125
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Chubby Brown of Spiritualism. And he really could see into the past.

126
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Maybe he was a lucky guess.

127
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 It's always funny because news articles are always kind of written.

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 They're written in a very particular way where you have to get the facts in,

129
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 but how it's organized determines the intent or how they want the reader to feel.

130
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 In this particular article, it said, here's an actual line from the article here.

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 "While he openly admits to being in prison four or five times, Mr. Cole insists he is no stalker."

132
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 And it says, "Most of his passengers..." So let's stop before I finish this quote.

133
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 And go back to that first part.

134
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 "While he openly admits he's been in prison four or five times, Mr. Cole insists he's no stalker."

135
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 And it says, "Most of his passengers enjoy it when he gives readings."

136
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 So drunk tank going to jail for beating someone up, spending a weekend in jail, spending 30 days in jail.

137
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 That's fine. Four or five times in prison? Prison.

138
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 And they don't tell us why.

139
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Oh, yeah, but I've been in prison four or five times, but I'm not a stalker.

140
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 I may be a bank robber, and I may be a hitman, but I'm no stalker.

141
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 So who knows? I don't know what he was in.

142
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 They never really say what he was in prison for, so...

143
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 I don't think he was a bank robber or a murderer, but it's just a weird thing to throw in there.

144
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 So that's what he's facing right now.

145
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 He'll probably just lose his license. I don't think there'll be any criminal charges, because his defense is that he's just talking to ghosts.

146
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 Which I would like to see that trial, because just to hair him, like, all the juries up there.

147
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Do they do juries in England? Is that an American thing?

148
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 I think it's just like the judge with the powdered wig. I hope they do juries over there.

149
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 So before we move on to our next story, yes, we are going to get to the India story today.

150
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 We were 100% going to get to the India story. It's very creepy. I haven't put it off for a while, but...

151
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 I just want to remind you guys, if you want to help support the show you can do it through Patreon.

152
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 You can do it in the merch store. Both of those are linked in our show notes.

153
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 You can also send us a review, and I wanted to read this review I got the other day.

154
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Short little guy. This is from somebody named Noliti.

155
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 And I love this.

156
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 New subscriber who found the show by accident and now binging the 350+ episodes on an international trip.

157
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 Jason, it's really funny. Thank you. Super interesting. Thank you.

158
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 But I can't figure out how he has time to do this daily.

159
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 A huge endeavor that's well appreciated by this listener. Thank you.

160
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 No, thank you for the review. So if you guys want to leave me 5-star reviews wherever you listen to podcasts, that'd be great.

161
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 And if you can't do any of those, just share the show with your friends, let your family know, let people around your community know.

162
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Really helps the show grow.

163
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 Any one of those four are awesome things to do, and I really, really appreciate it.

164
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 Let's hop on board. We're saying goodbye to Tony Cole. He knew we were going to say that by the way.

165
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 We're going to hop on board the carpenter copter. Get in guys.

166
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 We are finally headed to India.

167
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 I don't know what that noise is. I have no idea. It sounded like some German craft work electronic music song.

168
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 We're going, we're bumping some KMFDM flying over to India.

169
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 Oh my God. Please know Jason, it's got...

170
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 There's a whole genre of music that's basically sounds you can make with your mouth, but a computer makes them instead.

171
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Like you can't really make a good piano sound. You can't do that, right?

172
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 You can't do this even farther.

173
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 But electronic music is like... What is the thing?

174
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Boots and cats and boots and cats and boots and cats and... That's all noises you can make with your mouth, but a computer makes them.

175
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Maybe, maybe Skynet, maybe the ultimate AI machine isn't some supercomputer.

176
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 It's just a synthesizer that becomes self-aware and realizes it doesn't need us to make music.

177
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 It can make music itself. That was terrible.

178
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 Let's go ahead and move on to our India story, which I already said. I'm getting lost in the beat.

179
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 I'm a slave to the rhythm. Okay. It's July 1st, 2018.

180
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 Copter.

181
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 We're going to land in a field in Bharari, India.

182
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 In Bharari, India, there is a man named Lalit.

183
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Lalit Bhatia. So you had the brothers Bhavnesh Bhatia and Lalit Bhatnia.

184
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 I'm sure I'm pronouncing all of those names wrong, so I'm pretty much going to stop introducing the rest of the family.

185
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 You have those two brothers. You have a grandma and a sister.

186
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 So Lalit's sister. Their wives. Not the... This is getting complicated. Not the sister's wives.

187
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 You have the grandma. You have a daughter. You have Bhavnish Bhatia and Lalit Bhatia.

188
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Those are the brothers. Then you have their wives.

189
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 And then five grandkids. So it's a total of 11 people living in this house.

190
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 He has a little shop. A little like supermarket. And then their house is above the shop.

191
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 This family's lived in this area for the longest time. It's not in the middle of nowhere.

192
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 It's kind of a... It's not bustling metropolis either. Both of those are code words for Jason.

193
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Didn't look up the location. But don't think that this is some shanty town in the middle of BFE.

194
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 And it's also not in the middle of down... Actually, it may be either of those. I didn't look it up.

195
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 So the point is, just for the sake of the story, imagine a little town with a little shop.

196
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 A little house on top of it. So you're like, Jason, why am I going to trust anything you say after this

197
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 when you've told me twice? Now you don't know where this takes place. I know where it takes place.

198
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 I just don't know the demographics. I didn't look it up on MapQuest, okay?

199
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 We're in Burrari, India. It's July 1st, 2018. Three days away from 4th of July, everyone's buying their fireworks.

200
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 You're ready to shoot them off for Indian independence. Very middle-class family. They've lived there for 20 years.

201
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 People go to the shop all the time. Family runs shop, family runs business.

202
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 And one morning... Knock on the door. No one is in the shop looking through the windows.

203
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 That's weird. Probably should have looked through the windows before I knocked on the door. That's normally how this works.

204
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 Don't see anyone in there. Hey! La-Lit! Are you in there? La-Lit! Are you in there? La-Lit! Are you in there?

205
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Someone else is like, "What? You think he turned invisible? You can obviously see there's no one in there just yelling his name."

206
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 I don't know. I'm just trying to figure it out. No one's there.

207
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 So La-Lit was a good man. But people... You know, after a certain amount of time, people thought, "Is that a little weird? Is that a little weird? He's acting withdrawn."

208
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Now, we find out after the events we're going to go into. I'm kind of doing this sequentially.

209
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 After the events that we're going to have the story in. We find all this stuff out. But at the time, he's keeping diaries.

210
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 Writing stuff down, which is what you generally do with the diary. 22 of them in total. With a lot of weird beliefs in them.

211
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Now, he loved his family. But he would write stuff that the family is not living up to their full potential. They could be better. They could do better.

212
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 And one thing they're not doing is they're not recognizing the hard, hard work that my father put into this company.

213
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Without my father, none of this would exist. My father built this business and they don't realize how great of a man he was.

214
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Lolli began to talk to some of his friends in private and say, "I saw my father's ghost. My father's ghost is visiting me."

215
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Friends are like, "What's he saying?"

216
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 He tells me that we're not grateful. I'm grateful enough. But the rest of the family is not grateful enough for all the hard work that he put into the business.

217
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 People are like, "Well, I mean, it's always tough when someone close to you has a parent."

218
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 I know people who have been abducted by aliens have seen ghosts and all sorts of stuff.

219
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 There's different ways to deal with it. Some people just tell the story and then they're on. And then some people you can tell it's very troubling for them to talk about the event.

220
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 And it's always difficult to help them because they're dealing with something that there really is no help for.

221
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 And in a situation like this, someone comes to you and says their dad's ghost is visiting them.

222
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 You may believe in ghosts, but you're still going to have that knee-jerk reaction to think you may need to go see...

223
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Before you go see an exorcist, why don't you go talk to somebody like a psychiatrist or something like that?

224
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Because it could be that too.

225
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 But his friends were like, you know, "Lalit, that's kind of weird, but, you know..."

226
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 "My condolences!"

227
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 Like, what do you say to someone when their dad's ghost is showing up criticizing the family members?

228
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 But then as more time passes, he begins to become more withdrawn.

229
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 He starts to make more troubling statements.

230
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 He feels like there are four spirits that have latched themselves onto his family.

231
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 And he can see them.

232
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 He writes about this stuff in his diaries.

233
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 These spirits have latched onto the family and they won't let go.

234
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 And more troubling than that, his father's spirit is now no longer just appearing and talking to him.

235
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 Sometimes walking through the house, sitting in the living room, laying in bed.

236
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Lalit can feel his father's spirit trying to crawl into his body, trying to possess him.

237
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 Shhh. Shhh.

238
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Writing this down in his diaries.

239
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 He also realizes that he needs to make sure that his family is aware of the father's contribution to the family.

240
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 He realizes that he needs to cleanse the family of these dark spirits.

241
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 Maybe that will give him some peace.

242
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 Maybe that will allow the father's spirit to go somewhere else, to stop trying to possess him, to not torment him.

243
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 He has to perform a purification ritual.

244
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Lalit writes in his journal a particular ritual he wants to perform.

245
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 One of the key parts of the ritual is being able to tie your own hands behind your back.

246
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 Everyone in the family has to do it.

247
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 It will cleanse the family.

248
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 It will appease the patriarch.

249
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 July 1st, 2018.

250
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 Lalit! Lalit, open up, dude. You're a shop, dude.

251
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 I gotta buy milk, bro. Come on, do they drink milk in India? Cause I know the cow secret.

252
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Let's go. I don't know. M&Ms. Dude, I gotta get Indian food. Open up.

253
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Nobody's coming to the door.

254
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 That's fine. Every show, often, a business, something's gonna happen.

255
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 But this family had been here for 20 years. This business has been open for that long.

256
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 It's super bizarre that nobody's there. There's 11 people in the house.

257
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Dude finally goes, "I'm breaking in." They're like, "What?" He goes, "I'm gonna break into the house.

258
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 I'm not gonna bust in through their glass door of their shop. I'm gonna kick their door in."

259
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Cause I think something's up. You go call the police. Fine. Go ahead and do that.

260
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 But I'm just gonna break in. So apparently a cat burglar lives in the neighborhood.

261
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 And he breaks into the house. Lalit! Anybody. Is everything okay?

262
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 Walk up through the house. Sees something sitting in a recliner in the corner of a room.

263
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 But what gets his attention is when he turns and looks into the living room.

264
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 And there, in a circle, are 10 stools and 10 hanging bodies.

265
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 Slowly swaying back and forth.

266
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 Police show up. Not long afterwards. Guy runs out. Cops are already been called. Cops go in.

267
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 One of the officers on the scene walks in and said, "I'll never forget that."

268
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 I walked in, saw 10 bodies hanging, and just turned around and walked back out.

269
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 10 bodies hanging in a circle.

270
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 The 11th body, the grandma, was the one sitting in the recliner.

271
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 She was strangled where she sat.

272
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 10 bodies hanging are the rest of the family, including Lalit.

273
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 There was actually one person who wasn't killed that day, cause they were gone.

274
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 I think it was like an other son that was gone from the area, moved away or something like that.

275
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 But everyone in that house was dead. Hands tied behind their back.

276
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 They each had a blindfold made out of a bed sheet, so someone took a bed sheet, ripped off individual pieces, and they go...

277
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Their first inclination was, "This wasn't well planned. Someone didn't go out and buy 10 blindfolds."

278
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 It was a spur of the moment thing. But they got CCTV footage of some of the members of the family buying stools a couple days before this happened.

279
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 So it was a little bit planned out. They needed 10 stools. I mean, who has 10 chairs or stools?

280
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 That's a lot of stuff to commit suicide. There's a lot of...

281
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 A lot of people have a lot of rope hanging around. Definitely have bed sheets, but not everyone has 10 chairs or stools to jump off of.

282
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Their hands are tied behind their back. And going through the diaries, they think...

283
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 First off, the thing... I think I'm kind of missing the force for the trees here.

284
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 How did this happen? How do 10 people kill themselves at pretty much the same time?

285
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 They're all blindfolded. They all have earplugs in.

286
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Their phones are all in a separate room. Hands are tied behind their back.

287
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 So they're basically tying their hands behind their back. They were taught to tie their hands behind their back.

288
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Now it's funny because really only one person would have to tie their hands behind their back, and that was the last person.

289
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 Someone could tie the rest of them. When they're looking through...

290
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 When the cops are looking through all these diaries, they come to a bizarre conclusion.

291
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 This was the ritual that Lalit was talking about, but they didn't intend to die.

292
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 It actually says after the ritual, one person will untie their hands and then untie the rest of people's hands,

293
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 because it's harder to untie yourself than it is to tie yourself.

294
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 It also said in the diaries that we will perform this ritual again next week when that family member comes back.

295
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 We're going to do this ritual again because they have some demons attached to themselves as well.

296
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 So the cops are looking at this and they go...

297
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 This looks like it's some sort of horrible accident. There's supposed to be some ritual and maybe they were all supposed to jump off as a leap of faith.

298
00:23:51,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 And they wouldn't die and then the matriarch would cut them down from the ropes or some weird supernatural thing and then that would get the demons off of them.

299
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 The rest of the family members, because they still had cousins and stuff like that, they go...

300
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 These people were murdered. This is 100% a murder. Lalit was a little depressed.

301
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 But he wasn't an idiot. Nobody...

302
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 First off, even if he did believe if you hung your...

303
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Because they bought the stools to jump off of. These people were definitely hung and the grandma was strangled.

304
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 So that was the weird thing too. If it was supposed to be a ritual that was supposed to be fine that you're going to do next week, they bring in grout.

305
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 They strangled grandma. So they're like...

306
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Even if it worked, even if they're like, "Oh, the ropes broke and then the ghost dad saved us and now he's off to shoot ghost dad too."

307
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 With Bill Cosby.

308
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 Grandma's still dead. Like, she's choked. There's no coming back from that. You watched her die, dude.

309
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 So that part's weird. I mean, it's all weird. But the fact that they have earplugs in makes...

310
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 This is what I think it is, honestly. I think the dad was going nuts.

311
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 And I have an even darker theory in a second, but...

312
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 He told the rest of the family that it was just a ritual and he may have even shown them the writings in the diary being like, "Look, look at this book."

313
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 And they're like, "Didn't she just write that, dad?" He's like, "No, no, no. I bought this book at Barnes & Noble. This is just in my handwriting. It's a really weird book."

314
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 But it says that this ritual, this is how it's happened. We're going to jump. We're going to survive. We're going to be purged by the fire.

315
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 All the demons are going to leave us and we'll be fine. And he may have tricked them into doing it.

316
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 He may have tricked all of them into doing it. And they all hung. And then he went and strangled Grandma and then he hung himself. That's possible, too.

317
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 He could have been so tormented by these thoughts that that was the only way to clear everything up.

318
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 The other possibility is that, like the rest of the family says, somebody murdered this entire family and made it look like a ritual suicide.

319
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 But again, that's always tough because he wrote about it in a bunch of books and then the Mafia decided to kill. Did they read the diaries, too?

320
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 Like, they have everyone at gunpoint and some guys like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Don't shoot them yet. Let me finish reading these 22 diaries."

321
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 Hmm. I have an interesting idea in this 19th diary here that I've just been reading for two weeks.

322
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 He starts talking about doing some crazy ritual. Let's kill them like that. Like, that would be a weird coincidence.

323
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 But here's where we get dark. And that's pretty dark already with ten people either accidentally killing themselves or suicide, mass suicide, something like that.

324
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 Let's get even darker than that.

325
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 A man is tormented by the spirit of his dead father, who's constantly brow-beating him about, "The family is not grateful enough. The family does not understand what I've created for them. They're ungrateful."

326
00:26:50,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 And then this spirit of the founder of the family who created all of this wealth, created this life for this family, does possess Lalit.

327
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Takes control of his body. Lalit's mind is trapped somewhere in the back, just watching the events unfold over the last few days.

328
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 This possessed man is able, either through trickery or through force, able to murder his entire family, and then hangs himself.

329
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 It was the father all along, slowly crawling back into the family's life, because he knew that they would never understand the hard work that he had done to give them the life that they had.

330
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 He knew they were ungrateful. They had to be punished.

331
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 The only way to get them to realize the life that he had given them was to take that life away from them.

332
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 The only way he could truly communicate to them his hard work and how much he had given them, how much he had created for them, how much he had given them the life they had.

333
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 The only way he could let them know for sure what he had done for them is to take that life away.

334
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 We'll never have any real answers as to what happened in that house.

335
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 We have a collection of diaries, signs of a man in his mental decline, a family seemingly normal, but may have had issues of their own.

336
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 We'll never know for certain, but eleven people did die in that house on that summer day.

337
00:28:51,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 We can only hope that they have peace in the next life, and the father's spirit is no longer tormenting them on the other side,

338
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 trying to prove to them that even after death they are ungrateful and must be punished.

339
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:21,000
