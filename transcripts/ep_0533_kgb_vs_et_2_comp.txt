 Does an old French ghost story actually have terrifying implications for everyday life?
 And then we travel to the Soviet Union to follow a group of KGB Special Forces out on
 a mission.
 When an island is mysteriously shrouded in fog and people go missing from time to time,
 the government wants to know why.
 Little did they know that this investigation would turn into a bloodbath today on Dead
 Rabbit Radio.
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.
 We got a ton of stuff to cover so we're going to get started right away.
 First off let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Joseph Zuts.
 Joseph Zuts thank you for supporting the show.
 He's actually just started listening to the show and he's a new Patreon that's very very
 exciting.
 You're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.
 You can't decoy the Patreon that's fine too.
 Just help spread the word about the show that really really helps out a lot.
 Now Joseph I'm going to toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Robot or an ore.
 Catch!
 It's a huge ore but he's a strong guy.
 Toss you an ore.
 We're going to take the Dead Rabbit Robot but first off I want to give you an update to
 yesterday's episode Samson Forever.
 So yesterday we talked about Samson the dog.
 Samson is a long time listener of the show along with his best friend Sean.
 We actually used one of his websites as a source a long time ago on the Gattington Canyon
 story.
 So he told me that his dog Samson had come down with something called leptocereiosis.
 It's not it.
 It's not it.
 Leptoprosis and it's very common.
 It's super common.
 You usually get it by being a dog.
 Just like your dog you're like swimming and you're chasing animals and stuff like that
 biting squirrels.
 You can get this disease.
 It's so common among dogs that the vets say you should get them vaccinated once a year.
 So if you have a dog talk to your vet about that because it can kill your dog it would
 ended up causing internal organ failure in Samson and they were going to put him to sleep
 on Wednesday.
 So we rushed the episode out.
 We put Samson in the cockpit of all of our vehicles and I wanted to let you guys know
 that although Samson is no longer with us Sean was a I thought this was pretty cool.
 Sean I sent Sean the email and he woke up the next day and he was going to take Samson
 out to the yard one last time to play catch and he thought he had something in his head
 going I should check my email and he saw the episode and so Samson got to hear that episode
 with all of us this show isn't just me it's all of us so we all got to go on this giant
 adventure with Samson and he got to hear it and he had a great time.
 Sean said he just seemed so alive running around in the backyard.
 So we're sorry to see Samson go but he may make returns in future episodes.
 He may be a dog that pops up helps us fight aliens chase Bigfoot all sorts of stuff.
 We're going to miss you Samson but you'll always have a place in the heart of the dead
 rabbit radio family.
 So Joseph I'm going to nod to you you nod to me you try to salute with the ore you bump
 your head it's very comical to us not to you.
 Let's go ahead and hop in that dead rabbit row boat we are going to row all the way from
 America to France.
 Joseph gets to stand on the bow of the dead rabbit row boat he's technically the captain
 where we all have to row we're rowing with one hand drinking our beverage of choice in
 the other.
 And Joseph's like a man I'm going to have a drink we're like yeah sure but you got to
 help row and he's like no I'm fine.
 I brought my own water so we finally are making our way all the way out to France.
 We're going back to the year 1710 and I want to give a shout out to two Twitter followers
 burnt toast ghost and Lusurter Chuckle F word I can't they actually say the word but
 try to keep the show not super explicit although I'll talk about horrible horrible disgusting
 diseases that meth users have those episodes aside thank you so much Lusurda thank you
 so much burnt toast ghost they helped do some translation for this episode.
 So we're going back to the year 1710 we're in Brittany France we're going to get out
 of the dead rabbit row boat we're walking through the forest we're specifically in the
 forest of Ludock and we're walking through the forest and shh be quiet be quiet we hear
 two people arguing in the distance we see two men poking each other's chest with their
 fingers I love her and then the other guy goes no I love her and they keep poking each other's
 chest we're seeing a fight this is how all the time people fought we're seeing a fight
 between Pierre LaRoy and Jan Jan so they're like poking each other's chest I love her
 no no no I love her more and we're like oh this is kind of like a lovers quarrel except
 except the lover isn't there it's two dudes fine over one they're just poking each other's
 chest and then we see a startling movement but we can't do anything because otherwise
 I don't have a story we have to let this happen Jan Jan stops poking Pierre in the chest with
 his finger and he reaches down he pulls out a dagger and goes this will be more effective
 than my finger and he stabs Pierre LaRoy oh no my blood I need that to live Pierre exclaims
 as he falls to the ground and uh p- Jan Jan goes I guess I win I guess I now have the
 love of my life and he walks away so Pierre is laying there out in the forest and he's
 bleeding and he dies oh wait no I looked at my notes that's not what happens we kind of
 I skipped a step so Jan Jan comes back he's like oh I forgot this part of the story he
 comes back and Pierre is dead he just kind of walked around the tree until he died and
 then he goes okay I committed the perfect crime I murdered someone that's step one of
 the perfect crime now I have to dispose of the evidence so he digs a grave right by an
 oak tree deep in the forest and he buries it he's like ah ha ha now the perfect crime
 has been committed step two hiding the evidence now step three to leave the scene but the
 perfect crime is not what he committed because he's very shortly found out to have murdered
 this guy I don't know why those details have kind of been lost to history or I didn't research
 that part but the point of the story is he was found out and poor Jan Jan is executed
 on December 11th 1710 now there's actually a record of his execution so we know this
 part of the story is true and that's not in the realm of impossibility right so we know
 that part of the story is true where we get into the legend is this at that oak tree in
 the middle of the forest five holes appear in the ground that's the sound of a hole
 appearing you know if you're not a geologist five holes appear in the ground right where
 his body was buried I'm a suit actually now that I'm saying this out loud I'm assuming
 they dug them up I'm assuming they didn't leave them buried there but for whatever reason
 it was ghost ground five holes appear right by this oak tree now a legend started this
 where the ghost story starts that if you cover the holes up you die within a year it's interesting
 because we don't know how the legend started or even when it started we just have anecdotes
 later on supposedly at some point like the first story we have about this is two drunk
 dudes show up at the crime scene and they're like I'm more drunk no no no I'm more drunk
 they're poking each other in the chest and then one guy starts reaching for a knife and
 they're like whoa whoa whoa hey I don't know I don't know what you're trying to do but
 first let's tempt this ghost story I heard that if you cover up one of these holes you'll
 die within a year and the guy the guy's still reaching for the knife he's like you might
 die right now and he's like yeah yeah don't don't do that let's let's continue the story
 if we cover up these holes will die within a year apparently one of them did one of the
 drunk guys decided to cover up the holes I don't know if he covered up all of them or
 one of them or what but he died within a year now there's no names associated with the story
 there's no dates associated with that story and that's really when you read about this
 online they tell it's pretty much the story I told you dude gets murdered body gets dumped
 holes appear legend starts and then they'll go for example two drunk guys once da da da
 da da you're like okay just a simple local ghost story it's a legend if you go out there
 you walk around a tree three times say boogity boogity ghost pops up the national forestry
 office of France has the area roped off you can see photos of this there's four posts
 put up there's a rope covering the areas and there's a sign there that warns people to stay
 out of the area and that's what I was getting help from Lasserta and burnt toast ghost because
 I was like I don't know French right that's actually a long story I might I might have
 told that story before but I might know French but I definitely can't read it I asked for
 a translation and people are like oh you know that's actually what it says it says beware
 that some dude died here don't cover up the holes you'll die within a year so stay out
 so the national forestry office put this up now obviously it could just be a tourist trap
 but where are you spending your money at there's not like a person selling whole trinket around
 the corner selling donut holes test your luck try to throw these into the rope dairy and
 see if you can plug a hole up could be a tourist trap but it's unlikely it could be a legend
 that nobody really wants to test it's interesting on two levels one it's a very very hard myth
 to disprove because a lot of people die within a year your chances of dying in the next year
 are actually quite slim if you're generally healthy and you don't do any sort of like
 crazy things like drinking and driving and stuff like that but everyone has a chance
 of dying within a year you can increase those chances plugging holes isn't one of them unless
 you're plugging in like you know Godzilla's butthole then you might be in trouble but
 for the most part plugging holes isn't a high risk factor you could have a hundred people
 plug these holes a hundred people do this and then within a year one of them dies and
 that was the 65 year old man who was drunk driving and trying to drive his car and Godzilla's
 butthole so he was going to die anyways the other people who do it who keep on living
 aren't part of the legend so it's like confirmation bias you're looking for the stories that back
 up what you're looking for you could even say my uncle died and a year before he went
 to the forest maybe he plugged one of the holes I think there's actually a scarier implication
 to this story what we know is that there is a record of this crime taking place at this
 area we have these five holes in the ground we have this legend around them how many of
 these locations are out there that we don't know about the world could be littered with
 paranormal landmines like this I'm not even talking about like haunted houses or sacred
 ground I'm talking about places where someone was brutally murdered the crime was never
 discovered it was the perfect crime bodies buried just feet under the ground and while
 it's decaying into the earth it's releasing all of this vengeance energy because it was
 killed because of a lover's quarrel basically fosters and grows so the chance of you stepping
 on one of these or you're like spitting sunflower seeds and there's tiny little hole tiny little
 bird got stabbed are quite high so I'm not asking you guys to be a gorophobic or anything
 I'm just asking you to be a little careful around all those holes you see in your daily
 life if you happen to see one just step aside because although you might think oh that's
 just a hole there's no big deal it can't hurt me within a year you may find out how much
 damage a hole can actually do I guess I said that statement out loud and yes I'm saluting
 to Joseph Zatz he's saluting back we are going to give him the keys to the carboner copter
 we are taking off and we are headed out to the Soviet Union to helicopter is flying out
 Joseph take us high in the air as I do this introduction a while back I a long time ago
 did an episode about the KGB fighting aliens in Antarctica I actually might do that episode
 as a rerun because it's one of my favorite episodes and spoiler alert the KGB got slaughtered
 they got turned into concrete pillars you know those things you see outside of like a Walmart
 so people don't crash their car into the store that's what happened to the KGB they all work
 a Walmart now these KGB soldiers try to shoot down a UFO with a rocket launcher and they
 all got turned to giant concrete poles but see that can't be the end right that can't
 be the end of that so also that story was fake that story was provably fake but this
 story this story from a r u dot UFO for not r u a UFO is from a Russian UFO forum by Alexander
 Glasunov now this story might be this story might be real doesn't end with anyone turning
 into pillars of concrete this story actually is more in line with how the KGB would actually
 interact with alien life because this is how they interacted with humans as well Joseph
 bring us down low put on that stealth mode we're landing at Barsek Lemme's Island we're
 in the Aral Sea of Kazakhstan and I know I added letters and mispronounced each of those
 but it doesn't matter Joseph is our weapons master he's each given us the weapon that
 we deserve most based on our skill set he gives me this cool cool looking rifle with like
 all these laser pointers and there's just laser pointers taped onto the end of it and then
 he's like giving you I don't know like shotgun you like shotguns he's asking he doesn't know
 anything about weapons he's just handing out random weapons to people hey you look like
 you could use a grenade launcher gives it to like a 10 year old kid Joseph is now handing
 us all weapons we gotta check them because this is gonna be a dangerous mission guy we're
 putting on our ghillie suits we're going off the year is 1976 and it's dark it's night
 time and as we're sitting there in darkness we all got night vision on we see a boat come
 up to Barsek Lemme's Island there's been a lot of this island is uninhabited but there's
 been a lot of reports of people in the area I know that doesn't make sense but but I'm
 assuming that it means other fishermen I'm assuming fishermen had reported other fishermen
 going missing around this island the island itself was uninhabited but there were reports
 from locals that people had gone missing in the area so the Soviet Union wants to know
 what's going on here is it US secret spies here or US not secret spies you just walk
 around with big shirts and say I'm a spy on it in this landing craft is about a dozen
 KGB special forces troops these are the best of the best of the best they're being led
 by a major we'll call him major Jones major Jones hot everyone's like dude that's an
 American name I think he's the spy he's like what no I'm not I shift inside of side they
 jump all out of the boat now major Jones is leading these 12 special forces KGB guys so
 they're walking up this dark beach and now they're exploring the inner part of the island
 and even though it's so dark out they can start to see fog begin to roll through the
 area and the major describes a sensation of fear
 he had never known before he's been in a lot of dicey situations breaking into people's
 houses beating up peasants but he's never experienced fear like this so he holds his
 hand up to halt his men the fog just rolls over him now they had an aerial footage of
 this island they knew it was uninhabited that's why when the fog clears and they see a giant
 fence in the distance the major knows something's up so they begin to make their way towards
 the fence when they get to it's quite high the Russians actually have to climb over
 it they all scramble over it and now they're on the other side of this fence there's a
 rocky hill now going up and on top of it they can see in the darkness a 16 foot wide silver
 sphere just sitting on the ground soldiers all look at each other the major just stare
 straight ahead so major Jones commands his troops to get down get down get down and they
 begin moving through the darkness weapons ready this wasn't supposed to be here the
 fence was weird enough but now there's an alien craft they're walking up this hill very quietly
 and when they get to the top of it they see what's described as strangely dressed people
 there's three of them they're standing around this sphere the major sees these these strangely
 dressed people standing around and they're wearing holsters and in those holsters is
 what is described as a laser gun major Jones gives the command he goes listen what we're
 going to do is we're going to walk up to them really really quietly and then we're going
 to jump out we're going to point our guns at them we're going to take them prisoner
 because I really want to know who built that fence it's a really nice fence we're going
 to take a prisoner however men if they even think about reaching for one of those things
 in their holsters you know what the KGB does best and everyone knows everyone nods in agreement
 yeah they just shoot people so major Jones and his men start getting closer and closer
 to these aliens it doesn't describe them as actually being aliens they're just strangely
 dressed people could have been Amish for all we know but they generally don't have laser
 guns eventually the soldiers pop out and they're holding their guns aimed at the ready at these
 three strangers and major Jones has his weapon aimed at them as well one of the little alien
 dudes starts reaching it's just a minute touch but his hand goes to that weapon in his holster
 major Jones and his men know what they have to do they immediately open fire the aliens
 are all screaming and stuff they slaughtered these three dudes now that is pretty typical
 for the KGB right you can't knock them it gets results done they've been doing this
 for years generally you kind of want to keep one of them alive maybe to like you know find
 out secrets of the universe how to build spaceships things like that or you could just shoot three
 dudes just because they're strangely dressed and might have a weapon on them just massacre
 them major Jones really isn't worried about this at this point they have at least as giant
 silver orb they can like hang out take pictures and and reverse engineer that's something
 for the eggheads in Moscow to figure out what he's more interested in is that laser gun
 so major Jones walks up to one of these previously alive aliens and he pulls it out and it's
 actually like a wand he figures just by looking at it which direction whatever's gonna come
 out of it will come out of it I mean he has a 50/50 chance right he's either gonna destroy
 his arm or do something cool so he takes this wand type device out and he points it at the
 ground and he presses a button and it goes and everyone at first is very very afraid
 they don't know if he made the right choice it's 50/50 they don't know if this dude's
 about to get disappeared but nothing happens they hear that whistle noise and everyone
 is on edge even major Jones isn't exactly for sure what that whistle noise signifies
 but there's no light there's no flash it's just the noise and then nothing and then major
 Jones looks down and sees that the dirt where he had been pointing the rod at was beginning
 to turn into glass so this wasn't in fact some sort of laser weapon major Jones puts it in
 his belt I'm assuming it doesn't actually say that in the story but you're not gonna leave
 that behind at this point he is stationed at this silver sphere and there are scouts
 kind of surveying the area there are more of these things out there are there more of
 these really cool guns are gonna be able to have a laser tag battle to the death eventually
 one of the scouts comes running back and says major Jones major Jones found a cave I think
 there might be more of them in there suit up boys get all their weapons ready they're
 ready to go they begin making their way to this cave major Jones is leading his men through
 and it's just a normal cave but then he notices that the cave stops being a cave the walls
 stop being jagged and all rocking stuff they start to become smooth like walls as they're
 walking through this tunnel they begin to see tables which while those aren't very sci-fi
 everyone has one there's probably one in front of you right now you don't expect them in
 caves especially caves with smooth walls if you see a table in a cave don't call a national
 inquire that's kind of weird it's not super weird but they also saw a bunch of like weirds
 alien equipment is how it's described they're walking through this tunnel they're starting
 to see these tables and it looks like alien equipment is just being stored here it's not in use
 but as they continue to walk through the tunnel they see it starts to open up and in this massive
 open chamber it's full of alien technology view screens and control panels and all sorts of stuff
 and this is being used it's lit up little lights flashing and in this
 room they see a ton of these tiny little alien guys these guys are actually described as being
 dwarf size these may actually be gray aliens the people in the first part of the story they
 weren't described in any sort of alien fashion other than they were wearing weird clothing
 they could have just been vacationers honestly and they were just flying around in a silver-shaped
 balloon and i guess they also invented laser guns they were probably aliens but this part of the
 story actually seeing what's described as several dwarf sized aliens so most likely a room full of
 grays but it wasn't just a room full of gray aliens going about their business there was also two
 giant aliens sitting at different control panels now both of these guys are six foot five so not
 giant in the nephaleme sense like 13 foot tall but still six foot five is not something you want to
 go in combat against sure you're the kgb you got all these weapons but still these guys are pretty
 huge they're definitely familiar with alien tech they most likely have laser guns as well so major
 jones is kind of running this game through his head he goes okay here's the thing we can retreat
 because there's only 12 of us there's a bunch of these dwarf little alien dudes in here and these
 two giant guys so we can retreat come back with better forces we could bomb it we could gas it we
 could be like throwing gas grenades should have brought some of those but i didn't gas them out
 take them back dissect them all that stuff or we could keep them alive we could go in kind of hold
 them hostage that didn't work so well the first time just about 30 minutes ago but we can hold
 them hostage we can actually learn from them maybe we can actually apologize for what we had done
 before because we thought we were under attack maybe we can make first contact in 1976 we're at
 the height of the cold war we could use all this stuff but this technology is so much more useful
 if you can talk to the people who know how to work it out so he's running these games through
 his head he's trying to think what's the best move what would vladimir linand do then he then he
 goes what would stall and do his men pour into the room and begin to massacre everyone in it
 these kgb soldiers come in with guns blazing not a single word said they direct all their fire to
 mowing down all the tiny people the two chinese are still just sitting there they're not even
 aware what's going on until half the grays are split in half by russian gunfire goes on and on
 and on longer than i have breath for just play that segment over and over again put it in a loop
 they slaughter these guys they blow them up it would have been an absolute massacre and after
 they're done shooting everything smaller than four feet in that room the major then directs all of
 his fire towards the giants this is happening so fast the giants are still at their control panels
 when the first bullets come flying towards them it's in slow motion now these bullets
 flying towards the giants the giants begin to turn and the bullets begin to hit them
 automatic gunfire just hitting these aliens the aliens just start to stand up they start to stand up
 concentrated fire from automatic weapons 12 kgb special forces aiming at two targets and these
 giants are just getting up out of their chair cracking their back a bit oh yeah oh sit on the
 computer too long and then they just begin walking towards russians the bullets have no effect on
 these guys doesn't say that they're bouncing off of them doesn't say they're going through it's kind
 of a moot point because basically from the point of view of the kgb soldiers who are telling this
 story their bullets weren't working you weren't you weren't concerned about the physics of it
 you just massacred a ton of aliens and now the two threats left are just walking towards you
 like it's a bright sunny day so the kgb does something that's quite uncharacteristic they run away
 they've been running through this tunnel they stop being kgb agents they become scared humans
 they're running through this tunnel and these big giant aliens are chasing them
 when they finally get out of the tunnel all of a sudden a white beam shoots from the sky
 into the hill that the cave was burrowed into and then it turns red
 and then it turns blue well usa action if i don't say so myself but then it turns multicolored so
 then the patriotism leaves plus i'm pretty sure russia's flag is red white and blue doesn't matter
 you're seeing this multicolored beam shoot out of the sky into the top of this hill that
 hid this cave and they said they could actually it was this giant cylinder and it got smaller and
 smaller and thinner and thinner until eventually it was like a just the size of a pencil coming out
 of the night sky into this hill and then the beam disappears and the sky catches on fire
 and major jones and his men just stood there watching this
 completely bizarre phenomenon there would be really other than a nuclear blast there would be no other
 way you would see the sky on fire primordial earth the sky was on fire and now this
 they stood there for 20 minutes as this event continued just watching these flames
 above this hill and then finally it is a clear night they get back to their landing craft they
 do they don't go back in the cave because they're thinking oh maybe the aliens want to wait or
 maybe there's reinforcements we don't know it's 50 50 i already tried my luck with that once they
 go back to their landing craft go back tell their supervisors hey you won't believe what happened
 to us over there there's a fence so we're like what okay that's fine no no you don't let me finish
 there's something over the fence they're like oh i'm listening so the soviet union sends back more
 troops they scour every part of that island it's empty nothing but an island sitting in the middle
 of the soviet union stories like that i think are fun because they have a combination of stuff
 that we enjoy to hear about aliens and then you got the combat attack attack attack attack
 people shooting stuff your mileage may vary on that i do love combat alien stories but it's combined
 with that these things are everywhere everyone's always looking at the sky for a UFO all these
 UFO reports i mean that's why they're called UFOs but if you were planning any sort of long-term
 operation you have to have boots on the ground for example this the cold war the united states and
 the soviet union had sleeper agents in each other's countries in each other's allied countries they
 had little safe houses the aliens are here for scientific purposes we go out to the jungles
 and hang out with apes to observe them if they're here for military purposes we have bases as close
 as we can as close as we can get undiscovered to enemy territory they're here for some like
 subversive world conquering a long-term conspiracy reason then you would definitely need to have
 boots on the ground so i think stories like this are a very cool part of alien lord it also has
 the creepy factor so we have this story and it's action packed and not so much for the aliens they
 all got massacred but you have humans gunning down aliens it's always great because you know humans
 are better so this story is an action story but before the story starts it's a horror story
 because we get that segment of it but we don't get the story before it of the fishing boat
 floating empty in the aral sea and another fishing boat comes by it and they look
 this is Yuri's boat where did he go fishing oh he went to the island i told him not to go there
 let's bring his boat back and tell his wife a tugboat listing alone day and night day and night
 abandoned for days weeks who knows people had gone missing in this area so much so
 that the soviet union said we need to figure out what's going on out there and that's not one
 missing person that's not three missing people that's a lot of missing people for a national
 government to say let's figure this out so you would have to have a mass amount of people missing
 before it even came to the notice of kgb and even then a few more to really get them off their butts
 and figure out what was going on out there so we have the action packed part but what happened to
 those missing people where did they go i can keep making jokes about the kgb just slaughtering these
 aliens without any real contact with them but how many times did one of these fishing boats get too
 close to the island and a fog bank rolls off the island and covers up the boat and they find themselves
 on the island they're lost they're walking through the fog until they find a fence and hoping there's
 help they scuttle over it but there's not 12 of them it's just one lone fisherman he's not heavily
 armed he just has a fishing knife in his sheath what are the odds of him surviving any of these
 encounters with these aliens they were obviously armed and they were obviously hidden so if they
 need to keep their location secret they'll do whatever it takes how many soviet citizens
 disappeared on that island their names lost to time until the kgb showed up and shot everything
 with a heartbeat and remember these aliens just packed up and left they didn't leave earth they
 had a mission they set up somewhere else and after a few humans came in and slaughtered their entire
 staff save two giants the next location they set up they're going to be much more careful
 about letting intruders in they're going to have better security and they're going to have better
 weapons to fight off any adversaries but a byproduct of having an alien installation on earth
 is that it breaks the realm of the normal and the paranormal and every so often a dimension
 defying mist seems to spread out in the area so the next time you're out for your morning walk
 and you start to see that fog bank roll through your area maybe you should turn that walk
 into a run because while it might be a beautiful natural phenomenon it could also be something
 darker and more dangerous a portal to an alien base and unless you're a member of the kgb the
 chances of you ever being seen again are slim to none dead rabbit radio at gmail.com is going to
 be our email address you can also hit us up at facebook.com/dead rabbit radio twitter is at

 you don't have to listen to it every day but i'm glad you listen to it today have a great weekend guys
 you
