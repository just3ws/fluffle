1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
 Yet another reason to hate flies.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,000
 A mysterious man appears in Germany and nobody knows what to do.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,520
 And then we take a look at a recent bizarre crime way, where people are blaming their

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:18,200
 misdeeds on the zombies today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:28,840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,400
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I hope you're having a great day too.

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,360
 Coming up to the weekend, I hope you guys have an awesome, fun and safe weekend.

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,120
 We're gonna go ahead and get started here, we got a lot of stuff to cover, so let's

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,240
 board the Carpentercopter, get on, go go go.

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,640
 You're like dude, I just started the podcast, why are you rushing me?

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,640
 I'm pushing you at this point, get up, urgh!

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,760
 Push you into the Carpentercopter, kinda roll around.

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,160
 On the Carpentercopter already is our newest Patreon supporter, Alora Alora.

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,440
 So thank you so much for supporting the show Alora, it really means a lot.

15
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,200
 If you can't support the Patreon, just go ahead and get the word out about the show,

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,680
 that helps a lot as well.

17
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,480
 So we're taking off.

18
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,480
 Sounds like a rocket ship, but it's not, we're the Carpentercopter, I just got my sound effects

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,920
 mixed up for a second and the word mixed and missed, we're flying around, right?

20
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,040
 And you're like Jason, would you please stop drinking turmeric before recording the podcast?

21
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,040
 Never!

22
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,360
 I will not.

23
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,760
 And for new listeners of the show, I've discovered that turmeric, it's a combination of a normal

24
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,280
 thing that turmeric does to people or makes them feel good and then my mild allergic reaction

25
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,880
 to it makes them feel like I'm drinking whiskey.

26
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,280
 I feel like Alf, remember when Alf used to eat cat food?

27
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,400
 You're like no Jason, I'm not 45 years old, I don't remember Alf.

28
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,880
 Alf used to eat cat food and it would make him intoxicated.

29
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,880
 Wait, no!

30
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,440
 Or was that the prawns from?

31
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,240
 You're like Jason, you really can't drink turmeric during the show?

32
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,960
 You already can't remember half this stuff.

33
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,640
 What was the movie with the prawns?

34
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,640
 District 9.

35
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,280
 I've realized probably half this podcast is people yelling at it going, the answer is

36
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:14,200
 $2.1 million, like when I can't come up with an answer, I'm sure you guys are super frustrated.

37
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,400
 Let's get started with the episode.

38
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,720
 Now this next story is gross, just to let you know.

39
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:27,740
 So if you're eating noodles or top ramen or broth with a single noodle in it or anything

40
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:33,200
 noodley if you're singing the song Yankee Doodle Dandy, wait does that have a noodle

41
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,200
 in it?

42
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,840
 It's a Yankee Doodle once in town writing on a pony.

43
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,440
 It's like a feather in his head called it macaroni.

44
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,840
 I guess macaroni is a noodle.

45
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,760
 Anyways, did you know macaroni was a term for like a fashionable person and basically

46
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,240
 it was the, there was a British song making fun of Americans like oh look I'm going to

47
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,000
 put this feather in my cap and say how fashionable I am.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,040
 And the Americans loved the song so much they took it.

49
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,440
 That's hilarious dude.

50
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,280
 Don't insult an American, let's just take it and turn it into a top 40 song.

51
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,120
 So where was, oh yes, eyes.

52
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,920
 So wait, you didn't know I was going to talk about eyes.

53
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,760
 Okay, anyways, anyways I'm going to talk about eyeballs.

54
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,820
 So eyeballs and noodles.

55
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:18,160
 So if you don't like either of those or if you love both of those so much you don't want

56
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,360
 them ruined for you.

57
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,240
 You're like no don't ruin my eyes.

58
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,240
 Skip ahead.

59
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,320
 So anyways, the year is 2018, it's March and there's this woman.

60
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:32,880
 Now these people are unnamed because these are all medical journal stuff so again you

61
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,480
 know this is going to be gross.

62
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,520
 But since we have a new Patreon subscriber, Elora, we're going to have Elora as this

63
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,680
 68 year old woman.

64
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,200
 She's running through Carmel Valley, California.

65
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,400
 The most delicious part of California.

66
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,160
 It's kind of sticky though.

67
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:52,760
 So she's running through Carmel Valley, California, sorry.

68
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,080
 And she's just running.

69
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,840
 I mean, now to be fair, I don't run at 43.

70
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,000
 The fact that she's 68 and running kudos, kudos.

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,080
 I couldn't run from a pack of jaguars at this point.

72
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,520
 I mean I could probably bench her but I definitely couldn't outrun her.

73
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,960
 Anyways 68 year old woman is running and she turns a corner and she gets hit in the face

74
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,360
 with a bunch of flies.

75
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,560
 Now it's not like someone had flies was hiding there and threw them at her.

76
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,840
 It was just a giant swarm of flies flying in one direction.

77
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,280
 She's running in another one.

78
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,280
 She turns the corner.

79
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,700
 They hit her in the face so violently she says that she's spitting them out of her mouth.

80
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,320
 So it's not like three or four flies.

81
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,160
 It's like, remember in like Bugs Bunny cartoons where like the bugs would make a hammer and

82
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,320
 like mallet down daffy duck or whatever?

83
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,320
 Like that.

84
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,320
 There's that many flies.

85
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,320
 It was so dense.

86
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,400
 They were hitting her eyeballs and going into her mouth.

87
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,200
 She's like, spit them out.

88
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,440
 And then we're moving ahead a month.

89
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,720
 So now we're in April 2018 and this woman she's like, oh, Laura.

90
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,800
 Laura's going, oh my eyeball.

91
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,640
 My eye, my right eyeball hurts.

92
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,640
 So bad.

93
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,640
 It's super irritating.

94
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,640
 Okay.

95
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,640
 So now you guys know where this is going.

96
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,080
 She starts fleshing her eye out.

97
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,040
 She starts putting water in it and she pulls out as she's fleshing it out.

98
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,960
 She pulls out a half inch long worm.

99
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,600
 That's so disgusting.

100
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,000
 And then she's, she's, I, at that point I would immediately just go to the hospital.

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,200
 I'd go to the ER.

102
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,880
 I wouldn't run because we've established I can't do that.

103
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,640
 I would just walk to the hospital picking up heavy stuff as I'm going, get in there

104
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,200
 and be like, I found a worm in my eye.

105
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:37,840
 She though looks in the mirror and realizes there's a second worm in her eyes.

106
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,160
 So she peels that one off, tosses it down.

107
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,400
 I don't think she's thrown away.

108
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,320
 They should probably saving them for the doctor.

109
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,120
 Next day she goes to the doctor.

110
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,280
 Third worm in her eye.

111
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,360
 Just swirling around in there.

112
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,600
 These things are called the laesia gulosa.

113
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,880
 The laesia gulosa.

114
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,160
 And what happens is they're normally found in cow eyeballs or maybe cows in general,

115
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,920
 but definitely cow eyeballs.

116
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,880
 Because these, there are these type of flies.

117
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,560
 They're called face flies.

118
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,640
 They didn't know these existed.

119
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,600
 People, we don't need Cthulhu to come here.

120
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,480
 Cthulhu already exists.

121
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:25,440
 If we have a thing called face flies and they quote, consume eye secretions, i.e. eat your

122
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,960
 tears.

123
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,280
 That is, that is a demonic level insect.

124
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,680
 These face flies try to land on your eyeballs.

125
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,960
 They drink your tears and then they lay eggs and they get into your eyeball.

126
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,960
 Now very, very common among cows.

127
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,400
 And here's the thing.

128
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:49,420
 At this point, people are going, this might actually be a bad sign that we have a disease

129
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:54,880
 or we have this thing that's jumping species from cows to humans.

130
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,040
 And you go, well, bad luck, right?

131
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,880
 Well, this is the second time it's happened in two years.

132
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,480
 So the first time it happened in 2016, there was a woman in Oregon who got it.

133
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,560
 So that sucks because I live up here.

134
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,200
 And now this woman, the first woman, she found three worms.

135
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,280
 Eventually a doctor found a fourth worm.

136
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,800
 The woman in Oregon, she had 15 worms in her eyeballs.

137
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,640
 Same thing, just flies kind of landed on her eyes.

138
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,240
 I think she, what was she doing?

139
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,800
 She was horseback riding.

140
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,400
 She got a bunch of flies on her.

141
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,880
 So when this happened back in 2016 and it happened to this one woman, she had 15 worms

142
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,480
 in her eyes, there was this quote.

143
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:41,960
 This is almost certainly just an unfortunate random event because it's going to happen

144
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,200
 once in a million years or maybe once in a million minutes.

145
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
 I don't know.

146
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,520
 I don't know how random or rare it is.

147
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,040
 But when it happened in 2016, the medical community goes, oh, that sucks.

148
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,520
 I mean, it was bound to happen at some point.

149
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,720
 The fact that it's happened again just two years later makes people think, or the medical

150
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,960
 community think this isn't a random, rare.

151
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,360
 It was a statistical anomaly to happen the first time.

152
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,760
 The fact that it's happened twice in two years means that this may be an emerging

153
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,520
 Zootronic disease or Zootonic disease.

154
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,520
 What's the actual word here?

155
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,800
 Yeah, Zoo, sorry, neither of those.

156
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,000
 Zoonotic, zoonotic disease.

157
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,520
 So watch your eyeballs, guys.

158
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,520
 I hate flies.

159
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,760
 Flies are the worst, man.

160
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,840
 They're landing on stuff.

161
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,240
 What are they good for?

162
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,520
 Anyways, I've become a fly.

163
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,360
 I'm a racist against flies.

164
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,360
 I hate them.

165
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,360
 I remember once I took a BB gun.

166
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,360
 Nah, never mind.

167
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,360
 I'm going to tell that story.

168
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,680
 Anyways, let's go ahead and move on to our next topic here.

169
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,360
 You're like, Jason, just tell the story.

170
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,360
 Never.

171
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,080
 So we're going to go ahead and move on to, let's hop back in the Carbenter Cafeteria.

172
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,280
 I was wearing goggles the whole time, too.

173
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,360
 After telling you that story, your eyes are all swelling up.

174
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,320
 You're like, why didn't you tell me to bring goggles?

175
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,640
 I'm like, yeah.

176
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,560
 I'm that kind of podcast host.

177
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,280
 I like to see my listeners suffer.

178
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,480
 Let's hop back in the Carbenter Cafeteria.

179
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,720
 There's a little eye wash station in the back.

180
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,720
 You're washing your eyes.

181
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,960
 I'm all, hehehe, I put hot pepper in the eye wash station.

182
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,680
 You're all, ahhh.

183
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,960
 But your eyes burn now, but it did kill off all the worms.

184
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,960
 So see, I did it.

185
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,160
 I did it out of love.

186
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,680
 I cost you that pain because I wanted to get the worms out of your eyes.

187
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,480
 We're now flying to Germany.

188
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:25,960
 We're going back in time to the year 1851.

189
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:31,040
 Now we're going to a place called Frankfurt-Anderotor.

190
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,920
 Frankfurt-Anderotor.

191
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,200
 So we're just going to call it Frankfurt for short.

192
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
 And we landed there.

193
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
 Whole towns made hot dogs.

194
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,080
 You guys saw that joke coming a mile away.

195
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,160
 Don't even complain or groan about that one.

196
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,800
 Helicopter lands on a giant bun.

197
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,720
 Okay, you didn't see that joke coming.

198
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,240
 The helicopter lands on a giant bun.

199
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,240
 We get out.

200
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,120
 Pit forks and spoons.

201
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,120
 Forks and knives.

202
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,920
 Wait, who eats hot dogs with forks and knives?

203
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
 Never mind.

204
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,520
 We're walking around Hot Dog Town and it's 1851.

205
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:05,120
 And there is a dude standing in the middle of town and everyone's like, "Whoa, huh?

206
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,760
 What's up with this guy, huh?"

207
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,080
 Apparently they're all extras from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure in this town.

208
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,080
 "Whoa, dude.

209
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,080
 Who is he?"

210
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,480
 We're walking through the crowd and there's this guy just standing there in the middle

211
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,480
 of the crowd.

212
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,480
 "Hmm, so we walk up to him and we're like pushing these villagers out of the way or

213
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,000
 get out of the way.

214
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 Americans on the move.

215
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Go, go, go.

216
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,760
 Although half my audience isn't from America, you're technically U.S. citizens when you

217
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,520
 listen to this show, whether you like it or not.

218
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,960
 So we're pushing all these Germans out of the way.

219
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,960
 Get out of the way.

220
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,960
 Get out of the way."

221
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,280
 "Hey, what's your name?"

222
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:42,280
 And he turns to us and he goes, "I'm Jofer Voron."

223
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,080
 And we're like, "That's weird.

224
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,800
 Do you not know how to pronounce your own name?"

225
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,760
 And he goes, "Well, I'm assuming the person telling this story doesn't know how to pronounce

226
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,760
 my own name.

227
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,320
 I'm going to say it slowly this time.

228
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,120
 Jofer Voron.

229
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,760
 My name is Jofer Voron."

230
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,400
 We're like, "Okay, that's better.

231
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,600
 Thank you for pronouncing your name correctly."

232
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,120
 So what happened was one day everyone in this village town is hanging out and this dude,

233
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,040
 Jofer, shows up.

234
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,640
 Mr. pronounced it again already.

235
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,160
 "Jo," call him Jo.

236
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,800
 Jo shows up into town.

237
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,360
 And everyone's like, "Whoa, that's weird.

238
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,040
 What is this guy doing here?"

239
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,400
 And he speaks a little bit of German, just a little bit.

240
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,000
 Probably more than I do.

241
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,360
 I can say Guten Tag.

242
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,600
 And yeah, definitely he can speak more German than I can.

243
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,960
 He comes into town and he's like, "Hey guys, I need to sit down.

244
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,480
 I've been on a long journey."

245
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,360
 He kind of sits down and they're like, "What's going on?"

246
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,520
 And he's like, "Well, listen, I'm trying to find my brother.

247
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,920
 You guys happen to know where my brother is."

248
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,920
 And they're like, "Who's your brother?"

249
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,920
 And he's like, "Oh yeah, I guess I should have told you that part first."

250
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,800
 Starts describing his brother and everyone's like, "Nah, I don't know who you're talking

251
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,800
 about."

252
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,840
 He's like, "Listen, man, I'm all the way from Lacks area.

253
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,120
 And I got to come out here and I'm trying to find my brother.

254
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,120
 We came across the ocean.

255
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,560
 Like, I know he's here, but I can't find him."

256
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,160
 This is 1851.

257
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,520
 This isn't caveman days.

258
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,960
 I mean, people have been around the world and stuff like that.

259
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:10,600
 Aqua's number one hit around the world is just bumping all over in raves in Germany here

260
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,620
 in 1851.

261
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,640
 People know geography and people are like, "What?

262
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,360
 What's Lacks area?"

263
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,360
 Never heard of that place.

264
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,360
 He's like, "Lacks area?"

265
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,800
 It's like one of the biggest, it's like one of the most powerful countries.

266
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,000
 It's right across the ocean.

267
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,160
 Germans are like, "Are you talking about America?"

268
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,160
 He's like, "What?"

269
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,160
 "No, Lacks area."

270
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,160
 Lacks area.

271
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,480
 You know, it's the country.

272
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,320
 Is there somebody that I can talk to?

273
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,840
 Now, so again, broken Germans.

274
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,800
 So they're having a hard time talking to each other.

275
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,740
 And the villagers are like, "I've never heard of any place called Lacks area, but it could

276
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,740
 be a translation error."

277
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,180
 They go, "This is what they're able to gather.

278
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,700
 This is what they're able to gather."

279
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,700
 And so when they asked him why he was here, he said that he actually was searching for

280
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,700
 his brother.

281
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:58,900
 He was on a trip to find his brother, but the boat that he was on shipwrecked and he basically

282
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,500
 washed up on shore and started walking through Germany.

283
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,860
 When people start talking to him, he's able to explain a couple things.

284
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,820
 German is not his native language, obviously.

285
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,720
 His native languages are Lacarian and Abram.

286
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,240
 People are like, "Those aren't real languages."

287
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,560
 And he's like, "Yes, yes, they are."

288
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,880
 He also says that he worships a religion called Ipspation.

289
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,880
 Ipspation.

290
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:28,560
 And when he would ask to describe what Ipspation is, basically was Christianity.

291
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,440
 So people in town are like, "What is good?"

292
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,520
 It has to be a language issue.

293
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,640
 There has to be a language issue here.

294
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,480
 It must be trying to say Christian.

295
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,480
 He's saying this other word.

296
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,760
 It doesn't make sense.

297
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,380
 So they eventually get the elders of the town involved.

298
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:43,620
 And the elders in town sit and talk to him for a while and they come up and they go, "This

299
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,620
 guy's legit."

300
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,660
 Like, he's not getting these words mixed up.

301
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,060
 He actually worships something called Ipspation.

302
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:54,780
 And he speaks these weird languages and he says he's from this country, Laxaria.

303
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,500
 He's from...it's not a translation error.

304
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,180
 He's actually from Laxaria.

305
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:04,580
 Eventually, though, this story reaches not just the elders of town, but the learned people

306
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,580
 in Berlin.

307
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,540
 The power structure and they go, "We need to talk to this guy."

308
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,520
 At the very least, we're gonna laugh at him because his German sucks.

309
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,160
 At the very most, maybe there's a mystery to unravel.

310
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,880
 He goes to Berlin and he's never heard from again.

311
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,120
 He's lost to history.

312
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:25,380
 Now, that is a real story that was published long, long time ago.

313
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,040
 It's not an urban legend.

314
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,760
 It's not like the man of Toreed, which is a very famous version of the same type of

315
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,760
 story.

316
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,460
 It technically appears in our reality, saying he's from somewhere else.

317
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:40,820
 We can trace that story back to about the 70s, which technically is when the story is supposed

318
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,660
 to take place, but we can trace it back to one paragraph in a book about missing people.

319
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,180
 There's no documentation before that book was published.

320
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,580
 If you're interested, I did an episode on the man of Toreed.

321
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:56,340
 I think it's like episode 30 or something like that, a long time ago.

322
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:59,380
 But this is the same type of thing.

323
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:06,840
 Like the man of Toreed, we actually have a news article printed in the year 1851 involving

324
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,680
 this story.

325
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,600
 About a man named Jo Farvoren who showed up in Germany and had a hard time speaking language,

326
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,120
 all the details and more are in this news article.

327
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,680
 It ends with this.

328
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,040
 The sages of Frankfurt on the odor after much examination of the tale and its bearer have

329
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,600
 come to the conclusion that it is true.

330
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,760
 Some men believe things because they are incredible.

331
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:34,540
 However, Jo Farvoren has been carefully dispatched to Berlin and is now the subject of much scientific

332
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,500
 and curious gossip in the Prussian capital.

333
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:42,900
 What mystification hides under the story time will probably show, which is interesting because

334
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,900
 it didn't.

335
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,900
 We don't have any more information on what happened to this guy after he went to Berlin.

336
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:53,140
 So you go, "Whoa, there's actually a newspaper that printed a story about a guy who magically

337
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,540
 appeared and then got lost again to history."

338
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,540
 Here's the thing.

339
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,540
 Yes, that is true.

340
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,920
 It was published in a newspaper.

341
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,360
 Well, let me rephrase that.

342
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,680
 It was published in something called a newspaper.

343
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:11,480
 This may have been made up because apparently at the time there was a tax.

344
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:17,520
 There was a British stamp tax and part of that tax was if you published fiction or a

345
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,960
 magazine you had to pay a tax.

346
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,420
 But if you published a newspaper you didn't have to pay the tax.

347
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:30,400
 So Edward Lloyd at this time started publishing stuff with fiction in it but called it a newspaper.

348
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,600
 And then after a while the British government, he started doing that like in 1840s.

349
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,800
 And then the British government got wise to it and they're like, "What?

350
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,420
 Cats don't talk.

351
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:43,000
 Why is a Shewell's time machine in the newspaper?"

352
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,040
 And way before it was even published.

353
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,040
 How is it in here?

354
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,920
 It's a time machine, obviously.

355
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,360
 You have to stop doing that.

356
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,700
 And so Edward Lloyd was like, "Sorry, sorry, sorry for trying to rip off the British government."

357
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,900
 And then started publishing actual news in the newspaper.

358
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,900
 Is this story true?

359
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:03,740
 You know, the world is so vast and huge that it wouldn't shock me if every so out of 7

360
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,980
 billion people everyone just kind of pops in from another dimension or another era.

361
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,260
 Because that's pretty much what this would be.

362
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,820
 This guy, his brother was lost.

363
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,180
 He's traveling across the ocean.

364
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,060
 Some sort of portal opens up.

365
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,540
 Some sort of wacky thing.

366
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,560
 Quantum suicide, who knows?

367
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,940
 But when he crashes onto the shore, he ends up in our reality.

368
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,940
 Starts walking around.

369
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:26,740
 Now, I don't think he went to Berlin and they chopped him up and said, "I wonder if on their

370
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,220
 planet they have two hearts."

371
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,380
 They probably weren't even thinking that.

372
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:35,420
 They probably would just think, "Whoa, this guy is from someplace else."

373
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,140
 They said he seemed to have a pretty good knowledge of geography, though.

374
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,940
 So it was almost like just the names changed of places.

375
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,180
 But one of the key components to the story of the mandatory, and I'm not saying the story

376
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,180
 of mandatory is fake.

377
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,440
 I'm just saying we don't have a lot of information on it.

378
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,760
 One of the key components of the story of the mandatory is its temporary.

379
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:58,500
 Is that when you flop to an alternate dimension, you're only there for a window of time before

380
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,320
 you're pulled back out.

381
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,480
 And then you end up in your home dimension.

382
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,200
 So he may have gone to Berlin and simply just vanished on that trip.

383
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,460
 He may have lived a long life.

384
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:14,060
 But I kind of hope that he did go back to his home dimension and found his brother.

385
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,380
 That way it would be a happy ending for him and his brother.

386
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,540
 And then an interesting story for us.

387
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,540
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next.

388
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,220
 You were like, "Jason, that was a weird ending."

389
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,220
 "What?

390
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,220
 I like happy endings.

391
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,220
 Are you missing your brother?"

392
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:32,580
 Have you guys seen the trailer for that movie, 1917, about it's World War One?

393
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,860
 It looks dope about the guy.

394
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,060
 I like movies like this.

395
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,620
 I like very simple movies.

396
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,620
 This guy gets an order.

397
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,700
 It says, "Your brother and 1,200 men are walking into a German ambush.

398
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,420
 You have like two days to get there.

399
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,660
 They're all going to be massacred."

400
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:53,580
 And it's about a guy and his buddy walking from one end of the war to the other one.

401
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,300
 It's shot almost all handheld and it's supposedly supposed to be one.

402
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,780
 It's not, but it's supposed to seem like it's just one long over the shoulder camera shot.

403
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,700
 Like you're the third man in this party.

404
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,700
 Trailers look great.

405
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,460
 And I really like that director.

406
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,700
 Was it David Mendez?

407
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,980
 Sean Mendez is a singer.

408
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,420
 But anyways, 1917, it looks dope.

409
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:15,300
 Anyways, that is enough of you with anything we're talking about.

410
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,300
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

411
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,180
 So we're going, we're leaving behind Germany.

412
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,940
 We're going to an American interrogation room.

413
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,620
 So it's all like spooky and dark.

414
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,940
 I don't think the, I've never been in an interrogation room.

415
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,380
 I know they're supposed to be super uncomfortable.

416
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,500
 Police interrogation room.

417
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,940
 This guy is in the interrogation room.

418
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,940
 In this copy.

419
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,940
 Okay, so police interrogation room.

420
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,140
 Cop is sitting there across the table from this dude.

421
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,380
 And they're like, "So why'd you do it, William?

422
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,660
 This dude's name is William Berry.

423
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,660
 William Berry.

424
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:47,660
 Not Berry like, "Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

425
00:19:47,660 --> 00:20:17,660
 Not Berry like, "Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

426
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:40,820
 So who knows what's going on, but anyways, he's standing there next to this woman and

427
00:20:40,820 --> 00:21:10,780
 stabbing her in the back.

428
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:15,540
 He's like, "Oh my God, your shirt, it's ruined."

429
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,020
 And she's like, "I know.

430
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,340
 Also I'm bleeding."

431
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:22,100
 So he calls the ambulance and arrests William Berry.

432
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:26,340
 He was trying to escape to Knott's Berry Farm in a giant hot air balloon.

433
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,580
 Snoopy's his getaway driver.

434
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,060
 So anyways, Snoopy's in the other interrogation room.

435
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,780
 He's like, just shaking his head.

436
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,780
 You can't get the visual joke.

437
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,780
 I'm shaking my head.

438
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,780
 But the joke is a guy in a giant suit can't talk.

439
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:44,020
 Or I guess the joke actually is that Snoopy doesn't talk.

440
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,260
 He's the perfect accomplice.

441
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,820
 He will never rat you out.

442
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,740
 Anyways though, that joke would have been much better if you guys could have seen me

443
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,180
 shaking my head.

444
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,900
 The point being William Berry is caught and the cops ask him, "Why'd you stab that woman

445
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,900
 multiple times?

446
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,900
 Like did you know her?"

447
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,020
 And he's like, "No, I didn't know her."

448
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,580
 And you won't believe she was being really mean to me.

449
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,780
 And she tried to feed me to the zombies.

450
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,420
 And the cops are like, "What are you talking about?"

451
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,580
 He's like, "Zombies!"

452
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,260
 He was trying to feed me to the zombies.

453
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,260
 And the cops are like, "Okay, you're nuts.

454
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,340
 We'll lock him up."

455
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,940
 That's the end of that story, right?

456
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,620
 But that happened in this year.

457
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,820
 That happened in October 26, 2019.

458
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:26,980
 Last year, June 26, 2018.

459
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,580
 Massive fire.

460
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,500
 We're going to El Granada, California.

461
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:37,540
 Raging fire.

462
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,860
 900 hay bales burning in the field.

463
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,860
 Not a big loss.

464
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,820
 Cows go a little hungry.

465
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:47,260
 Do you use hay for anything other than cow food?

466
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:52,900
 Did you know that hippos are herbivores, but if there's no food around, they will eat

467
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,900
 other hippos?

468
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,900
 Or they...

469
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,900
 Okay.

470
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,380
 At least, let me back out here.

471
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,500
 They will at least eat other animals.

472
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,260
 I believe they will eat other hippos.

473
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,980
 Because hippos are animals and I was reading stuff about cannibals.

474
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,220
 Recently, cannibal animals.

475
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,980
 Hey, that rhymes!

476
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,900
 Has no one ever figured that out yet?

477
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,900
 Cannibal animals?

478
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,900
 How is that not a band?

479
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,860
 How is that not the name of every band ever?

480
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,860
 Cannibal animals.

481
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,340
 Anyways, hippos will at least eat...

482
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,060
 I would love to see a hippo try to eat another hippo.

483
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,420
 But if a hippo doesn't...

484
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:28,020
 If a hippo is a herbivore, but if it doesn't have any food, it will eat a fox.

485
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,460
 Or it'll eat like a lion cub or something.

486
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:34,780
 So it'll probably also eat a bunch of marbles in the game Hungry Hungry Hippos.

487
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,300
 But um, oh, fire, fire, flame.

488
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,340
 Um, hey, hey, cows eating, hey, that's where we were going with this.

489
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,140
 That happened on June 26, 2018.

490
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:47,380
 July 3, 2018.

491
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,980
 Huge fire, again, same area.

492
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,700
 This time 865 hay bales erupt in flame.

493
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:58,780
 Now, what's weird about this, other than a bunch of cows being like, "Oh, I'm so hungry."

494
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:03,460
 Is them talking, being able to tell people they're hungry.

495
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:08,500
 But is that a woman was spotted at the scene of these fires and apparently she was like

496
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,500
 driving around.

497
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,460
 I mean, it wasn't in the middle of nowhere, it was like farmland, so of course like people

498
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,460
 would drive around.

499
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,060
 But this woman was driving around.

500
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:20,300
 Very, very suspicious people kept seeing this woman and she was making odd statements.

501
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,140
 Not statements like, "Oh, look at the fire, it burns, it burns away the evil."

502
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,180
 Just weird people that was...

503
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,500
 Just never kind of making people a little suspicious.

504
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,820
 Firefighters were seeing her and everything like that.

505
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,660
 So eventually she does get tracked down, she gets arrested.

506
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,340
 Monica Louise Berlin, 39.

507
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,220
 She's 39 years old.

508
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:44,140
 She says, the cops arrest her and she's like, "Listen, officer, I know that you have a

509
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:48,380
 duty to arrest me, but I need you to know that we're on the same side.

510
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:53,940
 We are both fighting for the sake of good."

511
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,940
 You get that, right?

512
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,340
 You and me were same sides of the opposite coin.

513
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,900
 He's like, "I think you got that phrase backwards."

514
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,500
 She's like, "Yes, you're right.

515
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,460
 We're different sides of the same coin.

516
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,420
 You see, you fight with a badge and a gun.

517
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,700
 I fight with fire and hay."

518
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,020
 She's like, "What are you talking about?"

519
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,780
 The zombies.

520
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:23,020
 See, I know that there's a cult operating in the area, a doomsday cult.

521
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,500
 And part of their plan was to use the hay bales.

522
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,500
 They were going to move them.

523
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:32,100
 They were going to get their zombie slaves to move the hay to block the roads.

524
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:37,340
 And so when doomsday came, the zombies would descend on the town of El Granada, the shining

525
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,940
 jewel of California.

526
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,620
 Everyone knows where this place is.

527
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:46,260
 And the zombies would come into town and we would go to escape.

528
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,380
 The hay would be blocking the road.

529
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:53,380
 We'd be trapped and it would be just one long smorgasbord.

530
00:25:53,380 --> 00:26:02,660
 I mean to say, we would have been killed, but I saved us by burning all those hay bales.

531
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,380
 You're welcome, officer.

532
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,260
 You're welcome.

533
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:12,660
 Now obviously she's charged with felony arson, destruction of property, all sorts of stuff.

534
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,100
 I have two questions about that.

535
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,460
 And is there a cult in the area?

536
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,460
 Most likely not.

537
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,060
 But again, conspiracy theorists, there might be.

538
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,060
 Two.

539
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,060
 Those aren't real zombies.

540
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:26,020
 I guess that's not really a question, but real zombies don't push hay.

541
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,540
 And I'm not going to end this with an argument.

542
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:30,700
 I'm running this episode on an argument with what real zombies are.

543
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,220
 This is my concern with these type of stories.

544
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,020
 We got these two crazy people saying that.

545
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:39,540
 And this is just stuff that's happened recently.

546
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:43,780
 There's always a weirdo story about a guy believing that zombies are attacking and he's

547
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,900
 taking pod shots out in the dark.

548
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:51,900
 Or zombie apocalypse is coming and the family's running to go prep somewhere, whatever.

549
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,900
 This is my concern with this stuff.

550
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,980
 It's the boy who cried wolf.

551
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:00,500
 The other day I made a passing comment that, oh, you know, zombies are kind of passe at

552
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,780
 this point.

553
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,820
 But it is a possible threat.

554
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:10,460
 The living, the dead coming back to life, not so much, but any sort of infection, any

555
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:15,740
 sort of disease that changes the way the brain works.

556
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:19,820
 Coupled with the fact that we got 7 billion people on the planet, coupled with the fact

557
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:26,260
 that diseases are crossing from cow eyeballs to human eyeballs, it's not irrational to

558
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:32,860
 think that at some point a disease may emerge that makes people act like zombies.

559
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:37,060
 Not necessarily be zombies, but act like zombies.

560
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,980
 And what happens is whenever one of these crazy people walks around and does something

561
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:43,660
 stupid and goes, "Those are zombies!"

562
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,660
 People laugh.

563
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:48,220
 It's great because they tend to happen around Halloween because people are preoccupied with

564
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:52,460
 that stuff or at least it gets reported around then and walking dead ratings go up and all

565
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,620
 that stuff.

566
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:59,620
 But what happens is this is how the boy cries wolf.

567
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:04,780
 Some day a newspaper article will appear and it will be "Man believes that town is under

568
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,820
 influence of zombies shoots mayor."

569
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:11,700
 Now that's a bad headline.

570
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,140
 It should be the mayor gets shot first.

571
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:18,740
 That's obviously horrible that guy shot that mayor.

572
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,260
 But these stories start happening with more and more frequency.

573
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:24,060
 You have people talking about "zombies."

574
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:28,380
 You have people talking about being eaten alive, this fear, something happened in the

575
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,380
 town.

576
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,780
 They got jumped by a couple homeless people and one guy tried to take a bite out of them

577
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,780
 and the article is like "Zombie attack?"

578
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:38,700
 Same thing we saw when that guy got his face eaten off in Florida.

579
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,620
 How it was really sensationalized.

580
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:45,940
 Which to be fair, that is a sensational story.

581
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:52,940
 But I'm just afraid that if these encounters start happening in small pieces, we're not

582
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,500
 going to realize it until the threat shows up.

583
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,020
 A man could have literally been standing on the street corner totally minding his own

584
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:03,780
 business and there's a woman waiting for the bus in front of him and she's like "Ugh."

585
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:11,620
 And then she turns to bite him and then in self defense he stabs her to death and then

586
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:16,260
 they just look at this guy standing over this 90 pound woman and they're like "dude why'd

587
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,100
 you pull a knife out and stab her multiple times?"

588
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,100
 And she's laid there and she died and he's like "she was trying to bite me.

589
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,740
 I think she was a zombie."

590
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,220
 She had this look in her eyes.

591
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,980
 That guy's going to jail.

592
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:30,140
 And how many times will that happen in these little incidences where people are getting

593
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:36,540
 this contagion and attacking the person next to them and it doesn't spread right away or

594
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:41,140
 we don't know the transmission vectors are or maybe it does spread but both people die

595
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,140
 so quickly in the melee that it just kind of ends there.

596
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,540
 How many times are these little stories going...

597
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,180
 These two guys were nuts.

598
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,340
 These two people were nuts.

599
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:55,420
 But how many times will these little stories pop up over the course of a time that are

600
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:59,940
 things that could have led us to realizing that "oh this is actually a big threat.

601
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,300
 Zombies are knocking down your door.

602
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,380
 You're like oh I should have been paying closer attention to what was going on around me in

603
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,580
 the newspaper."

604
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:15,620
 If worms can hop from a cow's eyeball into your eyeball just from a fly hitting your face

605
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:21,900
 the way diseases are being transmitted are just way too...

606
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:26,340
 If that's the case it's way too easy to be having this spread between animal and human

607
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,340
 diseases.

608
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:32,260
 And we're looking at stuff like rabies coupled with really any other disease.

609
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:35,620
 It could be a bad period of time for humanity.

610
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:39,580
 70,000 years ago volcano went off and it so drastically changed the environment of the

611
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,580
 planet.

612
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:44,160
 Humanity was basically reduced to only a thousand people.

613
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:49,860
 And from that thousand people we've regrouped to become the powerhouse that we are today.

614
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:57,780
 But we were extremely lucky and we weren't fighting crazy versions of ourselves.

615
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:02,300
 It is possible that a disease will wipe us out but I think the worst disease would be

616
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,940
 the one that turns us against each other.

617
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:11,420
 That makes humans crazy and bloodthirsty and self-destructive killing machines.

618
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:15,500
 And we won't know that's happening until it's too late.

619
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:20,300
 Because whenever these little articles pop up where someone's attacked or something suspicious

620
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:24,140
 happens or whatever we're going to laugh those stories off just like we laugh these ones

621
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:33,860
 off until those bloody hands are clawing at our faces.

622
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,580

 I'm glad you listened to it today.
