1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
 Did a popular travel website actually cover up rapes so they would continue to get advertising

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,600
 revenue?

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:14,680
 And today we take a look at one of the most requested topics on the Conspiracy Iceberg,

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,360
 CCAXX1, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:28,960
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,160
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,160
 I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,520
 I hope you're having a great day too.

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,520
 We actually got a lot of stuff to talk about today.

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,080
 So we're going to go ahead and jump into it.

11
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:42,200
 Now it is October and I was bemoaning the fact during World War II never existed that

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,120
 episode that I haven't been talking a lot about ghosts in October.

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,160
 So I think I'm going to squeeze a ghost story in here because there's so many.

14
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,480
 There's so many ghost stories.

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,080
 This one I thought was particularly gruesome and I think it's a good way to, I mean what,

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,880
 it's like a week till Halloween at this point.

17
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,120
 It's like six days.

18
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,000
 So let's go ahead and squeeze one in.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,240
 Now this one is generally known as the Bump in the Carpet.

20
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,280
 So we're going back in time to the 1900s.

21
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,360
 Well, specifically 1900 that year and this takes place in a town called Dark Harbor Main

22
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,360
 which is a real place.

23
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,680
 I don't know why they would name that, that.

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,320
 Don't think they'd get a lot of visitors or people would want to move there.

25
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,440
 I don't really understand the appeal of living anywhere by the water.

26
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,880
 It's spooky, especially at night.

27
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,400
 But anyway, so there was this dude named Slothiel Stoner.

28
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,400
 Slothiel Stoner.

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,640
 And I will say this, when you try researching anything with the word stoner in it, everything

30
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,160
 is just a weed joke.

31
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,600
 Especially if you're looking for stoner ghost or stoner house.

32
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,200
 I was getting all sorts of nonsense.

33
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,840
 But anyway, so Slothiel Stoner lived in Maine and he was pretty well off and he hooked up

34
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,840
 with this young girl, not like criminally young, but younger than him.

35
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,320
 And they fell in love, but it was that really like, they weren't really in love.

36
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,640
 They got together for whatever reason and they were constantly fighting.

37
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,960
 Now she came from a, she was raised in kind of a different household where everything was

38
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,680
 really nice and he just had like a basic house and the woods had, he had wood floors.

39
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,160
 Now they fought all the time, all the time.

40
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,440
 But the biggest thing they fought over was the fact that the floors were wood and her

41
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,000
 feet were cold all the time.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,200
 Now it is the 1900s, they didn't have heaters.

43
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,680
 They had like fireplaces and stuff, but it's not like you have central heating.

44
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,400
 So she was caught, they fought over everything, but this was a sticking point.

45
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,000
 She's like, why don't you put a rug in the, in the foyer?

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 I want a rug.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 I want a rug.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 And he's like, oh, I'm a fish a man.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 I'm a fish a man.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,240
 Like I'm not a rug merchant.

51
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,840
 But anyways, they fought all the time over this.

52
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,000
 So anyways, after a couple of years of this, he's like, you know what, whatever, he was

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,320
 out doing fish stuff and he came across the market and they were selling rugs.

54
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,880
 And he's like, you know what, I'm just going to all, you know, happy wife, happy life.

55
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,480
 He went and he got a nice rug and he goes, my wife will like this.

56
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,580
 And he took it home and he was nailing it into the floor, which I guess is something

57
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,580
 you do with rugs.

58
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,580
 I don't know.

59
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,600
 Like I always thought they just like laid there.

60
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,480
 I've never had like, I've either moved into places that already have carpeting or I just

61
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,440
 buy like a bunch of throw rugs and just throw them on top of each other.

62
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,240
 But he's nailing the rug into the floor and she walks in and she sees it.

63
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,920
 And instead of being like, oh, that's so sweet.

64
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,920
 He compromised.

65
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,680
 Finally, she just flips out on him and then she says, I hate that rug like I hate you.

66
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,680
 He then uses the hammer to just beat her to death.

67
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,640
 He's like totally done and he throws her body under the rug.

68
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,200
 Trust me, a ghost is showing up.

69
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,800
 It's not just a gruesome domestic violence story.

70
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,480
 He beats her to death with the hammer and throws her under the rug and then nails the

71
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,480
 rug down on top of her.

72
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,580
 But she actually wasn't dead yet.

73
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:53,240
 She was alive for two days underneath the carpet.

74
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,720
 Just moving around.

75
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,720
 She's weakened.

76
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,560
 She can't like break through the nails or like rip through the carpet or anything.

77
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,920
 Sure carpets back then were pretty well made because they were like expensive and handmade

78
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,920
 probably.

79
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,080
 But so she's wriggling under the carpet and he's just doing, you know, fisherman stuff.

80
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,960
 And then one of his buddies comes over to visit and he's like, hey, Slathen, what's up, dude?

81
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,600
 Hey, we're going to play cards, dude.

82
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,680
 We're going to, you know, hang out in front of the fireplace and tell stories.

83
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,280
 And he realizes there's this giant lump, a woman sized lump under the foyer carpet.

84
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:30,960
 And so the friend removes the carpet and finds the body and Slathen, I know I've pronounced

85
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,440
 his name differently each time.

86
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,400
 His name is actually Slathiel.

87
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,440
 But anyway, so Slathiel was just like whatever.

88
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,200
 He was taken to a mental hospital.

89
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:45,640
 To this day, if you put a carpet in that house, it will start to bunch up like there's a lump

90
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,320
 in the middle of it.

91
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,800
 And like blood stains will appear on your carpet.

92
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,200
 That's the story of the bump in the carpet.

93
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,640
 Now I read that scary story years ago in my favorite book, National Directory of Haunted

94
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,640
 Places.

95
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,840
 I'll have the link below because it's just a great encyclopedia of haunted stories.

96
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,840
 Now when I read it back then I was like, oh my God, that's so scary.

97
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,440
 As I've gotten older I realize there are several problems with this story.

98
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,520
 One, it's not true.

99
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,880
 I mean, I guess that's the biggest problem.

100
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,040
 When you make a statement that every time you put a carpet down and now bunches up and

101
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:23,200
 blood stains appear, your first thing as a paranormal investigator or a debunker, a

102
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:28,040
 skeptic would say, well, I will buy a carpet and we will go out there and do that.

103
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,520
 But it's never been like if it always does it, we've never seen any photos of it, we've

104
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,720
 never seen any video tape of it.

105
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,400
 I tried looking up Slothiel Stoner.

106
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,760
 I couldn't find any record that this guy existed.

107
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,880
 If I have any, I do have listeners out in Maine.

108
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,960
 If you guys live near Dark Harbor or live in Dark Harbor for whatever reason, I imagine

109
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,960
 it's spooky.

110
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,440
 I imagine there's crows everywhere on dead trees.

111
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,160
 But if you can find some proof that this guy existed, that would be awesome.

112
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,600
 But I can't find this guy ever existed.

113
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,360
 I can't find any proof that the murder actually took place, let alone that anyone has tried

114
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,480
 to replicate something that supposedly always happens.

115
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,240
 However, I think it's a good spooky story and that's why I wanted to share with you

116
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,080
 guys six days before Halloween.

117
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,480
 I like spooky stories, but I also like kind of trying to figure out whether or not they're

118
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,480
 actually true.

119
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,520
 I think it's still fun, it's a still fun story.

120
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:28,640
 So we're gonna jump in to a story that's a little less fun here, a little less endearing,

121
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,800
 not saying that domestic violence is necessary endearing, but I mean at least that had like

122
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,280
 a spooky ghost to it and we're, and she didn't really get killed because she never existed

123
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,280
 in the first place.

124
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,520
 But so there's a website and I'm sure you guys have all heard about it.

125
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,840
 It's TripAdvisor, tripadvisor.com.

126
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,040
 And they're a fairly popular website for booking trips going places.

127
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,200
 I don't travel much, but I'm sure other people do and I'm sure they've used TripAdvisor in

128
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,200
 the past now.

129
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:00,240
 Back in 2017, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, a newspaper in Milwaukee, did an expose on

130
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,400
 TripAdvisor.

131
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:07,440
 And what they found was that people were booking trips with TripAdvisor.com.

132
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,520
 They would read the reviews of these hotels and they'd be like four stars, five stars,

133
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,840
 they're like, "This hotel is great, I loved going there, it was so awesome."

134
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,240
 This one woman using TripAdvisor asked, "Hey, how's this hotel?"

135
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,280
 Fifty-five responses popped up because you can obviously rate the hotel yourself and

136
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,400
 then if someone asks you can say, you can comment on their post.

137
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,280
 Fifty-five responses to her request of, "How's this hotel?"

138
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,000
 Twenty-four of them were great, they're like, "This hotel is awesome."

139
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,760
 Twenty-seven of them were deleted.

140
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:44,120
 So people wondered, "Well, that's a pretty big amount of deleted comments on a hotel."

141
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,040
 And of course people could be like, "Oh, I don't like them down there, their skin's too

142
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,880
 dark or I don't like them down there, they smell or whatever."

143
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,480
 You could have just like troll comments.

144
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,960
 Or it could have, TripAdvisor doesn't allow third party comments in the fact that you

145
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,080
 can't say, "My sister went down there and it was full of termites."

146
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,960
 So it has to be an experience you had at that hotel so they don't allow third party comments.

147
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,080
 So it could have been totally troll comments, it could have been third party comments, but

148
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,480
 still that's a huge amount.

149
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,160
 Twenty-seven deleted comments out of a total of fifty-five.

150
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:25,680
 And the article was mainly focused on was there were allegations of rape at these hotels,

151
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,000
 at various hotels, not in one geographical area, but they would use TripAdvisor, they

152
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,080
 would go to these hotels, they would get raped, and then they would rape, well obviously,

153
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:44,640
 you know, they would try to talk to the authorities, they would, and it's just like, "Oh no, you

154
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,240
 were just drunk, you just remembered it wrong," stuff like that.

155
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,520
 They would go on TripAdvisor and they would review this and say, "Don't go to this hotel,

156
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,320
 I had a drink and I don't have a problem in drinking."

157
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,240
 One of the stories was I was there with my husband, we were at the pool, we had two drinks,

158
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:05,440
 we both blacked out, we woke up, I felt that I had been sexually assaulted.

159
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,680
 My husband's thumb was broken and they reported that.

160
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,240
 They reported that to the authorities and they reported that on TripAdvisor.

161
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,880
 The comment was deleted.

162
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,440
 The woman goes, "Why did you delete my comment?"

163
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,960
 She's talking to TripAdvisor and they say, "Oh, because you used third-party information."

164
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,320
 And she goes, "What do you mean?"

165
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,840
 And they go, "Well, you said your husband's thumb was broken and it was the doctor who

166
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,640
 said his thumb was broken, right?"

167
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,000
 And she's like, "Yeah, he was diagnosed with a broken thumb."

168
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,600
 They go, "Doctor is third-party, we don't allow third-party comment."

169
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,080
 So that she would take that out.

170
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,880
 You'd have other, and they still wouldn't post it.

171
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,720
 And this wasn't the only case, you had a total of three women over the course of three different

172
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,360
 years report rapes on TripAdvisor.

173
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,560
 They would say, "Listen, I was there, the security guard tried to rape me.

174
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,520
 Do not go to this hotel, it's absolutely horrible."

175
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,520
 Comments deleted.

176
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,520
 Post is deleted.

177
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,560
 It doesn't go up on there.

178
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,320
 One of the women who reported a rape there, the TripAdvisor, deleted the comment.

179
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,400
 Seven years later, because she was fighting the whole time, they put the comment back

180
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,960
 up on the site for that particular hotel in chronological order.

181
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,760
 So it appeared seven years back in the history, and the thread was closed, no one could respond

182
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,960
 to her comment.

183
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:23,280
 The question is, what would TripAdvisor have to gain from covering this stuff up?

184
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,080
 They're just a travel agency.

185
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,200
 They're just a website.

186
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,720
 The thing is, is that this news article exposed a couple things.

187
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,640
 One, when you look at hotels on TripAdvisor, they're almost always rated four or five stars.

188
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,880
 I shouldn't say always, but they're mostly rated four or five stars.

189
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,160
 Very rarely do you see like three, two-star stuff like that.

190
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,600
 They're usually highly rated.

191
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,920
 A hotel that has, a hotel can charge extra like 11% more on their price if they have

192
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,760
 five stars and they don't lose any bookings, because people see five stars, they'll pay

193
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,880
 the extra money, because it's so highly rated.

194
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,480
 But how can almost every hotel be four or five stars?

195
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,320
 That must mean that TripAdvisor is messing with the algorithm.

196
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,200
 TripAdvisor gets money from resorts and hotels advertising on TripAdvisor's site.

197
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,000
 They also get commissions on some of these bookings.

198
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,240
 So they have a vested interest in making sure that the sites are highly rated.

199
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:26,300
 They have a vested interest in making sure that these crimes, I mean, and I'm focusing

200
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,560
 on the rapes, because I mean, honestly, it's the most sensational of them, but there's

201
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,880
 other things with people having their belongings missing and things like that.

202
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,880
 You have these crimes taking place and people reporting them on TripAdvisor and TripAdvisor

203
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,160
 burying the comments or deleting the comments for whatever reason.

204
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,960
 They had another woman who, I think she was the one who was sexually assaulted by the

205
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,360
 security guard.

206
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,400
 They just wouldn't put it on there.

207
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,000
 They kept saying it has this wrong with it, it has that wrong with it, and she kept modifying

208
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,600
 it and they just, they never posted it.

209
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,360
 The one woman at least got her story posted up there, but again, it was buried under seven

210
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,360
 years.

211
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,880
 Since the article came out, this article, this Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article came

212
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:07,720
 out in 2017 in November, of course, more people have come forward and say that experience

213
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,560
 happened to me.

214
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,520
 Not just that I was raped there, but that I had a horrible experience that involved

215
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:19,120
 some sort of criminal activity and TripAdvisor took my rating off.

216
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,640
 Now, the reason why I wanted to talk about this story is we talk a lot about conspiracies

217
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:29,360
 and we talk about, there are conspiracies that are flat out fake, no pun intended, flat

218
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,360
 earth.

219
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,960
 There's just a 100% fake conspiracy.

220
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:38,320
 Then there are the conspiracy theories that are true and that affect people on a daily

221
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,320
 basis.

222
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,320
 This is one of them.

223
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,080
 This is a conspiracy.

224
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:52,360
 This is companies getting together and exploiting people's pain and suffering for money.

225
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,280
 I think most conspiracy, most of the true conspiracy theories out there, most of the

226
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,520
 true actual conspiracies out there are caused by human greed.

227
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,680
 That is the main motivation behind them.

228
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,720
 Some people feel like they're doing something moral or they just want to feel powerful,

229
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,640
 but a lot of them, they'll come down to this and this is a true conspiracy.

230
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,600
 Of course, TripAdvisor is saying, yes, it is a conspiracy theory.

231
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,600
 That's not true.

232
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,920
 But I think sometimes it's interesting to take a look at actual conspiracies that are

233
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:28,600
 provable and have been proven, like I believe this has been proven, that affect people.

234
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,840
 It's very sexy to talk about the reptilian shapeshifters taking over the planet, but

235
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,960
 sometimes when we talk about conspiracy theories, we do also want to highlight the ones that

236
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:44,440
 are true, that do affect people and are still going on today.

237
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,360
 The next story I wanted to talk about, it's funny because I had this story prepped to

238
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,280
 go before I went on vacation.

239
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,800
 So that was back in August.

240
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,880
 I had CCA XX1 ready to go.

241
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,520
 I was hesitant to put it out, not because that I'm afraid that if I record it, I'm

242
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,800
 going to get arrested or I'm going to disappear or anything like that.

243
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:11,960
 I was hesitant because I feel that it deals with a particular subject matter that I'm

244
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,520
 not 100% well-versed on.

245
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,440
 Now, you're thinking, Jason, you couldn't even talk about sexy coconuts with any sort

246
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,160
 of knowledge base.

247
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:28,280
 And to be fair on that, I was talking about the coconut they murr, how to fur on it like

248
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,280
 a coconut, they don't.

249
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:36,720
 As I was getting the artwork ready for it, I'm looking at all these pictures and I'm

250
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,320
 like, they're not even furry.

251
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,880
 So that's part of the issue of a single person doing a daily podcast.

252
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,920
 Sometimes slight details fall through.

253
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:52,720
 I guess it has a little bit of fur, but this subject is quite complex.

254
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,520
 I'm going to have to focus it in into about 9, 10 minutes, but when we get to the end,

255
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:02,240
 you'll kind of start to see the weaknesses of my personal knowledge in a certain area.

256
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,760
 And so I would like to reach out to you guys who listen to it, who will have more experience

257
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,240
 with this to kind of help me suss it out.

258
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,960
 Because I really believe that I figured out what CCA XX1 is now.

259
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,880
 Let's go ahead and go on the journey of CCA XX1.

260
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,040
 It is something that's been on the conspiracy iceberg since 2017.

261
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,040
 So this is one of the oldies like Aiglish Travel.

262
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,040
 CCA XX1, people look at it and that's all that it shows.

263
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,600
 CCA-XX1.

264
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,200
 Just as humans, when we see something mysterious, we want to know more about it.

265
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,560
 So there was quite a few theories over what this was, just like golf rumors where people

266
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,360
 were kind of thrown out theories and seeing what was coming up.

267
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,680
 And it was also one of those things saying, if you talk about this, you're going to get

268
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,960
 arrested, if you talk about this, you're going to disappear or goblins are going to

269
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,280
 come out of your vents or whatever.

270
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,360
 You're going to get blown up by a space laser.

271
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,700
 So let's start with that.

272
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,920
 Not being blown up with a space laser, but so one of the theories was that it was the

273
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,920
 platform.

274
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:04,800
 It was basically the operating platform for what's known as the Zuma satellite.

275
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:12,600
 Now the Zuma satellite is a mysterious payload that was on a SpaceX rocket that supposedly

276
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,080
 failed and the satellite was never launched into orbit.

277
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,400
 There's been speculation that it's a spy satellite.

278
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,760
 There's been speculation that it's a killer satellite in the sense that it's a weapon

279
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,680
 that's sent up to destroy other satellites.

280
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,880
 There's been speculation of all sorts of stuff.

281
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,840
 I'm sure people have thought it's Project Bluebeam, which is a theory that holographic

282
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:37,040
 aliens are going to appear in the sky or holographic gods going to appear and it's the start of

283
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,040
 the New World Order.

284
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,280
 I'll do another episode on that because that's quite fascinating, but there's a lot of theories

285
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,440
 of what the Zuma satellite is.

286
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:47,400
 The official story is the satellite failed to get into orbit.

287
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:52,000
 There was this issue with the actual launch and it basically plummeted earth or disappeared

288
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 or blew up.

289
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,880
 We don't know what the Zuma satellite was.

290
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,000
 No country has taken credit for launching.

291
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,680
 It was a private SpaceX rocket.

292
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,840
 No country has come forward and said we're the ones who created this satellite.

293
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,320
 It was a private company that created it.

294
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:11,240
 Supposedly, they installed it on the rocket themselves.

295
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,840
 It had to be done very delicately.

296
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:17,320
 So people are like, what's so delicate about this satellite as opposed to other satellites?

297
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:22,000
 One thing about the Zuma satellite is people believe that it is up there, but no astronomer,

298
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,960
 no amateur astronomer has been able to locate it.

299
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:32,440
 I'm going to strike Zuma satellite off of CCA XX1 because the Zuma satellite was launched

300
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,680
 in 2018 and the iceberg predates it.

301
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,960
 So it wasn't at it unless you could say, well, no, maybe it was on the iceberg because the

302
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,520
 operating system was being itself.

303
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,360
 But I think we can safely say that the two issues are too far apart for it to be the

304
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,800
 Zuma satellite.

305
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,400
 So we can take that off.

306
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,080
 So then we have the option of CA XX1.

307
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:03,360
 So we lost the C, but CA XX1 is a United States Geological Survey well that was dug in Virginia.

308
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,840
 I mean, that's how much people really wanted to figure out what this could mean.

309
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,640
 They're like, does this well lead somewhere?

310
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,720
 Did they discover some sort of cryptid in the well?

311
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,360
 Is the well full of aliens?

312
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,960
 No, no, no, it's a well in Virginia.

313
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,640
 It doesn't match the CCA, the CA XX1.

314
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,840
 But I mean, I pulled it up on my search and I looked into it and I was kind of digging

315
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,840
 around.

316
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,840
 It's just a well.

317
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,920
 That's when I get called to shill when I say stuff like that.

318
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:34,280
 But CCA, so what I started to do is I started breaking it down, looking for each individual

319
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,280
 one.

320
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,960
 I needed to find them combined, but CCA is also known as the Corrective Corporation of

321
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,960
 America.

322
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:47,360
 It is a private prison group that is something that was originally tossed around that CCA

323
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,360
 XX1 was some sort of private prison program where they were going to start rounding up

324
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,800
 dissidents and throwing them into prisons.

325
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,360
 I couldn't tie that into XX1.

326
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,360
 That was the problem.

327
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,120
 And the reason why I go through all of these options, because I'm going to come up with

328
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,280
 my conclusion, but you may have a different one.

329
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,160
 People may say, oh, you just wasted time, but I like to throw out the different conclusions

330
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,600
 and why I dismissed them or why I went forward.

331
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,120
 And let me say, for the CCA, as far as the Corrective Corporation of America, they're

332
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,640
 not called that anymore.

333
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,680
 And I went through documents they had looking for page 21 or chapter 21, and I couldn't

334
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,920
 find any connection to that, because XX1 could also be read as 21.

335
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:30,360
 CCA, as an acronym, also is known as Combat Command.

336
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,600
 Combat Command was back in World War II.

337
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,160
 There was this dude who was like, I don't like the way that the army is organized.

338
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:43,880
 This actually started in the 1930s, but in 1942, this guy set up this thing called Combat

339
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,880
 Command.

340
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,600
 I don't like the way that everything's organized.

341
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:51,760
 I need something that's far more fluid to fight in the field.

342
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,320
 So this was General Adna Chaffee.

343
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,000
 People had weird names back then.

344
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,080
 General Adna Chaffee.

345
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,840
 This was United States.

346
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:06,280
 What he wanted was he wanted, basically, Chaffee wanted a completely fluid fighting force.

347
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:11,240
 If he's like, listen, we need to take this area, instead of using this division and this

348
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,080
 division, we're going to just scramble it all up.

349
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,080
 I'm going to take these tanks.

350
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,080
 I'm going to take these troops.

351
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,760
 I'm going to take a couple of your guns.

352
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,800
 Okay, I want your jeeps.

353
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:28,680
 Your CCA, your Combat Command A. Then he had Combat Command B, Combat Command C, or Combat

354
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:33,120
 Command R, sometimes it's no one else, and that was their reserve.

355
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,520
 And so it allowed him to move pieces around instead of having to play with whole divisions,

356
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,560
 to having to set in these whole things.

357
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,080
 He'd make mission-specific groups.

358
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,400
 The problem was that they weren't very cohesive, because you all of a sudden had these infantry

359
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:55,320
 soldiers working with this group of artillery gunners, and they had never really met.

360
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,920
 So they weren't super cohesive.

361
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:01,880
 After the war, the Combat Command ideology lasted until about the '60s, and then they

362
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,200
 said, you know what, let's do this thing.

363
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,480
 We're going to call them brigades.

364
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,720
 It's going to be kind of the same thing, but you're basically, you will be a brigade.

365
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,760
 It's not going to be super fluid.

366
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,480
 We're going to table that one for a second, because I want to get to this other one.

367
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,920
 This other one popped, I just saw this other one pop up within the last two days.

368
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:26,160
 CCA can also be known as Canonical Correlation Analysis.

369
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:32,080
 There's a paper that came out in 2014, and I thank you to the anonymous user who pulled

370
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,600
 this up, because this was another neat little piece of this puzzle.

371
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,120
 I had not found this in my own research.

372
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,600
 Canonical Correlation Analysis is, there's this paper came up in 2014.

373
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:49,880
 It is this software that allows you to take a 2D photo and basically match it to a 3D

374
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,880
 photo.

375
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,880
 So facial recognition.

376
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:58,360
 Before you would take a 2D photo, and they had like a 55% chance of matching it up to

377
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,120
 a person walking down the street.

378
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,240
 With this new technology that they've added, they have CCA and then they have PCA, they

379
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,560
 believe that they can get it up to 85%.

380
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,480
 So it's like Minority Report type stuff.

381
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,440
 You're walking on the street and they're like, "Hey, we're looking for you, dude."

382
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,080
 And they see my face and I'm like, "Ah!"

383
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,560
 And I run away.

384
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:23,120
 XX1 in that scenario though, referred to the mathematical formula.

385
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,960
 So basically mathematical vectors.

386
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,480
 So you're like, "This vector's X.

387
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,760
 This vector's X1.

388
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,160
 This vector's XX1."

389
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,600
 I thought it was a cool little angle to go on.

390
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,600
 I went and I looked at the papers.

391
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,840
 I went and looked up the papers that the Anon had referenced on 4chan.

392
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,800
 And it still wasn't there for me.

393
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:49,800
 Because the XX1 in that scenario was, again, simply a mathematical vector.

394
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,440
 It didn't have really any impact.

395
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,760
 It did predate the iceberg, which was a good lead.

396
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,680
 And the CCA does match, but the XX1 could have been XY1 or X1 or whatever.

397
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,160
 It didn't have any real bearing.

398
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:08,200
 So like I said, I had this episode prepped a month ago, or more two months ago.

399
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,320
 CCA XX1.

400
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,800
 I kept going back to combat command.

401
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:20,320
 I kept going back to this idea of a mobile military force.

402
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,800
 But then I kept saying that it's called a brigade now.

403
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,800
 It's nothing.

404
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:30,880
 I felt like I had run into a dead end.

405
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,880
 Then I found XX1.

406
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:45,680
 XX1 is, starting in 1994, a reorganization of the army to be a completely modifiable

407
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,320
 fighting force.

408
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:55,840
 It is basically combat command on an entire organization scale.

409
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:01,680
 In 1994, there was a pamphlet written up called Force XX1.

410
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:08,280
 It goes over how they want to redesign the military to fight the new wars for the coming

411
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,360
 century.

412
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:16,200
 One of the key parts of it is that it needs to be fast, flexible, deadly, and strong.

413
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,500
 It states that we can no longer afford to have the army of armies.

414
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,960
 We need to have a small army that's completely modifiable.

415
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:31,440
 Depending on the mission, we can pick what we need to do, send them in, take them out.

416
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,400
 This idea of two armies clashing in the middle of the desert is on its way out.

417
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,760
 Now again, this paper came out in 1994, so it was shortly after the Cold War.

418
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,600
 But these guys get paid to look 100 years into the future of warfare.

419
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,160
 It's all about technology, it's all about smaller engagements.

420
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,840
 Before the World Trade Center got blown up by Al Qaeda, I don't know internal explosions,

421
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,560
 but before 9/11, they're talking about how to take on these terrorists.

422
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,120
 The pamphlet I'm going to link on the show notes, it's fascinating, because they break

423
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,600
 down how wars are going to change.

424
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,800
 They said the rules of war are gone.

425
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,240
 We're going to be fighting wars around hostages now.

426
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:16,040
 Like, you're going to have a legitimate government taking hostages.

427
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,600
 The rules of war are done.

428
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,120
 It's funny because they don't necessarily say we're not going to do that.

429
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,640
 It just says that these things are going to happen.

430
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,800
 I think it's interesting, so I'm going to quote here for a second.

431
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:32,680
 In this paper, he's saying, "Force XX1 is defined by five characteristics.

432
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:39,640
 Doctrinal flexibility, strategic mobility, tailorability and modularity.

433
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,720
 Joint and multinational connectivity and the versatility to function in war and operations

434
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,360
 outside of the war."

435
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,240
 So you're like Jason.

436
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,360
 Okay, you have a paper called "Force XX1 Operations," which talks about tailoring the

437
00:25:53,360 --> 00:26:00,280
 army to make it very fast, very mobile, very small, to take these operations and to move

438
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:06,600
 pieces around to fulfill different goals, rather than moving in an entire army or entire

439
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:13,720
 divisions into an area, you could basically send in a small modular group.

440
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,080
 Isn't that the Navy SEALs?

441
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,400
 Isn't that Delta Force?

442
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,160
 No, those are surgical.

443
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,520
 What this is talking about, this is talking about a hammer.

444
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:27,520
 Not the massive wave of troops we've used in the past, but and not the small surgical

445
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,520
 strikes.

446
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,000
 This is basically a hammer that would move into the area, devastate the enemy, be as

447
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,160
 lethal as possible and sustain the least amount of losses.

448
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,960
 You're not going to have these huge tank battles.

449
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,640
 You're going to have these small groups.

450
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,400
 And you're like, okay, that's fine, but who cares?

451
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,360
 That's not a secret conspiracy.

452
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,280
 The fact that the military has been shrinking and trying to become more mobile and more

453
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,720
 technologically efficient, that's not a secret.

454
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,160
 And you're right.

455
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,800
 But Combat Command A XX1 is.

456
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:07,040
 See Combat Command A was a modular force that was supposedly disbanded in the 1960s.

457
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,680
 Maybe it was disbanded.

458
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,200
 Maybe it was completely gone.

459
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:16,160
 And maybe Force XX1 is actually a full overhaul, but it is possible.

460
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:23,120
 If this series of numbers and letters means anything, and if I'm on the right track, I

461
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,240
 could be totally wrong about this.

462
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:37,080
 But there may be now a group, a Combat Command A group that is a completely modular small

463
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,200
 version of the army.

464
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:45,880
 You have a couple helicopters, a couple tanks, some engineers, some infantry, some demolitions,

465
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,080
 you have these specialists.

466
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:52,520
 You have a small version of what you would consider to be an army.

467
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,080
 But stay with me here.

468
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:00,160
 What if there is a small, basically a sample size of the US army?

469
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:04,760
 Not as surgical as the Navy SEALs where they're like coming in on their little dingies.

470
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:12,440
 We're talking about a microcosm of the US army that as fast can be deployed in a heartbeat,

471
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,560
 they're lethal.

472
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,480
 They're G.I. Joe.

473
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,240
 They're a mobile strike force.

474
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,720
 You would pull people from other divisions.

475
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,760
 Because the Navy SEALs, they're trained to be Navy SEALs.

476
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:35,880
 CCA XX1 would be, you would get the best people, like you'd get the best engineers, you'd get

477
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,520
 the best snipers, you'd get the best infantrymen, you'd get the best drivers, you'd get the

478
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:45,200
 best helicopter pilots, you'd get the best of the best, and you'd assemble them in Combat

479
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:51,880
 Command A, which was a fighting force, a completely modifiable fighting force.

480
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,640
 You bring them in there.

481
00:28:53,640 --> 00:29:00,800
 You have them go on these missions, these small, hard strikes that require more force.

482
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,560
 You don't want to use that surgical strike.

483
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,600
 You want to smash an entire area.

484
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,720
 Whether or not CCA XX1 exists, I don't know.

485
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,080
 That's my hypothesis.

486
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,960
 If it does exist, has it been used?

487
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,960
 I don't know.

488
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,000
 And see, this is the reason why I put off doing this episode for so long.

489
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,600
 I've never served in the military.

490
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,320
 I have a lot of friends and family who have served in the military.

491
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:28,440
 But this is a particular subject that I'm fairly weak on as far as how these things

492
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,440
 operate.

493
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,960
 You could say, Jason, that is completely ridiculous.

494
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,120
 There is no way she performed that the military would want to make a small version of the

495
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:43,480
 Army with the best of the best people, basically create GI Joe and have them go into an area.

496
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,160
 But if I'm on the right track, there basically is.

497
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:54,200
 The Army has created a mobile strike force, and that is the definition of GI Joe, where

498
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,000
 GI Joe doesn't need a fleet of tanks.

499
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,200
 I'm already second guessing putting this episode out.

500
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,840
 GI Joe doesn't need a fleet of tanks.

501
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,640
 They need the best guys.

502
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:15,140
 They need the best four tank crews with the best four top of the line experimental tanks.

503
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:20,240
 You don't need an entire helicopter attack wing.

504
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,800
 You just need the best helicopters with the best helicopter crews, the best engineers,

505
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,160
 the best people supporting that group.

506
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,960
 And you just move into an area and just lay it out.

507
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,680
 Get out.

508
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,920
 You've left your calling card.

509
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,000
 Am I on the right track?

510
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,960
 I think so.

511
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,560
 But I could be wrong.

512
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,560
 This is my hypothesis.

513
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,660
 I'd like to hear back from you guys about this.

514
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:50,420
 Does America actually have a GI Joe?

515
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,860
 Does America actually have a modifiable force?

516
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,540
 Which that's what makes it different than the special forces we have.

517
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:59,300
 Where I know they will call in Delta Force and stuff like that.

518
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:05,420
 They can call in other assets, but this one is basically a small version of the Army that

519
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,580
 works on its own.

520
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:11,740
 Not like they just do whatever they want, but they are basically a small version of

521
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:17,520
 the Army that has its own command structure, but they will go on their own missions to

522
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,400
 take these targets out.

523
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,160
 Special forces are more surgical and more specialized.

524
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:31,680
 These guys are basically a giant army as a microcosm, as a full on fighting force that

525
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:36,520
 can support itself and not need to have these giant theater engagements.

526
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:41,000
 CCA XXI, I think that's a legitimate guess.

527
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,220
 I think that is what it is.

528
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:46,300
 And I don't think that the FBI is going to knock down my door, because everything I've

529
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,460
 found is available online.

530
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,460
 So there we go.

531
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,380
 Am I on the right track?

532
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,780
 I think so.

533
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,340
 And if I'm on the right track, honestly that's pretty awesome.

534
00:31:55,340 --> 00:32:01,820
 But again, dealing with the military is not one of my strong suits as far as a knowledge

535
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,820
 base goes.

536
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,260
 So I'd be happy to hear your guys' opinions too.
