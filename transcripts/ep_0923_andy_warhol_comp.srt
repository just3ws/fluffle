1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,800
 Who would win in a fight? A dog? Or an alien? We'll be finding out the answer to that.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,800
 It's kind of a rhetorical question if you think about it.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:19,040
 And then we meet two young girls who have an obsession with a popular artist. Using

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:25,800
 a black magic spell they found on the internet, is it possible that they brought Andy Warhol

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,800

00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:38,400
 trying to find a good sound effect for the bicycle. We might have to get rid of the

19
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,600
 bunny bike until I can come up. At least that one does the little gear squeaking. Maybe

20
00:01:43,600 --> 00:02:13,600
 I should just do the sound of a card going brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

47
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:09,400
 bike. So he left and Billy just got his dog. Went away. He actually got scared and he

48
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,400
 grabbed his dog. He drove into town. Here's one of those odd details that makes me think

49
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,400
 the story is true. Because generally fake stories are very clean. You have a through line

50
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:25,400
 to them. This is how this story goes. He gets his dog, drags him to the truck, drives into

51
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:32,400
 town, drives back to the farm, drops his dog off. Jasper gets dropped off in the farm

52
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,400
 and then Billy drives himself to spend the night in a motel. Now if it was fictional

53
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,400
 it would just be like, oh he went back and he went to sleep or he took his dog to town

54
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,400
 but his dog got loose or whatever because the dog's gonna play an important part on this

55
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,400
 next thing. In a real story this would make sense. He gets his dog, he goes into town,

56
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,400
 he goes to the motel. He says you can't bring your dog with you. Dude you can't have a dog

57
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,400
 in a hotel room. He doesn't want to stay the night at his house. It's spooky right? Something's

58
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,400
 up there. So then he has to drive back and drop his dog off. It's little details like

59
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,400
 that that make stories make them more believable. I read a ton of stuff all the time and I'm

60
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,400
 like it's fake. Like even the skeptical side of me, I do have a skeptical side when I read

61
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,400
 a bunch of this stuff but you just start to develop a pretty good BS meter. Now it's not

62
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,400
 foolproof. It's not foolproof right? Lone Pine Devils I was wrong. The high school episode

63
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,400
 I did recently I was misled. So it's not foolproof but for the most part like it's little details

64
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,400
 like that that make you go there might actually be some truth to that because it's a messy

65
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:38,400
 part of the story. Anyways so no dog is allowed at the hotel. He then drops his dog off at the farm.

66
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,400
 This alien creature just got mulled and Billy's too scared to stay there so he goes to the

67
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:52,400
 motel, holiday inn to spin the night and then the next morning he comes back and he walks

68
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:58,400
 up to the hill. The first thing he does is he goes to the hill and the creature is gone.

69
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,400
 Billy's like well okay I don't know if he moved on his own. Probably not. His legs are pretty

70
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:09,400
 damaged. Maybe someone got him. I don't know it's spooky but and then he goes to his farm

71
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:21,400
 and there he finds Jasper dead and a couple of Billy's cows had gone missing. I found that

72
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,400
 story on ThinkAbout@Docs.com one of my favorite resources for this podcast. They got it from

73
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,400
 an article written by Gray Barker. The dog himself wrote it like every time he died he's

74
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,400
 like typing out his memoirs. He's like this is what's happening please don't. Gray Barker

75
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,400
 he wrote this article in UFO annual 1981 a UFO journal back in the time. It's interesting

76
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:51,400
 because ThinkAbout@Docs.com added a little addition to this in parentheses they go was

77
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,400
 there any autopsy on the animal which is an interesting quote. I didn't think about that

78
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,400
 until I finished reading it and saw that sentence. I go yeah that would make sense like they

79
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:06,400
 don't know how the dog died. The dog was just dead. Yeah you know did you take it to the

80
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,400
 vet and say hey can you find out what happened to my dog and that's looking he's like it

81
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,400
 was like he ate a couple arms and legs last night is that pink flesh in that yeah forget

82
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,400
 the flesh let's pretend that he didn't maul someone or something last night can you tell

83
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,400
 me how my dog died and the doctor could like cut it open and be like well all the organs

84
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,400
 are in the right place and there's a really bad doctor that's the only thing you notice

85
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,400
 how to check is where the organs are but yeah so how did the dog die I mean obviously the

86
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:41,400
 implication is that the alien bros came back they showed up and they found their little

87
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,400
 dune laying there with his little cloak on and they're like Cyrus Cyrus are you okay and

88
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,400
 he's like please carry me back to the mothership please put me in the Regenotron and they take

89
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,400
 him in and then as he's like floating in some see-through tube and his limbs are getting

90
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,400
 strong again he's like the first thing he does with his new arms is he's like punching

91
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:06,400
 his hand he goes guys we need to even the score that dog down there chew me up man and

92
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:12,400
 when they're down there killing this dog they just take a couple cows that's basically the

93
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,400
 payment you made us use the Regenotron you know how much energy that thing uses bring

94
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,400
 on steel a couple of your cows and don't come looking for us on the other side of the

95
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,400
 Alpha Centauri nebula it's not like Billy had access to intergalactic court drive but

96
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:30,400
 an interesting story nonetheless real-world consequences of encountering alien life so

97
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,400
 many times people are abducted they don't remember it or they're abducted and they

98
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,400
 remember it and they have horrifying nightmares I mean that's pretty bad or they have implants

99
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,400
 and stuff like that stories where people die animals die encountering aliens I don't think

100
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,400
 we hear a lot of them because I don't think people survive them I think these one-off

101
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:52,400
 encounters with aliens like if the farmer just died of a heart attack that night right

102
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,400
 they would have been like oh no Billy now where are we gonna get our milk for the town

103
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,400
 they just go to the store they go to the store they're like whoa grocery store sell them

104
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,400
 up would have been chalked into a horrible accident right and there wouldn't have been

105
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,400
 no witness to finding the little guy up on the because they were coming gun form right

106
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:13,400
 the implication is they came back to the farm later and killed the dog and took some cows

107
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,400
 and if Billy had been there he would have been dead too I think there probably are more

108
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,400
 stories of people dying at the hands of alien invaders but we don't hear about it because

109
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,400
 there's no one to tell that story but in this case there was a survivor luckily for us

110
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:33,400
 but Jasper we will always honor you for being the first dog that we know of to mutilate an

111
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:38,400
 alien this week has been really heavy on dog stories I hope that's not for telling something

112
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,400
 hope I'm not gonna have a close encounter with it dogs jaws thought not let's go ahead

113
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,400
 and toss you the keys of the carbon or copter we are leave me high north Carolina we're

114
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:58,400
 headed out to a high school speaking of high schools I'm gonna do a very quick dead rabbit

115
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:04,400
 recommends and I have to keep it quick I could honestly talk about this movie for the next 30

116
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,400
 minutes but I won't I'll punish the people on the discord with that the page on discord

117
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:14,400
 I've already started posting stuff long time ago I did a dead rabbit recommends on the Disney

118
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:21,400
 movie zombies it was a musical about brain eating zombies who had to wear control like

119
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:27,400
 callers to keep them from eating people's brains and they were right next door to this

120
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:34,400
 gated community and it really was a story about race relations in America like humanity

121
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,400
 had become post-racial that wasn't an issue anymore because everyone hated the zombies

122
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:45,400
 they had found a common enemy the zombies are like hey we can't help it like we can't help

123
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,400
 it we got this nuclear radiation on us and now all of our kids are zombies too we just

124
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:56,400
 want to be just like you and it's this bizarre musical that that's the central theme but

125
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:01,400
 there's all of these weird underlying things like Zed who's the lead zombies this dancing

126
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:07,400
 group and so he's constantly on the verge of eating people's brains and he realizes that

127
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:13,400
 he can adjust his control collar it's actually like a watch but and it gives him superhuman

128
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:19,400
 strength and he tries out for the football team and he's throwing people like 30 40 yards

129
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,400
 and it's really then it becomes an allegory on like performance enhancing drugs like would

130
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:30,400
 it be fair he wanted to be the first zombie to ever play high school football and the reason

131
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:37,400
 why you can't do it is it's not fair you're extremely powerful and then he starts losing

132
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:42,400
 control and there's like they have these bizarre musical sequences I remember when I watched

133
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:48,400
 it I thought this movie cannot get any weirder and then the next scene would start you're

134
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:55,400
 like what is going on and I absolutely loved it it was so weird then they came out with

135
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:00,400
 two which I did not do a dead rabbit recommends on I watched that I bought it the day it came

136
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,400
 out so the first one was pretty much the other right it was humans versus the other in the

137
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:10,400
 second movie they clarified that the zombies are supposed to represent like black culture

138
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:16,400
 in America because the second one they bring in indigenous culture werewolves we were here

139
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,400
 before the humans got here we are living in caves the whole time and even know we were

140
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:25,400
 here so these werewolves jump out and they're dancing around and again it has this really

141
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:31,400
 really bizarre commentary because the werewolves just go hey can we start going to school here

142
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,400
 and the administrators like yeah sure you can come here and the zombies are like it took

143
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:42,400
 us 15 years to even be able to set foot in this school that was a part of the first movie

144
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,400
 like it was the very first year zombies could go to high school and they just get to come

145
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,400
 in and the administrators like yeah sure whatever and so you had like this antagonism between

146
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:55,400
 these two different minority groups and then Addison who is the lead love interest he's

147
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:01,400
 in love with the zombie she all of a sudden becomes super obsessed with the werewolves

148
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,400
 and their culture and starts dressing like them and believing she is the savior of their

149
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:11,400
 people and I'm like dude this is a Disney Channel movie what is going on and she's saying

150
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:16,400
 I'm prophesied to help the werewolves I was a werewolf all along there is a prophecy about

151
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,400
 this woman who is supposed to save the werewolves I'm talking about this way longer than I wanted

152
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,400
 to but there's a prophecy about this person who is going to save the werewolves and Addison

153
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,400
 goes that's me and everyone is like that's not you and she's like no no that's me I'm

154
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:33,400
 going to save the indigenous people and it really plays on like the white savior trope

155
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:39,400
 and at the ending she goes to use this magical power to save the indigenous people's moonstone

156
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:45,400
 and it doesn't work she wasn't the prophesied one and everything blows up at the end of

157
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,400
 that movie everyone is worse off than they were at the beginning but they're still singing

158
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:54,400
 and dancing it's super bizarre but I didn't like it as much the music wasn't that good

159
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,400
 so at the end of that one it turns out that Addison wasn't a werewolf like Jason I really

160
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:04,400
 don't care get to the end of your whole story but hold me and be hosted Addison was not a werewolf

161
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,400
 but at the end she goes well if I'm not a werewolf and I'm not I don't fit in with the humans

162
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:12,400
 because she has white hair she never feels like she fit in who do I what group do I belong to

163
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:18,400
 and as she's going to bed a UFO shows up and I'm like oh my god are you going to talk about

164
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,400
 illegal immigrants in the next one we've already talked about indigenous culture being wiped out

165
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,400
 we've talked about an oppressed group of people living right next door and having curfew and

166
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,400
 dress codes and it's like this prison camp that they live in so I was like are they actually

167
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,400
 going to do a story about illegal immigrants in zombies 3 but I was like they're not going to

168
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:42,400
 make a zombies 3 right I was lucky enough to get zombies 2 well on July 15th zombies 3

169
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:50,400
 dropped and it is fantastic dead rabbit recommends zombies 3 and I remember going oh my god I just

170
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,400
 found out they're going to make this movie and is it going to be about illegal immigrants

171
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:00,400
 coming and then the indigenous people and the minority like the oppressed group and then

172
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:06,400
 the humans are they all going to hate the illegal immigrants for like taking their jobs and things

173
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:13,400
 like that taking their places in college the movies about whether or not bonzo can get a

174
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:20,400
 driver's license or whether or not Zed can impress a counselor to be the first monster to go to

175
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:26,400
 college it starts off with him saying if I win the football game tonight I get a full scholarship

176
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:33,400
 to college and I was like what and the movie flies by at a clip they do talk a little bit about

177
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,400
 like the illegal immigrants the aliens come in and they do better on all the tests and they're the

178
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,400
 best cheerleaders in the galaxy because they're flying around the stage and they have alien powers

179
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:47,400
 I was like obviously they're going to win and then they completely abandoned that theme and it's pretty

180
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:56,400
 much can the UFO take off Addison is an alien she's the granddaughter of an alien fantastic

181
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:03,400
 movie I dead rabbit recommends highly zombies 3 and I'll tell you right now if you're looking for

182
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:09,400
 a absolutely bizarre movie to put on in the background while you're just chilling zombies

183
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,400
 especially I think if you watch zombies 3 and didn't watch any of the other two you're like this

184
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:20,400
 is random nonsense absolutely fascinating dead rabbit recommends the entire zombie trilogy

185
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:28,400
 if you have six hours to spare but if not zombies 3 it's just so weird and I love it and I thank you

186
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,400
 for letting me waste your time in the best word but until you okay yeah yeah okay we're done

187
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:40,400
 thought not let's go ahead and have you land this carbon helicopter at this high school we

188
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,400
 are just sure I just clicked on my desktop it's a picture of zombies 3 I changed that wallpaper

189
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,400
 right away thought not land this carbon helicopter at this high school we're going to take a look

190
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:56,400
 at the story of a young girl we're going to call her Jessica she goes by the internet name

191
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,400
 suitcase in her hand she says that this story took place back when she was around 14 years old

192
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,400
 the year is 2015 her and her best friend who we're going to call Madeline while they were in

193
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:16,400
 high school they were obsessed with Andy Warhol famous artist soup can man Campbell soup dude

194
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,400
 couple pictures of Elvis I'm not a big Andy Warhol fan myself it was even zombies 3 I never

195
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:28,400
 really got the appeal I know that he was trying to take like art and like consumer mass consumption

196
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:35,400
 images and go this is art I like the endeavor right I like the idea maybe if I was alive back then

197
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:41,400
 but now I'm just like I don't hate the guy right if you're already in ready to cancel your subscription

198
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:47,400
 I don't hate the guy I just am not a fan of the art that I've seen of his anyways these two girls were

199
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,400
 they loved Andy Warhol they loved him so much and often they would sit around dreaming about their

200
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,400
 eating soup all the time mom's like you guys really need to get some nutrients in you well he didn't

201
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:04,400
 draw vitamin mom he drew soup they would sit around eating soup and Jessica would say man I really

202
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,400
 wish I could have met Andy Warhol and Madeline's like I agree I totally agree well they start to get

203
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:18,400
 like obsessed with this idea of meeting Andy Warhol and Jessica goes we were also a bit of fans of the

204
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,400
 paranormal so we believed in magic and stuff like that so we decided to peanut butter and jelly this

205
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:32,400
 thing what if we summoned the soul of Andy Warhol so Jessica goes I don't remember the exact ritual

206
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,400
 I remember we got it online we were typing in Andy Warhol summoning spells and there's a huge list

207
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:45,400
 she goes I don't remember exactly what it was but we got this incantation and then we built a shrine to

208
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:53,400
 Andy Warhol in my room we had all these candles we had photos of Andy Warhol empty cans of soup

209
00:19:53,400 --> 00:20:00,400
 this flies everywhere and then they had soup cans nothing looking back on the note I'm assuming they weren't

210
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:06,400
 opened anyways they had a Polaroid cameras because apparently that was a medium he used a lot with

211
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:14,400
 Polaroid cameras soup cans pictures of him notes written to him so they're like oh dear Andy Warhol

212
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:20,400
 I wish you weren't dead sincerely Jessica they had all this stuff and they had a laptop playing

213
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,400
 footage of him on a loop that's an interesting twist to a spell right I you know like obviously all this

214
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,400
 magic was written before technology got to that level but photographs are a big part of low magic

215
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:39,400
 right basically like witchcraft nature magic type of stuff where you have to have an icon of someone

216
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:45,400
 nowadays you could have 24 hours of just continuous video footage of this subject that you're doing the

217
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,400
 spell on right it's pretty interesting she said the entire room was dark except for the candles and the

218
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:56,400
 desktop that was playing Andy Warhol doing the jig or something I don't know exactly what he was doing

219
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:03,400
 but they begin the ceremony and as they're doing this flames are burning on the candle

220
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:11,400
 Andy Warhol is doing the jig they begin to recite the incantation and she said we weren't just

221
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:17,400
 saying the incantation we were focusing we were trying to manifest him so we were using basically

222
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:24,400
 the law of attraction we had our intention set we focused on manifesting him into the cut into our

223
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,400
 world into my room and they have their eyes closed and they're doing the incantation and then Jessica

224
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:38,400
 said all of a sudden I start to feel this pressure all around me I start to feel a change in the

225
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:45,400
 atmosphere she said it felt like hot and cold at the exact same time like loud and quiet simultaneously

226
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:52,400
 it was just this completely different energy in the room and she opened her eyes and at that time

227
00:21:52,400 --> 00:22:01,400
 she sees her friend's face is locked in this gaze of horror and so she turns and she goes to look to

228
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:12,400
 see what her friend is seeing and there standing in the darkness of the room is Andy Warhol Andy

229
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:19,400
 Warhol came back alive you see that newspaper you haven't been checking CNN Andy Warhol is alive

230
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,400
 they see Andy Warhol standing in the darkness and I really like the way that she described this she

231
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:31,400
 said he was there for a moment and he was incredibly bright she said what it looked like was if

232
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:36,400
 someone was standing in the dark pitch black room and someone snapped a photo of them with the flash on

233
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:42,400
 and how it illuminates them for a quick second and she goes I turn and I see him standing there and I

234
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:50,400
 see this this huge illumination effect he's just blindingly bright and then he fades away or he

235
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:57,400
 just disappears actually it's not like a slow fade it's just gone and at this point Madeline's like

236
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,400
 screaming she's freaking out it was definitely like you wanted to see Andy Warhol but at the end of the

237
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:10,400
 day you realize you just summoned a spirit and Jessica goes I didn't scream it wasn't even like a

238
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,400
 sense of fear when he was there obviously you were startled she goes I didn't scream I was actually

239
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:24,400
 just frozen in physical place and my emotions everything just were like muted she actually

240
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,400
 felt because Madeline wanted to leave the room Madeline wanted to run away Jessica felt that she

241
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:38,400
 needed to be closer to this now gone figure she goes I know that he was gone but I felt like I

242
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:45,400
 should be physically next to where he was like move over there and stand where Andy Warhol just was

243
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:51,400
 she goes the whole thing felt like a dream now Madeline did end up running out of the room and

244
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:57,400
 she said shortly after this we stopped hanging out with each other me and Madeline haven't been

245
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:03,400
 hanging out in a while to put it bluntly she goes I really haven't seen her in seven years so I don't

246
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:08,400
 really know how she's she's been chopped up and stuck in a hundred soup cans we don't actually know

247
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,400
 how Madeline's doing but Jessica said I'm doing fine I'm actually doing better than fine you might

248
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:20,400
 want to visit my room nowadays now that I'm an adult I'm in my 20s now once you swing on by my

249
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:30,400
 house she's obsessed with Andy Warhol now totally obsessed you walk in she has over 70 books on

250
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:38,400
 Andy Warhol I don't think I own 70 books period she has 70 books on Andy Warhol she has a tattoo

251
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:46,400
 of Andy Warhol that'd be alarming right you meet a pretty girl she has a face of a big old weirdo

252
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:52,400
 on her bicep the kind of alarming she has a well that's the least of your worries actually then you

253
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,400
 go back to her house and you see her library Andy Warhol books she has a tattoo of Andy Warhol

254
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:03,400
 she has autographs from Andy Warhol she went to the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh and she said when

255
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:09,400
 she walked into the museum she started to feel the same pressure that she felt when she was in the

256
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:16,400
 room the first time she started to feel the energy change and you could say Jason sure I wouldn't

257
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:22,400
 necessarily say it's obsessed if you have 70 books on one person yeah I'm gonna ask for it but I would

258
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:28,400
 say you're pretty obsessed if you have 70 books on the same person a tattoo of the person and then

259
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:38,400
 all that other stuff she actually has dirt from Andy Warhol's grave that's obsessed with that's obsessed

260
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:46,400
 right I mean like I really like Zombies 3 I really like that movie but I'm not going to be walking around

261
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:54,400
 in a in a sea brook shrimps football jersey I definitely want to be carrying dirt from the set of

262
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:00,400
 Zombies 3 you could be Jason you're declaring one of America's greatest pop culture artists to a

263
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:05,400
 Disney Channel movie yeah I like Zombies 3 and I'm not a huge fan of Andy Warhol but anyways that's

264
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:12,400
 that's not the point I can't get back on Zombies 3 I'll never stop she has dirt from Andy Warhol's

265
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,400
 grave and she goes from time to time the dirt's knocked over and I kind of feel like it's Andy

266
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:23,400
 Warhol's ghost knocking it over I should add to that fact going through her history she has a cat

267
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:32,400
 it might be the cat knocking over the dirt but here's my here's my read on this story I will give

268
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:38,400
 them the benefit of the doubt that they actually summoned Andy Warhol back to life and then it

269
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:45,400
 disappeared in a flash but I don't think it disappeared in a flash I think that this girl Jessica

270
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:51,400
 is possessed by Andy Warhol it might be the dumbest thing I've ever saw on the show but hear me out

271
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:57,400
 she summoned this guy I mean she before she was pretty obsessed before right but based on the

272
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,400
 narrative like she didn't have the tattoo she didn't have the dirt as far as we can tell she didn't

273
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,400
 go to the museum if you go to a museum with someone you're gonna get possessed by him you didn't

274
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:12,400
 know that we learned that in history class you have this girl who's in love with this dude and not

275
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,400
 necessarily romantically right but she's in love with this dude and then she summons him and then

276
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:22,400
 Andy Warhol while he's there he's like yo I'm gonna be this girl now and he's like in the body

277
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:29,400
 of this girl now the thing would be is that maybe he doesn't have full control over her right

278
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:35,400
 maybe she's like eating vegetables she's like no no he's supposed to be eating soup like maybe he

279
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:41,400
 doesn't have full control over her or maybe he does maybe maybe Andy Warhol is such an egotist

280
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:48,400
 that now that he's in this girl's body he just wants to look at stuff look at stuff that people

281
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:55,400
 made of him autographs I guess those are his but he's like oh the sweet dirt of my grave he's

282
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:00,400
 all rubbing it on himself she's always walking around with dust on her cheeks what if Andy Warhol

283
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:06,400
 possessed this girl that's the best case scenario that's the best case scenario the worst case

284
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:11,400
 scenario is that Andy Warhol did not possess this girl but something pretending to be Andy Warhol

285
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:16,400
 possessed this girl we talked about this recently I think it was on yesterday's episode or the episode

286
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:22,400
 with the haunted album where you'd have a dark creature like a latch itself to you in the guys

287
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:28,400
 of something else so maybe there's like a demon who is in hell and he heard like this incantation

288
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:32,400
 he's like who who is Andy Warhol I don't know I'm gonna go up there and be him maybe he's cool

289
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,400
 and he shows up the demons like he realizes he's super lame he's like oh man I thought this guy

290
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:43,400
 made zombies 3 but it was too late the zombie the dinosaur wave what if the demon had already taken

291
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:48,400
 the form of Andy Warhol and he saw how much this little girl loved him so he's like affecting her life

292
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:57,400
 he's basically like making her obsessed over some dead dude and when you're obsessed with someone's

293
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:06,400
 accomplishments do you have your own you know there's this source of inspiration right I think

294
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:12,400
 to look at the people who've inspired me over the years and then I go on and do my own thing

295
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,400
 I think that's the normal thing right you see someone you're like wow dude I wish I could be that cool

296
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:21,400
 I wish I was the first monster who went to college and then that inspires you on your own journey

297
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:28,400
 but people who become obsessed just don't do that they're just constantly collecting and consuming

298
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:33,400
 something from something that somebody else has created there's nothing wrong with that

299
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:40,400
 but you know the difference between obsession and admiration or just simply like in a dude

300
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:46,400
 before it seemed to be like yeah we really like dandy warhol and we wish we'd met him before too

301
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:53,400
 his face is forever emblazoned on my body and I have his dirt dirt from his grave in my bedroom

302
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:59,400
 like you know what I mean like that's a bridge too far so maybe this demon is actually draining her energy

303
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:05,400
 and only making her focus on the past instead of her own artistic endeavors or just having a life

304
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:13,400
 right just having a normal life it's fascinating story is it true we don't know right

305
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:19,400
 we really just have this one person's statement but it's fascinating nonetheless it does track what we know

306
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:26,400
 about these type of incantations summoning spells stuff like that it does actually make sense

307
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:31,400
 it's not completely outlandish as he said as he talked about Andy Warhol possessing a young girl

308
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:36,400
 or something pretending to be Andy Warhol which would be far worse at least if Andy Warhol was in your body

309
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,400
 I don't know maybe you can make more soup maybe you could go get a job at the Campbell soup factory

310
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:46,400
 and work all the way up to CEO and then Andy Warhol's ghost flies out of her body and goes

311
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:52,400
 you're all fired I'm the soup king now and they're like ahh and all the other CEOs leave

312
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:59,400
 and then it's just this ghost who's running the Campbell soup factory right that's reasonable

313
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:05,400
 that's reasonable but it also shows that the dangers are messing with the stuff so many times

314
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:12,400
 people do this I have a friend who just moved into a new house and she keeps saying I hope it's haunted

315
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,400
 I hope it's haunted and I was like yeah that'd be cool and she's like yeah I hope there's a demon there

316
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:20,400
 I hope it would be fun to get possessed and I'm like okay now you're just nuts

317
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:28,400
 nah I would be totally cool I'm like Magania knock it off that's like what you're just even saying that

318
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:35,400
 she wasn't saying it in jest she wasn't saying it to rile me up nah it'd be so cool

319
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:40,400
 it's dangerous stuff people watch a couple movies and they read a couple books or they read some stuff online

320
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:45,400
 and they go I can handle that and it's the same thing like people watch Save and Private Ryan and go pfff

321
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:50,400
 I can do that I think my face is blowing off on a beach somewhere

322
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,400
 you always see yourself as a hero you always see yourself as the triumphant victor

323
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:59,400
 but you're messing with dark dark energy

324
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:07,400
 and whether you're summoning forth one of the grand arch demons of hell or a pop artist from the 60s

325
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:14,400
 you're dealing with dark energy you're dealing with something that you shouldn't be messing with

326
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:21,400
 the consequences could be something as basic as losing your friend and developing a lifelong obsession with a dead icon

327
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:29,400
 or it could be life altering events after life altering events right you get possessed so fully by a demon

328
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:36,400
 what happens to your own soul terrifying story don't mess with dark energies unless you know what you're doing

329
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:46,400
 and the reality is no human no matter how long they've been steadying this no human knows what they're doing

330
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:53,400
 when it comes to the dark arts
