1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,060
 Two, paranormal stories involving creatures that hunt the darkness around Christmas.

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:15,900
 One, true crime murder spree that forever changed Christmas for an entire city.

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,040
 And then, a Christmas conspiracy.

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:27,080
 One that may have led not only to the destruction of an entire race, but those people who are

5
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:37,080
 most likely my ancestors today on the extra long episode Christmas episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,080
 Ho ho ho ho ho!

7
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:47,080
 [Music]

8
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,080
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of the Christmas episode.

9
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,080
 Not just another episode, it's the Christmas episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,080
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

11
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,080
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,080
 I hope you're having a great day too.

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,080
 You know what's funny is I actually started going back.

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,080
 I've been doing it for probably about two or three weeks now and listening to the podcast at work.

15
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,080
 And I've gotten some, one of the reviews someone left on, I think it was Spotify or something like that, they said,

16
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:16,080
 "It's a really good show. It's well put together. The guy has kind of an interesting way to present stuff."

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,080
 He goes, "Episodes are a little short though."

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,080
 And I was like, "Little short? I mean, I get that most podcasts are longer."

19
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,080
 But as I've been listening back to the podcast, it does seem short.

20
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:32,080
 Like, I think I spend the right amount of time per topic, but each episode leaves you wanting a little bit more, which is good, which I like that.

21
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:39,080
 But this episode, no time limits. It will be heavily edited, but I'm not going to set my nine minute timer to my stories.

22
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,080
 I got four for you, all Christmas related.

23
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,080
 And first off though, I'm going to open some presents.

24
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,080
 So I hope you join me for this.

25
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,080
 My mom sent me a box of presents.

26
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,080
 I opened two of them already.

27
00:01:54,080 --> 00:02:00,080
 I told her I'd save them, but I already opened two of them.

28
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,080
 One of them was a pair of really nice, there was actually two pairs of really nice thermal socks.

29
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,080
 Up in Hood River, it's gotten really, really cold up here.

30
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,080
 So I'm glad I opened those early.

31
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,080
 Yesterday, I decided to open another one.

32
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,080
 It's a flannel hat.

33
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,080
 Now, here's a little personal note.

34
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,080
 There's currently a hat war going on.

35
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,080
 These two women have bought me competing hats.

36
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:32,080
 Well, to be fair, one woman just bought me a really nice flannel hat I've had for years, and another woman decided she would buy me the exact same hat, simply newer and a different color.

37
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,080
 So the hat war began.

38
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,080
 And you know, my mom's hat's really nice, but it's a hat war.

39
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,080
 What am I going to do?

40
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,080
 Okay, I'm going to open this one up here.

41
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,080
 I got some family of snowmen.

42
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,080
 Dude, they had a lot of kids.

43
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,080
 Wait a second.

44
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,080
 There's a snowman.

45
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,080
 There's three, two big snowmen.

46
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,080
 I think that's a snow woman.

47
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,080
 Maybe that's the dad and that's the older brother, or maybe this is some kind of non-traditional family.

48
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,080
 They got three kids.

49
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,080
 I'm assuming that's a woman because she doesn't, I don't know.

50
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,080
 I just get a feeling it's a woman.

51
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,080
 Okay, let's see what we got here.

52
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,080
 What is, whoa, oh, this is pretty dope, dude.

53
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,080
 It's a, looks like a burka.

54
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,080
 Oh, it's a balaclava, a balaclava.

55
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,080
 Yeah, but it's like, my mom wouldn't buy me a burka.

56
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,080
 It's kind of like a half burka, I guess.

57
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,080
 I think it's too big.

58
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,080
 Here, I'm going to try it on real quick.

59
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,080
 Oh yeah, dude, it's like a Swiss tech.

60
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,080
 It's a little thing because it's super hot.

61
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,080
 I hope my headphones will fit.

62
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,080
 Yeah, my headphones should be able to fit under it.

63
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,080
 That's always the key thing because we're, oh dude, I could put my ears back like that.

64
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080
 That'll definitely be warmer.

65
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,080
 Thanks, mama.

66
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,080
 I hate the cold.

67
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,080
 We've been over that.

68
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,080
 No snow zone.

69
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,080
 It's supposed to snow like a ton up here right now.

70
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,080
 Okay, and I got, that's a card and that's a card.

71
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,080
 This is a bill from my cable company.

72
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,080
 I got one more gift here.

73
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,080
 I'm going to open this guy up.

74
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,080
 Compelling podcasting, I know guys.

75
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,080
 It's a Walmart gift card, which is actually one of the things I asked for.

76
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,080
 Dude.

77
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,080
 $75 Walmart gift card.

78
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,080
 That's awesome.

79
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:23,080
 I'm going to buy some pants, buy some nice warm jeans.

80
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
 You know what?

81
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,080
 It's funny because once I stop, I'm throwing presents away.

82
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:34,080
 That's why I'm back is once you stop gaming, once you stop playing video games, you have

83
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,080
 so much money.

84
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,080
 You have so much money to spend on other stuff.

85
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,080
 I used to game a lot.

86
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,080
 Oh, you want me to read the card?

87
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,080
 No, that's personal.

88
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,080
 I'm not going to read the card.

89
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,080
 Okay.

90
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,080
 And then I got another card.

91
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,080
 My mom's a card person and I am a card receiver.

92
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,080
 I hang them up.

93
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,080
 Let's see what we got in this last card here.

94
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,080
 So the first one had a picture of a little baby in a manger.

95
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,080
 A little baby in a manger with a little sparkly sun.

96
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,080
 That's cute.

97
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,080
 And this one is a more traditional picture of the manger painting.

98
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,080
 Mama.

99
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:22,080
 What the heck is this?

100
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,080
 It's a receipt for a bunch of candy she bought.

101
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,080
 I don't know why this is in here.

102
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,080
 Stag chili, beef chili.

103
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,080
 Mama doesn't buy chili.

104
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,080
 I don't think so unless she's making some sort of...

105
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,080
 This is some sort of coded message from my mom.

106
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,080
 Super bizarre.

107
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,080
 Why is this in here?

108
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,080
 Anyways, I will read this card.

109
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,080
 Dear Jason, have a wonderful Christmas and a happy new year.

110
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,080
 See you soon because I'm going to go visit them.

111
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,080
 Love, mom.

112
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,080
 She always draws little smiley faces.

113
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,080
 Dear Jason, let us rejoice on the day Christ was born.

114
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,080
 Love always, mom.

115
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,080
 Oh, it's a nice card.

116
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,080
 I like that.

117
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,080
 I got a $15 gift card to Dairy Queen.

118
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,080
 So I will go use that tomorrow because I'm currently not on my keto diet.

119
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,080
 So I got to...

120
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,080
 I'll just have like three blizzards tomorrow and call it a day.

121
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,080
 I took it off for the vacation.

122
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,080
 Okay.

123
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,080
 Thanks, mom.

124
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,080
 That baklava is going to be dope, dude.

125
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,080
 That's going to be super warm.

126
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,080
 Super, super warm.

127
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,080
 Okay.

128
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,080
 Why did she put included a receipt in there?

129
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,080
 That's so bizarre.

130
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,080
 That's so funny.

131
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,080
 Okay.

132
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,080
 So there we go with that.

133
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,080
 Christmas presents are opened up.

134
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,080
 I'm glad I actually opened this up early.

135
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,080
 So I can use that DQ card before I go, okay, back on my keto diet.

136
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,080
 And then I open this up and I was like, ah, can't, can't let it go to waste.

137
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,080
 I mean, I could save it, but that's not very American of me.

138
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
 Okay.

139
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,080
 Let's go ahead and get started on the episode.

140
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:55,080
 And now, like I said, we got two paranormal monster stories, one true crime story and a conspiracy story.

141
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,080
 We're fulfilling the pledge of the show on this episode.

142
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,080
 First monster story.

143
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,080
 It's kind of tiny, not a lot to it, but I thought it was interesting.

144
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,080
 It's actually like two sentences worth of stuff.

145
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,080
 In Iceland, so this kind of goes into bizarre Christmas traditions that we will find that a lot except for the true crime.

146
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,080
 That's not a Christmas tradition, hopefully.

147
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
 But you know, and I'm not going to talk about Krampus.

148
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,080
 Everybody knows about Krampus or Black Peter and all that stuff.

149
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,080
 Like Krampus was cool when nobody knew about it and like it was funny on the office, but there's been like a ton of movies about him.

150
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:31,080
 So I wanted to find some other creepy and it's funny because a lot of Christmas legends are creepy.

151
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,080
 And I think it's because of the whole winter solstice.

152
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,080
 It's still kind of tied into the same time period as Halloween, things like that.

153
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,080
 Changing of the seasons, death and violence.

154
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,080
 Anyways, so in Iceland, they have this yule cat.

155
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,080
 Yule is a old timey word for something.

156
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,080
 But anyways, so this cat's name is Jalak-

157
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,080
 Jalak-Pateran.

158
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,080
 Jalak-Pateran.

159
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:04,080
 And it's this massive cat that hunts around in Iceland, around this time of year.

160
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,080
 Now he doesn't eat sinners and he doesn't eat bad kids.

161
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,080
 He eats people who don't get new clothes for Christmas.

162
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,080
 That is quite the threat.

163
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,080
 It's funny because as a kid you were always like, "Oh, socks. Thanks grandma."

164
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:25,080
 Like you wanted, you know, sound wave or you wanted a ghostly bumblebee by the way.

165
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,080
 But you wanted like a toy and you got socks and they're just being practical.

166
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,080
 But in Iceland you'd be like, "Yay socks, I'm not gonna get eaten. Yay grandma, thank you."

167
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,080
 They're like, "Why don't you open that other toy?"

168
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,080
 And they're like, "No, I'm afraid that won't be enough new clothes for me."

169
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,080
 And so it's actually still a tradition where people have to wear new clothes.

170
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:51,080
 And when I say it's still a tradition, it's not like Macy's is like, "Buy your clothes before December 25th, otherwise you'll get eaten."

171
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,080
 Like it's in rural societies.

172
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,080
 But people want to wear their new clothes on Christmas time.

173
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,080
 And it's funny because it almost sounds like something that is 100% made up.

174
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,080
 Like some legends are kind of based on something.

175
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,080
 It sounds like something that a grandpa one time told a kid.

176
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,080
 And it's like, "Why did grandma buy me socks?" And he's like, "Uh, cause you'll get eaten otherwise."

177
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,080
 And then the legend just grew from there. That's what I'm assuming.

178
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,080
 I don't know why a cat would care what type of clothes you were wearing.

179
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,080
 But apparently this one does.

180
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,080
 Yule cat. Meow.

181
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,080
 I should be bigger. So let's do a bigger...

182
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,080
 Meow.

183
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,080
 Don't eat me. I actually got new clothes. I got a baklava and socks.

184
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,080
 And uh, oh the hat.

185
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,080
 My mom joined the hat war.

186
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,080
 The next one is a little more intriguing.

187
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,080
 Because these guys were spotted throughout southern Europe.

188
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:51,080
 They were spotted in countries from Greece to Bosnia.

189
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,080
 So this is a long range myth.

190
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,080
 And people are like, "Oh no, these things were totally real."

191
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,080
 They're basically their bigfoot. Cause it lasted a huge period of time.

192
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,080
 I'm sure there are people who still believe in it.

193
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,080
 A huge period of time.

194
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,080
 Depending on what region you were in, they had a different tradition.

195
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,080
 But they all looked the same. Which is kind of interesting.

196
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,080
 They're called the Cali Cant...

197
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,080
 The Cali Cant...

198
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,080
 The Kali Kanzeros. The Kali Kanzeros.

199
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,080
 We're gonna call them Kalis for short.

200
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,080
 Actually that might be disrespectful towards the Indian religion.

201
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,080
 Let's call them Zarros for short.

202
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,080
 Okay, so these Zarros, they have a few things in common.

203
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,080
 They generally live underground.

204
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,080
 They're underground creatures.

205
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,080
 They have dark skin. They're short. They're smaller than humans.

206
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:47,080
 They look like humans, but across the cultures.

207
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,080
 The one thing that is persistent is they have tails.

208
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,080
 So from all the different countries that these guys are a part of.

209
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,080
 Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia, Albania, Bosnia and Cyprus.

210
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01,080
 They're small humans with darker skin and they have tails.

211
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:05,080
 Now some of those countries say, "Oh no, they have donkey ears as well."

212
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,080
 And other people say that they have feet.

213
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,080
 They don't have human feet. They just have feet.

214
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,080
 And the other countries are like, "What's a foot?"

215
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:16,080
 No, some of the countries say they don't have feet, but they have hooves or whatever.

216
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,080
 So some of the specifics are different.

217
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,080
 But in general, they're short. They're dark.

218
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,080
 They have like a tail. Almost like a devil tail.

219
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,080
 So one of the traditions of the Zarros is...

220
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:33,080
 They hate the world so much. They absolutely despise the world.

221
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:38,080
 And they're in the core of the planet trying to saw down the world tree.

222
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,080
 And if they're able to cut it in half, the world is destroyed.

223
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:47,080
 But every year, during the 12 days of Christmas, which oddly enough,

224
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:53,080
 I thought was the 12 days leading up to Christmas, it's actually December 25th to January 6th.

225
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,080
 Which is... is that even 12 days, really?

226
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,080
 Yeah, I guess so. So anyways, during that, they're like...

227
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,080
 [imitates wind blowing]

228
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,080
 "Hurry up with the sign, boys! Let's get this world tree over with!"

229
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,080
 But when December 25th comes, they...

230
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,080
 Something kind of sparks in their brain and they're like,

231
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,080
 "Oh, you know what we should do? We should take a break from trying to destroy the world

232
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,080
 and go up there and cause chaos."

233
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,080
 And they're like, "Great idea!"

234
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,080
 They all scurry to the surface and just lay waste and stuff.

235
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,080
 They're basically gremlins. They're basically mischievous creatures.

236
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:29,080
 And then after January 6th, they're like, "That was fun! Let's go back to destroy the planet!"

237
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,080
 Which, I mean, whatever. It's kind of a weird myth.

238
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,080
 They go back down there and in those 12 days, the world tree is healed

239
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,080
 and they're like, "Dead! Never!"

240
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,080
 They get the saw and they start sawing again.

241
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,080
 Now, I have a couple... Other than the tree having the healing properties of Wolverine,

242
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,080
 you'd think if it could heal that quickly, which is heal while it was being sawed.

243
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,080
 I don't know. But anyways, so...

244
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,080
 Oh, and another thing that they're noted for having... I just saw this in my notes.

245
00:12:54,080 --> 00:13:00,080
 They're all men and they have what's listed as protruding sexual characteristics,

246
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,080
 which means they all have boners.

247
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,080
 I mean, that's just putting it mildly.

248
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,080
 It's a bunch of little tiny guys running around with boners knocking stuff over.

249
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,080
 They're gremlins with erections.

250
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:15,080
 Also, again, I don't... I should have went over my notes before I started this part.

251
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,080
 Here's another trait, another bizarre trait.

252
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:23,080
 They're mostly blind, so we got these blind little dudes running around with boners,

253
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:28,080
 knocking over vases, and they talk with a lisp.

254
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:34,080
 So I... Okay, so now remembering that, we'll redo our scenario.

255
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:39,080
 They saw the tree, "Hey, boys, let's go up there and cause some damage!"

256
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,080
 [crickets chirping]

257
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:50,080
 That's... Okay, okay, that's done. That sounded way too... way too... sultry.

258
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,080
 I don't think... Anyways, anyways.

259
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,080
 Mostly blind, talk with a lisp, big boners.

260
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,080
 There's a couple of ways to defend yourself from the Zarrows.

261
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,080
 Oh, and here's an interesting note, too.

262
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,080
 Across the countries, the names are pretty similar.

263
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,080
 So I don't know if that's... It means anything, but it's kind of weird that it's not like...

264
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,080
 This country, they're called this, and this other country, they're called, like,

265
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,080
 "Dangos" or something like that. It's a pretty similar name.

266
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,080
 Anyways, you can protect yourself from the Zarrows and their massive erections.

267
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,080
 They can only count to two.

268
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,080
 So... I mean, that's kind of a weird limitation.

269
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,080
 Anyways, so what you do is you leave a colander out on your doorstep, and they go,

270
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,080
 "Ahh!" and they can't count past two, and they're trying to count the holes,

271
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,080
 and they get stuck, and the sun comes up, and they have to run back underground.

272
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,080
 I mean, I guess, couldn't you just put, like, three cloves of garlic?

273
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,080
 It's such a bizarre weakness.

274
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,080
 Also, if you thought that was too ridiculous, you could throw...

275
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,080
 You could burn your smelly shoes in the fire, and the smell will keep away the Zarrows.

276
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,080
 That's incredibly effective, because it will keep away everyone else in the house.

277
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:56,080
 I can't think... There are a few smells, I think, that are worse than really, really...

278
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,080
 There's a lot of smells worse than a smelly pair of shoes, but...

279
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:04,080
 Imagine a smell of burning dirty shoes. That would... I would leave that house.

280
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,080
 And be like, "See you later, there's this little guy with a boner behind the corner."

281
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:13,080
 He's like, "Hahaha, my plan worked. That was fake news. I gave him that idea."

282
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,080
 And, speaking of which, they do hide around the corner.

283
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:21,080
 They actually... The Zarrows and this other country, they have this weird tradition,

284
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:27,080
 where they hunt adulterers. They're basically the Chris Hansen of adulterers.

285
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,080
 So, if you're cheating on your wife or your husband or whatever,

286
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,080
 you wait till your wife falls asleep, and you're like, "Ugh, the perfect plan.

287
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,080
 Now I just have to walk across this medieval village in the dark,

288
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,080
 and I can have sex with this other medieval woman."

289
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,080
 So, you sneak out of the house, and you don't have any shoes on, because you burned them.

290
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:49,080
 You sneak out of your house, and the Zorro is hanging on the, like, the door thing.

291
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:53,080
 The door... What's that? The door frame outside your house.

292
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,080
 And you walk out, and he jumps on your back.

293
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:01,080
 So, he jumps on your back. You have this huge, now, erection pressing into your neck.

294
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:05,080
 It's not a very pleasant experience, I'm sure. I've never experienced it.

295
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:11,080
 And he hangs on your back, and he torments you until...

296
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:15,080
 Well, two things happen. The sun comes up, so you're, like, just looking at your watches.

297
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,080
 He's like, "He he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he

298
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:41,080
 [laughs]

299
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:45,080
 The Zorro. It's super w... And, you know, again, this is one of those things, like,

300
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,080
 something like that may have existed at some point, some little creature.

301
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,080
 I mean, it just... [laughs]

302
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,080
 It's funny, because you can listen to that and go, "That's ridiculous!"

303
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,080
 And then, read a book about Bigfoot, and be like, "Well, that's possible."

304
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,080
 I mean, they exist in the same realm. I don't believe the world tree thing.

305
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,080
 But there could be these little tiny... They could have been, at some point, these little tiny guys

306
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,080
 running around Southern Europe, you know, whipping people with their dicks.

307
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:13,080
 I mean, who knows? Who knows? Really, the world is so bizarre.

308
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:19,080
 I don't know if they were so, like, anti-adultery that part of their race is to shut that down.

309
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:24,080
 But, I mean, you know, if you believe in Bigfoot, if you believe in cryptids or ghosts and stuff like that,

310
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:29,080
 this is foolish as to sound. It's really not that far out of their own possibility.

311
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:34,080
 If somebody told me they found a Zorro bone, a Zorro... Well, more than a Zorro bone.

312
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,080
 It's just this dildo sitting in the woods.

313
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,080
 If someone told me they found a Zorro skeleton, I'd be like, "Oh! That's cool."

314
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,080
 Like, I mean, I guess they would be a little more excited than that.

315
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,080
 What I'm saying is that I don't think it doesn't exist at all.

316
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,080
 I think these things... I don't... I'm not gonna bet money they existed.

317
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,080
 What I'm trying to say is I think the likelihood of something like this existing,

318
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,080
 this little gremlin-type creature existing, is more likely than something like the Yule Cat.

319
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:07,080
 I would put it on more of the line of a Bigfoot, which is still kind of like this folkloric legend,

320
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,080
 with no proof whatsoever.

321
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,080
 And then these little guys... I would love to get a blurry photo, though, of a Zorro,

322
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,080
 just like this guy creeping out of his house and you see this hunched figure.

323
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,080
 You see a silhouette and then a good nine-inch silhouette poking out.

324
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,080
 And he's just like, "Hey!"

325
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:31,080
 Zarrows... That'd be pretty dope. They should make a Zarrows vs. Gremlins crossover movie.

326
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,080
 I'd watch that. Wouldn't it be PG-13, though?

327
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,080
 So we've just focused on two mythical creatures.

328
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,080
 Which is our paranormal segment, our cryptids.

329
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,080
 Now we're gonna get into the true crime thing, so we're gonna...

330
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,080
 [imitates the sound of a machine gun]

331
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,080
 Shift gears. That was a stupid segue.

332
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,080
 This is... Okay, I'm not gonna hype it up.

333
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,080
 So, this is our true crime segment.

334
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,080
 We're going back to the year 2008.

335
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,080
 It's Christmas Eve. It's actually ten years ago today.

336
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:04,080
 If you're listening to this episode on Christmas Eve, if not, then that doesn't make sense.

337
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,080
 There's a Christmas party. There's a ton of people there.

338
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,080
 You got grandmas and grandpas and aunts and uncles and a ton of kids.

339
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,080
 Now, the kids are doing what they do.

340
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:19,080
 Fighting over the controller, one kid's bored of watching the Rudolph of the Reindeer special

341
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,080
 for the 19th time that season.

342
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:25,080
 A couple kids are in the back playing a video game.

343
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,080
 It was a fun gathering. Everyone was there, experienced in the love,

344
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,080
 but it was time for the gathering to leave.

345
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,080
 So while the kids were kind of situated in the back of the house,

346
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,080
 some of them playing video games, some of them watching television,

347
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,080
 the adults were all getting their coats standing by the front door.

348
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,080
 And that's when there was a knock.

349
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,080
 Was that an effective knock? That was on my laptop here. Hold on.

350
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,080
 Whatever. You guys know what a knock sounds like.

351
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:00,080
 And an 11-year-old girl opens the door,

352
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:07,080
 and there, standing in the doorway, was Santa Claus holding a Christmas package.

353
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,080
 And the little girl turns towards the crowd of people in the house

354
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:17,080
 and says, "Santa Claus, Santa Claus!" announcing it to the room.

355
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,080
 And that's when the first shot was fired directly into her head.

356
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:30,080
 Bruce Pardo. Bruce Pardo was a man who, by all accounts, was an asshole.

357
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,080
 So he got married, and what he didn't tell his new wife

358
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,080
 was that he had a child from a previous relationship

359
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,080
 who was injured in a pool accident and suffered severe brain damage.

360
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,080
 I believe he was like a paraplegic.

361
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,080
 And Bruce had kind of abandoned him.

362
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:49,080
 And when the wife found out about that, his new wife found out about that,

363
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,080
 she was... that was the final straw.

364
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,080
 Because he'd already started doing some controlling behavior.

365
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,080
 It was a relatively new marriage, and one of the things he set up was

366
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,080
 she had children of her own. He had a child, but she didn't know about it.

367
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:06,080
 And once they got married, he said, "If the money for you and your kids, you have to earn."

368
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,080
 "I'll make my money, and then you make money to raise yourself and your kids."

369
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,080
 And that's really not the point of a marriage, it's about form and union.

370
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,080
 But she was like, "Okay, fine with that."

371
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,080
 But once she found out that he could be so heartless towards his own child,

372
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,080
 it kind of made her reconsider who this person was.

373
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:31,080
 Now, Bruce Pardo's own mother took his wife's side during the divorce.

374
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:36,080
 So, they ended up getting into a divorce, he ended up having to pay Alamone of $1,700 a month.

375
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,080
 Now, he had it in his mind that, "I'm getting taken to the cleaners."

376
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:46,080
 Now, Alamone can be rough on a lot of people, and child support can be rough on a lot of people.

377
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,080
 I've had a lot of friends who've had a deal with that, and it totally sucks.

378
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,080
 There's a good way to deal with it, and there's a bad way to deal with it.

379
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,080
 Now, Bruce Pardo is one of those guys that thinks he can figure everything out.

380
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:02,080
 He thinks he has it all worked out. No one's as smart as Bruce Pardo.

381
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,080
 Covina is near Los... Sorry, we're in the city of Covina as well.

382
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,080
 I should have said that earlier. It's a suburb of Los Angeles, so it's California.

383
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:16,080
 And he's a manipulator. He was ripping off his employer.

384
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:21,080
 He was falsely billing hours. He was saying he was working times that he wasn't.

385
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,080
 And so, he was even stealing from the company that he worked for.

386
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,080
 So, he was just a scumbag.

387
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,080
 And his boss found out that he was ripping off the company. They fired him.

388
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,080
 So, Bruce Pardo comes up with a plan, a quite diabolical plan.

389
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:43,080
 He's going to go to a house where he knew that his ex-wife was at, and her entire family.

390
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:49,080
 And he was going to massacre all of them. He wanted to wipe her bloodline off of the planet.

391
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:56,080
 His next step was to then flee to either Mexico or Canada, and just disappear.

392
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:02,080
 He had money. He had cash strapped to his body. He had cash in his car.

393
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,080
 He worked out this plan. It was actually fairly complicated.

394
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,080
 The police still had a hard time figuring out what it was.

395
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,080
 He bought a plane ticket to another state, and people thought maybe he was going to go there to disappear for a while.

396
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:20,080
 But then he had documents in his car that led investigators to believe that he was going to flee to Mexico.

397
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,080
 And then some people were saying no, he was going to go to Canada, and they think maybe the plane ticket was to throw people off.

398
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,080
 Whatever it was, it was an elaborate plan.

399
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,080
 And I'm sure he thought this is going to go over.

400
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:35,080
 Like, I'm the top dog. Nobody pushes Bruce Pardo around.

401
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:40,080
 I'm going to pull this off, and I'm going to get away. And I'm going to laugh about it.

402
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,080
 Now, of course, we're reporting on it, so we know the plan didn't work.

403
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,080
 But the way the plan didn't work is...

404
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:52,080
 This story stuck with me for a reason. I remember reading about it when it happened, and it stuck with me for ten years.

405
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,080
 He goes to the house where his ex-wife is at.

406
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,080
 Now, he knocks on the door in his full Santa Claus suit. It's a cheap Santa Claus suit,

407
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:05,080
 which is kind of funny considering he had all this money, he had all this cash.

408
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:10,080
 But he goes out and buys a cheap Santa Claus suit, and it's like a nylon Santa Claus suit.

409
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,080
 He should have invested in full cloth, but he didn't. He bought a cheap nylon suit.

410
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:20,080
 He knocks on the door, he's standing outside, it's cold, it's winter, and you know in his head he's thinking,

411
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,080
 "Here we go, here we go. I'm going to get her back for all of the things she did to me.

412
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,080
 And then I'm going to get away, Scott."

413
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,080
 The door starts opening up.

414
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,080
 He sees a little eleven-year-old girl there. He doesn't care.

415
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:41,080
 Anyone who is friends with his ex-wife or related to his ex-wife is destined to die that night.

416
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:46,080
 He has a nine-millimeter handgun in one hand, a package in the other, a Christmas package,

417
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,080
 and he shoots her in the face. She falls back.

418
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:56,080
 The adults start to react to the initial gunshot, and he just opens fire, just indiscriminately,

419
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:02,080
 and he shoots the gunfire on all the adults who are standing near their doorway because they're getting their jackets ready to leave.

420
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:07,080
 The kids in the back playing the video games are spared the initial volley.

421
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:12,080
 He's shooting. People are diving over couches. One woman jumped out of a two-story window.

422
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,080
 She was on the next door. You hear a bunch of gunfire. What are you going to do?

423
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,080
 You're not going to be like, "Well, I wonder what's going on down there."

424
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,080
 They're opening presents already? She jumps out of the window. People are diving for cover.

425
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:28,080
 She's reloading. He's shooting. Some of the people are downed. He stood over them and executed them,

426
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:37,080
 and then he opens his Christmas package, a homemade flamethrower using racing fuel,

427
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:43,080
 and begins just spraying the entire house with flames.

428
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,080
 [blows air]

429
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:54,080
 Now, it's one of those things. I think we can all imagine... Not imagine, but all...

430
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,080
 consider the fact that we may get caught in an active shooter situation.

431
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,080
 Like, we may be at school and we hear a couple gunshots, or we may be in the mall,

432
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:09,080
 and someone comes in the mall with a shotgun, but you don't think that person is then going to pull out a homemade flamethrower,

433
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:14,080
 or a box of snakes, or any other weapon.

434
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,080
 You just assume that someone's going to start shooting bullets, and you can dive for cover,

435
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,080
 and you can hope they're going to run out soon, or something, the gun's going to jam, or whatever.

436
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,080
 Or if you have your own weapon, you can take them out.

437
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:34,080
 But you don't consider the fact that this guy may have built a flamethrower and shooting flames over the couch that you're hiding behind.

438
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:40,080
 Now, the damage was so bad to the house that when the firefighters got there,

439
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,080
 they said the flames were going up, like, 50 feet out of the house.

440
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,080
 It was a massive fire. They didn't know what caused it.

441
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,080
 They're putting out the fire, and they start getting cross reports,

442
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,080
 because the people who had escaped from the house early on called the police and said,

443
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,080
 "Someone's in our house and they're shooting people."

444
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,080
 So you have the firefighters in contact with the police.

445
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,080
 The firefighters are just trying to put out the fire.

446
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,080
 The police show up. They're worried that there's a guy with a gun running around.

447
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,080
 They can't figure it out.

448
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,080
 Now, the little 11-year-old girl who got shot in the face,

449
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,080
 so she opens the door and she's looking at Santa Claus.

450
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:23,080
 And when she turns to say, "Santa Claus, Santa Claus," which was her exact quote,

451
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:28,080
 she turns her head back towards the room to announce it to the room,

452
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:34,080
 so the bullet hits her chin, like sideways.

453
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:40,080
 If she had been looking at him straight on, it would have been a straight shot through her chin into her neck.

454
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,080
 But because she turned, she's still alive.

455
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,080
 She's still alive to this day.

456
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,080
 But nine people died. It took them a long time to even...

457
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,080
 because they couldn't identify the bodies. They were so badly burned.

458
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,080
 His ex-wife died, I think. Like, her grandma and grandpa died, things like that.

459
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,080
 It was nine people in total, dead, four wounded.

460
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,080
 And so the kids, other than the little 11-year-old girl, for the most part, the kids were spared.

461
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,080
 They took off the back.

462
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:12,080
 But the police, obviously, like, most of the witnesses are burned, or it was Santa Claus.

463
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,080
 Like, what's going on?

464
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,080
 They get another report across town of a gunshot, and they race over there.

465
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,080
 Covina, as it is near Los Angeles, it's a low-crime area.

466
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,080
 So they hear another gunshot. They get a report of another gunshot across town.

467
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,080
 I think it was, like, 30 miles away or something like that.

468
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,080
 They drive out there to where the gunshot was.

469
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:35,080
 There's a car in the driveway, or on the street. It doesn't matter.

470
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,080
 There was a car on the street, and they're like, "Oh, somebody must be here."

471
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:46,080
 They go into the house, and there's a man sitting there, dead, with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head,

472
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,080
 and a Santa Claus suit melted onto his skin.

473
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:56,080
 So what happened was when he started open fire with the flamethrower,

474
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,080
 he complicated things as there was a fireplace going on at the time.

475
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,080
 There was a roaring fire in the house in the fireplace.

476
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:09,080
 So when he ignited the racing fuel, it basically ignited the air around him,

477
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:16,080
 and melted the cheap nylon suit into his skin, fused with him.

478
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,080
 He had second and third degree burns all over his chest, all over his arms.

479
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:27,080
 He was half Santa's suit. He could rip pieces off--he ripped pieces of the suit off of him,

480
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:32,080
 because they found that in the car, along with more cash, three more pistols,

481
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,080
 and it was primed to blow up.

482
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,080
 He wanted to take out even more people if they opened the car up.

483
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,080
 It had, like, a black powder bomb in it.

484
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,080
 Now, here's a note, too. His mom was supposed to be at the Christmas party,

485
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,080
 but she called in sick. She's like, "Nah, I can't go tonight. You guys have fun."

486
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,080
 So he knew his mom was going to be there. He planned to murder her, too.

487
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,080
 Now, the reason why--that's probably honestly one of my favorite true crime stories.

488
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,080
 And the reason why--one of the reasons why I enjoy true crime--

489
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:06,080
 is because it involves so much arrogance on the part of the perpetrator.

490
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,080
 Whenever you read about true crime, other than people who are just out and out menily ill,

491
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:16,080
 there is so much arrogance, and I'm smarter than everyone else, and no one can ever catch me,

492
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:21,080
 and I got this all perfectly planned out, and they just don't think logically.

493
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:26,080
 When I'm reading these books about killers or bank robbers and stuff like that when they get caught,

494
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,080
 it's intriguing on one hand, but on the other hand, you're thinking,

495
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,080
 "This guy is an idiot because he thinks he can do this forever."

496
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:38,080
 This guy thought he could get away with it, and what's interesting is he may have for a time,

497
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,080
 but I can just--I remember reading the article when I finished it, I go,

498
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,080
 "Can you just imagine what he was thinking before and after that event?"

499
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:52,080
 For the days leading up to it, he's fantasizing about wiping his ex-wife's family off of the planet,

500
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:57,080
 and then sitting in Mexico with a hot chick and a beer, and he's like,

501
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,080
 "Ha ha ha, they'll never catch me. They don't even know it was me."

502
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:08,080
 I just think it was some random guy, and then living his life on as this kind of like badass hero in his world.

503
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:15,080
 And then I thought about what happened after he stumbled out of that house with that suit

504
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:23,080
 just melting into the pores of his skin and the intense pain he must have been going through.

505
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:30,080
 Driving down the road, looking at his arms, crying in unimaginable pain,

506
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:36,080
 knowing he can't go to a hospital, he can't get help, he definitely can't get on a plane,

507
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:47,080
 or drive across the border. Like, all of his plans ended in the instant as his suit started to fuse with his flesh,

508
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:52,080
 and him just driving up to that house. It was his brother's house, he knew his brother wasn't out of town,

509
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:57,080
 and stumbling into that brother's house and reality crashing into his head

510
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:01,080
 where he realizes that his plan is over.

511
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:09,080
 There's only two solutions now, to kill himself and put it into the pain and go out by his choosing,

512
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:19,080
 like an egotist, or to be arrested and go to prison and be caught by those people who are dumber than he is.

513
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:24,080
 I just imagined that car ride, like it's like one of those when you make a big mistake and you're like,

514
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,080
 "Ugh, why did I do that? Why did I do that?"

515
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:38,080
 But that added with your now half nylon, you're a man made of cheap Santa suit.

516
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:44,080
 So he shot himself. I just found that interesting because again, that's what I love about true crime,

517
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:52,080
 is that high arrogance thinking you're smarter than everybody else, and then that final blow,

518
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:58,080
 where it turns out that you're not. You're just an average person with delusions of grandeur.

519
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,080
 Obviously awful that these people got murdered, awful that the young girl got shot,

520
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:11,080
 but it really in cask, it really held all of the things that I like about true crime, which is that hubris

521
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:17,080
 that most of these guys have, and then that just falling to earth because of a stupid detail.

522
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:22,080
 If he had had a more expensive Santa Claus suit, probably wouldn't have melted to him,

523
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:27,080
 that just the sheer heat is what made it just scar him up.

524
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:31,080
 Can't board a plane like that. I wonder if you could actually.

525
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:35,080
 I don't think they stop burn victim. They're like, "Burn victim comes to the airport."

526
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,080
 They're like, "Hm, have you been to any crime scenes lately?"

527
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:44,080
 But it would probably be a little bit different if you were in line going, "Ahh, my arms!"

528
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,080
 It's probably yeah. I think they'd probably call at least an ambulance at that point.

529
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,080
 So that was grim. That's true crime for you though. Sorry about that.

530
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:59,080
 You're like, "Hey, this episode is starting off really good. You got giant cats, you have little dudes with big boners,

531
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:05,080
 you talk with a lisp, and then you have a guy shooting an 11-year-old girl in the face and setting everyone on fire."

532
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,080
 But that, again, is probably one of my favorite true crime stories.

533
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:16,080
 But we're going to end on a light note. Well, light-ish, because this is where we get...

534
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:23,080
 It's interesting because, like I said in the beginning, there's a lot of really grim Christmas legends.

535
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:28,080
 Now, this isn't obviously as grim as Nicovina Massacre. These are more like funny grim.

536
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,080
 But if you have an aversion to sickles, you may disagree with me.

537
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:37,080
 There's one thing that I haven't really talked about on the show. I don't talk personally about a lot of stuff.

538
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:43,080
 And there's one detail that I've left out pretty much on purpose.

539
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:50,080
 Now, you get... There's shows called Dead Rabbit Radio. I am partially Irish, and that's where I get the name from,

540
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:55,080
 because Dead Rabbits was a gang, it was an Irish gang in, like, the late 1800s in New York City.

541
00:34:55,080 --> 00:35:00,080
 Dead Rabbit means unstoppable or unkillable. I think it's a fitting name for this show.

542
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:06,080
 But more... I'm partially Irish, but I'm mostly Basque.

543
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:11,080
 Now, Basque is an ethnicity that is between Spain and France.

544
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,080
 And I'm not going to get into a bunch of Basque history.

545
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:20,080
 The reason why I haven't talked about it is because Basque people in general are...

546
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:27,080
 I've heard it all. I've heard every conspiracy theory about Basque people that were from Atlantis,

547
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:34,080
 that were from the Nephilim, were descended from the evil giants that were destroyed in the flood,

548
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,080
 but somehow, you know, I've heard that they actually play a part in this story.

549
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:42,080
 But, you know, I was like, "That were alien, that were partially alien."

550
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:49,080
 The reason why those conspiracy theories exist about Basque people, because the language is not related to any known language.

551
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:57,080
 They think it's one of the oldest languages still being spoken, and they have weird blood type stuff, you know.

552
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:01,080
 There's really no connection between the Basque people and the other people in Europe.

553
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:06,080
 We're kind of the oldest people still around who settled in Europe.

554
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,080
 So, there's a lot of legends and conspiracy theories.

555
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:13,080
 The Inquisition was to fight the Basque wizards.

556
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:17,080
 The Basque people are pagan in general, like they're Christian, but they're actually pagan.

557
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:23,080
 So, I heard it all, and I was like, "You know, because of the topics I cover, I didn't want to announce that earlier."

558
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,080
 It's not a big deal, but I don't want to announce it earlier and start getting emails from people being like,

559
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:32,080
 "Oh, yes, that is why you have such good insights, because your third eye was from this Basque."

560
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:39,080
 Whatever, dude. People are born the way that they're born, their ethnicity is their ethnicity, there's nothing special about it.

561
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,080
 So, I never really talked about it.

562
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:50,080
 But, I got to talk about it because their Christmas traditions are weird, and one of them is super...

563
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:56,080
 It's kind of creepy, actually. So, all that being said, now we're going to talk about the Basque people hanging out with giants,

564
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,080
 hanging out with the Nephilim.

565
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:02,080
 And maybe not the actual Nephilim, but again, I guess I should explain.

566
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,080
 Nephilim was a... It's basically this race that's in the Bible.

567
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:16,080
 These demons had sex with human women, and it created a race of giants and heroes of renown is the phrase used in the Bible.

568
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:23,080
 So, these mighty warriors and these giants who existed prefled because they were half human and half demon.

569
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:32,080
 And that was the reason why God was like, "Oh, this isn't good. I created Earth for humans, not for these superheroes."

570
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,080
 And so, he wiped them out in the flood.

571
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:38,080
 I mean, and he's like, "Oh yeah, yeah, there's some wicked stuff going on too."

572
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:42,080
 But he had to kind of erase this genetic code from the planet.

573
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:50,080
 That's why he's like, "Hey Noah, get on your boat. Don't hang out with any giants. Keep your daughters at home at night, and just stay away from those giants, those heroes of renown."

574
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:56,080
 Anyway, so that's what the Nephilim is, and they're generally described as giants.

575
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,080
 Now, we're going back to Basque Country.

576
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:11,080
 Now, yes, Basque... So Basque, they have... Okay, dude, I can barely pronounce English, so I'm not going to try to pronounce the countries, the regions and stuff like that in the native Basque language.

577
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,080
 But anyways, so we're in Basque Town. We're in Basque Country.

578
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:26,080
 And in the old times, in the old, old times, thousands of years ago, there was a race of giants that lived alongside the Basque.

579
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:30,080
 And they were called Gentile, or Gentileak for plural.

580
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:34,080
 But the Gentile were these race of giants. They were very hairy.

581
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,080
 They were about 12 feet tall, massively strong.

582
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:46,080
 And they taught the Basque people how to grow wheat, how they taught them a metallurgy, like how to forge metal.

583
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:55,080
 And they invented the saw, not the movie franchise. They invented a saw and they gave it to the Basque, and they were like, "This is how you can reclaim the land."

584
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,080
 And the Basque people were like, "Oh, that's awesome."

585
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:04,080
 These giants would also have a knack of picking up giant rocks and throwing them and building monuments.

586
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:09,080
 So a lot of the, like, you'll be crossing a field and there's just a giant rock in the field.

587
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,080
 They'll be like, "Oh, that's a Gentile through that a thousand years ago."

588
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:18,080
 And that's most likely just because of the way the earth forms and things like that, rocks come to the surface, whatever.

589
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:23,080
 But there also are ancient stone structures and they're like, "The Gentiles built that."

590
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,080
 And you can't be like, "Well, that happened naturally."

591
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,080
 It's like, obviously, a man-made structure.

592
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:35,080
 But the Gentiles had an interesting thing where they'd only live in the mountains and the Basque people who were very friendly with them,

593
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:43,080
 because the whole area is kind of encircled. It's kind of this, it's not, it's a lot of mountainous region, a lot of sheep herding region and stuff like that.

594
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:49,080
 The Basque people would be like, "Hey, why don't you come down and actually live with us in the towns, in the villages?"

595
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:54,080
 And the Gentiles would be like, "No, we're just going to stay in the mountains. We're going to live up here."

596
00:39:54,080 --> 00:40:00,080
 And everything was fine. But one day, there's a bright flash in the night sky.

597
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:07,080
 And this light shone down across the land.

598
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:13,080
 And there's a Basque sheep herder hanging out in the mountains with a Gentile, because they had the best weed in the area.

599
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:17,080
 They're getting stoned, they're throwing themselves, "Okay, that Joe was stew."

600
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:24,080
 So this Basque sheep herder's up there and he's like, "What is that?" And the Gentile, they all kind of look at each other and they go,

601
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:29,080
 "That means our time on this planet is over. We have to go home."

602
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:36,080
 And so the next day, Gentiles started packing up their stuff in their PlayStation. I don't know. I don't know what they had.

603
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,080
 They're packing all their stuff up. They're being bagged, shared, they're lava lamp.

604
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:46,080
 Now he's basically just a call of trustman. But anyway, so the Gentiles were packing up all their stuff, as we're trying to say.

605
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:51,080
 And they walk into this monument that they had built and they go into the planet.

606
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:55,080
 But one of them stayed behind and his name, his name was Ollant Zero.

607
00:40:55,080 --> 00:41:00,080
 And all the Giants are walking in and they're like, "Hey, Ollant, are you coming?"

608
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:07,080
 And he's like, "Nah, I'm gonna stay behind. I've come to like these little humans a little too much.

609
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:12,080
 I'm gonna stay here." And they're like, "You sure?" And he's like, "Yeah, I'm gonna stay here."

610
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:18,080
 He's smoking a clove. And then the other Giants go into the underground portal and disappear.

611
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:23,080
 And the best people are like, "Why did they have to leave? And why do you want to stay?"

612
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:27,080
 And Ollant's like, "This is so bizarre. This is so bizarre."

613
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:35,080
 Ollant's horror turns to him and says, "That star up there, that means that a new king has been born.

614
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:39,080
 And I want to become a Christian." That's super weird.

615
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:47,080
 Now, the reason why I find this story weird is that because the Basque culture didn't get exposed to Christianity,

616
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:53,080
 they don't even know. Historians don't know much about prehistory of the Basque.

617
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:57,080
 They don't know much about the Basque even when history is being written.

618
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:03,080
 But exposure to Christianity for the Basque came somewhere between 3 AD and 15 AD.

619
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:09,080
 But this legend is far older, as far as we can tell, is far older than that.

620
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:15,080
 So when the Star of Bethlehem lit in the sky, their ancient race of helper, Giants,

621
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:21,080
 who some people compared to the Nephilim, actually saw the star saying,

622
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:26,080
 "Oh, great. Now God's man, now God became a human on this planet."

623
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,080
 Okay, we survived the flood, guys. We lucked out.

624
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:35,080
 But we've really got to leave now because stuff's about to get real kooky here.

625
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:39,080
 So that legend, like, did that really happen? I mean, there's so many questions about it,

626
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:45,080
 and we're not done because it gets even weirder, but were there really hairy Giants walking around Basque country?

627
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:50,080
 I was reading this article and they said, "Because the Basque population is so old,

628
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:56,080
 because they've been in one location for so long, it's very likely that they had,

629
00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:04,080
 in that area, run-ins with Neanderthals or other humanoid species."

630
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:08,080
 They got to the area and then just stopped moving.

631
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:12,080
 And that's why the language has very little cross-contamination.

632
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:16,080
 So they're like, in their legends, when they talk about big hairy people,

633
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:21,080
 they could have been referring to Neanderthals, like, in their legends.

634
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:27,080
 But, I mean, you know, was there a race of Giants there that they ran into and the race of Giants helped them?

635
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:33,080
 Did they really see the bright star in the sky and go, "Oh, great."

636
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:38,080
 And then just bounce, which really makes you think that, I mean, were they the Nephilim?

637
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:42,080
 Because, again, that's an old, old, old legend of the Basque people.

638
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:47,080
 And it's funny because you imagine hearing that legend growing up or throughout the ages,

639
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:53,080
 before you had any idea about the story of, like, the manger and baby Jesus and the three wise men,

640
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:56,080
 your culture is telling you this story when they're like,

641
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:00,080
 "Yeah, we used to have these big Giants. They used to, like, give us weed all the time and stuff like that."

642
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,080
 And then one day they disappear because they saw a bright light in the sky,

643
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,080
 and they set a new king's coming and they left.

644
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,080
 And you're like, "Oh, that's weird."

645
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:10,080
 And then, like, eight years later, you're, like, talking to some missionary,

646
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,080
 and he's like, "Yeah, let me tell you the story about the birth of Jesus Christ."

647
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:18,080
 And as he's telling you that story, you're like, "What? What the hell, dude?"

648
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:22,080
 Like, that's, that's, you would blow your mind,

649
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:25,080
 because you would think that was just some fairy tale your grandpa was telling you.

650
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:31,080
 And then some dude comes and tells you basically the other side of that same story.

651
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,080
 Super bizarre.

652
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:35,080
 But anyways, so all at zero stayed behind.

653
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:38,080
 Oh, and I have to say this, too. I have to say this, too.

654
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:43,080
 So one of the parts of the legend is that the giants were very noble and they go,

655
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,080
 "Yeah, the new king's coming. We gotta bounce."

656
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:51,080
 Right? They go down to their crash pad in the middle of the planet with a bunch of Zarrows trying to cut down the tree.

657
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:55,080
 But there's another legend. Now, this one was obviously written later,

658
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:59,080
 because the Basque people for a long period of time were quite paganistic.

659
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:03,080
 This old blind man, mostly blind dude, was looking up and he's like,

660
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:07,080
 "Oh, no. Oh, no. I know what that is." And people are like, "What is it?"

661
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,080
 And he goes, "That means Jesus is being born."

662
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,080
 Oh, no. I don't know.

663
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:15,080
 People are like, "Who's Jesus and why are you so upset?"

664
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:19,080
 And he's like, "You don't get it. You don't get it. Everyone's going to become Christian now."

665
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:22,080
 "I don't want to become Christian. I don't want to become Christian."

666
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:26,080
 And he runs up to the mountains and he tells the Gentiles.

667
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:31,080
 He goes, "Please, I'm just an old blind man and I can't kill myself for whatever reason."

668
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:37,080
 "I can't kill myself. Can you please lead me to the edge of the mountain and I'll just jump off?"

669
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,080
 And the Gentile was like, "You really don't want to be a Christian that bad?"

670
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:46,080
 He's like, "Oh, no. I just totally sucks, dude. You got to drink like great juice instead of wine."

671
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:51,080
 "You can't do anything fun. It totally sucks. I don't know how I knew all that stuff."

672
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:55,080
 But anyway, so the Gentile was like, "Okay, we'll do that and then we'll go underground."

673
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,080
 And the other Gentile was like, "Yeah, that works."

674
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:02,080
 They lead the blind man to a cliff and he falls off and they're like, "Well, that was kind of sad."

675
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:10,080
 And then the entire race of giants turns to leave and they also fall off the cliff all to their death, except for all in zero.

676
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:17,080
 Now, for a race of giants that invented metallurgy, the saw, and the practice of growing wheat,

677
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:24,080
 how an entire species can fall off a cliff? Quite unlikely. That sounds like a little bit of a retcon to me.

678
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:33,080
 All in zero did stay behind and he did eventually convert to Christianity to the point where he became their symbol of Santa Claus.

679
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:38,080
 All in zero, so in Basque country, they had this giant fat dude.

680
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:44,080
 Actually, I think originally he was just like a giant farmer and that was who they did Christmas with,

681
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:48,080
 because they were like, "Oh, you're the bright shining star in the sky. This giant stayed behind."

682
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:53,080
 Now, one of the implements for harvesting wheat is a sickle.

683
00:46:53,080 --> 00:47:00,080
 So instead of a sack full of toys, all in zero, all in zero had his sickle.

684
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:05,080
 And here are a couple, there's different regions in Basque country, but here's a couple of their particular traditions.

685
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:09,080
 And I want to say technically, the story just told you it is a conspiracy.

686
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:15,080
 I might have had to wedge it in there, but it's kind of a conspiracy-ish. It's what is the truth.

687
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,080
 That's how that works on the show.

688
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:22,080
 In one region of the Basque country, they're told, children are told in the era,

689
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:26,080
 "You have to come home early. If you don't, all in zero will get you."

690
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:30,080
 And they're like, "What? Okay, this doesn't sound fun."

691
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:36,080
 An adult would then dress up as all in zero, so it basically put on a farmer's outfit

692
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:40,080
 and chased the children through the street with a sickle until they got home.

693
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:44,080
 Now, as fun as that would be for the adult, that's like the movie The Village.

694
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:47,080
 That's basically the plot for the movie of The Village.

695
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:51,080
 If the kids run at Christmas time, you know how we tell our kids,

696
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:54,080
 "If you don't go to bed, Santa won't bring you presents."

697
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:59,080
 That's adorable. And the kids like trying to stay awake, keep his eye open,

698
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:03,080
 and be like, "Santa?" I said, "Jesus knows."

699
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:06,080
 Santa knows if you're sleeping or not, and the kids are like,

700
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:09,080
 "Okay, mommy, I want presents." I think that was the sleep.

701
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:13,080
 In a particular region in the Basque country, they would, if the kid didn't want to go to bed,

702
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:18,080
 just sitting in the living room, staring at just a rock wall, because they didn't have anything to do.

703
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:21,080
 And the parent would be like, "You got to go to bed." And kid would be like, "Later."

704
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:25,080
 You got to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. I want to sit up and look at this rock wall.

705
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:30,080
 A parent, the father, most likely just from the sheer climbing skill that would be needed,

706
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:37,080
 would then go and climb outside the house, climb on the roof, and throw a sickle down the fireplace.

707
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:41,080
 So the kids sitting there just staring at the rock wall, and all of a sudden you hear this "clang, clang,"

708
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,080
 and you turn and there's a sickle in your fireplace.

709
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:51,080
 That means All In Zero was going to kill you, specifically cut their throats if they didn't go to bed.

710
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:54,080
 Terrifying. Terrifying.

711
00:48:54,080 --> 00:49:00,080
 And then there was, of course, a Christmas Sane. A Christmas Sane.

712
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:05,080
 So here we say, "If you're bad, Santa Claus won't bring you presents."

713
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:13,080
 In this Basque area, the saying is, "If children are behaving badly, All In Zero with the red eyes has come to the chimney."

714
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:18,080
 "If we break the fast, he will cut our throats."

715
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:22,080
 That, why would you, I mean, that's pretty gruesome.

716
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:30,080
 Now, of course, what happened was those traditions fell out of favor for a while, and because they're quite, quite grim.

717
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:37,080
 And what happened was as the Basque area became more and more Christianized, they bought more into the Yule Time, Santa Claus stuff.

718
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:42,080
 Nowadays, they've brought back All In Zero, but they've turned them into like a jolly oaf.

719
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:51,080
 And so some families will celebrate, like some families will celebrate Santa Claus and All In Zero, but now he's just like a big, lovable goofball.

720
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:58,080
 But they have an All In Zero Christmas song, and it goes to show that old habits die hard.

721
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:02,080
 Now, I don't know the tune for this, I actually try to look it up.

722
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:08,080
 I will try singing it as best I can, but again, we'll end our Christmas episode with this.

723
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:14,080
 The All In- This is a 100% real, the All In Zero Christmas song that's still being sung today.

724
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,080
 Here we go.

725
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:22,080
 All In Zero has gone to the Mountain Stew work with the intention of making charcoal.

726
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:26,080
 Now, okay, in the original Basque language, it rhymes.

727
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:30,080
 So, you're like, "That's kind of cool. He's making charcoal."

728
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:41,080
 When he heard that Jesus has been born, he came running to bring news. There is, there is, our All In Zero with the pipe between his teeth he sits.

729
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,080
 So we have this guy, he's like up making charcoal.

730
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:46,080
 He realizes, see, again, the legend's still part of the song.

731
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:50,080
 He sees the star, he comes down, he's like, "Hey, everyone, Jesus was born."

732
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:53,080
 And then he just sits and smokes, they're like, "Who the hell is Jesus?"

733
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:58,080
 You ran all the way down from the mountains to told us that, and he's just smoking it, smoking his pipe.

734
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:03,080
 He also has capons with little eggs to celebrate tomorrow with the bottle of wine.

735
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:10,080
 Our All In Zero, we can't say to him, "He has eaten whole 10 piglets."

736
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:17,080
 Now, now, again, we know Santa Claus is fat, but we don't know what his particular diet is.

737
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:23,080
 What we've learned about this guy in this song, that he's like, "Jesus is here, this is amazing."

738
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:28,080
 He's ripping these piglets apart with his teeth.

739
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:31,080
 10 piglets, the cutest animal possible.

740
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:36,080
 I mean, yes, puppies and kittens are cute too, but piglets are super cute.

741
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:44,080
 And it says in this Christmas song that is sung by children that their version of Santa Claus ate 10 of them.

742
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:49,080
 And you're thinking, "Okay, maybe he wasn't ripping them apart with his teeth."

743
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:54,080
 Wait till we get to the next part.

744
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:58,080
 So, it said that we can't say to him, "He ate whole 10 piglets."

745
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:04,080
 Ribs and pork loin, so many intestines.

746
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:11,080
 They're naming internal organs he's eating out of piglets.

747
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:16,080
 The intestines, going to piglets being one of the cutest animals on the planet to the intestines.

748
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:20,080
 The feces filled, grossest organ on the planet.

749
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:32,080
 So, yes, he was grabbing Babe the Pig and Wilbur from Charlotte's Web and just, "Jesus is here. Rejoice."

750
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:35,080
 You think I'm exaggerating? Let me finish this here.

751
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:41,080
 Ribs and pork loin, so many intestines because Jesus is born have mercy.

752
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:46,080
 He's eating these piglets to celebrate the birth of Christ.

753
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:51,080
 What is up with this? What is up with this song? This is super grim.

754
00:52:51,080 --> 00:53:01,080
 He's eating Baby Pigs. He's eating, specifically eating their intestines to celebrate the king of kings.

755
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:04,080
 Maybe this guy really was a member of the Nephilim.

756
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:13,080
 Maybe this guy actually was half demon because really, there's no other way to describe that type of celebration.

757
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:17,080
