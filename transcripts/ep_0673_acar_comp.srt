1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,080
 When a man tries to become immortal, he finds out the price is too small to pay.

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,080
 And then we continue Insanity Week here on Dead Rabbit Radio, which is oddly different

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,040
 than the normal weeks, this week's even crazier.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,840
 Because today we're going to take a look at a man who believes that he's been abducted

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,320
 by reptilians multiple times.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,840
 His mission?

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,920
 Train them to be the best cops ever.

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,920
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,760
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,680
 I'm your host Jason Garbender and I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,080
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,400
 I hope you guys are having a lot of fun.

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,640
 Insanity Week, that's the theme this week.

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,640
 Bunch of crazy people.

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,280
 I sent an intro more crazy than we normally covered.

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,040
 If you can believe that, first off, coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now, we see

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,840
 a mama bird flying in.

18
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,840
 You didn't notice?

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,360
 You didn't notice there's a little nest of baby birds on the floor?

20
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:13,600
 The mama bird is throwing up our newest Patreon support.

21
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,640
 Everyone is in fear that this time of saying their name.

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,880
 It's Odie.

23
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,480
 Everyone give a round of applause to Odie as Odie is falling into the mouths of several

24
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,480
 hungry baby birds.

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,400
 Sorry, Odie.

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,440
 That's the only thing I can think of.

27
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,560
 After Odie is digested and comes back to life and is now a normal sized person, Odie, you're

28
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,360
 going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

29
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,480
 If you guys can't support the Patreon or if you're not regurgitated bird food, that is

30
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,480
 fine too.

31
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,920
 Just helps read the word about the show.

32
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,440
 Really, really helps out a lot.

33
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,760
 Odie, I'm going to go into Odie so mad.

34
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,520
 I would sit there with her arms crossed like, "Listen man, I was trying really hard to come

35
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,520
 up with something."

36
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,360
 Odie, and that's when I came up with Odie.

37
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,800
 Let's toss you the oars to the Dead Rabbit Robot.

38
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,720
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

39
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,640
 We are headed out to Indonesia for the rest of this episode.

40
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,200
 Odie has a bunch of baby birds.

41
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
 They've bonded to them.

42
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,200
 But that's cool.

43
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,320
 Now you got a bunch of little pets.

44
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,120
 Maybe they'll come in handy later on.

45
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,120
 We're rowing the boat.

46
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,120
 We're headed out to Indonesia.

47
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,120
 Splash.

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,120
 Splash.

49
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,960
 Specifically, we're going to Pantai Celoton.

50
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,760
 That's in Java, Indonesia.

51
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,200
 The year is 1972 and we wash up on shore.

52
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,800
 We get there just in time to see Hindra Hartonto come out of a cave.

53
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,400
 He's walking out and he's like, "Ugh, stretching."

54
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,800
 He probably should have found a taller cave to meditate in.

55
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,160
 That one was kind of tight, but it all paid off.

56
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,280
 And then he's holding in his hand these four figures.

57
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,320
 He takes them to town.

58
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,880
 There are these humanoids.

59
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,600
 Little arms, little legs, scary-looking faces, long black hair.

60
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
 He brings them to town.

61
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,800
 People are like, "Dude, what are those things?

62
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,800
 Are those dolls?"

63
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
 And he's like, "What?

64
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,800
 Okay, listen.

65
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,160
 I know that they look like dolls."

66
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,160
 Don't touch them.

67
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,160
 Don't touch them.

68
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,160
 Don't touch them.

69
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,800
 I know they look like dolls and they look like if you touched them, they would feel like

70
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,520
 dolls.

71
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,960
 And basically, they're very doll-like, right?

72
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,200
 But they're not dolls.

73
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,720
 These are actually jenglots.

74
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,480
 Everyone takes a step back.

75
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,360
 But to you and me, I'm assuming you're not from Indonesia if you are.

76
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,360
 Thank you.

77
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,240
 I'm talking about your hometown.

78
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,800
 But most people, jenglots, when I was doing this research on the story, I go, "Oh, it's

79
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,120
 just the name that he named these things."

80
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,200
 Jenglots actually in Javanese means vampire.

81
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,800
 So even though it's just another word of a cryptid or a creature to 99% of the planet,

82
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,880
 to the people of Java, they knew exactly what these things were.

83
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,080
 They were little vampires.

84
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,640
 But they never had seen them.

85
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,440
 And they especially think they were going to be 9 inches tall, right?

86
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,880
 Dracula's not really threatening if he's tiny.

87
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:57,240
 But he goes, "Listen, I was meditating in this cave and I was able to manifest these

88
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,240
 jenglots."

89
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,560
 And they go, "Why do you call them vampires?"

90
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,560
 And he goes, "Well, dummy.

91
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,200
 I mean, why else would you call them vampires, you dolt?

92
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,440
 I have to feed them blood."

93
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,800
 And everyone takes another step back.

94
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,120
 He goes, "But don't worry.

95
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,640
 I only get my blood from verified sources."

96
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,280
 The articles did not go into detail what he considered a verified source.

97
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,480
 We do know that he fed them his own blood, but he also got his blood from verified sources

98
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,480
 as well.

99
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,520
 People who had blue checkmarks on Twitter, he said that he had to feed them human blood

100
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,040
 every 35 days.

101
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,040
 Now he puts them on display.

102
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,680
 He charges money, of course, to see these things.

103
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,440
 People walk up, look through the glass boxes, and you see these little guys.

104
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,880
 And I'm reading about these jenglots.

105
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,960
 I've actually wanted to cover these for a while, because what I read and what turned

106
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,160
 out to be true is two totally different things, which happens in the world of the paranormal.

107
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,120
 So I'm reading this, the original account I read, that these things were alive, they

108
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,480
 moved around, and they drank blood.

109
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,840
 And then as I did more research on these things, those things are true.

110
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,080
 They drank blood.

111
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,800
 But remember we did that story recently about the people who were pouring milk into the

112
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,760
 mouths of statues of the Hindu statues, I think it was?

113
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,960
 And I was like, oh, that's amazing.

114
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,640
 Imagine if you could see a statue drink milk.

115
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,640
 That'd be totally dope.

116
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,800
 I would totally become a fan of statues right now.

117
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,240
 I'm okay on them, whatever.

118
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,960
 But if they drank milk, I'd buy some of them.

119
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,720
 I'd be stealing David, and I have him in my bedroom.

120
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,720
 Not my bedroom.

121
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,720
 Forget I said that.

122
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,080
 I'd be having him in the living room.

123
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,160
 Be having him drink milk.

124
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,520
 But my point is, is that they just stand there and they take the, it turned out the

125
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,880
 statues weren't really drinking the milk.

126
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,720
 They would just put the milk by the statues and they would spill it on the statues.

127
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,560
 It was kind of a rip off.

128
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,920
 This one too, they would take a plate of human blood and just set it by the jangleots.

129
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,920
 They didn't actually go, thank you sir, and start like slurping it up.

130
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,920
 Because my immediate thing was, here's the thing, at the end of the day, even though

131
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,000
 I dismiss a lot of this stuff and I demuncle a lot of this stuff, I do want to believe it.

132
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,360
 So when I found out that there was nine inch tall vampires, I started looking for videos

133
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,720
 of them drinking blood.

134
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,040
 I was like, surely there must have been someone who recorded this stuff.

135
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,040
 Of course not.

136
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,040
 Of course not, Jason.

137
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,040
 Because they don't exist.

138
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,000
 There's so much things in nine inch tall.

139
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,120
 I actually tried looking on YouTube for a video of a nine inch tall vampire in 1972

140
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,120
 drinking blood.

141
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,120
 It doesn't exist.

142
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,760
 So here's what it is.

143
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,920
 They would take a plate of blood, set it next to the statue.

144
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,880
 That spoiler alert was not really a vampire.

145
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,160
 It turned out that, so let me tell the story, let me retract that spoiler alert.

146
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,160
 What was going on?

147
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,720
 You just charged them money for this in 1972?

148
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:50,240
 By the time 1997 rolled around, a bunch of other psychics also started manifesting these

149
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,240
 jangleots.

150
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,240
 They would go, I went to a cave and I was meditating and look at these guys.

151
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,680
 Oh no, you can't look at them unless you give me some money.

152
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,640
 They started having all these psychics come forward and say that they were able to manifest

153
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,200
 these little vampires.

154
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:07,960
 And that's when, the ones in 1972 apparently are still around, but in 1997 it's late enough

155
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,200
 that people could start doing what's called scientific tests on them.

156
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,880
 And people have really said these things.

157
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:21,480
 Up until the year 2006, they were doing DNA scans, X-rays on these, and it turned out shocker

158
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,880
 that these things were fake.

159
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,840
 They had nails, they could, through X-rays, tell nails we're connecting the arms to the

160
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,240
 torso that the hair was actually from a human.

161
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,040
 And it looked like they were all pulled from the same human.

162
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,280
 Which wouldn't make sense, right?

163
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,160
 You want to go like, I need 100 hairs for this doll.

164
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,480
 I must contact 100 people.

165
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,120
 The articles I read said a lot of them had been exposed, but since not everyone had actually

166
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:52,720
 been tested, you couldn't say verifiably that every single jangleot was a fake.

167
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:59,440
 True, I mean I guess you can't say that, but I think you can assume that if you test something

168
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,560
 and 99% of them turned out to be fake, or even 90% of them turned out to be hoaxes,

169
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,160
 you could assume the other 10% most likely are as well.

170
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,600
 And if you couldn't test them, you would think, well they don't want me to test them, because

171
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,000
 it's probably a hoax as well.

172
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,360
 So despite the fact that I was typing into YouTube, 9-inch vampire drinking blood wasn't

173
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,640
 finding any footage of these jangleots, there is still some interesting things to talk about.

174
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:28,440
 And the lore of these things, when Hendra came out of the cave they were 9 inches tall, but

175
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,440
 as time went on they were only 4 inches tall, and he explained that.

176
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,520
 He explained that these creatures as they get older, they shrink.

177
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:43,720
 And he also said these creatures, these jangleots, are actually thousands of years old.

178
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:48,440
 So I don't know why they just shrink super slowly, and then in a couple years went from

179
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:54,120
 9 inches to 4 inches, but the lore behind these things, other than them shrinking, is this.

180
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,520
 He believes that he was able to manifest the energy of a white monkey, which is a real

181
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,240
 monkey species, the spirit of the white monkeys, that's what these were.

182
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,960
 Jangleots in general lore, outside of these little tiny statues, are, like I said, a vampire,

183
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:16,480
 you can become a jangleot by abstaining from all sexual pleasure and meditating in a cave.

184
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,040
 It's the search for immortality, it's keeping all that sexual energy for yourself actually

185
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,080
 will make you immortal.

186
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:27,640
 I would say this, if someone said Jason, if you never have sexual thoughts again, if

187
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,000
 you never do anything sexual again, you can be immortal, I would take that, I would be

188
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,320
 like okay.

189
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,720
 But then if they go, oh, you're gonna be immortal but you shrink constantly, I wouldn't want

190
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,320
 to do that, like if I was immortal and I was like 5 foot or 4 foot or even 3 foot I'd be

191
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,640
 totally fine with that.

192
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,640
 But if I was, there's some 2 foot tall listener and there's some kid being like oh man, no

193
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:57,400
 if I was even, there's like, there's, one foot tall person is fine, but 9 inches, 9 inches,

194
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:03,080
 I don't want to be the size of a fetus forever and you shrink.

195
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,840
 That's the worst deal ever.

196
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,360
 That's the worst, I'd rather be like one of those weirdos from Vampire the Masquerade

197
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,560
 that hangs out in the sewer all the time, like the Nosferatu ones or the Malkavians

198
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,160
 even, the super edgy, I hated Malkavians.

199
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,680
 I used to do live action roleplay, I don't think I've ever revealed this before on the

200
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,080
 show, I used to do live action roleplay, Vampire the Masquerade.

201
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:32,120
 This was pre-internet, so we had no idea that edgy internet kids were a thing, we just

202
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,200
 thought it was the edgy people in our town and you knew who they were, because they were

203
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,880
 Malkavians and they were crazy and they were always in character.

204
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:47,560
 I got knives and I'm dancing around, oh shut up, Malkavians, I just lost 3 Malkavian listeners.

205
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,800
 It was basically Heath Ledger's The Joker, but that was their roleplaying class, it was

206
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,400
 so, oh my god, but anyways, that was Ventrue of course.

207
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,600
 How are you going to drink blood?

208
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,800
 You don't even get to drink blood, they don't even take a YouTube video of me drinking

209
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
 blood.

210
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,040
 I just live super long and I keep shrinking and I look dried up and eventually I have

211
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,480
 nails driven into my arms and my hair can be sent to DNA tests.

212
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,560
 No dice, I'm not taking that trade off.

213
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,800
 Odie, I look at Odie, there's some vultures circling overhead, he's like "get us out

214
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,300
 of here, Odie, we're gonna- oh actually no, Odie, those vultures are still gonna circle

215
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,400
 over you, I got one more thing to say about these jangleots, this is interesting.

216
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,480
 He claimed they were the spirit of a white monkey.

217
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:36,000
 The jangleots in normal lore are monks who go into caves who have not done anything sexual

218
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,760
 and they become immortal.

219
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,320
 Another side thing to this is that in Java they have a lot of UFO sightings, but like

220
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,560
 in the Middle East they don't really talk about them.

221
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,040
 It's just not something that's considered part of normal discourse.

222
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,040
 We had an episode on that recently, how come we don't see a lot of UFO stuff coming out

223
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,040
 of the Middle East?

224
00:11:53,040 --> 00:12:01,880
 It's not something in Java, but when they do talk about them, the aliens are only 3-9

225
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,360
 inches tall.

226
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:10,760
 So is it possible that some of these are fake to make money, but some of them, at least

227
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:18,720
 one set of them, maybe the original set, are the mummified remains of crashed alien survivors?

228
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,600
 That's another weird footnote in the story of the jangleots.

229
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:28,640
 Odie, now we're going to touch the keys to the carbonicopter, fight those vultures off,

230
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:39,080
 we're going to leave behind Java, we are headed out to New Orleans, Louisiana.

231
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:46,000
 In New Orleans, let me back up before I even get three words into this.

232
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,040
 This is what this guy is saying.

233
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:53,520
 I don't know if this man is actually a police officer, so New Orleans Police Department,

234
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,720
 please don't sue me and go "this guy never worked for us, quit saying fake stuff."

235
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,360
 He says he did.

236
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,360
 Your honor?

237
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,880
 If a judge is listening to this podcast, just go "not guilty" and then I don't have

238
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,440
 to worry about it.

239
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:12,360
 In New Orleans, there's a man, not a man, a legend known as Matt R. He doesn't give us

240
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,920
 a last name, we have his last initial, but we don't need a full last name to recognize

241
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,700
 this man's bravery.

242
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:23,160
 He claims to be a former New Orleans Police Department officer, more importantly than

243
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,160
 that.

244
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,400
 He's blowing the lid off of everything, dude.

245
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,400
 If you have a lid on something right now, go look, it's gone.

246
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:34,440
 He's blowing the lid off everything, especially the reptilian conspiracy.

247
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,080
 He's been seeing them since the year 2005.

248
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:45,440
 One day, he heard a tree smash in his neighbor's backyard.

249
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,220
 From the same time he said he saw a bright light come from the sky now.

250
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,980
 Not lightning, not lightning, mind you.

251
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,380
 Bright light in the sky, tree explodes.

252
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,500
 He knows what this is, it's not lightning.

253
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,660
 It was a reptilian, because that's what reptilians are known for.

254
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,180
 Remember, like Queen Elizabeth might be a reptilian, remember when she smashed all those

255
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,740
 trees?

256
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,060
 Because she's a reptilian, that's what reptilians do.

257
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,700
 He runs out into the yard, he runs out into his neighbor's yard, he does this constantly

258
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,420
 through this story, he's going into other people's property.

259
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,600
 They're OPP.

260
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,080
 He runs out there and he is trying to figure out where the reptilian's at.

261
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:26,200
 That's what you would think, bright light in the sky, tree gets obliterated, reptilian.

262
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
 He can't find them.

263
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,880
 So then he starts doing this thing where he goes into the forest around his house.

264
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,720
 I guess him and his neighbor live near the forest.

265
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:41,920
 He goes into the forest and he says he spends hours a day asking the reptilian's questions.

266
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,400
 This is what you want your law enforcement officer to be doing on their off time, right?

267
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,740
 This is what you want them to be doing.

268
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,380
 You don't want them to be like brushing up on like, you know, like how to discharge a

269
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:56,700
 firearm safely or, you know, not even doing cost stuff, just reading a book.

270
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:01,980
 He's standing in a forest with a notepad asking reptilian's questions and they're not answering

271
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,980
 him.

272
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,220
 The gall of them, right?

273
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:10,140
 The gall of these imaginary beings in the forest not answering him.

274
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,740
 Man, people today.

275
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,740
 Let's see.

276
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,640
 He knows that these are reptilians because his buddy's phone, not his phone, right?

277
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,120
 He's asking the reptilian's questions and the reptilians get mad at him.

278
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:28,800
 So his buddy starts sending him sexually explicit messages and he goes, I'm not doing this.

279
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,840
 I actually didn't do this.

280
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,400
 So Matt goes, Oh, must be the reptilians.

281
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,520
 And I'm assuming the buddy goes, Yeah, I should have signed the reptilians.

282
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,440
 He actually bought it that I didn't actually send those messages.

283
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,440
 Of course not.

284
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
 It must have been the reptilians.

285
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,500
 So that's all you need, right?

286
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,780
 Your buddy, your buddy confessing their love to you via text and then saying that it's

287
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,060
 not them and must be reptilians.

288
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,540
 But this, I'm dismissing him.

289
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,780
 I don't know why I'm dismissing him.

290
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,180
 He has proof.

291
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,860
 He turns his face.

292
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:00,100
 He turns his face to us and he looks and he goes, you see this wound?

293
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,100
 You see this wound I have, Jason?

294
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,060
 And it looks like he has just a thin scratch.

295
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,740
 It looks like, you know how sometimes you're like, wake up, you'll have a scratch on your

296
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,740
 face.

297
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,440
 You're like, Jason, I never wake up scratch on my faces.

298
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,600
 You might want to check out your house for Jangleots.

299
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,120
 You guys have woken up with scratches on your faces.

300
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,480
 He has a long thin scratch on his face.

301
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,360
 He goes, you see this, you see this thing that Jason wakes up with all the time.

302
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,960
 You probably should check for bed bugs.

303
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,920
 You might be hitting his face in the middle of the night.

304
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,720
 But no, this one, this hideous scar, don't look at me.

305
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,720
 Don't look at me.

306
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,720
 I'm hideous.

307
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,920
 This thin cut you can barely see that'll heal.

308
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,660
 That'll heal in the next six hours.

309
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,660
 Was caused by a reptilian.

310
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,660
 He tells us his story.

311
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,660
 He goes, laugh all you want at my hideous deformity.

312
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,020
 Don't look.

313
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,620
 But I was thrown in a shipping container once.

314
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,620
 We laughed at that.

315
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,620
 That's actually kind of funny.

316
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,100
 I don't know why the image of this guy just getting snatched off the street, thrown in

317
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,100
 a shipping container.

318
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:02,100
 He was thrown in a shipping container full of humans and reptilians and there was a door

319
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,220
 in the shipping container and every show often it would open up and someone would be pulled

320
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,220
 out of the shipping container.

321
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,520
 He goes, I don't know how I knew.

322
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,600
 It might have been the fact that everyone was violently trying to get away from the

323
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
 door.

324
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,360
 All I knew is I didn't want to go through that door.

325
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,360
 So in the darkness he was just punching people and getting punched and he felt a reptilian

326
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,320
 claw gouge into a skin.

327
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,160
 One whole millimeter.

328
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,600
 Razor talons that were evolved on another planet to fight for survival.

329
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,160
 These seven foot tall reptilian creatures bred for war.

330
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,160
 A single cut.

331
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,220
 It's as deep as a paper cut.

332
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,380
 He goes, I never got thrown outside that door.

333
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:43,180
 I fought my way in that dark shipping container all that I could.

334
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,940
 And he goes, this is the reason why.

335
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,700
 He goes, I think this is why battle royale games are so popular nowadays.

336
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,860
 It's preparing us.

337
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:56,700
 It's preparing us homo sapiens to be thrown in shipping containers someday.

338
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,140
 So interesting story, right?

339
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,140
 Interesting story.

340
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:04,520
 It would be terrifying to be thrown in a shipping container with a bunch of cuddly gerbils.

341
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,560
 Let alone a bunch of humans and razor clawed reptilians.

342
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,240
 How did he get out of the shipping container though?

343
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,240
 It's a rhetorical question.

344
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,240
 He never answers that.

345
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,380
 We've talked about this in other stories.

346
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:22,440
 These people who are exposing the truth that are exposing these government secrets, these

347
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,620
 high level conspiracies, how are they able to tell us this stuff?

348
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:32,180
 It's one thing when you have someone like Gary Webb, a real life journalist who exposed

349
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:39,540
 that the CIA was complicit in the crack epidemic in Los Angeles to fund the war with the Contras

350
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,580
 in South America, I think was Central America.

351
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,500
 He was eventually ostracized from his profession as a journalist.

352
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:52,640
 He was fired and he eventually quote unquote killed himself in Sacramento with two shots

353
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,060
 to the back of the head with a handgun.

354
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:57,500
 Now you actually can kill yourself with two shots to the back of the head with a handgun.

355
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,820
 That does happen.

356
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,860
 It happens more often than you would think.

357
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:07,100
 There's been questions about did he kill himself because he had no money and that his career

358
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,100
 was in the toilet?

359
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:12,620
 He was a hero for telling the truth or was he assassinated by the CIA?

360
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:18,460
 So we have stories like that where someone exposes a high level conspiracy and mysteriously

361
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,660
 dies.

362
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:26,280
 But this guy who arguably the fact that there are reptilians on the planet is a higher level

363
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:31,220
 conspiracy than the CIA is selling crack cocaine.

364
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,740
 Is flying all of this stuff over to LA.

365
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,020
 How is this guy still alive?

366
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:38,140
 And that's always the question I come to with this stuff because they could easily shut

367
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,900
 this dude down.

368
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,660
 Just don't open the container.

369
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,300
 Just leave him in the shipping container.

370
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,380
 Why did they let him out?

371
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,260
 But he doesn't even reveal how he gets out of the shipping container.

372
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,260
 Or does he?

373
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:54,220
 Let's keep talking here for a second because that's what a podcast is.

374
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,580
 It's me talking.

375
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,840
 The reptilians have actually been experimenting on him.

376
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,200
 They've actually made his eyes so sensitive to the light that he can't sleep with an alarm

377
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,760
 clock in the room.

378
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,640
 He says the light from the alarm clock is so bright he can't sleep his reptilian eyes.

379
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,520
 Now there's no photos of his reptilian eyes.

380
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,720
 He doesn't actually have like little slits.

381
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,960
 This to show the mindset of a man like let's imagine you.

382
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,680
 Let's imagine that you have been abducted by reptilians and your eyeballs have been

383
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,800
 operated on.

384
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:27,380
 And for whatever reason they let you exist.

385
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,900
 They let you go home to take an out.

386
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,300
 Your alarm clock is too bright.

387
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:36,820
 Do you A. Buy an alarm clock that's less bright or buy an alarm clock that's like an analog

388
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,860
 clock that doesn't have any lights.

389
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:45,860
 Do you B. Turn the alarm clock so it's facing the wall so you don't see the light.

390
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,500
 The alarm clock serves one purpose.

391
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,500
 To have an alarm.

392
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,100
 Or so it doesn't matter.

393
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,640
 If you need to see the time you just turn and look at it and go oh it's 1103 and then

394
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,680
 you turn it back.

395
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:01,480
 Or do you or do you do what Matt did.

396
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,440
 Those would have been the two most logical things.

397
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,680
 Matt got up out of bed.

398
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,480
 He can't sleep because the lights do bright.

399
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,800
 He gets him out of bed.

400
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:16,460
 He gets a blue Tupperware bowl or a blue Tupperware plate cuts it up and then glues it to the

401
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:22,460
 alarm clock so he can't see the time.

402
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:27,140
 Now if you're like I wonder what time it is you're all slowly peeling stuff it's all

403
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,300
 glued together you're like oh it's blurt o'clock.

404
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,360
 You can't even see anything.

405
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,540
 That's the mindset that we're dealing with and what's so weird when I read stuff like

406
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,780
 this is I'm reading it and thinking this guy's a lunatic.

407
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:43,260
 There are other people reading it and being like that poor man if those reptilians would

408
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:48,020
 just leave him alone he would have a working alarm clock and a blue Tupperware bowl but

409
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,940
 he has neither now.

410
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,380
 Who reads this and takes it seriously.

411
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:57,900
 But what we're really talking about here is the reptilians relationship with the police

412
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,900
 department.

413
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,980
 So we're going back in time.

414
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:04,020
 I jumped ahead to 2018 where he was throwing in the cargo container but let's jump back

415
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:08,260
 to 2005 when he first started encountering these reptilians.

416
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:22,100
 2005 was also the timing of a major event Hurricane Katrina.

417
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:26,460
 Hurricane Katrina hits a couple thousand people died it was a horrible tragedy and then the

418
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:34,420
 aftermath some people called them looters some people said they were just trying to survive

419
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:39,540
 but the reptilians didn't care either way.

420
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:45,100
 All that footage of police officers watching over people breaking into the local Winn Dixie

421
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:51,900
 that was actually footage of people breaking into Winn Dixie but then they would cut to

422
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:57,540
 a picture of a cop just standing there shaking his head that was a reptilian.

423
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,540
 Did you guys know that?

424
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,540
 No?

425
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,540
 You didn't know that?

426
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,540
 You didn't know that?

427
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,780
 That was a fact?

428
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:09,300
 You see Hurricane Katrina was actually the very first policing action of reptilians on

429
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:16,100
 planet earth and Matt R. helped train them.

430
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:20,620
 Like I said Matt R. at this time was a member of the New Orleans police department and he

431
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:27,900
 said that what happened was apparently before Hurricane Katrina happened he was abducted

432
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,940
 and put in an underground shopping mall.

433
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,500
 It was more like a shopping mall set like he could tell that it wasn't a real shopping

434
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:40,500
 mall it was almost like a testing ground and he realizes as he's there he's in his police

435
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:45,420
 uniform there's a couple other people in police uniforms but he doesn't have any insignia

436
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:50,700
 he doesn't have any badge or anything it's just a black uniform and he sees a bunch of

437
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:55,660
 other civilians in there they're not wearing uniforms and then all of a sudden the walls

438
00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:01,820
 blow open that's how he knows they're underground the walls blow open and reptilians pouring

439
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:10,220
 through these walls and they're carrying laser guns and they're shooting at the people.

440
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,740
 The people are panicking they're running every which way and Matt and his fellow officers

441
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:19,140
 are trying to maintain order but as these laser blasts are flying towards them there's

442
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:22,980
 just utter panic and that's when Matt realizes something the reptilians aren't shooting the

443
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,540
 people.

444
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:28,820
 They're shooting around the people they're shooting like the signs they're shooting out

445
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:34,620
 the windows they're shooting at potted plants it's like they're trying to herd the people

446
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:39,940
 to go into a certain direction they don't want to kill them they just want them to move

447
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,500
 and Matt realizes in this moment he goes this is probably where the legends of the fire

448
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,060
 breathing dragon comes from because you're looking at the seven foot tall eight foot nine

449
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:52,580
 foot tall reptilians and these heat rays are coming out he goes you couldn't actually see

450
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:56,580
 like the red laser beam you could just see how the air would get wavy and then something

451
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:00,580
 would explode or something would catch on fire.

452
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:05,220
 He said eventually the reptilians all pushed them back to this big stage and him and his

453
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:10,560
 fellow officers got up on the stage and the people were crowded down below it the reptilians

454
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:16,540
 were cornering them in and then the exercise stopped as they're standing up there one of

455
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:22,340
 these reptilians comes up on stage and walks right up to Matt and goes great job great job

456
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:31,100
 in fact turns to the other police officers Matt R is the best cop among you in fact

457
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:39,100
 I've served on planets I've met alien commanders all over the galaxy but Matt R I respect you

458
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:45,900
 more than even my own commanders so Matt R at this moment realized that this was a training

459
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:50,460
 exercise this is where he's kind of putting it together the reptilians were trying to figure

460
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:56,420
 out a way to do crowd control on humans without injuring them he also realized that he was

461
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:02,120
 part of that he was actually going to be training them to be better peace officers he was going

462
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:09,020
 to train them to help protect humanity in their own weird reptilian way and after telling

463
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:14,340
 this long story and after me reading this long story that he posted online I get to the

464
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:24,220
 line of the very ending that's where my dream ends so now I'm rethinking whether or not

465
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:28,620
 he was actually thrown in the shipping container was that a dream as well so basically he had

466
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:34,820
 a dream he had a dream that reptilians the whole thing I'm not even going to take him

467
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:40,140
 to fight him with retelling it and then he wakes up and at some point he notices he has

468
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:46,940
 a pea sized lump on his penis and it goes away and then it comes back not all at once it's

469
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:53,100
 not like blinking and out of existence one day but over time it's disappeared and reappeared

470
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:58,300
 and in the article he's almost he's almost pleading he's written several articles for

471
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:02,460
 this website called phantom and monsters in the article he's been like it's an article

472
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:07,940
 right it's not a forum post it's not an ask me anything it's an article he's basically

473
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:11,780
 like as he talks about the lump in his penis it's almost like he's asking is this okay

474
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:17,980
 should I get this checked out I can't answer that first off yes yes you should but I'm

475
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,940
 not I can't send you an email I'm not going to put in the comments dude get your penis

476
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:27,020
 checked out that's the most important part if you have a pea sized lump in your penis

477
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:32,940
 that comes and goes go to the doctor an earth doctor don't have a dream and have some reptilian

478
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,300
 do you probably think it's a microchip honestly that's a big old microchip if it's the size

479
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:43,220
 of a pea so what is it what's the end game with this what's the end game with this he

480
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:48,660
 believes that this dream was real he says if he eats tuna or sardines or non processed

481
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:55,980
 meat he doesn't have to cover up his alarm clock too late you can't really fix that

482
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:02,660
 he believes that his buddy was also abducted because of his buddy goes to the Kroger supermarket

483
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:07,500
 in the checkout lines his knee gets scanned because there's a microchip in his knee and

484
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:13,340
 it shows up as a price was the price like leg of you like anyways he just has all these

485
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:20,660
 weird anecdotes but we're really building up to this thing he believes that the reptilians

486
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:25,980
 have one purpose coming to earth they want to be police officers they want to be that's

487
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:30,020
 all that's all that's all they're in game and you go Jason that would make sense you

488
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:34,060
 would need police officers like if you're gonna have a new global order you need a new global

489
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:40,180
 police yes yeah the rational person we can have that conversation right if you wanted

490
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:45,100
 to start a new global society earthbound or intergalactic you would need to have a global

491
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:52,700
 police force you'd have to enforce the laws he says that these reptilians have one purpose

492
00:28:52,700 --> 00:29:01,420
 to stop looters when they look at all the combined violence throughout human history

493
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:08,300
 all the wars all the sieges all the disasters everything they hate looters more than anything

494
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:12,980
 because they look at the property damage there are billions on renticular nine are watching

495
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:16,740
 us through their view screens and they're like oh no another window broken in Portland

496
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:24,620
 send down the battle fleet that's their only goal is to stop looting here's a quote from

497
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:32,620
 one of these articles they will not give warning before they strike no hovering ships why because

498
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:39,420
 this would cause the exact type of panic looting that they are trying to prevent so basically

499
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:44,020
 the reason why we'll never get disclosure with ships is because if you see an alien craft

500
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:48,980
 overhead you're gonna want to break a window and they're here to save the windows so they

501
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,980
 won't they'll just one day will turn around there'll be an alien standing there and he'll

502
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:55,740
 just be you go to punch a window he'll be shaking his finger with that little claw you

503
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:59,940
 don't want a paper cut on your face he believes that's their only goal not interbreeding with

504
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:03,340
 humans not taking over the well they want to take over the planet they just want to save

505
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:09,980
 the windows they don't want any looting whatsoever and this all came to a head when last summer

506
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:15,100
 in the we had him in Portland and they also had him in Washington DC we started having

507
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:21,740
 federal police officers not wearing any badges any name tags no identifying information and

508
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:27,540
 they were scooping people off the streets and that's when Matt or started putting two and

509
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:37,220
 two together that was the first strike force of the reptilians it's begun ladies and gentlemen

510
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:43,980
 they're already here the training that he did in 2005 with the reptilians it's been put

511
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:50,460
 into effect when you see those men and women with no badges their reptilians that's why

512
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:55,740
 they don't have badges because he says this of a reptilian but no no what you're thinking

513
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:00,620
 Jason I saw footage of those guys I saw photographs they weren't eight foot tall reptilians they

514
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:05,860
 were normal sized humans okay just forget that part just forget that part he doesn't

515
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:12,900
 explain that either but he says listen a reptilian if he came down from Cyrus nine comes down

516
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:17,220
 in his battle fleet doesn't hover over a city because otherwise people start breaking windows

517
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:22,820
 sneaks in through the back and then walks in gets a job at a police department is now

518
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:28,100
 now standing eight foot tall reptilian but somehow he just looks like a normal guy he

519
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:32,940
 wouldn't be able to wear a local police badge because imagine the horror imagine if he was

520
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:39,100
 wearing a Portland police department badge on him and he goes to stop a looter and he

521
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:43,940
 doesn't realize there's a difference in gravity between our planet and his planet and he picks

522
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:49,220
 a looter and throws him like eight blocks eight city blocks smashing into some building

523
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:53,620
 in downtown everyone's going to be like who who is the officer who was the officer who

524
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:58,140
 broke the laws of gravity and it would turn out that it was this guy and then it would

525
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:03,540
 be exposed and they wouldn't let him wear like a like a holographic reptilian space

526
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:09,800
 badge because then everyone knows a reptilian so the only other thing you could do he specifically

527
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:16,220
 states for liability reasons reptilians cannot wear local police badges again it's an alien

528
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:19,740
 invasion I don't think they're worried about getting sued I don't think they're going to

529
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:24,020
 be like dude our plan is going to go off without a hitch unless one person sues us and then

530
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:29,180
 it's all over they can't wear the badges so all of these federal police officers that

531
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:34,980
 we saw last summer were actually reptilians according to Matt Art though it's it's the

532
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:42,380
 end now it's too late we can't fight against this it's the window industrial complex we

533
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:49,020
 love windows as a society we put little windows on our eyes and call them glasses we drink

534
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:55,100
 out of cups that we can look through and call them glasses we even have fairy tales about

535
00:32:55,100 --> 00:33:04,980
 shoes made of glass and then windows window the eyes are the window to the soul that's

536
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:08,700
 the only thing I can think of with windows but we think about it we love comedies we

537
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:16,900
 love like window washers like almost falling off to their deaths we love mirrors windows

538
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:21,540
 are windows that didn't quite make the cut so they only are halfway well our world is

539
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:27,100
 surrounded by glass and windows and we have skyscrapers with tons of these beautiful things

540
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:33,140
 that we look out we see the sunrise and the sunset we've surrounded ourselves with the

541
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:39,260
 only thing aliens care about protecting and it's too late to stop them now so the next

542
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:43,100
 time you're driving down the road and you see that flashing red and blue lights behind

543
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:50,180
 you don't stop don't hit the gas pedal like keep going bro keep going because for all

544
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:54,860
 you know that car is going to pull up to you you're going to you're going to legally do

545
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:58,100
 your duty as a citizen what you should do and you're going to pull over to the side

546
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,500
 of the road and the cops going to pull over next to you and then he gets out and you're

547
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,820
 like that's weird you look in your mirror and says his objects are closer than they

548
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:11,340
 appear but you can only see the officers crotch coming towards you and you're like okay that's

549
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:15,980
 super bizarre that's only something Jason would say and you turn and the officer is

550
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:21,860
 eight feet tall and he has to lean down to look into your car with his reptilian eyes

551
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:28,420
 you have to cover up you have to cover up your car stereo the lights do right he looks

552
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:34,220
 at you and he goes he has that's why the cops wear those sunglasses to cover up their reptilian

553
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:42,740
 eyes he goes do you know how fast you were going you're like what what you make that

554
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:48,380
 last word weird cut and then he goes ah you want to give me lip and that's when you feel

555
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:56,220
 reptilian claws reach and reach into your mouth and pull your lips off and he goes now I got

556
00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:01,340
 your lips apparently they're also from the leprechaun movies apparently they're also

557
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:06,460
 a horror movie villain and he eats them and then you're laying in your car with no lips

558
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:11,060
 and the reptilians calling in for backup more reptilian cops are going to show up and just

559
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:15,060
 then you think that things couldn't get any worse you turn there's a little jangle on

560
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:19,660
 sitting sit in your passenger seat and he's just sitting there and as you're bleeding

561
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:24,180
 all over yourself the jangle lots just sitting next to you and you can feel him absorbing

562
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:30,220
 your blood and then the blood was super realistic and it was coming out of your eyeballs I have

563
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:36,660
