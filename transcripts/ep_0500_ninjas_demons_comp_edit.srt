1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Could we soon be facing a crime wave of cuddly criminals?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,560
 And then we travel to Connecticut to meet five teenagers with attitude

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,520
 out practicing their martial arts late one night.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,920
 They thought they were just gonna have some fun throwing kicks in the air.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,400
 Instead they go toe to toe with the demonic force today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:34,200
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7

9
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,880
 breaking news coming but first off I want to give a shout out to our latest

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,000
 Tommy let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgable. We're

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,160
 gonna take a little flight. This is a breaking story. I didn't plan on doing

17
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:18,320
 this but it just popped up today. Let's go ahead and fly on over to Rochester,

18
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,080
 Indiana. That's the Durgable flying over. We're not gonna be here long so

19
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,440
 you know take your tourist pictures now. If there's anything to see in Rochester,

20
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,760
 Indiana I'm not for sure but we're here because these two num schools,

21
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,800
 John L. Schultz the fourth. That means there was three preceding this guy. The

22
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:44,200
 three stooge isn't in this guy and then Donald V. Robin Jr. Allegedly, allegedly

23
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:50,480
 these two guys decided to shoot up two schools. These two idiots thought it

24
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,680
 would be a great idea to go shoot up two schools just as the school year

25
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,760
 starting and things like that. Somebody, they were telling friends because they're

26
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,320
 so cool and they're like bragging about it and stuff and then one of their

27
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,480
 friends who was a who wasn't an idiot alerted authorities and both these

28
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:12,240
 people got arrested. Yes it is all alleged so they're allegedly num schools. I do

29
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,560
 think it's funny though that they went and bought trench coats because they

30
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,720
 wanted to be like the Columbine dudes. They even have tattoos of Columbine

31
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,400
 quotes on their arms. Allegedly I mean I guess that's provable right? I'm like hey

32
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,400
 dude show me your arm and he's like I will allegedly lift up my sleeve. I'm

33
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,760
 like whatever just show me your arm. Anyways these two guys are in jail. They

34
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,080
 had trench coats. They had that's not all. They actually had more stuff. It's just like

35
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,240
 there's a bunch of guys who don't like the rain and the cops are like oh boy oh

36
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,280
 wait and they're resting them. Guys were bragging they had access to guns and all

37
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,640
 that stuff so the cops made a move and they have arrested them so far and then

38
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,520
 the county prosecutor goes listen it could be a case of free speech. It was

39
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,480
 an interesting thing. The prosecutor's like it's really the prosecutor goes

40
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,200
 basically when you're talking about like Columbine and worshiping. Let me read you

41
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,640
 the actual quote because it's such a bizarre quote. This is from Fulton

42
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,120
 County prosecutor Michael Mars. He said so I mean anytime anyone's obsessed with

43
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,520
 Columbine yes it's a fine line between free speech and when you cross the line

44
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,600
 but I think in this case clearly what they had done was going to interfere with

45
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,600
 the occupancy of a school. So even the prosecutors like yeah I get it they

46
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,880
 could just be larping. They actually probably see a lot of that in law

47
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,560
 enforcement. People have been like oh I'm gonna make them pay. I'm gonna make them all pay and

48
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,680
 then the cops investigated and it's just like an edgy blog on Tumblr right. And

49
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,120
 the prosecutor again yeah they must come across this a lot. That's a very weird

50
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,240
 quote from a county prosecutor. He's like yeah you know when it comes to

51
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:48,360
 Columbine sometimes people just really like Columbine but this was more than

52
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,560
 that. So the way that this is going to anyways that is the numbskull of the week

53
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,240
 that's my new segment. That's my new segment. It starts and ends today. If you

54
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,680
 want to know more about these guys and their trench coat purchasing history

55
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,800
 it'll be in the show notes. Okay let's go ahead and move to the actual first

56
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:13,520
 story. Tommy or flying that dead rabbit dirgeable away from Indiana we are headed

57
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,680
 out to Sri Lanka. This is a story that popped up the other day. The ramification

58
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,320
 the story itself is kind of cute. The ramifications of it can be terrifying.

59
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:29,160
 Dirgeable going all the way to Sri Lanka. We're gonna go to Aruna Sri Lanka

60
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,760
 specifically in Aruna. There is the Wellicotta prison. It's high security

61
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,720
 prison. It's where they put all their big bad guys in Sri Lanka. It's July 2020.

62
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,000
 This just happened last month. Normal day at a prison at a high security prison.

63
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,800
 As normal as a day you can have in a high security prison. A cat breaks into the

64
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,400
 perimeter. Not a big deal right? Cats and rats and stuff like that are always

65
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,440
 hanging out at prisons. A lot of people adopt them as friends or a little extra

66
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,520
 snack on the side. You know a tasty black rat to supplement your top ramen and

67
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,600
 cheese and crackers. But this cat was no ordinary cat. This cat was a heroin

68
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,280
 smuggler. Now when I first read that I thought that's dope right? And then when

69
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,280
 I kept reading the article I go that's even doper than I originally thought.

70
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,880
 Because not only was this cat this cat just wasn't just didn't have it some

71
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,120
 heroin on him and happened into the prison. He knew exactly what cell block

72
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,720
 to go to. There is a cartel that has been smuggling contraband into the prison.

73
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:35,200
 Specifically this cat had two grams of heroin, some sim cards, and a microchip.

74
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,960
 Apparently so a Dr. Mindbender could finish building some sort of device to

75
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,400
 help Cobra Commander escape. When's the last time you've even heard the term

76
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:49,120
 microchip? But anyways this cat is smuggling in a microchip, a couple sim

77
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,920
 cards, and two grams of heroin. You know like the guy who got the heroin was

78
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,160
 like oh this is so awesome. And then the other guy who gets the sim cards he's

79
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:03,400
 like ah this is okay but I have some heroin. And then the guy who gets the

80
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,360
 microchip is like the total nerd of the prison. Everyone's like boo throwing stuff

81
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,480
 at him. He drops his microchip he's like oh no I'll never find it now. Anyways this

82
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,280
 cat gets arrested for smuggling this stuff in. The question is how many times

83
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,600
 did this cat actually successfully smuggle stuff in? And the authorities are

84
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,680
 like okay here's the plan. We're not actually gonna press charges against the

85
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,920
 cat because that's foolish but we can follow the cat back to its hideout and

86
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,800
 then we'll arrest the people who trained the cat. Good plan right? But before they

87
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,800
 could do that guards at a high security prison mind you this is the level of

88
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,840
 the level of the employees at this high security prison guards going to feed the

89
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:48,060
 cat opened the door and the cat ran out. So I don't know how many prisoners

90
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,920
 escaped from this prison on any day right? The guards are like lunchtime

91
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,880
 people are just scattering in every direction they're like oh no anyways and

92
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,840
 the authorities they go ah the cat's gone we can't really track it but this is

93
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,160
 what makes this story even more bizarre. They know the cartel that trained the

94
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,040
 cat because they know where it was going and dropping the stuff off and no joke.

95
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,520
 In this article I'm reading this article this same cartel previously before

96
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:20,320
 using the cat had trained an eagle to fly over the prison and drop stuff into

97
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,280
 the yard. Now in America we've been having an issue with drones flying over

98
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,960
 prisons and dropping off contraband that's cool because it's kind of like

99
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,640
 futuristic but I'd much rather have an eagle dropping me stuff off.

100
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,120
 Your clout in prison would be so high if you're just like standing out there

101
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,640
 playing a little basketball in here and everyone looks up and they're like oh

102
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,200
 yeah Johnny's getting a delivery today and then a little baggy you just hold

103
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,480
 your hand out. A baggy falls in your hand. You might not want to be that obvious about it

104
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,480
 because then the guards are like they hear the eagle screeching they're like

105
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,720
 oh get ready to arrest Johnny he's gonna have a handful of microchips. It's so

106
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,800
 funny because I read that and I was like dude that's super dope. They did end up

107
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,720
 catching the eagle. They caught the eagle. They went to like they had found the

108
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,000
 eagle before they'd seen the eagle flying around and they did a raid on the

109
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,800
 cartel and there was just like an eagle in a cage and they're like hey we

110
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,100
 recognize you. Eagles like gulp. Then I go I wonder if there are other like

111
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,440
 criminal animals and stuff so I went to this article about it's like nine

112
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,880
 wacky animal criminals. That's exactly what it sounds like when you read the

113
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:27,720
 article in your head and it was like this alligator. I was like oh this is dope dude.

114
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,760
 What does alligator do? It's all this alligator is a home invader. It broke into

115
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:40,480
 a dood house. I'm like that's not a crime. That's not a crime. I mean it is. I can't do that.

116
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,960
 That's just an alligator. It doesn't know what a house is. It's just breaking in.

117
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,440
 They had a, here's a better one. They had a bird who would sit outside of this

118
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,200
 gas station like this Aldi's in England or something like that.

119
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,200
 Do you like my notes? Do you like my notes for this segment? There's this bird who

120
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:01,000
 would sit on the sidewalk and the doors would open and close automatically and

121
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,920
 he would just sit there and then once he like had a moment he'd fly into the

122
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,080
 store grab a bag of chips and then fly out and eat them. There okay that's kind

123
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,400
 of more what I'm talking about but I started to think remember back in the

124
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,160
 day you don't because we're not a hundred years old but remember like hearing

125
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:25,360
 about like the monkey grinders was that there were monkey grinders. They were the

126
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,000
 organ grinders that had monkeys. The monkey grinders is something totally

127
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,120
 different. Pay me a dime and I'll grind this monkey right in front of you lad.

128
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,320
 You know what I'm talking about like not that but you give the old man a dime and

129
00:09:38,320 --> 00:10:08,320
 he plays the box thing goes do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do

00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:08,320
 He'd just go and get it. He'd just go and get it. He'd just go and get it.

147
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,320
 He'd just go and get it. He'd just go and get it. He'd just go and get it.

148
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,320
 He'd just go and get it. He'd just go and get it. He'd just go and get it.

149
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,320
 He'd just go and get it. He'd just go and get it. He'd just go and get it.

150
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,320
 He'd just go and get it. He'd just go and get it. He'd just go and get it.

151
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,320
 He'd just go and get it. He'd just go and get it. He'd just go and get it.

152
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,320
 He'd just go and get it. He'd just go and get it. He'd just go and get it.

153
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,320
 He'd just go and get it. He'd just go and get it.

154
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:35,320
 That is where they actually had a training facility for these super smart dolphins.

155
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,320
 It was in New Orleans and it was connected to the sea, but there was these giant walls.

156
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,320
 Because you know the military is like, "Listen, these things are hyper smart.

157
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:50,320
 We've trained these things to kill people. Whatever you do, don't let them go."

158
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,320
 And everyone's like, "Yeah, of course. Of course. We're not going to let these genetically...

159
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,320
 I don't know if they're genetically modified, okay? Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

160
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:04,320
 I'm pretty sure they were, but they were quote unquote trained at the genetic level.

161
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,320
 Maybe, but anyways, super smart dolphins. They were in this enclosure and everyone's like,

162
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,320
 "Okay, this has worked for like 20 years. We've been able to keep these contained."

163
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,320
 And then Hurricane Katrina showed up and everyone's like, "Ah, they're running away."

164
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,320
 I remember reading about this at the time. It was a sparkle of joy during that time.

165
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,320
 A horrible misery. That was a horrible natural disaster.

166
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,320
 But I remember laughing out loud when I came across this article.

167
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,320
 I was like, the researchers and the people who worked at the laboratory were like,

168
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,320
 "Oh no, what are we going to do? There's huge hurricanes coming."

169
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:43,320
 And then it started flooding. And then the floodwaters started to get as tall as the wall of the dolphin holding pin.

170
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,320
 And then it got taller. And all the dolphins escaped.

171
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,320
 All of these super smart dolphins escaped into the sea.

172
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,320
 And I remember reading an article at the time and the basically, I'll see if I can try to find the article.

173
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,320
 I'll definitely find an article on it. But at the time, I remember the military is like,

174
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,320
 "There's no way we're not going to be able to catch these things."

175
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:14,320
 They're super intelligent dolphins that were trained to like look for explosives and kill people.

176
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
 You don't want those out there, right?

177
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,320
 And they just swam away, selectively bred and trained.

178
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,320
 Wink, wink. Trained at a molecular level. So they're out there.

179
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,320
 So you, my thing is this, is like you can train certain animals to commit crimes.

180
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,320
 The cat doesn't know he's smuggling heroin, right?

181
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,320
 The eagle knows something's up. He's a little fishy, but because he eats little fishies.

182
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,320
 Uh-uh, you like that joke? You don't. But anyways, I want to keep it in.

183
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,320
 You can teach an animal to commit a crime. They probably don't know what a crime is.

184
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,320
 Those dolphins know that they're murdering Russians.

185
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,320
 Like they totally are aware of that.

186
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:55,320
 Could you get to the point where, weak, you could train a rhino to smash open a bank vault?

187
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,320
 Can you actually train a rhino, I think, would be your first question.

188
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,320
 But like, you could have hippos and stuff, because they're like bulletproof for the most part.

189
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,320
 I mean, cops aren't walking around with elephant guns.

190
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:10,320
 You just like unleash hippos into a city and they're just like smashing cop cars and stuff like that.

191
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,320
 And then you go in and you're just like robbing banks and stuff like that.

192
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,320
 Like, could we get to a point where if the military is... I've always said this.

193
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,320
 I always say this is the first thing I say when I meet somebody.

194
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,320
 Generally, technology works like this. First, it works as a military application,

195
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,320
 and then it works as a criminal application.

196
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:34,320
 Bulletproof vests invented for the military and now, you know, 50 Cent can wear one in a music video.

197
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,320
 But I mean, you know, like, originally it's a military component,

198
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:44,320
 and then it becomes a "civilian" thing which can be used to protect civilians or to aid in a crime.

199
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:44,320
 Tommy Guns, who are invented for the army, and then "brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

200
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:52,320
 Tommy Guns were invented for the army and then you had people writing their names on walls, I Hart Dick Tracy, just a couple years later.

201
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:59,320
 If they're training these dolphins and now we see criminals also training the house pets basically to do these things,

202
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:06,320
 will we reach a level where criminals are just like genetically modifying animals to commit crimes?

203
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,320
 Not just unleashing a cat with heroin on it, but like...

204
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:17,320
 unleashing a cat, it successfully delivers the heroin and as it's sneaking out of the prison, it's all "hehehehehe"

205
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:24,320
 and the cat had a bunch of geckos sitting on the cat so it was completely camouflaged.

206
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,320
 You can never see it, although I guess at that point you probably just genetically modify a giant gecko.

207
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,320
 But yeah, you could have a suit made of geckos and you're just walking around and no one can see you.

208
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,320
 Everyone does wonder why you have a thousand eyeballs, thousand little eyeballs on you,

209
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,320
 but you know, it's modern art and you're just walking around it from perfectly blended in.

210
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:48,320
 No one would know, no one would know if it wasn't for that handful of microchips that you're holding.

211
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,320
 Let's go ahead Tommy Davidson, we're gonna stop giving the criminal underworld ideas.

212
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:58,320
 Let's hop on that carbonicopter, we are headed off to Manchester, Connecticut.

213
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,320
 [mimics car noises]

214
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:06,320
 We're leaving behind a bunch of octopi, they've taken over the city, one of them is standing in the mayor's office.

215
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,320
 There's layin' motionless covered in ink.

216
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,320
 [mimics car noises]

217
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,320
 Brave New World, my friends, a brave New World.

218
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,320
 We're flying away, we're going to Manchester, Connecticut, it's November 6, 1999.

219
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,320
 It's 2 a.m.

220
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,320
 There's a man he's sleeping at home, he's the Reverend David W. Bowser Sr.

221
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,320
 He's sleeping at home with his wife and then...

222
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,320
 [knocking]

223
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,320
 Reverend!

224
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,320
 [knocking]

225
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,320
 Reverend!

226
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,320
 Reverend, open up!

227
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,320
 What?

228
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,320
 [sighs]

229
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
 He gets up and he walks through his house.

230
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,320
 He looks at the people and he sees two young men standing outside of his door.

231
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,320
 It's 2 a.m. he thinks he recognizes one of them, but both of them are dressed in all black.

232
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:53,320
 And he can see in the road is a car that contains three more men also dressed in all black.

233
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,320
 And it seems that they have some sort of...

234
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,320
 Is that a sword?

235
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,320
 Reverend, open up! We need your help!

236
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,320
 Let's skip to a couple hours earlier.

237
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,320
 It's the Devil's Hopyard State Park in East Hadam.

238
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,320
 There's five young men there in the park.

239
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,320
 It's late at night, one of them is swinging a baseball bat.

240
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,320
 [whooshing]

241
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,320
 Through the air.

242
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,320
 The other one has a sword.

243
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:23,320
 The guy with the baseball bat's like, "Oh man, I can't wait until I get my allowance. I can buy a sword."

244
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,320
 The guy with the sword's practicing his sword moves.

245
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,320
 One of the guys is hiding behind a tree.

246
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,320
 Can you see me yet?

247
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,320
 Yeah, I can kind of see you. Move a little bit more behind the tree.

248
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,320
 Can you see me now?

249
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,320
 No, I can't see you. Perfect. Perfect.

250
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,320
 These five men are martial arts enthusiasts.

251
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,320
 They just got done with a rigorous martial arts workout back in town, but they said,

252
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:56,320
 "You know what? If we really want to perfect our ninja moves, we have to go to Devil's Hopyard State Park."

253
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,320
 This is something they did. This wasn't like a spur of the moment thing.

254
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,320
 They were like, "What should we do? Dinnies or pretend we're ninjas tonight?"

255
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,320
 And they're like, "Hmm, well, we've never done the ninja thing."

256
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,320
 They'd done this before. I don't know if they've done it at this specific location,

257
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:15,320
 but these five guys, they were all 18 or older, by the way, like to pretend they were ninjas.

258
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:21,320
 They were training themselves in the martial arts to be fair, but they also just like to pretend to be ninjas.

259
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,320
 So they would swing in the baseball bats. They would do that to build muscle.

260
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,320
 Swing a baseball bat over and over and over again. You get big.

261
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,320
 They saw their heroes, Mark McGuire and Jose Canseco, get totally strong.

262
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,320
 Just by swinging a baseball bat, Sammy Sosa, totally natural.

263
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:44,320
 We actually believed that in 1999. I don't think they'd been exposed at that time, but swinging them baseball bats.

264
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:51,320
 Now, one of the guys there, his name is Paul Ponitowski. He's practicing his ninja moves, having a good time with his friends.

265
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:57,320
 Even if they're not going to be able to take on a Roku Saki anytime soon, it's still just a fun night with your friends.

266
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
 But while he's practicing his ninja moves, he hears...

267
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,320
 "Paul."

268
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,320
 He hears his voice clearly call out from the darkness.

269
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:12,320
 "Paul, leave now, or you'll join us forever."

270
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,320
 Paul kind of pauses for a second, looks around into the darkness.

271
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,320
 But he's not the only one who hears it.

272
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:24,320
 "Paul. Paul. Leave now or you'll join us forever."

273
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,320
 He stops him in his tracks and he asks, "Whoa, did you say that? What?"

274
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,320
 Other friend goes, "No, I heard it too, dude. I heard it too."

275
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:41,320
 At that point, playtime's over, right? You may not be the master of your ninja game, but you can practice that at a YMCA.

276
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,320
 It's time to leave a place called Devil's Hopyard. They decide to leave.

277
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:50,320
 Todd Silver, he's the oldest one in the group, he's 23 years old, is getting his stuff together and he hears...

278
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,320
 [laughs]

279
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:04,320
 Joseph Robinson, 18 years old, he looks over where there's a fence line and there's something sitting on it, watching them.

280
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:11,320
 He described it as beast-like. It definitely wasn't human, more monster than man.

281
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:19,320
 But the one word he really used to describe it was a demon sitting on the fence, watching them.

282
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:26,320
 Everyone seems to be having their own little encounter with this element that's out there.

283
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:35,320
 Because when Joseph goes, "Hey guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, I know you guys really want to pack. I really want to pack too, but what is that?"

284
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:43,320
 When Paul looks over and sees what Joseph is pointing at, he says he sees a shadow with a jagged edge.

285
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:49,320
 At this point, they're on their way out, right? They're not going to have arguments over whether or not it's a jagged shadow or a demon sitting on the fence.

286
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:55,320
 They're leaving. At this point, Todd Silver, as he's getting up, he actually gets attacked by this thing.

287
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:01,320
 He is picked up and thrown through the air and crashes into a tree.

288
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:07,320
 Whoa, okay guys, we really should have left. I know we really should have left when I heard that laughing.

289
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:13,320
 I don't know why we stood around for that to happen. Todd Silver looks down and there's four claw marks on his pants.

290
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:19,320
 No! Oh man, my mom's totally going to kill me. She just bought me these the other day, these ninja pants.

291
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:26,320
 Now they all get in the car and they're leaving behind Devil's Hopyard. They all understand something supernatural happened there.

292
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:34,320
 Sean Sear, he was one of the kids in the car, he's 18 years old. He's sitting there and he goes, "We need to go to my pastor's house. We need to go to my pastor's house."

293
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:46,320
 And they're like, "What?" And he's like, "We need to go to my pastor's house. We can't go home. You just can't go home. Something, what we experienced, we need to be blessed now."

294
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:53,320
 Everyone's like, "Why are you talking about it? What did you see Sean?" Sean said, "Nothing."

295
00:21:53,320 --> 00:22:03,320
 Sean said he would not, not that he couldn't, that he would not describe what he saw at Devil's Hopyard. He wouldn't. He flat out refused.

296
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:11,320
 He goes, "But we are not going home. You're not driving around at five different houses and dropping us off and you can go home and play Nintendo 64.

297
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:19,320
 But you are taking us to my minister's house, Reverend Bowser, because this isn't over. 2 a.m. they show up at the house.

298
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:25,320
 The two men outside the house is Todd Silver and Sean Sear. The other three guys are sitting in the car.

299
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:31,320
 Reverend Bowser opens up the door and these two guys start blabbering about. "Demons again picked up. Oh my God, look at my pants. Oh dude, you won't believe what happened."

300
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:37,320
 Sean Sear's like, "You got it. I think it's still with us. I think this demon's still with us. You got to take care of us."

301
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:44,320
 And Reverend Bowser basically does the only thing someone can do when he's confronted by two ninjas and three more in the car.

302
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:51,320
 He goes, "Yeah, yeah. Wait right here. I'm going to go get my blessing tools. I'm going to go do my blessing stuff."

303
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:59,320
 He shuts the door, calls the cops and says, "Hey man, it's 2 a.m. I got these kids outside."

304
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:06,320
 They're not wearing masks, but everything else about them is ninja related. And one of them has some ripped pants, which is kind of bizarre,

305
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,320
 but they're talking about demons and stuff like that. Cops roll up.

306
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:19,320
 And the dudes in the car did have swords. This was their inventory. They had a 38 inch samurai sword, three knives, a club, four bats,

307
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:25,320
 dark colored clothing and masks. The cops are talking to the guys in the car. Sean and Todd are out the door.

308
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:31,320
 The minister comes back and he's like, "Listen, you guys just need to calm down. This is super weird, so I did call the cops,

309
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:38,320
 but everything's fine." And at that point the cop comes up to talk to Todd and Sean at the door with the minister.

310
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:43,320
 The cop goes, "Hey, I need to see your guys ID." That's standard procedure, right? I've been pulled over 100 times.

311
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,320
 I've had my ID popped 100 times. It's just standard procedure.

312
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:55,320
 Sean starts to shake and then starts to resist the officers' commands.

313
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,320
 Now, I don't know if they both took a position and then it was ninja versus cop training.

314
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:06,320
 There was something dope like that. It was probably just two people kind of pushing each other, but there was definitely a scuffle.

315
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:12,320
 Todd's trying to break Sean and the police officer up. "Guys, guys, what are you doing? What are you doing? No, he's doing a flying jump kick."

316
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,320
 "Why? It's super dramatic." Well, just pretend it was, right?

317
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:23,320
 But it doesn't matter whether or not it was on the level of Enter the Dragon or it was just a guy getting pushed and then pushing another person,

318
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:30,320
 because Sean ends up collapsing. Everyone gets arrested, right? Even Sean is just laying there.

319
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,320
 Sean is having a diabetic fit, like low blood sugar or something like that.

320
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:42,320
 That's why he began shaking in the beginning and maybe diabetics like fighting with police. I don't know.

321
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:48,320
 But it had complications due to diabetes is what it was called. He's treated for that.

322
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:57,320
 "Cops arrest everyone." Todd and Sean are charged with interfering with the police and all the friends were charged with breach of peace and carrying dangerous weapons.

323
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:04,320
 Now, like I said, this happened back in 1999. It was in the newspaper. It was in the current, which is the newspaper out in Connecticut.

324
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,320
 It's all in the show notes. So I don't know. I don't think these guys actually did any hard time for it.

325
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,320
 I don't know if these guys are still in jail right now just waiting for their cat-delivered heroine.

326
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:19,320
 Probably not. These charges most likely probably got dropped on some level or another.

327
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,320
 I don't know if Sean's been cured of his diabetes or if it's still something he has to deal with.

328
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:30,320
 But there's an interesting footnote to this whole story. Sean starts scuffling with the cop. Let's go back to that part.

329
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,320
 Sean's shaking. He starts scuffling with the cop. He collapses.

330
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:41,320
 And that's all kind of chalked up to him having an issue with low blood sugar and shaking and all that stuff.

331
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,320
 Fighting with the cop again, maybe that's a normal diabetes symptom.

332
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:51,320
 But afterwards, the friends were like, "Sean, why in the world did you think it would be a good idea to take on that cop?

333
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:57,320
 Why in the world after everything that had happened, everything, we're just going to check our IDs? Why'd you start fighting with the cops?"

334
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,320
 And Sean looks over at him and goes, "That's what I saw."

335
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:07,320
 And they're like, "What?" He's like, "When we were at Devil's Hopyard, remember I didn't tell anyone what I saw?

336
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:12,320
 I saw this thing. Saw this thing."

337
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:18,320
 And when the officer approached us at the doorstep, he became that thing.

338
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:24,320
 That wasn't a cop that came to that doorstep. That was a demon.

339
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:32,320
 It's possible that Sean was starting to have some sort of complications due to low blood sugar and hallucinating.

340
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:38,320
 I don't know if that's a symptom of diabetes, but a skeptic could say he was a low blood sugar, high adrenaline event.

341
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,320
 All this stuff he's seen stuff goes up on this cop.

342
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,320
 But here's another more chilling way. We'll end it like this.

343
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,320
 Sean was insistent that it wasn't over yet, that they had to get blessed by the minister.

344
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:58,320
 Couldn't just drop him off at home. This thing was loose. They had to get blessed by the minister.

345
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,320
 So when they go to the minister's house, what doesn't happen?

346
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,320
 They don't get blessed.

347
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:10,320
 What if Sean was right? And this thing did follow them out of the park.

348
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:16,320
 "Leave now or you'll join us forever," is what the voice said at the park.

349
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,320
 What would be the point of taking over an 18-year-old pretend ninja?

350
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,320
 The minister himself would have protections from such possessions.

351
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:33,320
 But if a patrol unit, a cop car coming about to do his duty, now THAT is someone that a demon could have a lot of fun possessing.

352
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:39,320
 By the time the police officer walks up to Sean and Todd, it's already almost in full possession.

353
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:45,320
 This demon is now free and in the body of a law enforcement officer.

354
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:51,320
 And the only one who knows is Sean and his four friends.

355
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:58,320
 They were training to be ninjas, but instead they found themselves on the front line of a supernatural invasion.

356
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,320
 So the next time you're driving through town, you see those red and blue lights behind you,

357
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,320
 you know you haven't broken any traffic laws, but you pull over.

358
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,320
 It's weird because the cop car behind you looks older.

359
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,320
 It doesn't even look like one from this decade.

360
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:20,320
 But the lights keep flashing and the officer walks up to the driver's side of the car, flashlight blinding you.

361
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,320
 You can't really see who it is.

362
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,320
 You can't see that the uniform is older.

363
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,320
 You can't see that the badge is from a different state.

364
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,320
 But as that officer asks you for your driver's license,

365
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:38,320
 you have to wonder, is he pulling you over because he thought you were speeding?

366
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:45,320
 Or is he pulling you over because he's looking for a fresh body for one of his demonic friends?

367
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,320
