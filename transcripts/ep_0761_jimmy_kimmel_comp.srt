1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
 A woman who loves horror movies so much, she decided to star in one.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:11,440
 Are you smart enough to avoid stranger danger?

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,120
 And then we meet a man who claims if you can find an episode of Good Morning America that

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:22,440
 aired in the year 2017, you could overthrow the reptilians who currently rule the world

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,440
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:34,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,800
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,800
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,320
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,560
 I hope you guys are having lots of fun and I mean that all the time.

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,880
 I really do hope you guys are doing awesome.

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,120
 First off, coming into Dead Rabbit Command is someone that I know is awesome.

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,280
 Walking in, one of our newest Patreon supporters, give it up for Chris Padmos.

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,480
 Everyone give a round of applause to Chris Padmos, a little bow, a little curtsy if you

15
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,480
 have a skirt on.

16
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,840
 Chris, you're going to be our captain or pilot of this episode.

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,720
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it.

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,960
 Just help spread the word about the show.

19
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,680
 Really, really helps out a lot.

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,920
 Chris, are you ready to do this?

21
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,360
 Chris, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

22
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,240
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,680
 We are headed all the way out to Sydney, Australia.

24
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,520
 The reason why we're in Australia, specifically going to St. Clair, that's in Sydney, Australia,

25
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,520
 is 2019.

26
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,400
 And then we're going to meet a woman.

27
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,840
 Her name's Rita Calamari.

28
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,120
 She's 57 years old and life is going okay, but she has a bit of a problem with her adult

29
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,760
 daughter, Jessica.

30
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,280
 Jessica's 25 years old and she is obsessed with horror movies.

31
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,240
 Man, I do love myself a good horror movie.

32
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,400
 Love horror movies.

33
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,000
 But there's a difference between like, I will go out of my way to watch a horror movie.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 I will.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,920
 But I've never done this.

36
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,040
 I've never done this and this is what I find so interesting because I'm obsessed with horror

37
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,400
 movies so there is a bit of a bond between me and Jessica, but she takes it a little

38
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,400
 too far.

39
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,280
 One, she's obsessed with horror movies.

40
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,120
 Specifically she watches the Texas Chancell massacre movies over and over again.

41
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,120
 And that's a mixed bag.

42
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,680
 There's some really good ones.

43
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,680
 A new beginning.

44
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,680
 It was fantastic.

45
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,680
 Now, what she, and she watches the Jeepers Creepers movies over and over again.

46
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,160
 Those were less good and they were made by Known Pedophile, which makes them unwatchable

47
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,560
 in my book.

48
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,760
 And so, Jessica is watching these horror movies.

49
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,920
 I love horror movies.

50
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,840
 She loves horror movies.

51
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,160
 But she is threatening to murder her family.

52
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,680
 I mean, I did that once on that one Thanksgiving.

53
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,840
 She is constantly threatening to kill her family members and that was alarming.

54
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,120
 But then, they weren't reporting her to the cops because she's just like, why I ought

55
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,120
 to?

56
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,200
 She's like holding a butcher knife and stripping with chicken blood.

57
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,120
 They're like, "Ah, she was threatening to kill the family but the family wasn't calling

58
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,120
 the cops."

59
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,000
 She then started calling random people.

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,880
 She would just pick up the phone, dial a random number and when someone picked up, she would

61
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,240
 threaten to cut their heads off.

62
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,720
 So that's alarming.

63
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,040
 That's the last thing you expect.

64
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,840
 And your phone reachers are like, "Oh, I hope this isn't some salesman.

65
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,920
 I hope this isn't someone who's going to take up a bunch of my time trying to get me to

66
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,920
 change my cable provider."

67
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,440
 And it's some woman saying, "I know where you live.

68
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,040
 I'm going to chop your head off."

69
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:24,480
 You're like, "Ah, she did that 100 times a day constantly."

70
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,160
 So those people are calling the cops.

71
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,160
 I don't think it was the same person over and over again because she was dialing the

72
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,160
 number randomly.

73
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,160
 But I'm sure she got.

74
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,760
 She's doing this 100 times a day.

75
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,240
 I'm sure she at least a couple times got the same person.

76
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,440
 They're like, "Ah, now this is not a job again.

77
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,640
 Trying to watch Jeopardy."

78
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,400
 So the cops are now like, "You can't do this, right?

79
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,400
 You can't do this."

80
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,320
 But they're aware that she has some mental issues.

81
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,720
 I don't really think you can lock people up for that.

82
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,840
 Well, I guess it is threatening people, but they knew that she had some issues.

83
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,000
 You know, what are you going to do?

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,720
 The police are a little worried about it.

85
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,320
 The family is worried about it.

86
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:07,000
 But the mom, Rita, is like, "I can take care of this.

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 I can take care of this."

88
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,440
 So she goes to where you would go, right?

89
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,240
 When you need professional help, your child has some mental issues.

90
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,800
 But they're watching Jeepers Creepers over and over again.

91
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,560
 She contacts a medium.

92
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,240
 She contacts a she-wolf medium, a she-wolf half-linked spirit who can communicate with

93
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,520
 the dead.

94
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,800
 She says, "Your daughter is possessed by a demon.

95
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,240
 And for $3,600, I can exercise the demon out of your daughter."

96
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,120
 And Rita goes, "Well, you know, that's a lot of money.

97
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,040
 But why don't I make it stabbed in the back anytime, anywhere?"

98
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,080
 So she pays like half up front.

99
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,480
 Half up front, the other half, when I see a demon leave my daughter's body.

100
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,400
 And the she-wolf medium gets the money and then shocker, right?

101
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,320
 The most unbelievable part of the story, it was a fraud.

102
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,320
 She didn't do any...

103
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,240
 Can you believe that?

104
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,400
 I know, I'm shocked.

105
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,080
 The paranormal community, we're all aghast that there's one person who's a fraud in this

106
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,680
 entire community, ripped her off $1,800, did nothing.

107
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:22,360
 July 20th, 2019 is when this all comes to a head.

108
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,920
 The police are called to this house.

109
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,720
 They've been to this residence before.

110
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,280
 They know it's gonna have something to do with Jessica.

111
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,680
 And as their police cruisers are driving out the road, do, do, do, do, do, they see their

112
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,400
 red and blue lights illuminating the front yard of Jessica's house?

113
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,600
 And they see her running around the yard.

114
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,520
 They're like, "Great, it's a 101.

115
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,280
 Jessica, Jessica is running counterclockwise in the yard, over."

116
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,400
 And they get out of their patrol cars and they're walking up and they see Jessica running

117
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,560
 around and then they see her.

118
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,080
 She's holding Rita's decapitated head.

119
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,640
 When the police are walking up to her, she then shot puts her mom's head through the

120
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,920
 air and it lands in her neighbor's yard and kind of rolls for a bit.

121
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,360
 And then she just sits there and points to the head, standing there silently pointing

122
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,720
 at the head.

123
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,160
 When the police went into the house, they found the rest of Rita.

124
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:28,280
 She had been stabbed 85 times.

125
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:36,160
 And at one point, the knife broke and Jessica got up and got another knife and continued

126
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,040
 to stab her mom again.

127
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,200
 They found that happened a couple of times.

128
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:46,880
 There were a few broken knife blades in Rita's body and she kept getting new knives so she

129
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,160
 can continue stabbing her mom.

130
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,920
 What finally prompted her to go insane and kill her mom?

131
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,160
 Well, she was insane before that.

132
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:03,160
 But what prompted her to just completely lose it at that time?

133
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:09,680
 Everything else that had gone on, why did she finally snap and kill her mother?

134
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,040
 Because her mother realized something that day.

135
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,760
 Jessica is dangerous.

136
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,560
 I have to take her to a mental hospital.

137
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:25,000
 And when she told her daughter that they should go to the hospital to take care of her, her

138
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,440
 daughter murdered her.

139
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:35,440
 When she finally realized how dangerous Jessica was, it literally was too late.

140
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,640
 Terrifying story coming out of Australia.

141
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:43,280
 And again, it's one of those stories that's, it's one of the easiest stories to happen,

142
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,280
 right?

143
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,720
 Somebody loses track of reality and snaps.

144
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,880
 And she obviously had this long descent.

145
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,120
 Sometimes it can be someone doing too many drugs.

146
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,600
 Sometimes it can be someone who has a history of mental illness or someone.

147
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,080
 The scariest ones are the people who have no struggles at all and just snap.

148
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,880
 Because if it can happen to them, it can happen to the rest of us, right?

149
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,880
 So just a terrifying story about a mother and a daughter, the mother hoping till the

150
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:17,560
 end that she could save her daughter, but the daughter had other plans.

151
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,560
 Creepy, creepy story.

152
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,280
 She actually was found guilty of manslaughter and she'll be sentenced.

153
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,640
 I wonder if she's been sentenced yet?

154
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,240
 I have this story ready to go for a while.

155
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,240
 Let's take a look.

156
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,080
 Yeah, I typed this story up a while ago and I'd been waiting, kind of putting it off,

157
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,000
 but I liked it.

158
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,200
 21 years.

159
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,160
 She got a 21 year sentence.

160
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:47,160
 It's interesting when you look, I forgot about her horribly distended face.

161
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,400
 I'll have to put a picture.

162
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,960
 She looks like a muppet from the dark crystal.

163
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,760
 And it's not her fault, right?

164
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:05,560
 But she looks like HR Puffinstaff's niece.

165
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:11,960
 And I find that odd because her face almost looks inhuman.

166
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:16,280
 Right now, there's someone listening to this podcast and they're like, "Jason, it clearly

167
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,280
 looks like me."

168
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,040
 No, there's some, you can even have someone who looks similar to her.

169
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,440
 I'm putting the picture up.

170
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,680
 I'm going to put the picture up.

171
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,600
 You can obviously have someone that just popped up out of nowhere if you're watching the YouTube

172
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
 channel.

173
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,360
 People, I mean, that looks photoshopped.

174
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,360
 That looks photoshopped.

175
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,920
 It doesn't look human.

176
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,000
 The reason why I'm bringing that up isn't because I'm like, "Ew, gross, she's ugly."

177
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,200
 Because I'm not necessarily saying she's ugly.

178
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,000
 She just doesn't look like a person who belongs to the human race.

179
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,160
 But I'm wondering, like, if it's like demonic possession.

180
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,680
 You see what I mean?

181
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,680
 Is there a demon captured in this photo?

182
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,680
 Because there's other photos.

183
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,320
 She doesn't look that terrible.

184
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,760
 It's, um, yeah, creepy.

185
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,040
 Is that another picture of her?

186
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,520
 Yeah, she's just kind of weird looking.

187
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:16,040
 Again, sorry if you've already written your Jessica Calamari/fiction with you and her,

188
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,040
 but yeah, she looks weird.

189
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:23,120
 Anyways, Chris, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the oars to the Dead Rabbit Robo.

190
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,760
 We're leaving behind St. Clair, Sydney, Australia.

191
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:32,080
 We're going to row all the way out to Roseville, California.

192
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,080
 Splash!

193
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,080
 Splash!

194
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:40,320
 Row in our way over there, Chris, the courageous captain, making sure we safely get across

195
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,040
 the high seas.

196
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:50,600
 This story takes place around 2001 in the affluent suburb of Roseville, California.

197
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
 It's up in Northern California.

198
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,040
 You have to live in around that area.

199
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,040
 I never live in Roseville.

200
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,160
 It's a bunch of preppies, but I live in Citrus Heights and North Islands and Orangeville

201
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,160
 and all that stuff.

202
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,600
 But anyways, I've done a ton of episodes on that.

203
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,680
 The entire town is cursed and haunted.

204
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:11,160
 This story, Roseville, California, around the year 2001, there's a five-year-old kid walking

205
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:17,080
 down the street and then all of a sudden, a van pulls up next to the child.

206
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,120
 The window rolls down.

207
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,600
 When a young man sticks his hat out of the window and goes, "Hey, would you like some

208
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
 candy?"

209
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,040
 "I got candy in my van.

210
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,120
 Would you like to get in the van?"

211
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,760
 And the kid goes, "Candy?

212
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,760
 Sure!

213
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,240
 That sounds fantastic!"

214
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,120
 And then their memory goes blank.

215
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,120
 This was posted online by someone known as SpecificPurpose7419.

216
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:50,680
 And they were saying, "I have this clear memory of a van pulling up when I was about five years

217
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,840
 old candy in the van.

218
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,200
 Typical stranger danger thing and I got in the van and I don't remember anything that

219
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,720
 happened after that.

220
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,680
 But my family does.

221
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,800
 So what happened was at some point I brought up this memory.

222
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,680
 Hey, because I remember a stranger pulling over and getting me in the van and my dad goes,

223
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,920
 "Oh dude, you remember that?

224
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,160
 Oh, that was so long ago."

225
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,480
 And this guy will call him Steven if that's Israeli and he's just got Steven.

226
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,840
 "Well, what do you mean?

227
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,520
 You remember me getting kidnapped?"

228
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,520
 And then I forgot.

229
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,040
 Dad goes, "No, no, no, that's not what happened.

230
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,240
 You weren't kidnapped."

231
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:31,280
 You see, what happened was you and your siblings were a bunch of dummies and you were the most

232
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,280
 gollible of all.

233
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,720
 And me and your mom were afraid that you were going to get kidnapped.

234
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,400
 So we wanted to scare you straight.

235
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,680
 So we got a friend, a family friend that you didn't know and we had him pull up in the

236
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,240
 van and say, "Would you like some candy?"

237
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,440
 And you got in the van.

238
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,160
 And then it was all just a stage thing.

239
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,160
 It never happened.

240
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,680
 It wasn't a real kidnapping.

241
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,480
 It was fake kidnapping.

242
00:12:52,480 --> 00:13:00,560
 And Steven's thought about this answer for years and it doesn't make sense to him.

243
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:08,400
 He explains, "If my dad is telling the truth, why do I only remember the beginning?"

244
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,520
 I'm sure I'm five and a little kid, but why wouldn't I?

245
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,360
 And at that point, I don't feel like I'm in trouble.

246
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,880
 I'm getting candy.

247
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,080
 You figure the most traumatizing part would be the back of the van opening up and my

248
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:25,240
 dad and my mom saying and they're yelling at me because I was dumb enough to get in

249
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,960
 a car if someone I didn't know.

250
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:34,720
 Why do I only remember the first part and not the second part?

251
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,760
 It's written in a way that I think Steven is intimating that they don't really believe

252
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,840
 the father's version of events.

253
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,320
 And I, at least that's the read I get from it.

254
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:55,600
 Because the, you're thinking, I really got kidnapped and I completely blinked it out

255
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,800
 of my mind because I was a kid and my parents, when they got me back, they just said, "We're

256
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,160
 never going to talk about this."

257
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,680
 Law enforcement could have even said, "Listen, the kid's young enough.

258
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,120
 They may not remember this.

259
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,120
 Let's not talk about it."

260
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,480
 But I guess the police, they're like, "What about a trial?"

261
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,480
 And the cop's like, "Shhh."

262
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,480
 No.

263
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,040
 No, we don't want a trial.

264
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,520
 We don't want a trial.

265
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,280
 I guess that doesn't wash, but the parents could have said, "You know what?

266
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,520
 We're just not going to talk about it."

267
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,200
 It really happened, but we're not going to talk about it if he ever asked us to pretend

268
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,200
 it didn't happen.

269
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,440
 Because people do go through traumatic stuff as kids and don't remember it.

270
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,720
 Or they've blanked it out in some way.

271
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,600
 I mean, on the one hand, if your kid gets kidnapped, you don't want them to forget the

272
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,400
 experience so they don't get kidnapped again.

273
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,000
 But on the other hand, you don't want to put a giant poster of the kidnapper on the kid's

274
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,400
 bedroom ceiling.

275
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,120
 And I'm still out there, his voice boxes.

276
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,960
 You get him to record all of his best kidnapping sayings.

277
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,960
 Boo!

278
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,960
 I'm right behind you.

279
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,400
 They put all these voice boxes all over the house.

280
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:10,880
 Kids are like, "Oh, there's a gray area between those two."

281
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,880
 Never acknowledging that it happened.

282
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,560
 And then continuing the kidnapper's work while he's in prison.

283
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,240
 There's a huge gray area there.

284
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,880
 But I find, and so a bunch of people responded to this and they said, "Actually, there was

285
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:29,480
 a big wave of fake stranger danger stuff, dateline NBCs, dunce, things like that, Oprah

286
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,640
 did things like that."

287
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,920
 Other people said, "That happened to me."

288
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,920
 It's not unusual.

289
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,920
 I could see parents doing that.

290
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,800
 I think it would be a funny, practical joke.

291
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,560
 You're like, "Take them out, sight city limits.

292
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,120
 Let's see how long we can get this."

293
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,120
 They're on radio.

294
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,120
 You're like, "Just keep on driving.

295
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,280
 I want to see how long I can terrify my child."

296
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,280
 There's two ways to read this.

297
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,600
 One, this kid's dad was hilarious, right?

298
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,760
 This kid's dad not only was hilarious enough to get started in the first place, but then

299
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,920
 laugh about it years later when the kids all traumatized me like, "Uh, I have this weird

300
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,840
 memory I can't make out."

301
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:06,160
 I think it was kidnapped and then the dad laughing at him.

302
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,720
 Or, something super traumatizing happened to him and the entire family's decided to

303
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,720
 cover it up.

304
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,720
 That's creepy because there's family secrets where the family's like all together and they're

305
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,960
 like, "Thicker thin will never say where the gold is buried."

306
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,760
 Then, there's the thicker thin will never tell Steven where the gold is buried.

307
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,600
 You're a member of the family and if you're being boxed out from that, there's a family

308
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,800
 secret about you that you don't know of.

309
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,000
 That's some like, V.C. Andrews type stuff.

310
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,760
 So a creepy, creepy story.

311
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,560
 It's either very funny or the family's keeping a horrific event from them.

312
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:52,000
 I guess the question is, if that happened to you when you were super young, you get kidnapped

313
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,660
 and horrible stuff happens, would you want to know?

314
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,560
 Or would you not want to know?

315
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,720
 Yeah, it would be interesting.

316
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,480
 They go, "No, it's so traumatizing.

317
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,080
 If we started telling you about it, you're going to have all these horrible nightmares

318
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,360
 and stuff like that."

319
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,400
 A true mystery to us, a curious tale.

320
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:15,720
 But to this person, it's the most important conspiracy they may ever have to unravel.

321
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,240
 Very, very interesting story.

322
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,440
 Chris, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Carpentercopter.

323
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,680
 We are leaving behind Roseville, California.

324
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:30,000
 You're headed all the way out to Hollywood.

325
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,920
 [imitates carpenter]

326
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:42,160
 Yesterday we did an episode about whether or not the show, the secret of Skinwalker Ranch,

327
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:48,000
 is cursed by simply watching the show or knowing someone watching the show, could you go insane?

328
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Interesting.

329
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,800
 I really like that episode.

330
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,400
 But what if television couldn't be used to just spread a spell?

331
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,760
 What if it could be used to actually overcome the evil that infests this world?

332
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,240
 Well, that's what we're going to be talking about today.

333
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,240
 We're going to be talking about someone who actually believes they have discovered the

334
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,800
 key to destroying the reptilian control of this planet.

335
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:18,120
 The reason why we're at Hollywood is we're about to watch a taping of the Jimmy Kimmel

336
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,120
 show and the audience is like, "Yeah, woo, Jimmy Kimmel.

337
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,120
 Yay!"

338
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,920
 And some guys I call, I thought this was the Jimmy Fallon show.

339
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,560
 Half the audience gets up and leaves.

340
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,120
 So there's a lot of space for us to spread out, right?

341
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,880
 We're sitting here.

342
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,160
 And a couple of us are still clapping.

343
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,360
 Jimmy Kimmel comes out on stage and he's like, "Hey, everyone, welcome back to the Jimmy

344
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,880
 Killin' Kimmel Show or whatever it's called.

345
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,800
 I don't know if it's like late night with Jimmy or whatever."

346
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,720
 He's doing all that stuff.

347
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,560
 And in the back of the theater, we see a man.

348
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,160
 He's kind of like, has a hat on and a trench coat.

349
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,640
 We're like, "That looks super suspicious."

350
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,400
 He's kind of like, his eyes are shifty.

351
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:57,720
 And that man, I guess I'm even super-ail intent about saying that he's going to show up with

352
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,080
 the Jimmy Kimmel Show and do anything crazy, but that man is actually trying to expose

353
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,600
 the reptilian agenda.

354
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:10,840
 So there's a series of posts online about, there's a lost episode of Good Morning America.

355
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:16,800
 This was the episode that aired on April 22nd, 2017.

356
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,400
 And this was written by a user known as JB Stout 7.

357
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,960
 He was watching Good Morning America on April 22nd, 2017.

358
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,040
 And so I'm going to let his words paint this picture for us.

359
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,320
 He's watching it with his mom.

360
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,920
 Both of them were watching Good Morning America.

361
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,720
 "I remember watching the episodes that day.

362
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,120
 It was very, very odd.

363
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,480
 And I did see the weird beans.

364
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,320
 That meme is pronouncing the word like human beans.

365
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,720
 He didn't see a bunch of pinto beans walking back.

366
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,120
 And I did see the weird beans walking around in the background.

367
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,760
 The clips of lizards.

368
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:05,920
 Them talking about trying to figure out what was going on.

369
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,040
 I remember Harry Styles performing.

370
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,600
 Would you really remember who the musical guest was if you were watching television

371
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,640
 and sort of reptilians?

372
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,680
 Real life reptilians are walking in the background of Good Morning America.

373
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,200
 And they're like, "What's going on?"

374
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,800
 "I don't know.

375
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,240
 The holographic matrix must be offline again.

376
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,520
 You numbschool."

377
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,080
 And then he's like, "Oh, that's fascinating.

378
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,080
 Alien life is real."

379
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,640
 But I wonder who the musical guest is.

380
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,960
 Apparently Harry Styles performed that day on Good Morning America.

381
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,640
 And then so you have Harry Styles.

382
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,960
 You have Lizardmen.

383
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:47,160
 And then he also goes on to say, "You see at some point a bald man in a silver jumpsuit

384
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,120
 walk around in the background."

385
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,640
 So I'm assuming that's either a literal man who's bald, who's wearing like a silver jumpsuit,

386
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,640
 or supposed to maybe be an alien, a space alien with a bald head in the silver jumpsuit.

387
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,640
 I don't know.

388
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,640
 But anyway, so that happened on April 22nd, 2017.

389
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:10,720
 Now according to JB Stout, that video is the only one, the only episode of Good Morning

390
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,840
 America that is not available on Discovery Plus.

391
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,080
 Now I was not able to fact check that.

392
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:21,520
 It would have cost me $7.99 a month to fact check that.

393
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,160
 And I thought about doing the free weekly trial.

394
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,120
 If you use the subscriber code DeadRabbitRadio, you get 20% off.

395
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,680
 But I thought even if I do sign up for this free trial for $4.99 and you cancel within

396
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,360
 seven days and you get your money back, I might find that that episode's not there, but

397
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:41,880
 I'd have to go and see if these episodes, if there are other episodes missing, right?

398
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,520
 If it literally is the only episode that's not streaming on Discovery Plus, that would

399
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,520
 be shocking.

400
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,200
 I'm sure there are other episodes missing.

401
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,200
 And this is why.

402
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,600
 You could, Jason, how can you be so sure?

403
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,360
 You gotta fact check this guy.

404
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,280
 He does make another statement.

405
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:03,920
 He says that Jimmy Kimmel and Ellen DeGeneres were the most searched Google terms on April

406
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,840
 22nd, 2017.

407
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,520
 And it was because people knew something was up.

408
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,880
 So they all Googled Ellen DeGeneres.

409
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,760
 Ellen DeGeneres, Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Kimmel.

410
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,760
 They were trying to figure out what they saw.

411
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,960
 I could fact check that.

412
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,360
 I looked into Google trend history.

413
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,120
 Those were not, it was some like football teams.

414
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,880
 And when I say football, I mean soccer.

415
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,880
 I don't even know why.

416
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,880
 I don't even know why I misspoke.

417
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,840
 That was like the number one trending topic in the US.

418
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,840
 There's some other stuff.

419
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,120
 People on Ellen DeGeneres were not in that top 10.

420
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,520
 They definitely weren't number one.

421
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,480
 But you're like, Jason, wait a second.

422
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,480
 Wait a second.

423
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,480
 So let me get this straight.

424
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,480
 Good morning, America.

425
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:48,120
 Here's an episode about reptilians and bald people featuring hairy styles.

426
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,280
 What does any of that have to do with Ellen DeGeneres or Jimmy Kimmel?

427
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,280
 Why are we in Hollywood?

428
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,720
 Why do you force me to watch the Jimmy Kimmel show?

429
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,620
 Okay, so here's the timeline.

430
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,620
 This is how it all ties together.

431
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,120
 I'm not saying that it's logical.

432
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,440
 I'm not saying that it makes any sense or that it's true, but April 21, 2017, Jimmy

433
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,560
 Kimmel's son was born.

434
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,760
 Son was born with a little congenital heart defect, but he's okay.

435
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,240
 Totally fine, but did have to undergo surgeries.

436
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:19,240
 JB Stout believes that was some sort of coverup that his baby was totally fine.

437
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,120
 What really happened was the baby was born totally fine.

438
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:29,720
 A telepath showed up on the set of the Jimmy Kimmel show and started to affect Jimmy Kimmel

439
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,200
 and started to mess with the Ellen DeGeneres show.

440
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,720
 And so people who were watching their shows being like, oh, I can feel the words in my

441
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,720
 head.

442
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,720
 They're coming right at me and the telepath was affecting.

443
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,920
 This is all happening on April 22.

444
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,640
 The telepath was also affecting good morning America, and that's why the reptilians were

445
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,940
 visible to us.

446
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,800
 So there's no physical evidence if you watch the Jimmy Kimmel show on April 22, 2017, or

447
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,440
 the Ellen DeGeneres show on April 22, 2017.

448
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,760
 But if you watch the Good Morning America segment that day, you will see the reptilians.

449
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:09,480
 This telepath is starting to pierce through the aliens' communication, and he believes

450
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,240
 that reptilians control the media.

451
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,240
 So this telepath, is the telepath flexing?

452
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,740
 Is the telepath showing the reptilians what it's capable of?

453
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:22,260
 Is the telepath actually trying to disrupt these segments?

454
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,260
 Is the telepath Jimmy Kimmel's son?

455
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,340
 I mean, I don't know.

456
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:31,980
 It doesn't really explain where the telepath comes from.

457
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,900
 Or the motives of the telepath.

458
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:41,140
 But that is this conspiracy theory right now, the Jimmy Kimmel conspiracy theory, that there's

459
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:46,440
 a telepath that is maybe at war with the reptilians, maybe in league with the reptilians, we don't

460
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,440
 know.

461
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:53,440
 But if you can find the copy of Good Morning America for April 22, 2017, you may be able

462
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:59,640
 to prove once and for all that reptilians are slowly taking over the planet.

463
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,280
 Now yesterday's episode, we ended it up by saying if you look at what we know in the

464
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,600
 lore, the conspiracy theory makes sense.

465
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,240
 The conspiracy theory was the television show, The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch on History

466
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,340
 Channel is cursing its viewers.

467
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:19,980
 If you break it down to its components, that is believable in the paranormal world.

468
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,220
 This is a conspiracy theory.

469
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,140
 I think this is a great companion piece to that.

470
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:28,340
 Because you can break it down its components and it's the same thing.

471
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:34,700
 Reptilians, people controlling the media, telepathy, mind control, government censoring stuff,

472
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,540
 having to disappear, lost media.

473
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:42,680
 All this stuff, it's components, the Hollywood conspiracies, it's components we can break

474
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,160
 down as part of the lore.

475
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:48,360
 But this conspiracy theory is different.

476
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:56,960
 This user, their previous posts show someone in need.

477
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:04,840
 They are, they have several posts online about being plagued by intrusive thoughts.

478
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,080
 Thoughts that aren't their own.

479
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,900
 Thoughts one would assign to a telepath, maybe.

480
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:18,280
 They say they get lost in intrusive thoughts, disturbing sexual imagery, violent imagery

481
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,140
 popping in their head.

482
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:25,100
 They complain of racist thoughts, clouding their judgment.

483
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:30,980
 In a later post they start talking about hearing auditory hallucinations, they've gone beyond

484
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,420
 intrusive thoughts.

485
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:41,160
 And not only are they hearing auditory hallucinations, JV Stout is hearing auditory hallucinations

486
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,740
 speaking of damnation.

487
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,960
 You're wicked.

488
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,300
 You're going to hell.

489
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:55,160
 He closes that post out with quote, "I'm just worried that my mind is too far gone and there's

490
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:59,480
 nothing I can do to heal and get close to God."

491
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,040
 Unquote.

492
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:08,260
 So is this the story of a man who's gripped with intrusive thoughts and possibly other

493
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,660
 mental health issues?

494
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:17,060
 And he's projecting those thoughts out into the world, reshaping what he sees to be part

495
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:21,180
 of a broader conspiracy theory.

496
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:25,500
 But if you take this conspiracy theory and you break it into pieces, it's still the pieces

497
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:31,360
 themselves make sense, but the overall narrative doesn't.

498
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:37,140
 And because we know this man suffers from auditory hallucinations and intrusive thoughts,

499
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,600
 this conspiracy theory feels heartbreaking.

500
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:47,100
 It feels like we're reading the manifesto of a man who thinks he's cracked reality,

501
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:53,580
 but he's most likely in desperate need of help.

502
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,700
 There's a difference to it.

503
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,100
 There's almost a darkness to it.

504
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:03,640
 Reptilians and telepaths and all that stuff, sure that's feasible, but when it's crafted

505
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:11,440
 by a mind that's pleading for some sort of respite from the mental issues they're suffering,

506
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,480
 you can see that in the writing.

507
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:18,360
 You can see that in the theory itself.

508
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:24,400
 This is one of those conspiracy theories that it's more terrifying if it's not true.

509
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:31,100
 Because we can all imagine reptilians running around and telepaths fighting a secret war

510
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,780
 against them, and that all kind of comes with the territory.

511
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:41,620
 And if it's not true, it's really the story of a man, a real life human being who needs

512
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:46,060
 guidance and help in this world.

513
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:55,400
 And I'd rather live in an insane world than be insane and live in the real world.

514
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:01,680
 Live in a world that's turned its back on me.

515
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,160
 I would make up stories too.

516
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:12,560
 Because in that make-believe world I've constructed, at least people listen to me.

517
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:27,880
