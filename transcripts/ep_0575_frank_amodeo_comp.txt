 What would you do if someone magically appeared in front of you and gave you earth shattering news?
 And then we meet a man who believes it's his life mission
 To conquer the planet
 From an early age he set out with one goal
 To be a one-man Illuminati today on Dead Rabbit Radio
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. We got a ton of stuff to cover
 So we're gonna slide right into this first off. Let's give a shout out to our newest patreon supporter Devon
 Devon thank you so much for supporting the show. He's doing a little mock rain in the corner
 He's doing that dance since the year 1997 apparently but Devon's having a good old time doing that dance
 Devon you're gonna be our captain our pilot this episode if you can't support the patreon
 I totally understand just spread the word about the show that also really really helps out a lot
 But Devon when you're done doing the mock rain and he's still doing it
 He still has a couple more verses to go, but he's finally done
 I'm gonna toss you the keys to the Jason Jalabi drive us out to Brazil
 Driving down the long lonely highway that stretches all the way from America to Brazil is there one?
 Specifically we're going to Marisol. That's in Sao Paulo
 Brazil
 Also hit that little time travel button because we're going back to the year 1983. It's March 30th
 1983 and it's late at night and as we're driving down the road we come across the man
 He's not named in this so let's call him Gary Gary is a night watchman at his job and he's just doing his thing
 He's watching stuff. He's perfect for it. He has eyeballs. He's born to do this job
 He's watching everything and then right in front of him a
 Humanoid appears
 This creature with for lack of a better word. It's not necessarily an alien or a cryptid
 But this humanoid appears right in front of him has dark skin and red crinkly hair
 like that's kind of an odd combination begin with but
 Also the fact that he magically appeared in front of you
 And this stranger is standing right in front of Gary and says
 We have a kid
 Her name is Azalea
 you
 Figure disappears
 into a puff of smoke
 You don't see that often. You don't see that very often outside of a looney Tune cartoon person appears
 Disappears in a puff of smoke says we have a child together named Azalea. That's it. That's the whole story
 Now what's funny is that that story is
 More perplexing than so much other stuff we talk about on this show because if it had been a great alien if it had been a
 Ghost I've mentioned this before on the podcast. You have mythology. You can plug that into context
 You're like, oh here's a ghost I can do research and maybe the place used to be haunted or it's still haunted
 There's a ghost here
 But maybe someone tragically died here if it was an alien that would appear you go
 Oh human hybrid experiments like I must have been abducted at some point
 Just a dude showing up
 Saying hey, we have a kid together disappearing. That's way more perplexing
 There's no way to put that into the catalog of paranormal events
 The less context the more bizarre like where do you go from there? How would you ever research that?
 How would you deal with that?
 Like if an alien showed up and was like, oh, I abducted you like a long time ago. We had a baby together
 I'd want to see the baby
 Maybe hold it how weird it looked I'm like gross. Yeah, that's a gross little baby. They're like, but it's yours
 Don't you have an attachment to it? I'm like no super super gross, baby
 You could probably like explore it more but just some dude with crinkly red hair showing up
 You like what and the puff of smoke? I don't know why keep getting like fixated on the fact that there's just like someone saying
 We have a kid he had disappeared in a puff of smoke. That's super weird in and of itself
 No wonder why if a ghost can have a kid with a person we've covered stuff like that before with crazy women saying that ghosts have been
 Pregnated them, but they were nuts
 Outside of people being nuts. Could you have a ghost baby?
 could you have a if you can bang an alien and have a
 Alien baby and apparently you can bang this dude
 You can bang this dude if you want a kid named Azalea. Could you bang a ghost?
 Did you have a not talking about suck you by either like an actual ghost like some woman who died in the 1800s who looks kind of
 You know kind of hot and that old pioneer clothing and then like can you banger?
 That is the immortal question that is truly what every paranormal investigator really wants to know
 I don't care about orbs
 EVP meters nothing like that and I bang it can I have sex with a ghost and
 preferably like if it's preferably a living baby
 Which would be hilarious to watch a ghost walk around she's like I'm getting pregnant
 He's like a full-on little baby person that's totally solid inside of a ghost keeps falling out
 She's like, uh, this is gonna be a long nine months. He has to hold it in or
 Barring a real-life baby from a ghost and maybe the baby has like ghostly eyes
 Like the eyes are like a ghost blue
 Barring a human baby born out of a ghost
 Casper
 I want to if I'm gonna bang a ghost lady if she gives birth to Casper
 That'd be dope because Casper was pretty cool like I mean for what he was he was a bad cartoon
 But out of all that era of just like really cheesy cartoons you could kick it with Casper
 That is my that is my side to tracking from that
 Otherwise bizarre story. What would you do if someone just appeared in front of you and said they had a kid?
 Obviously in real life, you'd be like no we don't but if they magically could appear and disappear in a puff of smoke
 You'd kind of wonder if maybe at some point you had banged dude and you had a daughter and then what again?
 Super perplexing the less information the scarier really maybe someday he'll meet Azalea
 Devon let's put you in that carboner copter. We are going to fly on out to Florida
 Now Devon I chose Devon to be the pilot on this episode
 Because he has the military chops that are going to be needed to keep us safe during this episode
 So everyone gear up put on your BDUs get your guns cocked
 Make sure no teachers are putting bullets in backwards. That's yesterday's episode if you didn't hear that one all of our bullets are in the
 Right way we are flying out to Florida Devon's given us the a okay because he is bringing us now over the business a
 Frank Amodio
 It's a very unassuming business just sitting there
 You wouldn't even think anything of it as you're flying 15,000 feet over it
 You wouldn't think anything of it if you were walking into the front door, but this business is owned by a man who will someday
 Conquer the planet before we get started here. I got to give a shout out to two people first off the person who recommended this story to me
 Der Grob man on YouTube
 He recommended it to me about midnight the other night and I was up till about two to thirty reading this article
 Very very fascinating story. Thank you so much for sending it over and I want to give a shout out to the author of the article
 Matthew B Cox he wrote an article called its insanity the bizarre story of a bipolar
 Megalomaniacs insane plan for total world domination. That's not clickbait
 That's what we're gonna be talking about and Matthew did an amazing job and did a ton of interviews with this guy
 Wanted to give a tip of that to him most of the information I got is from his article
 I had other sources as well, but as far as all of the interviews and things like that Matthew did an amazing job
 Frank Amodio knew from childhood
 That he was destined to rule mankind
 Divinely destined. It's not just like he woke up one day and goes hey, I want to do that
 He's pointing at a globe someday. I'm gonna own that as a toddler
 These are stories that he told at least as a toddler. He walked away from his daycare
 I don't need you daycare you suck little toddler dudes walking out as little jammy jams. He walks into traffic
 You're like Jason this guy's supposed to rule the planet. He doesn't even know what traffic is
 Well, he is a toddler you would think he would die
 Because generally when toddlers walk into traffic, it's not good. It's not a happy ending
 Eventually a good Samaritan found him and ran over him a couple times like oh
 But don't he just ran over the footsie part of his pajamas didn't hit him take some drops him off at his parents house at age
 6 he was walking along the train tracks walking tight rope style on the train track and he's walking and then all of a sudden
 He hears a voice in his head saying get off the tracks
 So he got off the tracks and a train drove by almost killed him
 If you hadn't heard that voice in his head
 Or if you hadn't heard the sound of an 800 ton mechanical beast from behind him, I don't know if he was listening to Walkman
 I don't think the voice in your head is really what you need to listen to you need to listen to that
 Three years later so when he was nine he said that his aunt was like hey
 Frank you want to come hang out I forgot your name and looked over at my notes. Hey my favorite nephew
 Frank
 Why don't you come over my place and let's just like hang out do a bunch of stuff, you know like walk on train tracks
 We know you like that
 I got a lot of traffic by my house and Frank's like now I'm good because he actually hears a voice in his head saying don't go to your
 aunt's house tonight and
 Then the next morning his aunt was murdered and her body was found in a dumpster
 She'd been murdered in a fiance's best friend killed her
 So basically he was having these near misses and the fact that he was surviving these things
 meant that God was willing him towards a greater destiny and
 Also, he should probably get his hearing checked because he didn't hear a train coming and as he gets older
 He has a pretty varied life
 He was like going college double major doing all this stuff at one point the CIA was trying to recruit him
 But then his dad felt ill so a lot of this story makes you think that this guy is making this stuff up because we cover
 Blowhards all the time on this show, but early in life. He's telling me stories
 I got a skim over a bunch of the stuff because it's just like he was a lawyer and he was a guy
 It's very very fascinating story and you can read the article for more in-depth stuff
 But I want to kind of get to the meat of the conspiracy realm of it in college
 He comes up with a plan called capital Genesis
 Which is described basically as benevolent
 capitalist
 fascism the world would be run by
 Corporations and he would run the corporations he basically wanted to push out
 Governments and politicians and create a corporate structure that would rule the planet. He said quote by 2012
 I expect I'll have offices within one hour of every human alive
 Everywhere and the thing was is he was a good businessman
 He knew what he was doing, but he was also this is where we start to get an allegedly type of stuff
 But he was also really good at
 Hiding numbers from his time as an accountant. So he set up this is how his businesses worked he would
 Find businesses that were having financial trouble because he was a bankruptcy attorney by trade before he started this thing
 He would find companies that own a bunch of money to the IRS and then go to the IRS and say hey
 We'll set up a payment plan. We'll pay make these payments every month or every year however the plan was set up or
 I can gut it right now
 I can declare bankruptcy right now, and you'll never get the money and IRS is like yeah, yeah, yeah
 I mean we'd rather have some money later than no money now
 So they're working and while he's doing all this stuff
 He realizes that he can skim
 IRS money from the payroll tax of all these different corporations
 So he'd buy a company they'd pay payroll tax
 But he would take tax dollars from the payroll tax because the IRS is thinking they're gonna get paid in the future anyways
 It was this really weird financial scheme he had going on
 So not only was he getting money from the business as it was continuing to turn a profit because he's revitalizing it
 He was also getting extra money from all of these companies skimming a little bit out of their payroll
 Taxes because the thing is a dictator needs money
 So he wasn't just investing in businesses to help people out or to make short-term goals
 He was going to use this money to fund his plan of world domination
 This all kinds of starts to pick up around 2005. So first he's buying little firms here and there
 There's a little shop in Florida that needs some help. Here's some place in Saskatchewan that needs bigger investment
 He's building up this portfolio of money-making businesses. Then he starts to invest in tactical operations
 He was basically investing in security companies that were then being
 Contracted out by the US government to go do things in other countries that the US government didn't want to be tied to
 Snatching grab operations. You send some people over there. He sends six dudes twelve dudes
 Whatever it is, they'll grab a drug lord off the street grab a witness that the government wants
 Snatch up a terrorist take him back. So he wasn't just running a bunch of kinkos on the side
 He was actually starting to build a security
 Operation he buys a couple fighter jets. So right there right there. You should start getting alarm bells
 Sure, people do have private security concerns, but he starts buying fighter jets
 He starts to invest in a factory in Russia. He's going global. He invests in a factory in Russia
 He knows that he needs to be all over the planet if he wants to take over the planet
 He's going he's very successful
 He gets this reputation of taking businesses that otherwise would fail and revitalizing them
 Sure, he's skimming a little off of the back end, but nobody really knows that and even the people who work with him
 Some people kind of knew what he was doing
 Everybody knew that he had bigger ambitions and I should touch on this as well. I touched on it in the headline
 He is bipolar. He's manic depressive
 So the people at his job would see him like in this like raw raw super energetic
 This is the way the company's going. Let's all get together and you'd really get everyone all psyched up
 But then he would fall into a deep depression early in his career. It seemed to be worse
 He would just shut down for weeks at a time, but now he's on a roll
 He's just constantly pushing forward and people who work for the companies. They're all making a ton of money
 They know he keeps talking about like taking over the world
 They're like, dude, it's kind of weird. You keep wearing that co-work commander outfit to work
 But we're all making money. What could go wrong?
 The democratic republic of konga was having this big election and because of his reputation of kind of
 being able to save companies being really good with numbers
 A one of the political parties reached out to him and said hey listen, there's like 32 people running for president of the
 democratic republic of konga. We would like you to come out
 And talk to us and see give us some ideas on how we can if we win how we can revitalize the country
 And then we'll use that as our political platform and it's funny
 Let me take a break here real quick. This story should show more than anything the power of the law of attraction
 There's tons of successful businessmen all over the world
 That would never be contacted by the democratic republic of konga
 But because he was so driven on this idea of having this political power
 It's it's 100 law of attraction. I'll throw I know that sounds mystical to some of you guys
 But he's so focused on that. He's putting out into the universe. This is the type of connections he wants and he gets them
 Democratic republic of konga one of the political parties reaches out to him. He goes. Yeah, sure
 He goes over there and he sets up this plan with him and he goes. Okay. Here's what here's what you guys should do
 Take all the mineral wealth in the democratic republic of konga because there's a ton of it
 It's worth like billions if not a trillion dollars worth of minerals over there
 We're going to sell the mineral rights to a middle eastern investors. They'll invest in the country. They'll build up the infrastructure
 It'll be great. It'll be great for everybody. Everyone gets money. Everything gets stabilized over here
 But because he's talking about bringing in foreign investments because he's a foreigner himself
 He has a security team on the ground to work with this political party
 They get arrested because there are a bunch of foreigners
 They're talking about bringing in outside interests and people are super suspicious of them and they're all thrown in jail
 at this point franc's really upset because this is almost like a
 Black eye on this idea that he's going to rule the world someday like his people are actually being detained
 He ends up calling the state department the united states state department
 He's like you guys got to get my people out of there
 They were being used as a propaganda tool every show after they were being marched out put guns to their head
 And then ha ha we're not going to kill you today and take them back into the jail
 So that's a war crime. You can't actually do mock executions. You oddly enough can do real executions
 but the state department is trying to get this all settled and frank tells the state department i have
 100 men ready to go. I have hellfire missiles
 If they try to do anything to my contractors i'm going to level the city
 And his contractors are eventually let go they leave the country
 So after that this is his first big public step into
 International politics. It's actually a news story and people are going how did this guy in florida
 assemble a bunch of shock troopers and hellfire missiles and everything like that
 How did this go on but again? It's not raising red flags nato says, you know what we kind of we kind of like your style
 How would you with all your business acumen and your security connections like to actually host a nato meeting that we're going to have in latvia
 Now of course he's like oh
 Why you had me at latvia? I was totally down. They're like that was the last word in the sentence. He goes it doesn't matter
 I'm totally down with that. He also meets with president bush president george busch jr at the time
 He meets with them
 They have a meeting about this whole thing that happened in the democratic republic of congo
 Apparently also at that meeting george busch goes walks up to franken goes. Hey, I heard I read the after action report about congo
 And I heard what you said about leveling the city. You're my kind of guy. He's all elbowing him in the ribs
 We both love blowing up cities, don't we so frank is on his way man
 President thinks he's pretty dope dude. He's getting invited to nato. He has this small security force
 Everything's going great
 But the people he was backing in the democratic republic of congo election
 They lost the guy the president who had his people arrested won
 But frank never passing up an opportunity to take over the planet frank tells the president of congo
 Yeah, you won and I backed this other guy
 But let me tell you my plan and he lays out that idea about selling the rights to the middle east
 And they're like that actually is a good idea. We need a lot of money invested and the president goes
 You know what I really have a problem with is there is a ethnic group in the area called the buji mai
 He goes they're pretty cool dudes, but no one really likes them
 They're kind of like this impoverished part of our country. They're basically the equivalent of an american hillbilly
 He goes no one likes them. They're kind of out there all by themselves
 I would really like to see them lift it up as well
 So we can have a more unified country because there's like millions of them
 And so frank's sitting there and he goes hey, tell you what I got a plan
 I will guarantee each of them military training
 I have the people who can do it. I have the resources to do it
 I will train all the men of the buji mai region
 There's two million of there's two million of them
 So basically what you are doing is for free because i'm going to train them
 You're going to have a two million man army to help stabilize your country and then later you can help stabilize other parts of africa as well
 presidents like that sounds amazing and frank
 Frank knows what he's doing. He's building a two million man army for him
 This is the start of capital genesis. This story is 100 true and it happened just a few years ago
 And it would have kept going on. He would have had this little building in florida and done all of these things made all these maneuvers
 Start an army
 Had it not been for one conversation
 In latvia at the nato summit that he helped organize
 Someone goes hey, so what happened? What exactly happened in the congo?
 Like I read on the newspaper like your people got kidnapped
 And they were there for a couple days and apparently you made some moves and the state department made some moves and they all got let go
 What actually happened and he begins talking to all of these nato representatives about capital genesis about his plan
 To take over the world now people will say that the pesh modal writes songs about it. It happens
 But this guy has hellfire missiles
 This guy has a small amount of troops that he already threatened to level the city
 But while he's at this meeting he says he's going through the plan quote once i've created a military
 a million
 UGMI soldiers i'll use them to stabilize central africa
 Then someone asked what's your objective?
 frank says well obviously once i've built up my peacekeeping force i plan on taking all of africa
 And then he goes on to say he's going to continue to build his military
 He goes a five million man military capable of policing the planet
 We won't need nato anymore
 Probably not the best thing to say to nato meeting probably not the best thing to say at all
 He laid out his plan. He thought the plan was so genius anyone who heard it would have to go along with it capital genesis
 A worldwide corporation ran by him and he had already been taking his first steps
 Now he ends up leaving the nato summit later
 It's not like he's like gotta go once he realized that he revealed his plans the nato summit goes as normal
 But by the time he's headed back home to florida on his private jet
 There are already phone calls
 To the united states government because people are starting to put two and two together one
 He has what seems like unlimited wealth two. He already has a private security. He already has quite a few private security forces
 But one was ready to go with hellfire missiles three. He owns fighter jets
 These are all red flags that should have popped up earlier
 But the biggest one for that company. I said that he invested in in russia. He was a factory
 That up until a few years before he invested in it built intercontinental ballistic missiles
 By the time his plane landed in florida his companies are already being hit with subpoenas
 The government is sending out people
 Figure out something that this guy's doing illegal because something is wrong and they tried
 Over and over and over again and they could find nothing
 Even though he was doing this thing where he was kind of digging into the payroll taxes that money was going to be paid back
 Eventually
 He was saying we owe you 10 million dollars in taxes. I'll declare bankruptcy or you can just pay you later irs
 They go. Yeah, they owed for past taxes. He was taking out current taxes
 It was this weird scheme. It sounds pretty illegal. It probably was illegal
 But the government couldn't prove that he was doing anything illegal. He hadn't done anything illegal as far as they could tell
 July 2008 they still can't find anything that's going on with this guy
 But they do get his lawyer
 They're somehow able this is really interesting this article. I read they lean on his lawyer
 I don't know what they found on this lawyer
 I don't know if the lawyer is a good guy and developed a conscience and you know
 Didn't want to take over the planet or if they found something on him
 I'm not for sure but the but the government leaned really really hard on his lawyer
 His lawyer goes listen. You got to take a plea deal for this
 Take a plea deal for pulling money doing this tax scheme
 Do a couple years in prison not a big deal
 Frank won't do it
 The lawyer goes okay. Well, you know that whole manic depressive bipolar thing you have going on
 I'm going to have you ruled incompetent by a judge
 And then the decision isn't yours
 And you would think that it would be very very hard to do no
 No, not in this dude's case because the government already wanted to clamp down on him
 The lawyer has frank this guy who owns all these companies
 Declared incompetent and sent to the mclean psychiatric hospital at that point. He is diagnosed with bipolar disorder
 Which he does have earlier in life. They didn't really know what that was back in the 60s 70s 80s
 There wasn't really a thing. You were just depressed and that even wasn't a medical condition
 He was medicated very heavily a september 22nd 2008. So just a couple months later
 His lawyer has frank in court and says hey my client is now ready to plead guilty. He's competent
 We know he was in that psychiatric hospital for a while
 He's now ready to plead guilty to these charges your honor and the judge looks over at frank and he's literally
 Druling as he's sitting there. He's so pumped full of anti psychotic medicine. He's drooling in court
 The judge is like, okay, I'll take it. I'll take it. Yeah, he seems competent in totally
 He owns 70 companies and it taken a total of 64 million dollars
 In the end through all sorts of other shenanigans that were going on in the end. He did get
 Sentenced because he plead guilty. He was competent even though he's all
 Quite guilty. He got 22 years in prison. He's still alive. He's still in prison
 For quite a few years. He was drugged out of his mind
 Not by choice the prison authorities were keeping him on drugs and then when he finally gets off the drugs
 It had been a couple years. He's a lawyer by trade
 He starts to realize stuff. He goes first off
 I was a ward of the state when I was declared incompetent
 I was a ward of the state and by not having my own
 It doesn't matter whether or not i'm competent or someone else says i'm competent if i'm still a ward of the state
 I can't take a plea deal to when I was declared incompetent. There was someone else who was appointed as my
 Guardian it wasn't a lawyer. They should have been present as well
 When I took the plea deal
 Even the judge said had I known he was a ward of the state
 I can't take a plea deal if someone's a ward of the state. You should have realized the guy was drooling
 That should have been your first thing
 But he goes maybe there was just a really juicy steak and I couldn't see so the judge was like maybe that's why he was drooling
 The government actually did take a look at all of his findings frank puts this thing together and goes to the government
 Look at all these problems with the trial and my lawyer didn't have my best interest in mine
 A lawyer has to have your best interest in mine. My lawyer was actively working to get me thrown in jail
 So this stinks. I need to be let out and the government looks at it and they go you're right
 You're right. However, you only have one year after you are sentenced
 To argue that your lawyer didn't have your best interest in mine. It's like five years later
 He's like, yeah, but I was struck down the government was pumping me full of drugs and they're like, no, that's the deadline, dude
 so
 Frank still sits in prison now actually runs a law firm in prison
 He's constantly getting inmate sentences reduced some of them released
 He has other inmates working as paralegals
 Oddly enough, he stole about 60 million from the government through that IRS scheme
 He saved the government 83 million dollars
 In housing criminals by getting them let off to wrap this up. Let's go back to matthew cox's article here
 I'm gonna read you this passage from it and it really should give you an idea of where
 Frank's mind is at right now
 Matthew asks quote, how long did you think it was going to take for you to conquer the world and become emperor?
 Frank says you keep speaking in past tense
 I'm going to do this
 I will be emperor
 I will be emperor
 When Matthew says, you know, you're kind of getting getting older Frank completely dismisses that there's still time
 Moses started when he was 80 when I walk out of those gates
 My legions and I will march on washington burn the miserable constitution and the president will kneel at my feet
 My flag will fly above every city in this country
 and then
 the world
 It's interesting to look at a megalomaniac who failed
 Which to be fair, I guess a lot of them do
 But to have someone who actually dedicates their life to trying to take over the planet every edgy teenager imagines it, but he actually
 Took steps to do it actually may have
 Succeeded given a long enough time the idea of him marching out of jail with his legions and the president kneeling before him
 That's obviously a delusion of grandeur now
 But if his plan had been able to continue and he had amassed a five million man army in africa
 I don't know if the president would be kissing his feet, but he'd definitely be in a position of
 immense power
 And this is a type of person I talk about when I always talk about the Illuminati when I say I don't think there's one group
 Controlling the planet
 I think there's dozens if not hundreds of smaller groups each maneuvering their way
 Each one trying to conquer the planet
 But their alliances and their infighting and all this stuff going on and that represents the chaos of the world
 This is what i'm talking about this man became a key player
 He was just some college student who was a lawyer for a while
 He kind of bumbled his way through life
 And ended up coming very close
 To being a dominant player in world politics. This is the Illuminati
 It's people like this and whether a couple of them team up to form a group
 Or you just have a lot of lone wolves out there. These are the people that can really affect
 world politics
 It doesn't take a group to control a television station. It just takes a guy like this to own a television station
 And the creepiest thing is that this is chaos
 This is full chaos. It's almost more comforting to think that one group
 Rules the entire planet because that way you can focus all your energy on one group and everything that goes wrong
 You can ascribe it to that one group
 But to know that there are people like this in our lifetime
 Who are able to maneuver this and the only thing that tripped him up was him opening his mouth in front of the wrong people
 That's terrifying because that's pure chaos had he gotten an icbm
 And he was in a manic episode
 And he's threatening to destroy cities
 Raw chaos
 Knowing someone is in control even if they are evil can be more comforting than
 thinking that random people can just pop up
 By a missile factory and start taking over the world
 That's why more people want to believe that 9/11 was an inside job versus
 Some dude 3 000 miles away gets 19 people to change the scope of american history
 Because chaos is terrifying
 And control is comforting
 That's why people like frank scared the government into doing whatever it would take to get him behind bars
 Because people like frank are true loose cannons
 And he's not alone
 There's probably thousands of other people out there just like him
 Who not only dream about taking over the world. We all do that
 Reshaping the world in our image, but knowing how to do it
 The government was able to stop frank will they be able to stop the next one?
 And the next one and the next one?
 Or will there be a day when you wake up a new flag is flying over your city?
 You see the president on bended knees
 Kissing the foot of a man you never even knew existed
 But is now the king of the planet
 We may think that sounds far-fetched, but to frank
 It's just a matter of time
