1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,120
 When a young woman inherits a haunted house, she figures things aren't going to be easy.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:12,160
 But the last thing she suspected was her husband trying to kill himself.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,440
 And then we travel to Skinwalker Ranch, a very well known location in the paranormal

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,440
 world.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:27,000
 A piece of land in Utah that supposedly everything from Bigfoot to portals to aliens to interdimensional

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,240
 creatures have all been seen in this ranch.

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,880
 And all of that is the sanest part of the conspiracy we're going to look at today on

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,880
 Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:48,520
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,520
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,520
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,880
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,120
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing.

14
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,480
 You guys know that I love the fluffle.

15
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,960
 And I wanted to share this with you.

16
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,880
 Today I went and checked my post office box.

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,200
 It's in the show notes.

18
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,720
 And I got a package from a listener known as Robert Brewer.

19
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:11,360
 And he sent me a graphic novel he's published called Branches.

20
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,360
 It's available on Amazon.

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,560
 I put a link in the show notes.

22
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,080
 And he also sent me a solo, a little booklet.

23
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,600
 It's a solo role-playing game.

24
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,120
 Isn't that awesome?

25
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,800
 You guys, you guys are dope.

26
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,320
 You guys are always impressing me with your creative output.

27
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,040
 I love seeing all that stuff.

28
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,640
 Makes me feel like this is part of a bigger community.

29
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,640
 And Branches is really good.

30
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,920
 I'm about halfway done with it.

31
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,840
 It's a horror anthology.

32
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,280
 So perfect in time for Halloween if you want to check it out.

33
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,520
 It's on Amazon.

34
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,200
 Robert, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,200
 Really, really impressed.

36
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,200
 And thanks for sending me the free stuff.

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,480
 I'm not saying if you send me free stuff that you create, you'll be featured on an

38
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,480
 episode.

39
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,480
 But yeah, it doesn't hurt.

40
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,280
 It doesn't hurt to grease the wheels like that.

41
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,000
 And guys, check out Branches.

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 It is really cool.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,320
 Robert, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

44
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,240
 Let's go ahead and get you started here.

45
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,240
 We're going to get you suit.

46
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,600
 He's like, I didn't expect to be on episode.

47
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,760
 I was just sending you some extra comics I had laying around the house.

48
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,760
 Come on, Robert.

49
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,720
 We're going to go ahead and put you in a snazzy little driving suit and give you the keys

50
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,880
 of the Jason Jalopy.

51
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,840
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

52
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:21,480
 We are headed all the way out to somewhere, somewhere the United States.

53
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,800
 Driving through all these towns.

54
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,680
 We're looking for just the right one because what we're looking for is a spooky little house.

55
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,880
 But the story was posted online.

56
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,720
 Here's a little girl.

57
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,040
 This is not a fairy tale.

58
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,480
 This little girl, she lived in a big house.

59
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,560
 It was in the shape of a shoe.

60
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,920
 She lived in this house and she didn't even like it as a kid.

61
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,160
 She goes, I always thought it was creepy.

62
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,240
 She goes, I don't know if it was the dirt floor in the basement.

63
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,360
 I don't know if it was like the old timey Victorian furniture.

64
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,360
 I don't know what it was.

65
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,200
 I just found this house to be creepy.

66
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,800
 But it wasn't just an atmospheric thing.

67
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,280
 It wasn't just like, oh, I saw this.

68
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,640
 I saw a house that looked like this on Are You Afraid of the Dark?

69
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,160
 She was also, it wasn't just that, right?

70
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,320
 Because you could just get over that.

71
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,560
 She also would have horrible night terrors.

72
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,880
 She would dream all the time that she was getting murdered.

73
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:22,640
 Every night she'd wake up in a cold sweat.

74
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,120
 That was the worst dream ever.

75
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,040
 Oh, Tom, is your entire time to go back to sleep?

76
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,000
 I wish on this next dream won't be as bad.

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,560
 For 10 years, she dreamt of getting murdered.

78
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,160
 And I have to ask, I wonder if it was different murders each time because that would be kind

79
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
 of cool.

80
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,920
 Like if I was constantly getting stabbed to death, I mean by the eighth nightmare I'd

81
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,080
 be like, ah, I'm eating a burger.

82
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,360
 I'm like, I wonder if the pickles will fall through the wounds.

83
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,320
 I wonder if they'll just slide out the stomach wounds.

84
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:56,240
 But imagine if every night you fell asleep 365 nights a year each time you died differently.

85
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,240
 Over the course of 10 years, that's like 3,600 deaths.

86
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,160
 By that point, your brain's like, we've already done falling in acid.

87
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,920
 We've already done falling into a geyser, a hot spring.

88
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,200
 We've already done falling into a trash compactor.

89
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,560
 Like eventually your brain is, how, like basically you're getting killed by Dr. Seuss

90
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,560
 inventions.

91
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,920
 They're like the who's in my what's it?

92
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,920
 Went right into your brain.

93
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,920
 You're like, what?

94
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,440
 It's not scary at all.

95
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,920
 But if you died differently each time, that would, if you had to have night terrors and

96
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:32,000
 if you had to spend every night dreaming of dying, it should at least be mildly entertaining.

97
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,680
 But anyways, it wasn't for her.

98
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,280
 She just had her entire childhood.

99
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,000
 Was living in this horrible house where every night she jumped she was being murdered.

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,200
 So when she was able to, when she grew up, she moved away.

101
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,760
 Recently, she inherited the house.

102
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,760
 And you could go, sure, maybe I had a difficult childhood and I had all this other stuff going

103
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,960
 on, the house was creepy, maybe it wasn't, I maybe I didn't dream about it every night.

104
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,040
 Cause I'm an adult now and I'm a rational adult so I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna

105
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
 move into the house.

106
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,040
 I inherited it.

107
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,640
 At this point she's married.

108
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,920
 She has a dog.

109
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,480
 She said the very first night they moved in.

110
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:15,840
 The worst nightmare said her husband.

111
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,640
 Ooh, plot twist, right?

112
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,040
 She didn't have a horrible nightmare.

113
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
 Her husband did.

114
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,520
 She's all sleeping peacefully.

115
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,000
 She's like, "Thank you Jesus for passing the curse on to the next person."

116
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,520
 He has a horrible nightmare the first night.

117
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,520
 And then the second night they're getting ready to go to bed and he needed to go get

118
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,480
 something in the kitchen and he goes, "Will you come with me?"

119
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,480
 She goes, "What?

120
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
 No.

121
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,480
 I'm gonna get you a portion and give what you need."

122
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,240
 And he's like, "I don't want to walk down this hallway by myself."

123
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,200
 Now I should say that this guy's job, he's not a professional scaredy cat.

124
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,420
 This isn't what his normal personality is.

125
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,840
 She describes him as being like in the tech industry.

126
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,040
 He's a coder.

127
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:58,280
 So he's a fairly rational person to work in that level of boring science stuff.

128
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,320
 So he doesn't want to go down the hallway.

129
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,640
 He thinks there's something waiting to get him.

130
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,200
 And she's like, "What are you talking about?"

131
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
 She's like, "Grow up here.

132
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,840
 I've been burning 3,600 times in this house.

133
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,360
 You can walk down a hallway."

134
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,200
 The third night, full on night terrors.

135
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,560
 This is beyond the nightmares.

136
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,400
 He's thinking he's fighting stuff off.

137
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,040
 He's totally delirious.

138
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,040
 He's freaking out.

139
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,080
 She does not get a moment's sleep in this house.

140
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,720
 She's like, "Oh, just like the good old days."

141
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,240
 And then the fourth night, same thing.

142
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,000
 Ugh, freaking out, running around the room, fighting invisible bats or what have you.

143
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,160
 On the fifth night, sorry, here's the thing.

144
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,080
 There's so many ways I could have approached this story.

145
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,800
 And one of my theories was how many nights would it take for you to leave?

146
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,200
 I understand the little girl version when she was a kid.

147
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,800
 She couldn't just be like, "I'm out of here, ma."

148
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,840
 But as an adult, you already know that this is not gonna end, right?

149
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,600
 It only ended after you laughed after 10 years.

150
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,520
 It's been four days and your husband's already flipping out.

151
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:07,720
 The fifth night, she wakes up and the bedroom is dead silent.

152
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:15,280
 She looks around and he's not in bed.

153
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,600
 So she begins to walk through the house, looking for him.

154
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
 "Gary?"

155
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,440
 She says his name for the first time in the story.

156
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:28,840
 "Gary, it's me, Margaret."

157
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,480
 Walking through the house.

158
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:37,040
 She sees him sleeping in their car.

159
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:46,880
 She looks outside, she looks outside the window and she sees in their car, there is Gary sleeping.

160
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,280
 So she goes out to the car and when she wakes him up, his first good night's sleeping five

161
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,520
 days, when she wakes him up, he flips out.

162
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,280
 He flips out, he's screaming at the top of his lungs, he's running around, he's totally

163
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:04,920
 lost it and then right in the driveway of the house, he attempts suicide.

164
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,640
 And she calls the cops and the ambulance, "Doo doo doo!"

165
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,080
 Pull up and they get him with a net, they get him with one of those crazy people nets.

166
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:18,240
 They throw him in the ambulance and they take him to the hospital.

167
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,640
 Now she posted that right after it happened.

168
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,640
 She posted that online.

169
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,600
 She goes, "She's like, 'God, you want to believe the weekend I had!'

170
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,880
 My husband tried killing himself in the driveway because of the night tears and all that stuff."

171
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,680
 She posted that and I was like, "Oh, that's super interesting."

172
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,600
 The person's name, the user's name is "Madame Music."

173
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:40,520
 The headline that she posted it under was, "Can a haunting cause mental illness?"

174
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,360
 And that was something we touched on last week as well about, or maybe it was in the

175
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,560
 previous season even about the guy who he thought his wife was going insane, really creepy episode

176
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,680
 or was she getting possessed.

177
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,560
 This is kind of in that same vein, but this story has a super bizarre twist to it.

178
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,320
 We're not even done yet.

179
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,280
 I do, so I read it and I go, "Okay, this is really interesting and spooky story.

180
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,400
 I'd like to talk about this."

181
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,520
 But one, how does one commit suicide in the driveway of your house?

182
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:13,080
 Unless he had like a ladder and a bowling ball on it and he's like running.

183
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,920
 I don't get it.

184
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,720
 You could probably run your head over with your, like, "Put the car in."

185
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,720
 These are not tips.

186
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,120
 Once again, I have to declare these are not tips, but you could put the car in reverse

187
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,520
 and like lay your head down.

188
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,120
 I don't know.

189
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,120
 What else would you do?

190
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:35,160
 I mean, maybe if you had like a tire on your like, "Jason, please, stop, stop, stop."

191
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,920
 My point is, it doesn't seem like there's a lot.

192
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,280
 Like unless he brought a weapon with him, he's like sitting in the back seat of the car with

193
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,520
 a noose and a stick of dynamite.

194
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,480
 I don't think it's going to work, but anyway, so the reason why I bring that up was I go,

195
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,600
 "That's a little suspicious."

196
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,040
 Like how does one almost kill themselves just walking around their driveway?

197
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,480
 So I thought that was a little suspicious is what I'm saying.

198
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,280
 I thought it was like if it had taken place in any other room in the house, I'd be like,

199
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,760
 "Oh, there's a thousand ways to kill yourself in the den."

200
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,280
 And I thought it was a little suspicious.

201
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:11,040
 She's like, "As the ambulance is driving away," she's like, "Hey, people have read it?

202
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,320
 You won't believe the crazy thing that just happened."

203
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,520
 I thought that was a little weird too, because you don't think you would rush to Reddit to

204
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,520
 tell this story.

205
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:25,280
 And then a couple days later, that first story, I was like, "Oh, that's interesting."

206
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,680
 It kind of ties into what we talked about.

207
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,120
 Then she comes back.

208
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,120
 Then she comes back.

209
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,360
 And I don't know how to take this.

210
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,320
 I just don't know how to read this just yet.

211
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,360
 She does basically, she comes back a couple days later, like three, I think it was only

212
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,840
 like three days later.

213
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,360
 And she says, "There's more stuff happened.

214
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,320
 The husband is discharged from the hospital.

215
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,600
 The first night, they both sleep totally normal.

216
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:01,000
 The next night, the sun goes down, the moon comes up, there's a crow sitting on a gravestone,

217
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,160
 literally because they have Halloween decorations up.

218
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,240
 The story's super recent.

219
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,880
 The story's like going on right now.

220
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,600
 She, Margaret, just totally loses it.

221
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,240
 And she starts running around the house, flipping out.

222
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,320
 And the husband's like, "Oh, man.

223
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,960
 It was fun when I was doing it."

224
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:24,080
 And she's flipping out and then she runs outside and she begins breaking the tombstones.

225
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,280
 She destroys all of their Halloween decorations.

226
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,600
 She's pulling them off the window.

227
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,040
 She starts picking up pumpkins and smashing them into the ground and throwing them across

228
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,120
 the yard.

229
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,960
 And then she takes, like they have this spike with a, like a skull on it.

230
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,720
 These are Halloween decorations, right?

231
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,400
 These are not stuff that they normally have laying around.

232
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,240
 And she smashes one of her windows.

233
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:58,760
 Just then, out of nowhere, her brother, her new character being introduced in the third

234
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:10,760
 act, her brother, who is also a CEO, she calls him my CEO brother, runs across the yard and

235
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,080
 tackles her, right when she smashes the window with a spike.

236
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,720
 And he's like, "Margaret, you gotta snap out of it.

237
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,720
 You gotta snap out of it."

238
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,360
 And what happened was the neighbors saw Margaret come out of the house and throw pumpkins and

239
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,160
 start beating stuff up.

240
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,480
 So they didn't call the police.

241
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:31,240
 They called her CEO brother, who then drove across the business meeting.

242
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,080
 He drives all the way from his skyscraper and then tackles his sister.

243
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,800
 She gets taken to the hospital as well.

244
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,320
 Because she's a danger to herself.

245
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,200
 And then the guy says, "Hey, I'll pay for you to be in a hotel for a while.

246
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,720
 Don't stay in the house anymore."

247
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,920
 It's a weird story.

248
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,920
 It's a weird story.

249
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:55,760
 And what's even odder is that the second part of the post, where she goes crazy, has been

250
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,680
 deleted.

251
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,160
 It's been deleted.

252
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,320
 So that's no longer official canon.

253
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,680
 They're actually gonna do a retcon.

254
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:09,880
 But I find that super interesting that you have the initial story, which is that both

255
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,560
 stories are fairly plausible.

256
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,360
 If you don't believe in demons or ghosts, then it's all nonsense.

257
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,120
 But if you believe in demons and ghosts, this stuff isn't outside of normal lore behavior.

258
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:26,200
 We did an episode yesterday about a series of women who were possibly possessed by women.

259
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,440
 We talked, like I said, about a week or two ago about a guy whose wife was starting to

260
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,440
 act weird in the house.

261
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,080
 And the lore, it makes sense.

262
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,320
 I'm curious as to why she removed the second part of it.

263
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,920
 I find that kind of interesting.

264
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,160
 Did she make it up and she didn't like the way she ended it?

265
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,080
 Or, because remember the second part of the story, she gets possessed or she gets influenced

266
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,080
 by the house.

267
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,200
 Is the influence so strong it made her delete the Reddit post?

268
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,320
 As in, she said too much.

269
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,760
 So delete that part.

270
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,400
 The CEO brother is like, "You know how much stock I lost this week?"

271
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,640
 And he makes her delete it.

272
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,640
 Who knows?

273
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,200
 I do find it interesting that the second part is deleted.

274
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,120
 The whole story though I found absolutely fascinating.

275
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,200
 Haunted houses are very Halloween-y.

276
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,680
 Haunted houses and Halloween go hand in hand.

277
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,040
 I love a good haunted house story.

278
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,840
 I've even featured in a lot of those.

279
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:24,800
 But now we're going to leave behind a haunted house and take a look at a conspiracy theory

280
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,320
 that may actually explain the haunted house.

281
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,960
 It may explain a whole lot of stuff that's going on.

282
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,160
 Robert, I'm going to go ahead and touch you the keys of the carboner copter.

283
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,400
 We're leaving behind somewhere USA.

284
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:46,400
 We're headed out to the Skinwalker Ranch.

285
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:52,640
 Skinwalker Ranch is something that I assume if you have a passing knowledge of paranormal,

286
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,720
 if you have interest in the paranormal community, you're at least aware of Skinwalker Ranch.

287
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,640
 It's not really anything I've ever covered on this show.

288
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,640
 It's very, very popular.

289
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:07,080
 It's not as popular as, say, Roswell or Area 51 and the overall American consciousness.

290
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:12,200
 But I'd say if you've spent a year or two looking in the paranormal, you come across

291
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,960
 Skinwalker Ranch stories.

292
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,440
 And Skinwalker Ranch is a place, it's a real place.

293
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,440
 It's in Utah.

294
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,080
 Just a brief overview.

295
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,120
 It's owned by private individuals.

296
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,280
 Right now it's owned by a company, but it's normally been owned by private individuals.

297
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,600
 And it is a place of high strangeness.

298
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,040
 It's one of those places that you see, there's been reports of Bigfoot sightings, UFOs, cattle

299
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,800
 mutilations, portals opening to other dimensions, bulletproof creatures of darkness moving across

300
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
 the landscape.

301
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:45,560
 It's like whatever your mind could think of has happened at Skinwalker Ranch.

302
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,080
 And that is really the nutshell.

303
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,840
 And there are tons of resources available on this.

304
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:54,680
 There's even a television show on the History Channel going on right now, the secret of

305
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,600
 Skinwalker Ranch.

306
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,600
 So that's in a nutshell the story of Skinwalker Ranch.

307
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,640
 Now there have been a lot of allegations around this place, which I find very, very interesting.

308
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,640
 Because here's my thing with Skinwalker Ranch.

309
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:15,280
 Skinwalker Ranch, there's never really been any proof coming out of Skinwalker Ranch

310
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,320
 that you don't find that level of proof, say, coming out of a haunted house.

311
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:24,200
 Where the amount of activity that's happened, supposedly happened at Skinwalker Ranch,

312
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,800
 we're still getting the same blurry photos, the same photos of orbs and stuff like that

313
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,280
 that you would get at a local cemetery.

314
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,360
 Now I was reading this article on this website called The Parallax and they were doing an

315
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:43,520
 investigation into Skinwalker Ranch, visa v, the $22 million government contract that

316
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,120
 Skinwalker Ranch received.

317
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:52,480
 So it is, apparently the Parallax article said that Robert Bigelow, who was the previous

318
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,880
 owner of Skinwalker Ranch, he actually is the owner of a chain of hotels, like budget

319
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,200
 hotels.

320
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:05,400
 He got in touch with Senator Harry Reid of Nevada and told him about the Skinwalker Ranch

321
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,400
 and Senator Harry Reid has all been about UFO.

322
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,840
 He's been a proponent of disclosure for a long time.

323
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:16,840
 Robert Bigelow, who owned the ranch at this time, this is back in the early 2000s, late

324
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:22,360
 90s, talks to Senator Harry Reid and makes all these connections and gets a contract.

325
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,880
 The Defense Intelligence Agency is giving grants out to do these studies to see what

326
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,240
 is really going on at Skinwalker Ranch.

327
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,680
 And so, just like you're not gonna get $22 million to investigate a haunted cemetery,

328
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:39,960
 you're probably not even gonna get $22 from your aunt to go investigate a haunted cemetery,

329
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,440
 but that's what's always kind of bugged me about it.

330
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,320
 Like I am super excited to do this type of research and to find this stuff out, but people

331
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,240
 were pouring money into this and we weren't getting any better evidence than we've gotten

332
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:58,120
 out of any other, we get a lot of stories saying I saw this, but we're not getting any

333
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,840
 raw evidence from it.

334
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:05,680
 And I don't, when a bunch of ghost hunters go out to the gates of hell, New Jersey,

335
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,440
 or they're going on some road trip or Honsheyville or something like that, I'm not expecting

336
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,360
 them to, I'd be nice if they came back with evidence, but I understand the lore, the way

337
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,280
 things work, but when the government is pumping $22 million into finding out if the Mellon

338
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,000
 Heads exist, the Mellon Heads better exist, right?

339
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,520
 They better find these little freaks.

340
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,920
 Parallax, also in this very interesting article stated that a lot of people who worked at

341
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,640
 the ranch made stories up.

342
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,640
 Not all of them, not all of them, but they were showing, they had these interviews and

343
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,840
 they were like, yeah, we were encouraged to make stuff up, we got a bonus if we were ever

344
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:46,480
 able to find proof, so people are going to do what they're going to do to get money.

345
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,840
 That doesn't mean that everything cited there was fake, I'm not saying that at all.

346
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:55,600
 It does have a long history of sightings, but what I'm saying is when you pump $22 million

347
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:01,120
 into something, I want more than just, I saw this something one day.

348
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,600
 You know, at that point we should be getting, people should get insectin-aportal on camera

349
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,480
 for $22 million.

350
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:14,160
 But I find the idea of Skinwalker Ranch fascinating, I'm a big fan of portals, I'm a big fan

351
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,480
 of places on earth that high strangeness is likely to happen, so I'm not dismissing the

352
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,480
 idea of Skinwalker Ranch altogether.

353
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,880
 But that really isn't even what we're talking about.

354
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,960
 That is just the setup for the conspiracy theory.

355
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:38,320
 The conspiracy we're actually going to talk about is from a guy who believes that he has

356
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:44,200
 answered all the questions that we've been asking for the past couple years.

357
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,600
 You know this whole COVID-19 thing?

358
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:53,840
 Okay, before I say the next couple of words, YouTube and Spotify, okay, hold on.

359
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,440
 Just let me finish, okay?

360
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,240
 You know that whole COVID-19 thing?

361
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,840
 That's not real, right?

362
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,440
 You guys, all of distraction.

363
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,560
 That was all of distraction.

364
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,920
 This guy has shown us the way.

365
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,840
 Here's the real story.

366
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,800
 Skinwalker Ranch is a powerful place.

367
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,240
 In fact, it may be the most powerful place on earth.

368
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,880
 It's just all this raw interdimensional energy spilling out of it.

369
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,240
 And it's like the universe can't decide, do I want to be a photo, do I want to be a big

370
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,000
 foot, do I want to be a monster?

371
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:36,240
 So it's putting, it's just like raw, it's just raw psychic interdimensional energy.

372
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:46,520
 And Beblanks57 explains that this energy is so powerful if you encounter Skinwalker Ranch,

373
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,480
 it can drive you insane.

374
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,560
 But luckily it's really hard to get out there.

375
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,600
 And nowadays, all roads have been cut off to it.

376
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:04,400
 It's like it's owned by a company called Adamantium Holdings and they don't allow visitors.

377
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:12,400
 Except for the cast and crew of the history channels, the secret of Skinwalker Ranch.

378
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,680
 They've already finished their first season, season two will start airing soon.

379
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,760
 But that might be a bad thing.

380
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:25,720
 You see Skinwalker Ranch is so powerful that if you go there it can drive you insane.

381
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,020
 But it's even more powerful than that.

382
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:34,320
 If you watch the show, the secret of Skinwalker Ranch Wednesday nights at 9am, I don't even

383
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,320
 know when it is.

384
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:42,280
 But if you watch the show, the secret of Skinwalker Ranch, it will drive you insane.

385
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,920
 Now you may be thinking right now, you may be thinking right now as you're riding on

386
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,920
 your mirror with lipstick.

387
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,920
 I'm not insane, Jason.

388
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,880
 And that's my favorite show.

389
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:55,920
 So he goes on to say that it may only make people who are currently depressed insane

390
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:01,120
 or people who have some sort of psychic makeup.

391
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,520
 Like there's something peculiar about them that this show can affect.

392
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,240
 He goes, "I don't think it'll happen with everyone, but there's enough people out there

393
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,880
 that if they watch the secret of Skinwalker Ranch, it'll drive them insane."

394
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,360
 And you go, "Jason, that's all well and good.

395
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,880
 We've covered crazier conspiracy theories on there.

396
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,880
 What could that possibly have to do with COVID-19?"

397
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,120
 And that's when I go, "Here's what he says.

398
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,000
 If you go to Skinwalker Ranch, you go crazy.

399
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,720
 If you watch the show, the secret of Skinwalker Ranch, you go crazy.

400
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,240
 This power of Skinwalker Ranch is so unstoppable.

401
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:41,360
 If you talk to someone who's watched the secret of Skinwalker Ranch, you can go crazy."

402
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,880
 And what happened was the government realized this halfway through season one of the Secret

403
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,400
 of Skinwalker Ranch.

404
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,240
 They're watching, they got little dots on the map.

405
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,680
 They're like, "Sir, sir, five more people just went crazy in Detroit."

406
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,880
 And the president's like, "Oh my God."

407
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,480
 As they're watching more and more people go insane, they realize that this, the cat,

408
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,560
 they realize that the interdimensional cat is out of the bag.

409
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:08,760
 They decide, listen, there's only one way we can stop people from going insane.

410
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,080
 We lock them all in their houses.

411
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,000
 We have huge national lockdowns.

412
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,360
 We lock them all in their houses for a minimum of six weeks and remove their kids from school.

413
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,440
 That, that'll make them not go insane.

414
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:26,320
 You see the lockdowns, the social distancing that's all to keep you from talking to someone

415
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,000
 about the secret of Skinwalker Ranch.

416
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,760
 As long as you can stay six feet away from someone, someone's walking on the street like,

417
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,440
 "Hey, did you see the new History Channel show?"

418
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,880
 You're like, "No, no, don't."

419
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,920
 If you see anyone wanting to talk about it, make sure they stay socially distanced.

420
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:45,080
 All of this stuff is to prevent you from going insane.

421
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,480
 Because if you get close to someone who's watched that show, or if you get close to someone

422
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:54,320
 who got close to someone who watched that show, this is, it's infectious.

423
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,760
 It's a virus.

424
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,240
 It's driving humanity insane.

425
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,120
 Now to be fair, B. Blanks does say at the end of this, "Hey, I'm not saying this is really

426
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,120
 or anything.

427
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,880
 I'm just thinking, would that be crazy if it was?"

428
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,280
 However, I went through his post history.

429
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:16,400
 And basically whenever he says something like this, he goes, "I'm not saying this is true,

430
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
 but..."

431
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:23,400
 So either he's doing a bunch of story prompts, or this is his version of the conspiracy cap,

432
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,720
 where a lot of times I go, "Let's put on our conspiracy cap," because I know if I

433
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,680
 stated it in his fact, people will be like, "You're insane."

434
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,280
 They're very interesting conspiracy theory.

435
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,680
 And it really has...

436
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,960
 This is what I think when we talk about conspiracy theories.

437
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,600
 Like when we talk about stuff like "Monkeys Don't Exist," one of my famous episodes,

438
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,600
 that is so beyond the pale.

439
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,360
 Because it's just the workarounds don't make any sense.

440
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,680
 But sometimes when we come across conspiracy theories like this, when you break the pieces

441
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,240
 down, they make sense.

442
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,240
 We as...

443
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,960
 And you know, your mileage may vary.

444
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,920
 But generally the paranormal community believes in things like mind control, believes in

445
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:06,960
 things like curses, believes in raw psychic energy and powerful places of powerful energy.

446
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,760
 And it being able to go through electronic devices, nothing that he's saying when you

447
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:18,160
 break it down is out of the ordinary for a paranormal researcher to talk about.

448
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,240
 Monkeys don't exist just...

449
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,560
 It doesn't make any sense.

450
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,640
 You start asking questions like, "Well, who would do...

451
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,840
 Why would you be doing this?

452
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,120
 Who dresses up as a monkey?

453
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,600
 Where are the monkey suits made?

454
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,280
 How long has this gone on for?"

455
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:34,760
 With this one, and you can't break it down any further than monkeys don't exist.

456
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:40,240
 NASA wants to say that God isn't real, so they lied to us about evolution and they invented

457
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,240
 the monkey.

458
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,200
 That's the whole theory of monkeys don't exist.

459
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,000
 It just doesn't make any sense.

460
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,200
 But in this one, the components make sense.

461
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,200
 Why?

462
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,200
 It really...

463
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,200
 I mean, like you just break it down like that.

464
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,280
 It's possible in the paranormal world, there is cursed...

465
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:00,680
 There is a cursed location and that cursed location could spill out and begin cursing other people.

466
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,600
 We've done episodes on this podcast that I thought might have been cursed.

467
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,960
 So why not a television show on the History Channel?

468
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,200
 So it's an interesting conspiracy theory and I have to say this.

469
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,960
 His theory is that it's slowly driving people crazier and crazier and crazier and you can't

470
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,040
 stop the infection.

471
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:25,560
 We've tried doing the lockdowns but it's still spreading and eventually all of the executives

472
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,240
 of History Channel are going to go to jail.

473
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,160
 I don't know about that part.

474
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,360
 I don't know about that part.

475
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,480
 And if they did, they'd make an awesome show, the history of America's Jails.

476
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,680
 I really love History Channel personally, but I don't think they're trying to cause the

477
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,680
 degradation of humanity through our mind warping us.

478
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,920
 But even he's not saying that it's necessarily...

479
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,400
 They may not even know they're doing it.

480
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,840
 It sounds like it just may be this accident or raw energy, but then you figure the US

481
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,040
 government, they'd say, "You may not be doing it on purpose, but we're still going to cancel

482
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,440
 your show."

483
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:03,240
 So it makes sense in the lore it's possible.

484
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,120
 Now what I'd go so far to say that's the reason...

485
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,000
 The COVID lockdown is where he kind of loses you, right?

486
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,880
 That just doesn't make any sense because I think it would be better placed if he goes,

487
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,320
 "The government doesn't even know this is happening."

488
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,280
 Like I know it's happening, I can sense it, but the government doesn't know it.

489
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:26,640
 History Channel is either doing it on purpose for their ancient alien overlords or they're

490
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,200
 doing it on accident and they need to cancel a show.

491
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,640
 The idea of the government and then changing the entire world, that's where he kind of

492
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,640
 starts to lose me.

493
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,400
 But the idea of a cursed television show is creepy and the idea of a cursed television

494
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,720
 show that a lot of people watch.

495
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,440
 It's not something that's being broadcast on excess television three in the morning

496
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,640
 and it causes some dude to pick up a cleaver and hack his family up.

497
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,640
 I mean that's cool.

498
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,640
 I mean not for his family, right?

499
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,640
 Not for his family.

500
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,640
 What is it sound like?

501
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,640
 As a story?

502
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,600
 Have you heard that as a spooky story?

503
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,960
 That's a cool spooky story, but imagine if it was Friends.

504
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,600
 Imagine if there was that episode of Seinfeld where Kramer looks right at the camera and

505
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:12,280
 goes, "Now's the time and he just eats a cat."

506
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:18,520
 And half of America is totally aghast and the other half of America is watching, not

507
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,640
 that episode, not that episode.

508
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,800
 And the next day you have articles and everything in the news saying, "Hey, what was up with

509
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,040
 Kramer eating that cat?"

510
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,760
 Everyone else will be like, "What are you talking about?"

511
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:36,080
 And then if you ever watched a rerun of it, it's him not eating the cat.

512
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,080
 Like that would be more earth-shattering.

513
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:44,840
 You notice the half of the plant country that saw the Kramer cat eating episode, there's

514
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,880
 a steep decline in the cat population over the next couple of days.

515
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,360
 They could never explain that part.

516
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:58,280
 I think when we talk about lost media, I think what we really want to find is cursed media.

517
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:04,480
 When we talk about lost media, a lot of the times we want to hear about creepy stories.

518
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,000
 Like why wasn't this aired?

519
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,440
 Something bad happened behind the set.

520
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,040
 Squidward killed himself.

521
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,680
 You know the typical things.

522
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,200
 But when you look at lost media and they're like, "Oh yeah, they literally lost this.

523
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,320
 Like they filmed this and the guy tripped and it rolled down a muddy hill."

524
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,320
 That's not as fun.

525
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,040
 I think that lost media, we're talking about cursed media.

526
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,040
 We want it to be spooky.

527
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:28,480
 And it turns out that we may not have to wait until 3 AM on some cable access channel or

528
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,320
 channel 58 or something like that to see this cursed media.

529
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:35,280
 It may be on a major cable channel.

530
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,080
 It may be available for streaming.

531
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,880
 You may right now be able to stop listening to this podcast and watch an episode of the

532
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,440
 Secret of Skinwalker Ranch.

533
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,440
 It may be good.

534
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,600
 I haven't seen it.

535
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,600
 You may like it.

536
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,600
 I don't know.

537
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,560
 You may watch a second episode.

538
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,440
 And then a third episode.

539
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,680
 You binge the whole first season.

540
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:01,160
 You're sitting there, the whole season is done.

541
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,720
 You're by yourself in your room.

542
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,960
 And you go, "I really enjoyed that show.

543
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,400
 It didn't drive me insane."

544
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:17,760
 But then you realize you watched the last four episodes after you had gouged your own

545
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,760
 eyeballs out.

546
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:31,200
 Which might be the best endorsement the History Channel has ever gotten on that show.

547
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,000
 I like the History Channel.

548
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 Don't get me wrong.

549
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 History Channel is dope.

550
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 They ever want to work with me.

551
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,360
 They want to work with me on the iGouch show.

552
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,760
 I'm totally down.

553
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,360
