1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
 A monster that would put all other monsters to shame is stalking the most remote parts

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,120
 of the world?

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:16,140
 What happens when a young boy stumbles upon alien life in his own backyard?

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:21,100
 And then we travel to Scotland to look at the death of a young woman.

5
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:26,760
 When the family starts looking closer at the case, they realize this may reach the highest

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,560
 levels of government.

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,160
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,080
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,480
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,280
 Now I gotta let you know I am having a great day because I'm spending time with you guys,

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,280
 my friends.

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,160
 However, I did get laid off from one of my jobs when long time listeners of this show

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,960
 I always said I worked three jobs.

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,920
 Just today I was laid off of another one because of the virus.

16
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,520
 The company pretty much just dissolved overnight and suspended in depth.

17
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,920
 But I'm still having a great day.

18
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,560
 Because here's the thing.

19
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,880
 We can't, it sucks, absolutely it sucks that now I'm down to one job.

20
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,840
 And it's gonna hurt me financially in the end.

21
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,440
 But we can't let this stuff get us down guys.

22
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,480
 We have to have a positive.

23
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,360
 If we're not being positive during this time, it's only gonna get worse for us guys.

24
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,800
 That's why I'm gonna just keep doing this show.

25
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,200
 And actually I wanna recommend you guys also subscribe to my YouTube channel because I

26
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,640
 think I'm gonna be doing a lot more live streaming over the next couple weeks too.

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,400
 So we just got to keep positive.

28
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,760
 I'm just gonna keep putting out content.

29
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,200
 I'm gonna keep doing what I love.

30
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,540
 That's me sharing these stories with you.

31
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,680
 You guys need to keep doing what you love.

32
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,800
 Which maybe is promoting the show.

33
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,800
 But even if it's not.

34
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,360
 Even if you have to stop listening to the podcast for a while.

35
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,600
 Maybe this stuff's too scary.

36
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,080
 Maybe I'm talking about the stuff's too dark.

37
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,960
 That's totally fine too guys.

38
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,800
 Be positive in this moment.

39
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,200
 Because if you let this stuff get you down, it's only gonna get worse man.

40
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
 It's only gonna get worse.

41
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,240
 Don't become a prisoner in your own head.

42
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,160
 You got enough of the news and all that stuff giving you all this bad news.

43
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,720
 Just check out for a moment.

44
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,200
 Watch Jonas on Disney Plus.

45
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,000
 That's what I was doing last night.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,160
 Indulge in your comfort food.

47
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,520
 There's nothing wrong with that.

48
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,400
 In moderation on the food.

49
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,240
 Don't gain weight during a pandemic.

50
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,360
 That might be something you don't want to do.

51
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,880
 But guys, keep positive.

52
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,560
 And if that means you gotta take a break from the show.

53
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,240
 Because sometimes this show gets a little dark.

54
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,240
 That's fine too.

55
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,800
 I'll be here when you're ready.

56
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,160
 But let's go ahead and move on to our first topic for today.

57
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,520
 For our first story we're traveling to everyone's favorite Eastern Bloc country.

58
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,160
 Straight out from behind the Iron Curtain.

59
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,160
 It's Azai by Jon.

60
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,160
 Woo!

61
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,160
 Azur by Jon.

62
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:55,640
 It's a little landlocked country near Asia and the other place that I just saw on Wikipedia.

63
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,440
 We're flying the Carbender Coptor out there.

64
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:57,440
 Ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt

65
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:21,880
 We're coming over.

66
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:45,680
 We're going to be traveling to the other place.

67
00:03:45,680 --> 00:04:15,480
 We're going to be traveling to the other place.

68
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:45,280
 We're going to be traveling to the other place.

69
00:04:45,280 --> 00:05:15,080
 We're going to be traveling to the other place.

70
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:44,880
 We're going to be traveling to the other place.

71
00:05:44,880 --> 00:06:14,680
 We're going to be traveling to the other place.

72
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:44,480
 We're going to be traveling to the other place.

73
00:06:44,480 --> 00:07:14,280
 We're going to be traveling to the other place.

74
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:44,080
 We're going to be traveling to the other place.

75
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,880
 Never been spotted since.

76
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,280
 Is it possible these guys are all drinking Windex?

77
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,280
 Possibly, yes.

78
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,480
 But let's assume for a minute that they're not.

79
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,280
 I think the story's fascinating for two reasons.

80
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,280
 One, it's easily the biggest cryptid we've covered on Dead Ravvo Radio.

81
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:04,880
 And two, what would make a 22 foot Cyclops runaway?

82
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:11,680
 What could that monster have possibly seen to make it flee and never be seen again?

83
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,980
 That's pretty spooky.

84
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,880
 That's pretty spooky.

85
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,480
 What did it see?

86
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,580
 But yeah, so that's that story, right?

87
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,880
 So there's no other way to wrap that one up.

88
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,080
 But I think it's creepy.

89
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,480
 Not necessarily, I don't know if it's creepy, but it's definitely bizarre.

90
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,080
 So that's it.

91
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,180
 There's no way to wrap that one up.

92
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:27,980
 I just thought it was weird.

93
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,080
 Let's head and travel to Maryland now.

94
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,080
 Hop back on the Carpentercopter.

95
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,280
 We're headed out to Maryland.

96
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,280
 It's summer of 1989, same year.

97
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,580
 This year all out of that weird 1989 website.

98
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,480
 Where's all of the weird, a lot of UFO stuff.

99
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,380
 There's some Bigfoot and some other paranormal stuff.

100
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,980
 I don't think that 22 foot thing was an alien.

101
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,180
 Who knows what it was?

102
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:52,980
 Even like the biblical giants, even stuff like Goliath, this thing towered over the nephilim.

103
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,680
 That's what's so weird about it.

104
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,680
 The dimensions, it's so tall.

105
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,880
 The giant of Afghanistan, we did an episode on that was still like 9, 10 feet.

106
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,180
 This guy was like the granddaddy.

107
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,380
 Something was scaring him.

108
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,180
 Something was making him run away.

109
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,980
 Anyways, we're in Maryland now.

110
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,080
 This one I like for two reasons.

111
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,180
 This one I like for two reasons.

112
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,280
 One, it's just weird.

113
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,380
 And then two, okay, let me just read it to you.

114
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,880
 So this story was originally told in Fate magazine in the August edition, 1989.

115
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,080
 And there's so what happened?

116
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,980
 We have no names.

117
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,280
 We have no dates.

118
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,580
 So I mean, again, take it with a grain of salt, whether any of this stuff is true.

119
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:33,580
 But but anyway, so this dude is sitting at home, minding his own business, and he hears the neighbor's kid.

120
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,380
 Ah, oh, oh, no, please.

121
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,280
 What are you doing?

122
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,480
 No, no, oh, no.

123
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,880
 And the guy's like, what in the world?

124
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,380
 What is going on out there?

125
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,980
 Why is my neighbor's son all of a sudden?

126
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,880
 What's that guy?

127
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,480
 Mr. Bill from Silent Life.

128
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,780
 That's an old reference.

129
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:55,080
 He gets up and he looks out his window and he sees the neighbor kid going, oh, no, please don't.

130
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,680
 It's a little three year old boy.

131
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,980
 Stay away.

132
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,080
 Stay away.

133
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,880
 And he sees something weird in the backyard other than a boy, a frightened boy screaming.

134
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,780
 So he goes into the kid's backyard and he sees what's described as a two foot tall.

135
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,480
 Reptilian.

136
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:12,480
 Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

137
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:27,880
 Kind of walking through the backyard.

138
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:45,280
 And he's like, what's going on?

139
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:53,080
 It's this lizard thing so hard with his shovel, the head just pops off and just the thing crumples and dies.

140
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:58,280
 And then the mom comes out, the mom of the three year old boy, and was like, what in the world is going on?

141
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,980
 There's a decapitated monster in my backyard.

142
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,280
 Actually, we also got to say, why wasn't the mom out there first, right?

143
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,680
 Isn't that like the mom?

144
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:13,280
 Isn't it weird that if you have a baby bear, I did do much bear research for yesterday's episode, Bigfoot vs. Bears.

145
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:21,680
 If there's a baby bear and you step in front of the baby bear or between the baby bear and the mama bear, the mama bear kills you.

146
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:29,680
 But if a human, if there's like a kid walking on the street and you step in front of a kid or like separate a kid and a mom, mom won't even notice.

147
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,680
 Like, think about it because I don't know why that is.

148
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,680
 Like, you're on a subway and you're trying to get to your chair and you have to walk between them.

149
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,680
 You're like, Jason, are you really wondering why humans are more civilized and human women don't maul humans?

150
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,680
 Yeah, kind of.

151
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,680
 Like, why is there even a reaction?

152
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,680
 Now, I'm saying like, you, like a baby bear could walk by you, right?

153
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,680
 And you could do nothing to the bear.

154
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,680
 You're not interfering with it in any way and the mama bear will still kill you because you're somewhere near the kid.

155
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:08,680
 But in real life, you could be on a bus and there's a little kid and a mom and you can be like, walk by the kid and the mom won't even notice.

156
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:16,680
 I would even argue that you could have a conversation with the child and the mom, she'll probably think you're creepy, but she's not going to like cut your face off.

157
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,680
 I don't even think she would think of, that's my thing.

158
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,680
 It's not that I want human women to start cutting people's faces off.

159
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,680
 Do they even have the instinct to, this is what I meant to say.

160
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,680
 This is where I was going.

161
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:36,680
 Do human women have the instinct to protect their children the same way that bears have the instinct to protect their cubs?

162
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:42,680
 As in, they have to keep themselves from murdering everyone who comes near their kids.

163
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:49,680
 This is going to be a long, this is going to be a long self-isolation if my mind's already this broken.

164
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,680
 But I don't think they do.

165
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,680
 Actually, I'm pretty sure they don't because not a lot of people are killed by mommas.

166
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,680
 But like, why not?

167
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:06,680
 And also, what if a frog, what if there was a bear, a baby bear walked by, and then a frog hopped in between the baby bear and the mom?

168
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,680
 Would the mama bear kill the frog?

169
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:15,680
 Is it anything in between the cub or is it anything that the bear perceives as a threat?

170
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,680
 And if that's the case, does the bear perceive people as a threat in general?

171
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,680
 Or actually, how does a bear look at a human?

172
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,680
 Does a bear look at as a human as like another furless bear?

173
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,680
 Or do they look at us as a separate species?

174
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,680
 Or like, do they forget about us when we're not around?

175
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,680
 So when we do show up, we're just this big, giant pink thing walking in front of their kid.

176
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,680
 Also, you can pick up a dog's puppy and they don't attack you.

177
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,680
 Why are bears such jerks?

178
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,680
 I guess really, it shouldn't be why aren't human women like bears.

179
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,680
 Why are bears so mean to everybody?

180
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,680
 Because you can pick up a puppy and a dog doesn't bite you.

181
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,680
 Anyways, bears suck. That's the point of that story.

182
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,680
 What was I talking about?

183
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,680
 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, so bonk, noxious aliens head off.

184
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,680
 And then the mom is like, freak, sound she goes, "Dude, what are you going to do with this monster in my backyard?"

185
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,680
 And the guy took it to the dump.

186
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,680
 That's the end of that story.

187
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,680
 Now, I like that story for two reasons.

188
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,680
 One, I'm pretty sure I know what it is, but we'll get to that in a second too.

189
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:26,680
 Imagine if you were a lifelong seeker of the truth, a lover of cryptids, and the bizarre, and you needed to like find--

190
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,680
 I'm not mocking those people.

191
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,680
 I guess that did sound like I was mocking them, but you wanted proof.

192
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,680
 Like, I just like exploring it.

193
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,680
 I've gone beyond the fact of needing proof. I just enjoy the stories.

194
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,680
 It'd be nice, but I'm not going to go out of my way to get proof.

195
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,680
 Either you believe ghosts exist or you don't, you know?

196
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,680
 But anyways, you have people who-- that's their life journey is to find these cryptids.

197
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,680
 And then you read this in Fate Magazine about some dude who not only found one, but killed it,

198
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,680
 so he had permanent proof it wasn't going to teleport away, and then he threw it in the dump.

199
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:04,680
 Like, if I was a cryptid hunter in Maryland, I wouldn't then be going out to the swamps and looking for like the saggy swamp beast of Okie-Kunoki.

200
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,680
 I'd just be going to the city dump trying to find a rotted alien skeleton.

201
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,680
 But here's the interesting thing. I think I know what this is.

202
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,680
 I bet you anything-- it's a big ol' iguana or just a giant lizard thing.

203
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:23,680
 Like, not a lizard thing from another planet, but like some sort of gila monster who's kind of walking on two legs,

204
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,680
 or he was like perched up.

205
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,680
 Like, maybe he had a little walker with him, and he was like rolling, but he didn't bring it with him.

206
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,680
 Like, there was something in front of him and he stood on it.

207
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,680
 You're like, "That's more confusing."

208
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,680
 He just said he brought it with him.

209
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:41,680
 But I bet you anything, it was a regular old lizard that got loose somewhere,

210
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,680
 and some dude straight up murdered this guy's pet and just threw it in the dump.

211
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,680
 But either way, still an interesting story.

212
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:55,680
 Would you, if you looked out your window and you saw your neighbor's kid who's always whining and crying and playing Fortnite really, really loud,

213
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:02,680
 if you saw him about to get attacked by a two-foot-tall reptilian, would you leave what you were doing,

214
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:07,680
 grab a shovel and bash its head in, or-- yeah, you probably would.

215
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,680
 I know my audience. I think we all would. I think we all would.

216
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,680
 Anyways, let's go ahead and move on to our last story-- our last story of the day.

217
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,680
 And this one does not involve lizard. This one actually is really down to earth,

218
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,680
 and that's what makes it so much more creepy.

219
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,680
 We're taking one more trip. Let's hop in the rabbit rowboat,

220
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,680
 because we're going to be involved in a lot of water stuff here.

221
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,680
 We're headed out to Scotland. We're going to Prestwick, Scotland, to be exact.

222
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,680
 It's December 4th, 2005.

223
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,680
 And people are kind of hanging out on the beach, walking down to the beach.

224
00:16:42,680 --> 00:17:07,680
 [singing]

225
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,680
 She's from Sweden. She's recently in Scotland.

226
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:16,680
 She's lived in Edinburgh. Edinburgh, I believe it is.

227
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,680
 Anyway, she lives in the Edinburgh Place.

228
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,680
 She traveled to Prestwick, and nobody knew why she was going to Prestwick.

229
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,680
 Now, we have very limited information while she's here.

230
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,680
 We see her at the Prestwick Airport. They can follow her on the camera.

231
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,680
 [singing]

232
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,680
 And they go for her to get from this point of the airport to this point of the airport,

233
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:41,680
 and in like a minute and a half, she'd have to be running, basically, walking very, very fast.

234
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,680
 They had footage of her trying to pull money out of an ATM. She didn't have enough money in their account.

235
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,680
 She denies she puts in two different amounts. She can't pull out any cash.

236
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,680
 And then they have video of her leaving the airport.

237
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,680
 Now, the family comes out to Scotland. They're still in Sweden.

238
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,680
 They come out to Scotland, and they're like, "You know, we want to know what happened to our daughter."

239
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:06,680
 And the coroner goes, she was drowned. It was suicide. Suicide by drowning.

240
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:11,680
 The family goes, "Oh, that just doesn't seem possible."

241
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,680
 The coroner's like, "Yeah, I know, but you don't really know people's mental state,

242
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,680
 and some people can be dealing with stuff."

243
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:22,680
 And the family goes, "Yeah, I mean, we get that it's possible to kill yourself, but it's only been one day."

244
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:29,680
 And you've already come up with that ruling. The coroner goes, "Yeah, yeah, I'm suicide by drowning."

245
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,680
 You did a post-mortem on it, right? You did an autopsy on the body. No!

246
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,680
 No, suicide by drowning. Case closed. What?

247
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:44,680
 Annie's body had bruises on it. Well, that's because she was drowning. She's banging up against rocks.

248
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:51,680
 She's found on the beach wet. She's drowned. Yeah, well, we can agree on that, but...

249
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:57,680
 You're saying she walked out into the water or jumped off into the water, drowned on purpose,

250
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,680
 got washed up on the beach. Yeah, that's my ruling.

251
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,680
 Then why is her handbag washed up next to her?

252
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:11,680
 Family gets access to Annie's emails. Everything's deleted.

253
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,680
 The family tries tracking down phone calls she may have made to people.

254
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:23,680
 Phone logs deleted. Phone calls that they know were made weren't registered in her phone log.

255
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:29,680
 Police say, "Oh, no, we have records of her calling you guys before the accident."

256
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,680
 The family goes, "We didn't get any phone calls from her."

257
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:39,680
 At all. And then while the family is trying to investigate their daughter's death,

258
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,680
 they start to experience phone problems and email problems.

259
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:49,680
 Now, as a skeptic, I'm going to say this. That may be not necessarily connected.

260
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:55,680
 Because if something's going on, tragic in your life, and all of a sudden your phone calls start dropping,

261
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,680
 your phone calls may drop every few months and you don't really notice it.

262
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:04,680
 But when something tragic is going on or you send an email and it doesn't get sent out right away,

263
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:09,680
 that I'm a little skeptical on. But they are reporting these things as well.

264
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:15,680
 I'm just putting that in as a little... My skeptic hat kind of went off on that.

265
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:21,680
 That happened in 2005. Now we're in 2020. There's Sky News, which is the...

266
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:26,680
 It's like a media company. Sky News is a media company in Europe.

267
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,680
 So Sky News starts this podcast, "What Happened to Annie?"

268
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:36,680
 So now you have a group of journalists working with the family to try to figure out how this woman died.

269
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,680
 And now it may be the podcast goes, "Maybe she did kill herself."

270
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:45,680
 People do kill themselves and it's not impossible for all of these things to happen.

271
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,680
 The purse has to wash up somewhere, right?

272
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,680
 And if her body is washed up with the tide and the purse is...

273
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,680
 The purse is just not going to magically disappear. It has to end up somewhere on the beach.

274
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:00,680
 And the purse being near the body, what's near the body? 10 feet, 20 feet, 1 foot on top of the body?

275
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:05,680
 We don't know. So we need to actually investigate this.

276
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,680
 Could be something more. It could actually be drowning. The podcast investigates this.

277
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,680
 They go and they start petitioning the Swedish government and the Scottish government

278
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,680
 for documents pertaining to this case.

279
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,680
 "What Happened to Annie?" is the name of the podcast.

280
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:24,680
 We're not saying she was murdered. We just want to know for sure.

281
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:29,680
 So about a week ago, the Swedish government released this statement.

282
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:35,680
 The Swedish government, the Swedish foreign ministry is involved in this now.

283
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,680
 Released a statement involving this 30-year-old woman who washed up dead on the beach.

284
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:45,680
 "Information has been deemed classified as secret,"

285
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:51,680
 according to the provision of Chapter 15, Section 1 of the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act,

286
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,680
 "and has been redacted to the attached file."

287
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:00,680
 The reason for this is that the information concerns Sweden's relations with a foreign state

288
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:07,680
 and a foreign authority, and it can be assumed that a disclosure will damage Sweden's international relations

289
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:13,680
 or, in other ways, harm national interests.

290
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:17,680
 Sweden hands over the documents to the podcast.

291
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:23,680
 It's nearly completely redacted, including the official cause of death.

292
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:30,680
 Can't tell you what it is. It'll damage Sweden's standing with at least one other nation.

293
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,680
 This woman wasn't a spy. She wasn't a journalist.

294
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,680
 She was just a person.

295
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:43,680
 What's interesting about this story is, one, how high up it's gone.

296
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,680
 And really, the podcast is at a standstill. This is all the information they can get.

297
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,680
 And you have to think, here's a couple different scenarios.

298
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:55,680
 One, she did kill herself, and that almost is out the window now.

299
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:00,680
 Because then, "Why is the Swedish government like, 'Uh-uh, we don't want to know people from Sweden kill themselves.

300
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,680
 It'll damage us with foreign governments.'"

301
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,680
 It's possible she saw something she wasn't supposed to see.

302
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,680
 She was taken out by some spooks. That's one scenario.

303
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,680
 Two, it's organized crime, organized crime that may have ties to some government,

304
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,680
 and it's some sort of that even you get really tied into conspiracies.

305
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,680
 One of the interesting, because a lot of people are putting out theories for this one,

306
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:27,680
 one of the interesting theories is, there is a reporter named Christina Borgensen.

307
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:32,680
 So, not exactly the same name, not exactly the same name at all.

308
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:42,680
 But some people believe that Annie Borgesen and Christina Borgesen were confused at some level.

309
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:56,680
 Because at the same time in 2015, Christina Borgesen, a journalist, was exposing a story which Scotland and the United States deny.

310
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,680
 Absolutely deny this story.

311
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:08,680
 But, Christina said that Prestwick Airport in Scotland was being used by the CIA for rendition flights.

312
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:14,680
 Rendition is where you would arrest terrorists, you take prisoners in a combat zone.

313
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:22,680
 So, Afghanistan, Iraq, America officially does not torture people.

314
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:27,680
 But we have allies that do torture you, so we're going to put you on a plane,

315
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:32,680
 we're going to take you to Turkey, and we're going to let them torture you,

316
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,680
 and then we'll get all the information we want.

317
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,680
 And yeah, waterboarding and enhanced interrogation was the term they used,

318
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:43,680
 but CIA would do stuff like sleep deprivation or waterboarding,

319
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:49,680
 so we're talking torture, torture to get information.

320
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,680
 Black sites, CIA black sites, that's not a conspiracy theory.

321
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,680
 That was one of the big news stories that came out of the Iraq war.

322
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:02,680
 Journalists worked really, really hard to uncover rendition flights and black sites and all this stuff.

323
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:08,680
 We're CIA, they can take you to a country where torture is legal.

324
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:12,680
 Drop you off there, have a CIA agent on site, or maybe even not.

325
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,680
 Maybe just let them get the information out of you.

326
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:24,680
 So, they believe that this reporter was investigating rendition flights at that airport,

327
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:31,680
 and maybe the CIA or some other group went to kill her, got the wrong girl.

328
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,680
 It's possible.

329
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,680
 This is always a scenario that usually gets overlooked.

330
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:43,680
 The CIA wants to silence Christina, but if she disappears, it looks too on the nose.

331
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:48,680
 So, you kill someone with a similar name.

332
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,680
 Let's say that the Illuminati wanted to shut up Dead Rabbit Radio

333
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:57,680
 because they revealed too many truths about that reptilians are really just iguanas with walkers.

334
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,680
 They kill someone named Mason Marpenter.

335
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,680
 In a public weird way, right?

336
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,680
 Mason Marpenter gets beheaded at Mall of America.

337
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:11,680
 "Uhhh, should stop revealing the truth."

338
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,680
 That's a theory.

339
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:24,680
 But it's also possible that Annie saw proof of one of these rendition flights herself at the airport.

340
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:31,680
 She saw something, looked through an open door, looked down a hallway she shouldn't have been,

341
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,680
 and caught a glimpse of something going on she shouldn't have seen.

342
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,680
 Who knows?

343
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:45,680
 The fact is, the government of Sweden doesn't want us to know why.

344
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:53,680
 Knowing why, and even how she died, could damage Sweden's standing with the world.

345
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:58,680
 So even if it does have something to do with the rendition flights,

346
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:09,680
 why is Sweden afraid that it's going to hurt them if the United States was pushing stuff through Scotland?

347
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:15,680
 I think the one thing you can hope for if you ever get kidnapped or murdered or something like that

348
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,680
 in your final moments is justice, is fairness in the universe.

349
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:26,680
 Sure, this serial killer may shoot me in the face, but as the bullet's penetrating my brain,

350
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,680
 I know you're going to fry.

351
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,680
 You're going to get caught.

352
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:36,680
 You're going to pay for this.

353
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:41,680
 Now, I personally believe you pay for it in this life or the next, or both.

354
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,680
 You may live the rest of your life sitting on the beach.

355
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:51,680
 Nothing ever happened to you, but then in the end you will pay for it.

356
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:59,680
 But outside of my sense of cosmic justice, here on Earth, you want your death to be avenged.

357
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,680
 If not avenged, at least understood.

358
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:08,680
 At least some loved ones having peace with how you died.

359
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:14,680
 But when you have multiple governments keeping your family from having that sense of peace,

360
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:18,680
 you have to wonder, is there any justice for this family?

361
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:25,680
 All they want to know is what happened to Annie.

362
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,680
