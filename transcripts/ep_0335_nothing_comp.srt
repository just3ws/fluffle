1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
 queer ghosts and queer ghost hunters

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,080
 bees

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,400
 Interrupt your civil rights in Britain and

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:18,280
 Then we take a trip to the farthest reaches of space with the Mandalorian conspiracy today on Dead Rabbit Radio

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,160
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day

6
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,560
 I hope you guys are having a great day too

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,600
 I know I often say that this is gonna be a short episode because I'm not feeling good

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,320
 This is gonna be a short episode because I'm not feeling good and it's funny because every time I say it's gonna be a short episode

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,720
 It ends up being like 35 minutes long

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,800
 I think you can tell from the sound of my voice that I'm really on my last leg as far as

11
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,880
 Sore throat health I need to go to bed as soon as I can but I wanted to get this episode out for you

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,160
 And I previously just got then recording 15 minutes of stuff and was like yeah, I don't like it

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,160
 So I'm starting over I'm starting over for you guys my friends

14
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,440
 Yesterday's episode I finished off with the story about queer ghost hunters

15
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:16,600
 I teased you he gave you a little tickle little little tickle tickle about queer ghost hunters and what's interesting

16
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,720
 We're not gonna spend a ton of time on these guys because I kind of think it might be a joke. It's really really hard to tell

17
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:29,360
 Queer ghost hunters you go. Oh, it's a bunch of queer people that are hunting ghosts. That's interesting

18
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,960
 Well, they are that they are a bunch of queer people interviewing not interviewing

19
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,640
 Investing what am I what's oh man? I'm so tired

20
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,440
 Hunting ghosts queer people hunting ghosts. That's the name queer ghost hunters. They're not queer ghost interviewers

21
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,320
 So they're not just queer people who hunt ghosts. They're queer people

22
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,840
 They're queer people who hunt ghosts, but the ghosts they hunt are

23
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,000
 Gay like they hunt gay ghosts and and lesbian ghosts and stuff like that

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,200
 Which oh which brings up a whole bunch of questions and I'll get to those in a second, but

25
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,920
 This is their logic when ghost hunters show up at a place

26
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:11,880
 They're like how many women have you slept with and the ghost will be like oh five or whatever little EVP farve

27
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,040
 And they said well, that's weird that every time someone shows up

28
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,560
 They ask a ghost if it's a man if he was married if it's a woman they ask if it was a husband now

29
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,160
 What's funny is I'd have never really heard that I've never when I used to watch a lot of ghost hunting shows

30
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,560
 I never hear them show up and be like so

31
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:35,600
 Did you like blonde or brunette women like I think that might be something that they perceived was going on

32
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:41,840
 But I don't know I've never seen that at least, but I'm not saying it's not happening. I've just never been aware of that

33
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,200
 And they said that if you think about this why I thought was kind of funny

34
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,240
 If you think and it's true in a sense if you think about the most haunted places

35
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,520
 It's places where gay people

36
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,960
 hung out the most

37
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,960
 you have

38
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,840
 theaters like big ballrooms and stuff like that and a bunch of gay dudes hanging out there

39
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,240
 Operas stuff like that theaters operas big fancy mansions

40
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,880
 That one's a little more iffy because big fancy mansions were just where rich people hung out insane

41
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,080
 Asylum's in prisons though

42
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:21,480
 Which I mean there was a point in time where if you were gay you did get sent to the insane asylum

43
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,160
 And it was you know sodomy was a crime now those last two

44
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:32,360
 Here's the thing this is the thing I this is the thing really that's the most interesting thing about this

45
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:41,960
 They self-identifying 4.5 percent of the population I self-identifies as LGBT queer people

46
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:48,600
 So even in a in the world of the paranormal you're still gonna scale that in

47
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:55,400
 So in the amount of which which not every human being leaves a ghost just right off the bat and

48
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,920
 Out of those ghosts you would figure five maybe high-ball at 10% of all the ghosts that can be encountered are

49
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,000
 Queer so you're actually making it even harder for you to find ghosts

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,200
 But they have this YouTube show

51
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,960
 Like two and a half seasons long. They're still trying to get new episodes

52
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,680
 Where they keep running into gay ghosts and you go Jason. How do they know they're gay?

53
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,600
 Well, they have these

54
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
 dowsing rods and they go

55
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,080
 Are you gay and then the rods move and they're like oh lesbian lesbian ghost

56
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,880
 Which again, I think the whole thing might be made up

57
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:39,000
 They did raid third they they did raise $35,000 on Kickstarter and they currently have a patreon going

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,640
 Part of me part of me thinks it's a parody

59
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:50,440
 But it could be real but here's my questions about it one first off ghosts are incredibly hard to hunt hunt in the first place

60
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,320
 You're making it even harder if you only want to find queer ghosts secondly

61
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,840
 What's the ethical ramifications of outing someone after they're dead?

62
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,000
 Because they don't I mean a ghost from the 1800s. They'll be like we're gay. They went to a

63
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,560
 They went to a nun graveyard and they go there's a bunch of lesbian nuns nuns

64
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,320
 They were a lot of lesbian nuns out there, which I don't know statistics on lesbian

65
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,800
 I don't know the Venn diagram between lesbians and nuns

66
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,580
 But anyways they go to a nun graveyard and they're just walking around the graveyard going we're gay

67
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:27,960
 We are gay so feel comfortable talking to us come to the back of our van

68
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,080
 Sit in our van and talk to it if I was from the 1800s and I was a gay nun

69
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,240
 I could be like oh what and I and they're doing in the middle of the day

70
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,220
 Which was weird too like oh and then you crawl out of your grave your little ghost crawls out of your grave

71
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:44,600
 And then you're like telling them yeah, I'm gay and then you go back to sleep or wherever you go

72
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,680
 They don't understand they're on YouTube. They don't understand video cameras or anything like that

73
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,280
 So outing someone after their death is that there was one where the guys was like

74
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:00,240
 Who do you think is cute in the group or do you think Mike they're talking to a guy ghost and there's three guys in the room

75
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,000
 And they're like which one of us do you think is cute and it's like

76
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,600
 Mikey and he's like oh they just see they're

77
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:14,000
 Well, I think that parts made up to like that's the whole that's the weirdest thing about this like

78
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,500
 It's so hard to get a ghost to just admit what its name is but this one is like giving it relationship advice

79
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:26,080
 Being like I love your shirt like though. I think it's a setup. I really think it's a wind up

80
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,820
 But it raises some interesting questions one

81
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:34,800
 Does your sexuality go with your spirit I

82
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,620
 Think there's a lot of stuff

83
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,240
 That we assign biological traits to that would have no

84
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,640
 Relevancy to be in a ghost. Let me say this to

85
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,320
 John Jack London did not write cannery row. That was John Steinbeck. I looked that up afterwards

86
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:57,780
 I had a sneaking suspicion while I was doing some editing. I go great. So

87
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:02,020
 Jack London did not write cannery row that was on yesterday's episode

88
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:08,540
 But on yesterday's episode I said that ghosts may just be these forms that then we put a physical

89
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,580
 presentation on top of that's why famous people

90
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:19,280
 Show up looking as you remember to Marilyn Marilyn Monroe's ghost is an uploaded fat gross

91
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,100
 Blob because she has she laid in her own organ

92
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:29,640
 She what's that thing called when you get all purple not not holding your breath

93
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:35,840
 Well, that happens when you die too, but rig a mortis if you saw her ghost, she'd be all glamorous. I

94
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:43,080
 Think the idea of like there might be some forms out there that we're putting thought projections on and

95
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,920
 That's why we would see a white ghost as a white dude and a black ghost as a black ghost

96
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:54,940
 But why would the soul matter in that case the actual soul

97
00:07:54,940 --> 00:08:01,920
 The the energy that is existing outside the body would if it's black or white

98
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:08,600
 Then what if the ghost as a living person had Down syndrome does the ghost have Down syndrome if

99
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,160
 the ghost was

100
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:21,400
 If you had somebody who had both their arms chopped off and they died their ghost wouldn't have both their arms chopped off

101
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:28,240
 I'm thinking that right because otherwise everyone who died would basically it'd be like Beetlegees

102
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,440
 She would be the death you'd be a ghost of your

103
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:39,420
 Of your body, so I don't it's so why is it that you would see a oh an Asian ghost

104
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:44,460
 Appear like an Asian man and a white ghost appear like an Asian man

105
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,820
 No white ghost would appear as a white man

106
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:55,740
 But how does that of that's your that's the physical body that shouldn't affect what the soul looks like I

107
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:02,720
 Don't imagine if a guy who's three feet tall his soul is not three feet tall

108
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:11,280
 So if the biological and that and I you can you can we can argue about that because obviously that's not what we see

109
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,560
 When you see a ghost of George Washington

110
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:22,720
 It looks like George Washington, but I think that is just our representation or our perceiving the energy that's actually there

111
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,840
 So extrapolating that further

112
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:36,420
 Sexuality is who we are your your your sexual preference. I guess it should say is who you are attracted to

113
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,460
 It's who your body reacts to

114
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:48,720
 When I see an attractive woman walking down the street my body reacts to that whether it's my eye my eyes go

115
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,960
 My blood pressure goes up whatever like I'll see an attractive woman

116
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,640
 I will feel an attraction towards her like physically and I'm not talking about pop it

117
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,640
 You know, I'm not talking about you know getting a boner

118
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:10,320
 I'm talking about I can feel my body react to a beautiful woman in my presence or a beautiful woman walking 50 yards away

119
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:17,160
 But those are biological markers. There's it's a biological thing. That's happening when I'm seeing a woman. I want to mate with

120
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,120
 my ghost

121
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,600
 Would my ghost be like a

122
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:33,340
 Little cartoon ghost eyes. I don't think so. I don't think your sexuality is

123
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:37,140
 such an important component of

124
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,580
 Your soul

125
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:43,320
 Because your soul if you imagine if you think about something like the Tree of Life

126
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,060
 We're not getting to the other two stories

127
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,160
 By the way, you talk about something like the Tree of Life that we've discussed before

128
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,220
 The soul exists before your body and

129
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,720
 Then your soul is in your body and it may exist by

130
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:03,940
 Millennial or it may exist by simply moments, but your soul goes into your body and then it leaves when you die

131
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,320
 so your soul is

132
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,160
 Beyond sexual preference. It's be if in

133
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:20,660
 Living times if while I'm alive. I love to eat chili beans and rice and then I die and my soul is has that same dietary preference

134
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:25,460
 And but all that's there to eat is nothing because I'm a ghost

135
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:32,700
 The dietary preference doesn't carry over either. I don't I this might this might sound super rambly

136
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,780
 But I feel like I'm trying to put my thoughts together while we're constructing this you're like Jason

137
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,920
 This might be the least funny episode and I apologize for that also. I'm sick, but

138
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,060
 the

139
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,340
 idea of your preferences

140
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,140
 existing before or after

141
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,740
 you die seems

142
00:11:50,740 --> 00:12:00,940
 Universally such a minute thing and then I feel the same thing what about race or or your sex or your gender I

143
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:05,940
 Feel that none of I feel that the soul itself is

144
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,500
 Neither male nor female or both

145
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:15,800
 It's neither white black eastern European Persian. It's all of those and nothing

146
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:21,360
 Most likely nothing is most likely not both male and female. It's simply transcended that

147
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,840
 So I don't think you could have a straight ghost or a gay ghost

148
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,080
 You could have a ghost of someone who was gay who died

149
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:33,480
 But I don't think the ghost is still like search, you know going on grinder the same way

150
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,160
 I don't think that a straight ghost would be going on Tinder

151
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,160
 I

152
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:46,600
 Course I have absolutely nothing to back any of that up. I just find it in I find it interesting that

153
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:52,220
 In the realm of ghosts these questions don't really get asked

154
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:57,720
 Let me ask you this - this is an interesting question if a trans woman died

155
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,960
 Would her ghost

156
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,720
 be a trans woman or a woman who was born a woman?

157
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
 There's tons of questions

158
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,640
 Because what would be the what would be the represent?

159
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:19,760
 Let's say I'm totally wrong with my idea that souls have no sexual preference no dietary preference no race

160
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,960
 Nothing like say I'm totally wrong and all that and if you're a white dude and you die your ghost is a white dude in

161
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:34,720
 That theory if you're a trans woman or a trans man and you die is your ghost that of a trans woman or trans man or

162
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,280
 a

163
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,720
 Woman who was born a woman or a man who was born a man. How would your ghost?

164
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,640
 Be what is your ghost? What is your soul on that level?

165
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:51,640
 So as much as I think the queer ghost hunters is a parody because and they don't seem to be fair

166
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:56,960
 They seem like a lovable bunch of ragamuffins and they don't seem to take themselves super seriously

167
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:02,880
 And I think that's why I keep leaning on the parody thing because in the beginning the like during their credits

168
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,680
 They kind of do the serious pose like the ghost hunter shows and they kind of start laughing so you're like they don't take themselves

169
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,680
 That's you seriously

170
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,160
 But they raise a whole host of questions

171
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,080
 What survives death

172
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:22,640
 What survives death and it's one of those things that will never know obviously

173
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:28,480
 But I guess as long as you have groups they're not as far as I saw I watched a couple episodes

174
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,040
 So they're not actively and asking these questions as far as I saw but having these kind of groups that are kind of

175
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,360
 Not traditional ghost sending groups

176
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,680
 It is it does kind of make you think about the stuff on a different level

177
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,000
 So I congratulate them for that. Maybe we do have time for the last two stories here

178
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,480
 But I do have to go soon because I'm super sick

179
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,960
 Bees

180
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:54,840
 Let's leave behind the queer ghosts the queer ghost hunters. We're gonna go to Britain and

181
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,620
 There's a bunch of bees flying around right I'm gonna try to get a little bit of humor in this one

182
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:05,040
 Cuz that one was just sounding like like I was super stoned and just going off the top of my head

183
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,640
 Which to be fair I was going off the top of my head, but not super stoned

184
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:14,360
 Here I don't even need to do bees. Yeah, I've already told you that right bunch of bees flying around

185
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,640
 Here is the thing this might

186
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:24,800
 I'm so tired. Okay. Where did you go bee be notes? I actually had to take notes for this hold on in

187
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:33,640
 1980 Britain the the most police state in Europe. I swear to God these guys are so brutal in 1980

188
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,680
 They enacted the bee act

189
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,080
 Which means

190
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:47,240
 If the authorities think there are bees in your home they can go in without a search warrant

191
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:54,080
 Not only can they go in your home it is it is it is specified

192
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,480
 They can also go into any vessel

193
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,520
 boat

194
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:05,880
 Hovercraft aircraft what are they chasing down co-ver commander or vehicle of any other description

195
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:11,680
 In which he has reasonable grounds for supposing there are or have been bees or

196
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:18,480
 Other things subject to control under an order under that section. So probably like wasps hornets

197
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:25,560
 Yeah, all they have to do is show a badge if they think be if they think you had bees in your hovercraft aircraft

198
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:31,440
 They just show a badge and then they kick down your door and get in now. Hopefully

199
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:38,240
 I'm just about to give up on this episode

200
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,280
 Okay, let's move on to our next story

201
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,680
 You know what jokes bad when you don't even finish it

202
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,280
 Let's just get on with the next story so I can go to bed

203
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,520
 You'll have to email me and you'll have to say hey Jason

204
00:16:53,520 --> 00:17:01,360
 We would rather not have an episode than an episode where you're one clearly dying and to

205
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,980
 Barely trying so let me know in the comments like share subscribe this video

206
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,320
 Share it with your friends. Maybe not this one

207
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,240
 Mandalorian the Mandalorian

208
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,280
 You know you guys hear me talk about this is our last story

209
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,920
 You guys have heard me talk about Disney in the past

210
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:28,920
 Usually I taught I say I watch a lot of Disney stuff, but every show often I'll make a comment like they're I

211
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,600
 Said that they were I

212
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,680
 used Disney of

213
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,680
 Faking death threats against theater that were showing the Joker I

214
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:44,880
 Reference that Mickey Mouse may be a representation of the ultimate evil a summoning spirit. That was a long time ago

215
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,080
 all sorts of stuff and I also

216
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,480
 quite often make fun of

217
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,840
 The new the sequel trilogy Star Wars movies both on the show in real life. I've never seen any of them

218
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:01,200
 I've never seen Force Awakens the last Jedi. I've read the plots and they sound super stupid and

219
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,160
 I never saw Rogue one

220
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,600
 I have seen that Darth Vader scene quite a few times like near near when he's walking on the hallway and

221
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,120
 I watched a little bit of Han Solo

222
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,560
 And I thought it all pretty much sucked except the Darth Vader scene was cool

223
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:20,720
 But I had no interest in watching any of the Disney Star Wars stuff. I was a huge fan of the original trilogy

224
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,720
 I'm actually a fan of the prequels and

225
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,600
 So

226
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,960
 But I really wanted to see the Mandalorian and I do watch a lot of Disney stuff

227
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:35,320
 So I recently signed up for Disney Plus Disney Plus is the service that you too can subscribe to for just 699 and one

228
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,320
 If you use the promo code dead rabbit

229
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,120
 You'll get nothing off because it doesn't exist. Anyways

230
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,120
 So I got Disney Plus

231
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,120
 I got it because I wanted I was really curious about the Mandalorian

232
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,880
 But at 30 years of Simpson episodes plus all the other Disney Channel stuff

233
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,800
 I watched all that stuff is included in their basic package for 699 a month

234
00:18:53,800 --> 00:19:02,000
 So I watched the episode of the Mandalorian now what was interesting was I began to snoop around and check out stuff

235
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,280
 see what other people thought about Mandalorian YouTube videos Easter eggs stuff like that and

236
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:13,680
 Just clicking on randomly I found a couple of them and they said the comment. Hey listen man not a fan

237
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,620
 Basically what I just said I'm not a fan of the new sequel, but this

238
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:24,640
 Mandalorian show this Mandalorian show reminds you why you love Star Wars this Mandalorian show is a love letter to the fan

239
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,520
 And I heard that on a couple different YouTube videos and I thought

240
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,880
 Disney's paying people to say this

241
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,400
 Like this is weird because they're using kind of the same terminology

242
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,800
 Now I have to say two things to this one obviously I have no proof of that

243
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:46,280
 But it seems like it's right up a wheelhouse Disney totally screwed up Star Wars with the last Jedi

244
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:52,200
 They were already people were okay with the Force Awakens. I thought it was stupid that they just told the same story first order

245
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,080
 Resistance rebel I thought all this stuff was dumb thought all this was super stupid

246
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:02,180
 I thought it was a total fake out or they made it look like Finn was going to be the next Jedi and then he's like

247
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:08,920
 Or and then Ray gets the sword you're like what like even on the posters he had the lightsaber really kind of just a weird

248
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,040
 I stormtrooper being a Jedi. I thought was an interesting concept

249
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,560
 but anyways I

250
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:20,680
 Totally screwed it up with the last Jedi to the point that Han Solo was a huge flop and

251
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:27,200
 The last Jedi didn't make as much money and no matter how much they spin it people are now coming out and saying how much they

252
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,440
 Don't like that movie even though these same people at the time were defending the last Jedi

253
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,960
 Which again makes me think that Disney was pumping money into these YouTube people

254
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,880
 To prop to prop it up and to say if you don't like last Jedi

255
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:46,800
 It's because you have a defect of a personality the last Jedi is actually this totally great subversive film this slow-speed chase

256
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,760
 Through space that takes place in about eight hours. What a great epic Star Wars movie, but anyways

257
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:58,160
 Mandalorian comes out and all of a sudden the thing has changed. Oh those sequels boo

258
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:05,920
 This reminds you why you liked Star Wars this reminds you why you like sorry and that's actually a perfect marketing thing and

259
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:11,720
 Disney's always had this conspiracy around them that were not always but fairly recently

260
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,440
 That they're manipulating

261
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,560
 ratings and rotten tomatoes and

262
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,640
 basically social engineering people Batman vs. Superman

263
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:27,960
 Civil war yay, and you look at all the reviews and people's reactions saw this up Batman vs. Superman is

264
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,960
 200 times better than Civil War

265
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,640
 now

266
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,780
 It wasn't a very well constructed film, but what it tried to do is basically the difference between

267
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:43,640
 watching someone try to jump the Grand Canyon and

268
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,400
 Only making it halfway

269
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,960
 Versus someone on a three-foot slip and slide in the backyard

270
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,080
 that's the difference between Civil War and and Batman vs. Superman

271
00:21:54,520 --> 00:22:01,600
 This idea that you shoot for the stars at least she'll hit the moon Civil War was basically like oh remember those dudes

272
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:08,400
 Anyways anyways, I think Disney does prop up their properties and now they realize that the last shit

273
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,960
 I sucked they have to admit to that I think they knew it early on but anyways now they're telling people

274
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:20,240
 Hey and subscribe to Disney plus six ninety nine a month and you'll get to watch this new show if you're a true Star Wars fan

275
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,600
 This is this is what it is. I think that Disney is

276
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:31,320
 Do and run in the same game, but now they're actually pooping all over their past properties to get support for this one

277
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,200
 Because people are using that same terminology

278
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:40,320
 What's weird too is that

279
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,240
 They're kind of right

280
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,600
 like I really really enjoyed the Mandalorian and it reminded me of

281
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:54,440
 Old Star Wars it reminded me of the original trilogy the way that it looked the way that it felt

282
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,160
 so really really well put together television show and

283
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,120
 It's not doesn't dumb stuff down

284
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:10,240
 There's a scene. This isn't a spoiler Mandalorian walks into a room. This takes place like five or six years after return

285
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,360
 Mandalorian walks into the room and there's a guy sitting behind a desk

286
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:23,040
 There's four stormtroopers and their armor is totally dirty and scuffed up not battle scarred like actually dirty

287
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:29,160
 And they're standing around and one of them looks a little skinnier than you would imagine a stormtrooper to be

288
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,680
 That's it

289
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,640
 They just kind of stand there and there's this little meeting and

290
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,120
 Then he leaves

291
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,760
 Now a dumb television show before he went there. They would have been like hey look out about this guy

292
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:47,320
 He's hired rogue Empire soldiers after the fall of the Empire

293
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,680
 They needed something to do and you'd be like okay

294
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:57,400
 So they're actually like old stormtroopers or a guy could have said yeah the guy rolls with stormtroopers

295
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,200
 Turns out it's just a bunch of bandits who found some armor

296
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,960
 But still they might shoot you in the back and you'd be like oh then these guys are you you don't know the movie

297
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,960
 The show is really good at just like putting you in a room

298
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,240
 Using terminology you don't know and you're kind of like well, I guess I guess that means a bucket

299
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,760
 I guess that means something you put it in I don't really understand what they're talking about

300
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,360
 So the show is actually pretty smart as far as that goes but

301
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:28,240
 Yeah, I and the whole episode is like that. It's just it assumes you are a resident of this galaxy

302
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,600
 So you should know what they're talking about very very well done show

303
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,520
 But does that mean that

304
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:43,920
 There is no conspiracy doesn't mean that Disney is not I just realized that this has nothing to do with the topic of the show

305
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,960
 I just am talking about Mandalorian at this point

306
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,320
 Does this might honestly be this I'm not even going to title this episode anything

307
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,480
 This is a this is an episode. This is a spin-off for a new podcast

308
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,280
 This is the lost episode

309
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:03,520
 Does that mean that Disney actually is a spin-off for a new podcast?

310
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,280
 Does that mean that Disney actually isn't pulling a conspiracy? I

311
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,200
 am almost for certain that Disney is paying people to say

312
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,480
 All of our other stuff sucked

313
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,400
 But this is the good one and the sad thing is is that they've been working on this bounty hunter show for like 10 years

314
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,080
 I remember hearing about HBO going to have a star war show focusing on bounty hunters

315
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,640
 If this had come out first

316
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,760
 And it was a hit which I am sure it's shaping up to be

317
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:35,200
 It would totally change the whole dynamic of these prequel these sequel movies that are just rehashes

318
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,560
 Death stars and stuff like that totally would have changed look. I think it's directed by the guy who did a lot of the clone war stuff

319
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:46,800
 But anyways, it didn't it came out after we had to sit through princess layoff flying through space

320
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,600
 and all that other stuff so

321
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,480
 Is Disney committing a conspiracy?

322
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:58,080
 To get people to watch their show probably it's it's actually now that I say it's not a conspiracy

323
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,040
 It's called marketing. You know what?

324
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:09,520
 This episode has completely gone off the rails. I apologize, but

325
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,920
 Here's the dilemma. Do I release this episode?

326
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:20,480
 Knowing that it's it's it's barely functional as an episode it barely works

327
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,280
 or

328
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:28,080
 Do I put a message on twitter saying sorry guys not feeling good. No episode tonight

329
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,800
 If

330
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,440
 You're hearing this episode

331
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,800
 Then you know which decision I made obviously

332
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,040
 I'm going to get a good night's sleep

333
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:48,240
 And I will be back monday with it with a relevant episode an episode that makes sense

334
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:55,520
