00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
 As a mysterious illness sweeps over a girl's school in Mexico, the federal government is forced to step in.

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,280
 But as investigators take a closer look, is it mass hysteria or witchcraft?

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,200
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:22,880
 [music]

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,280
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:35,200
 We've got a lot of stuff to cover. We actually only doing one story this episode, which is pretty rare.

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,600
 But what we're taking a look at, you gotta have time for it to breathe.

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,280
 So let's go ahead and get started here.

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,240
 First off, I want to give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Hunter McCarthy.

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,760
 Hunter, I really, really appreciate the support and means a lot.

12
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:56,240
 You are going to be our chauffeur, our pilot. Whatever vehicle we use this episode, you are going to be in command.

13
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. Just help get the word out about the show.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,920
 That really, really helps out a lot.

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,320
 Now, this story was recommended to me by Vince G via email.

16
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,960
 It was a great story. Vince, thank you so much for sending it over.

17
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,720
 And I have to say this too, almost the entire story, almost all the information I got,

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,800
 came from an amazing article on Vox called The Haunting of Girls Town by Daniel Hernandez.

19
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,200
 So I want to give a shout out to Daniel for doing the legwork to get all this information out.

20
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,240
 Because this story, this story is really cool.

21
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,160
 Hunter, let's go ahead and fire up that carbonicopter.

22
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:37,200
 We're leaving behind sunny, flowerful, that's not a word, sunny, a bunch of flowers in Oregon.

23
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,480
 We're leaving, you know, everything's blooming. It's super hot.

24
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:46,080
 And we're going to Mexico, which is known for its moderate temperature and never being hot at all.

25
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,160
 We're also going back in time. We're going back to October 2006.

26
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,320
 So Hunter hit that time travel button right there.

27
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,520
 We're flying over Mexico, specifically we're flying over the town of Chaco.

28
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,840
 Now in Chaco, there is a all girls school known as Villa de la Nimas,

29
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,440
 which basically means city of girls or city of all girls or something like that.

30
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,880
 I think Villa House, House of Girls, maybe, maybe not a city.

31
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,640
 Maybe that's two ambitious population of one million girls.

32
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,640
 There was a dude back in the 50s, 60s. He traveled all over the world.

33
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,280
 And he was setting up girls towns and boys towns.

34
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,640
 He sets them up in the Philippines. There's like 15 locations worldwide.

35
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,520
 And one of the last schools he was able to open, his health was failing.

36
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,840
 One of the last schools he was able to open was this school in Mexico.

37
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,840
 This one was set up in 1990. And like I said, he was getting sick.

38
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,960
 He's like, I can't finish this dude. He's like putting the bricks down himself.

39
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,680
 They're like, sir, sir, you just have to like lead the design team.

40
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,200
 He's like, no, must establish it myself, driving the backhoe.

41
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,160
 Eventually though, he has this quote. He says quote.

42
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,200
 "There was a lingering doubt and a nagging concern that I was making a mistake.

43
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,760
 Perhaps the biggest mistake in my life."

44
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,680
 And he called the Villa de las Nenas his unfinished symphony.

45
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,680
 But he does have to stop building the school.

46
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,840
 They actually got a construction team to come in.

47
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,480
 They're like, okay, now we can actually build this on schedule.

48
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,680
 This old man's hobbling away. They're like, come on, bring in the bulldozers.

49
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,720
 Let's knock over this wall. It took them 10 years to put up.

50
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,000
 They finished the school.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,080
 But he does have that thing in his head.

52
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,800
 He's like, I don't really think something's right here.

53
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,560
 Don't think something's right.

54
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,000
 But he's able to set up all these schools all over the world.

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,960
 And what it was was they would go to places of horrible poverty

56
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,760
 and try to lift kids out of poverty.

57
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,000
 So that was a whole mission.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,080
 So Hunter, let's go ahead and land our carpenter copter at this campus.

59
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:52,000
 The Villa beautifully manicured lawns, very ornate architecture stuff.

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,480
 There's like statues and like buildings.

61
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,080
 Because most other places don't have buildings.

62
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,760
 It's a stark reminder of what is possible with the power of hope.

63
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:09,280
 Because it's basically surrounded by like open sewage treatment areas in a smelly part of town.

64
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,120
 But they built this beautiful thing there.

65
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,720
 They probably could have planned that part out better.

66
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,320
 But I'm sure it's just really cheap.

67
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,320
 And so, but you have this beautiful campus and you have these huge gates.

68
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,960
 And it's a symbol of what hard work and God's grace can give you.

69
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,840
 Now, they would get kids from all over Mexico.

70
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,040
 This one was all girls.

71
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,040
 So specifically a girls town.

72
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,000
 They would get kids from all over Mexico.

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,760
 And it was run at the time back in 2006 by mother superior Margie Cheong.

74
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,200
 She's from South Korea.

75
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,200
 So she's a nun from South Korea.

76
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,560
 She's come to run the school.

77
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,000
 Now, there's a little bit of a culture clash going on here.

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,440
 Because one, she's...

79
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,200
 The nuns aren't known for, you know, they're kind of like, do whatever.

80
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,480
 They're pretty strict.

81
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,880
 Apparently, I don't know if this is a stereotype.

82
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,920
 But according to this article, South Korean nuns are way more strict than the average nun.

83
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,160
 The average nun may be like, ah, not cool.

84
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,960
 You can do that.

85
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,080
 That's not a mortal sin.

86
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,680
 Or maybe just say some prayers and stuff.

87
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,000
 I don't know.

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,640
 I'm not a Catholic.

89
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,480
 I don't know how it works.

90
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,320
 I don't know if nuns are just like, ah, murder it.

91
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,120
 That's fine.

92
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,320
 But South Korean nuns are super, super strict.

93
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,520
 So when she came to this school, things got...

94
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,280
 You could say a little overboard.

95
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:25,600
 So you have a, what some would say, and honestly, I would say this too,

96
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,040
 a quite tyrannical leadership of this school.

97
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,240
 Obviously, they don't see it that way.

98
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,920
 They're doing this for the Lord.

99
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,680
 And they're doing this for these girls.

100
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,200
 So these girls are being taken from poor areas.

101
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,200
 Willingly, they're not like being kidnapped.

102
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,040
 They ain't getting the back of the bunch of nuns.

103
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,480
 They're disguised themselves as nuns from the town.

104
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,400
 And then they just get out and they're just regular nuns.

105
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,240
 They weren't kidnapping these kids.

106
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,600
 Like they would go to the parents and say,

107
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,440
 they would test the kids as well.

108
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,480
 Because they weren't only...

109
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,680
 They didn't just bring in poor kids.

110
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,360
 They wanted poor, smart kids.

111
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,080
 They wanted kids that would either go on in like technical programs,

112
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,000
 going to college, or be nuns and let the cycle continue.

113
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,240
 But anyway, so you have this school set up for these younger...

114
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,600
 And they're told in the beginning,

115
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,680
 this is going to be super, super strict.

116
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,120
 There are no surprises.

117
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,480
 This isn't a cult.

118
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,440
 Like the anthill kids.

119
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,200
 Or they're like, come join me at the compound.

120
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,920
 And the next thing you know,

121
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,760
 people's arms are getting chopped off of chainsaws.

122
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,040
 You knew what you were in for.

123
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,920
 Again, you're 12.

124
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,760
 So you may not comprehend the rules that are coming,

125
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,040
 but you know the rules.

126
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,560
 And this system had been set up since the 1990s.

127
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,040
 But in October of 2006, the girls started to have issues.

128
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,720
 So let's take a visit.

129
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,040
 Let's... We're walking inside this school.

130
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,240
 It's really, really beautiful.

131
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,200
 There's the buildings.

132
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,280
 Those are buildings, those new-fingled buildings

133
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:41,840
 I was talking about.

134
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,880
 We're walking around.

135
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,440
 And there are these girls walking through the school.

136
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,120
 And they're all dressed in uniforms.

137
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,240
 They all have really short hair.

138
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,520
 Their hair couldn't be longer than two fingers below the ear.

139
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,920
 And they're just walking, holding their books,

140
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,720
 doing girl stuff.

141
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,840
 And then all of a sudden, one of them...

142
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,080
 Oh my God!

143
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,080
 She falls to the ground, holding her legs.

144
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,200
 Oh my God!

145
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,120
 I guess she probably didn't use the Lord's name in vain.

146
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,320
 Oh my gosh!

147
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:08,960
 Oh no!

148
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,680
 My legs!

149
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,840
 The other girls run to her aid.

150
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,720
 We can't help.

151
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,520
 We're just standing there.

152
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,440
 We're two adults in the hallway.

153
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,480
 I hold back, Hunter.

154
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,280
 I'm like, "Mmm-mm."

155
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,600
 No, they have to solve this problem themselves.

156
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,640
 Ah, my legs!

157
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,520
 This girl says she feels like needles.

158
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,240
 Like, needles are going into her skin,

159
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,160
 into her muscle tissue, and just scratching underneath the skin.

160
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,120
 Deep pain in her muscles.

161
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,160
 Ah!

162
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,440
 Ah, it burns!

163
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,080
 It burns!

164
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,160
 Now the other girls are obviously sitting there.

165
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,840
 They don't see any needles.

166
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,960
 They don't see anything.

167
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,360
 She's just grabbing her legs, flipping out.

168
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,880
 Go get headmistress.

169
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,000
 And then girls are running around.

170
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,600
 They're getting help and stuff like that.

171
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,800
 But then a couple days later,

172
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,960
 the girl's sitting in the cafeteria.

173
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,400
 "Mmm, this is delicious."

174
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,240
 Ow, my legs!

175
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,920
 Wait, guys, are you poking me with the needles?

176
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,800
 Oh my God!

177
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,920
 I mean, oh my gosh!

178
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,360
 No, my legs!

179
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,160
 My legs!

180
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,680
 She's flipping out in the cafeteria.

181
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,400
 Ah, it hurts!

182
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:04,880
 It hurts!

183
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,760
 Girl in the middle of math class.

184
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,360
 It's 2 plus 2 is 4.

185
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,640
 I learned that in fourth grade.

186
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,560
 I don't know why I'm doing that math equation.

187
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,120
 Jason doesn't know any math higher than that.

188
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,720
 Triangle plus square equals rectangle.

189
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,000
 There, that's high level math.

190
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,720
 Ah!

191
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,400
 Ah, my legs!

192
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,600
 My legs!

193
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,560
 Sorry, she's flipping out in class.

194
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,160
 500 girls.

195
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,160
 Between October 2006 and June 2007,

196
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,600
 500 girls.

197
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,520
 Are inflicted with this illness.

198
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,280
 It wasn't just the needles in the legs.

199
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,800
 It wasn't just the needles in the legs.

200
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,240
 These kids are also experiencing nausea, fever,

201
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,400
 temporary paralysis.

202
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,000
 They couldn't move.

203
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,840
 And then the nightmares.

204
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,400
 Five, if it was five kids,

205
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,000
 you could probably cover it up.

206
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,920
 But 500 kids, it starts to become a national story.

207
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,760
 Remember, these kids are from poor families.

208
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,200
 This is their one shot.

209
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,160
 This is their chance to make it.

210
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,000
 And you have parents traveling 100 miles to pick their kid up.

211
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,320
 I want her out of the school.

212
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,680
 Because we don't know what's going on here.

213
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,280
 The federal government gets involved.

214
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,280
 They send people out to test the air.

215
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,560
 There's no problem.

216
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,640
 They send people out to test the water.

217
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,440
 There's no problem.

218
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,280
 They're so, okay, let me back up.

219
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,080
 First, they send out doctors to see what was going on.

220
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,800
 Medical doctors.

221
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,880
 And they couldn't come up with any reason why.

222
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,240
 They didn't just start testing the air.

223
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,320
 As all these kids are freaking out.

224
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,200
 They send out doctors.

225
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,320
 The doctors are like,

226
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,080
 there's no physical reason they should be having this.

227
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,000
 The fever is obviously a physical thing.

228
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,640
 Nausea is something you can never really diagnose.

229
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,760
 We can diagnose a fever.

230
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,480
 We have a tool for that.

231
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,680
 But nausea, I think is the actual way you pronounce it.

232
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,720
 Someone can say they're nauseous.

233
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,520
 We'll never know.

234
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,640
 Medical doctors come out.

235
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,480
 Environmental dudes come out.

236
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,000
 Testing the air, testing the water.

237
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,280
 500 kids.

238
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,000
 One teacher and a couple of the nuns.

239
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,280
 House mothers are, I think is what the term was there.

240
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,880
 It came down with this.

241
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,880
 Needles in the leg, nausea, fevers, temporary paralysis.

242
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,760
 One girl said her fear was that she would never be able to walk again.

243
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,920
 So when I say temporary paralysis,

244
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,120
 I don't mean five minutes.

245
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,240
 Days you couldn't walk.

246
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,360
 The pain was so intense.

247
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,240
 Federal government sends in a psychiatrist.

248
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,040
 Dr. Naxila Lonevala.

249
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,720
 And she comes into the girl's school and she is a little,

250
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,000
 I don't want to put,

251
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,360
 I don't want to put emotions in her brain,

252
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,040
 but she seems kind of excited.

253
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,800
 Because here's the thing.

254
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,520
 Mass hysterias are rare.

255
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,520
 They're pretty rare.

256
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,600
 We've covered them before on this show.

257
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,640
 The Dancing Plague, the Laughing Epidemic.

258
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,520
 And both of those are actually mentioned in Daniel Hernandez's article.

259
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,680
 And I would honestly recommend after listening to this episode,

260
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,400
 reading the article.

261
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,400
 It is a very, very well-written piece of journalism, investigative journals.

262
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,840
 But anyways, Dr. Lonevala is like,

263
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:02,160
 this is a super contemporary case of mass hysteria.

264
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,400
 People think that these things don't exist.

265
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,600
 They've kind of just kind of disappeared into the medical journals.

266
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,360
 This is 2006.

267
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,560
 So she's kind of like, wee!

268
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,000
 She's like, push, she's running the airport.

269
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,440
 She's pushing other people out of the way.

270
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,760
 Look out, nerds, I'm on my way to go investigate.

271
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,240
 Mass hysteria takes control of the plane.

272
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,280
 So she comes out to the school.

273
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,960
 So that's kind of what she's going into.

274
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,560
 The doctors have already checked it out.

275
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,800
 They've already checked out the environmental contagions.

276
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,560
 She decides to go in and go, this is a mass hysteria.

277
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,800
 The way you deal with mass hysteria is to calm people down,

278
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,280
 to figure out what's really the emotional thing going on.

279
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,880
 Here's this great quote from this article.

280
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:48,000
 Quote, hysteria, Lonevala explains, is an audio-visual contagion.

281
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,480
 You have to see and hear someone exhibiting symptoms

282
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,280
 in order to find yourself replicating those symptoms.

283
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,160
 See it enough and it becomes you.

284
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,880
 This is hysteria's essential and most terrifying threat.

285
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,440
 Anyone is susceptible.

286
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,760
 Imagine a disease that simply affected everyone.

287
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,240
 It's a disease that you can't have an immune system.

288
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,120
 The immune system is not being anywhere near it.

289
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,120
 Not seeing it, not hearing it.

290
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,480
 If you're in that blast radius of the disease,

291
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,280
 the chances of you getting it are quite high.

292
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,960
 If everyone around you, you can't tell me that if you're at work

293
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,800
 and everyone around you starts sniffling, sniffling and stuff,

294
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,200
 that you won't start sniffling.

295
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,560
 Or the very first time you know it starts running,

296
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,560
 being like, uh-oh, I wonder if I have that.

297
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,800
 It's just the way we're a social species.

298
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,920
 We're a social species, so we'll pick up on cues like that.

299
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,400
 So it's a disease that can affect any of us.

300
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,080
 So she's at the school and she's like,

301
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,680
 "I'm just going to start counseling these kids."

302
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,880
 Now, these kids were coming from really, really bad backgrounds.

303
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,600
 No father at the home.

304
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,440
 These are girls, so they're expected to work at very, very young ages.

305
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,520
 The father's gone or the parents abused them.

306
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,240
 They have to go to school and work at the same time

307
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,320
 to support their other siblings.

308
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,440
 It is not a pleasurable life.

309
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,480
 It's a life of hard work.

310
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,960
 And you're like 12, right?

311
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,880
 You expect to work hard when you're like 24,

312
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,880
 but when you're 12 and you're going to school,

313
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,480
 you're like, "I go to school and work?"

314
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,080
 Yeah, but you're in college, bro.

315
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:30,560
 When you're 12 years old and you have to take care of your three siblings,

316
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,280
 it's really difficult.

317
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,040
 So you're going through all of this mental stuff.

318
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,320
 So when this school says, "We can remove that from you,

319
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,120
 you don't have to work,

320
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,040
 we're going to give you free housing, free education, free food,

321
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,880
 we're going to give you a better life,

322
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,320
 we're going to give you a better life."

323
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,160
 One, you have a little bit of survivor's guilt

324
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,720
 because your siblings are still in that situation.

325
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,080
 And two, in your situation, it's very regimented.

326
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,080
 It's like a military academy.

327
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,600
 So these girls are going through a lot of stuff.

328
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,880
 Dr. Loa Navala is interviewing these girls.

329
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,440
 And she says that they're talking to me,

330
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,200
 and the more that they talk to me,

331
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,880
 the more their symptoms one away.

332
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,640
 So we'd have a session.

333
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,200
 "Hey, can you tell me about your home life?"

334
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,960
 "Oh my God, my legs hurt so bad, please.

335
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,400
 Can we have this meeting somewhere else?"

336
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,800
 And then the next day,

337
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,240
 "Tell me a little bit about your home life."

338
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,400
 "Oh, my legs, they hurt a little bit less,

339
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,000
 but they're still burning."

340
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,320
 And over time, these symptoms would dissipate.

341
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,360
 Now, sometimes the symptoms would dissipate without the therapy.

342
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,040
 But the psychiatrist was starting to realize that this is working.

343
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,640
 I believe this is mass hysteria,

344
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,640
 but that's only half the story.

345
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,560
 That's only half the story.

346
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,920
 Let's go back in time a bit.

347
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,960
 And we're going to follow the trail of a girl named Hovita.

348
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,040
 In 2003, she's 12 years old.

349
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,480
 Family super poor is exactly the situation I set out for you.

350
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,120
 She, her dad, said, "Hey, I'm going to America.

351
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,320
 I'll send back money. Bye."

352
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,520
 And then just disappeared.

353
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,400
 So it's her mother, her.

354
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,120
 She's the youngest of four kids,

355
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,600
 and it's on her to help support the family,

356
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,720
 to get a job, to help the mom support the family.

357
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,880
 And she knows that eventually she's going to,

358
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,920
 she loves going to school,

359
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,000
 but eventually she's going to drop out of school

360
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,520
 and have to work full time.

361
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,000
 That is when the Villa de las Niñas show up to her house

362
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,400
 and say, "We want to test you.

363
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,920
 We know you're doing well in school.

364
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,840
 We want to test you to see if you're allowed to come."

365
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,680
 Now, the rules are super strict.

366
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,000
 Only one person from a family can go to the villa.

367
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,240
 So it's your ticket out of there,

368
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,760
 but you got to leave people behind.

369
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,240
 Here were the rules that were given to this 12-year-old girl, Hovita.

370
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,640
 No connection to the outside.

371
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,960
 These are going to sound very cultish, by the way.

372
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,560
 There's a couple of caveats that make it not a cult,

373
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,240
 but you're going to be like,

374
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,440
 "Dude, this place is fairly brutal,

375
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,600
 but no connection to the outside world at all."

376
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,440
 Little asterisks there.

377
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,120
 You can't accept phone calls.

378
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,520
 You can't call your family.

379
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,360
 Your family can write to you,

380
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,120
 but you can't write back.

381
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,120
 You're allowed to see your family

382
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,400
 for two weeks during the summer

383
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,480
 and two weeks at Christmas time.

384
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,400
 That's actually the biggest non-cult thing.

385
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,400
 They do let you eventually see your family.

386
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,000
 They let the family write to you,

387
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,200
 but their letters are red.

388
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,080
 They are screened before you get them.

389
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,040
 You're not allowed to write back.

390
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,880
 You can see them for two weeks during the summer

391
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,320
 and two weeks during Christmas time.

392
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,400
 No one has a birthday.

393
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,200
 Everyone at the school celebrates their birthday on the same day.

394
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,440
 That is the day the school was founded.

395
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,440
 No television, no magazines, no newspaper.

396
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,800
 Your hair has to be cut short,

397
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,880
 can't be longer than two fingers below the ear.

398
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,760
 Which, that again, that sounds very cult-like.

399
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,440
 That sounds very heaven's gate-like.

400
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,840
 And on detail, and I get,

401
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,680
 I'm not a girl, I don't know how this stuff works,

402
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,520
 but no waxing.

403
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,600
 No waxing.

404
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,960
 Can't wax your hair.

405
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,480
 And that was the thing that when the kids

406
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,520
 were brought to the school,

407
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,200
 they checked them for that.

408
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,560
 They checked their armpits, their face,

409
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,680
 and their brachini area.

410
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,880
 And if they were waxed,

411
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,200
 if there was evidence that these girls had ever waxed,

412
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,440
 they were immediately expelled

413
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,400
 and sent back to the home.

414
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,880
 So the girls were asked, "Do you wax?"

415
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,640
 "Have you ever put on any wax?"

416
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,520
 "No, no, I haven't."

417
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,440
 If you did it, you were expelled.

418
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,320
 Can't bring any mementos from home,

419
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,680
 even photographs.

420
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,360
 Can't bring pictures of your siblings,

421
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,040
 pictures of your parents, things like that.

422
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,760
 Grounds for expulsion.

423
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,200
 Once you're out of the school,

424
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,360
 if you start to become close to one of the house mothers,

425
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,440
 or to one of the adults on your dorm,

426
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,560
 you are reassigned,

427
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,880
 and the adult is reassigned to a different dorm.

428
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,760
 If you become friends with another person,

429
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,480
 they are reassigned to a different dorm.

430
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,480
 You are not going to be hanging out with your buddies here.

431
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,920
 You're going to hear to learn.

432
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,480
 Now, you go, "That's super dumb.

433
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,240
 I'm not doing any of that stuff."

434
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,000
 But if your choice was backbreaking labor

435
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,160
 for the rest of your probably short life,

436
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,720
 or a chance to get a free, high-level education,

437
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,000
 you're going to choose the education.

438
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,640
 You're fine.

439
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,280
 I'll take the rules.

440
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:01,920
 I don't wax.

441
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,640
 I'll do all that stuff.

442
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,760
 Because if you stayed, you stayed in poverty.

443
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,360
 If you were expelled,

444
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,640
 you were expelled into a harsh world.

445
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,640
 So she signed the paperwork.

446
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,480
 Let's do this.

447
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,880
 And another girl who went to school with Hovita

448
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,480
 in this small town,

449
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,840
 her name was Maria.

450
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,400
 Same thing.

451
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,360
 Same age.

452
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,400
 Went to the same school.

453
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,720
 She signs the paperwork.

454
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,680
 Now, Maria was a natural-born leader.

455
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,440
 Striking features.

456
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,120
 Tractive little girl.

457
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,040
 And Hovita knew a little bit about Maria.

458
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:40,080
 One, she knew that she looked like a leader.

459
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,800
 Secondly, there were rumors that Maria's mother was a witch

460
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,280
 who worshiped Saint Death.

461
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,880
 But just rumors.

462
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,160
 And the bus leaves behind this small city

463
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,160
 and hunts her fire up that Jason Jalapy,

464
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,760
 we're going to follow them in our car.

465
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,840
 We're going to follow along this path.

466
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,080
 Now, when they get to the school,

467
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,480
 the first thing all the girls realize

468
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,680
 is just how beautiful it is.

469
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,720
 How out of place it seems from where they came from.

470
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,920
 And the rules are immediately being enforced.

471
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,440
 They're being checked for photographs.

472
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,000
 Some of the girls hid photographs of their family

473
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,360
 in their undergarments.

474
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,040
 Photographs are taken.

475
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,880
 The girls aren't immediately expelled.

476
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,320
 But they are then threatened.

477
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,760
 This happens again, you are expelled.

478
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,840
 That started in 2003.

479
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,240
 And that system that they're living in,

480
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,160
 it takes us up to year 2006.

481
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,880
 The girls are all going on a field trip

482
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,880
 to an elite Catholic university.

483
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,600
 And while they are there,

484
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,040
 the girls stumble across the magazine.

485
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,160
 Now, I'm going to stop here.

486
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,680
 This is all true.

487
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,240
 This isn't some weird myth that's going around.

488
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,640
 This is 100% documented.

489
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,880
 Because from this point on, it gets super bizarre.

490
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,960
 Super weird.

491
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,760
 Even the chance finding of the magazine

492
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,320
 seems like something that happens in Act 2 of a horror movie.

493
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,080
 But these girls are at this elite Catholic university,

494
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,240
 seeing what is possible for their future.

495
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,920
 Very, very hardworking young women,

496
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:13,120
 pushing themselves mentally, physically to become successful.

497
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,280
 They find a magazine.

498
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,120
 And in this magazine, the girls are flipping through it

499
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,720
 because they don't have access to magazines.

500
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,520
 This would be like finding a Nintendo Switch

501
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,280
 when you didn't even have electricity in your house.

502
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,360
 They're flipping through the magazine

503
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,560
 and they come across an article.

504
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,520
 "How to make your own Ouija board."

505
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,920
 Forbidden knowledge.

506
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,920
 100%.

507
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,680
 Just having the magazine could have gotten them in a ton of trouble.

508
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,080
 But creating a Ouija board?

509
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,240
 The girls debate it whether or not they're going to do this.

510
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,360
 They were familiar with the idea that these girls

511
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,520
 weren't raised in a cave.

512
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,720
 They knew what Ouija was.

513
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,600
 They knew what black magic was and things like that.

514
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,080
 Maria says, "I will build one."

515
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,080
 I'm going to build a Ouija board.

516
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,240
 Using these instructions, I'm going to create a Ouija board.

517
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,800
 And Hovita said it was no surprise to her

518
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,120
 that Maria was the one who spearheaded this whole thing

519
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,720
 because of her reputation.

520
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,360
 The girls began sneaking out late at night.

521
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,560
 They would crawl through a window

522
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,560
 so they wouldn't alert any of the adults.

523
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,960
 They would sneak out onto the roof of their dorm.

524
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,720
 They would call upon the spirits,

525
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,880
 call upon the darkness,

526
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,560
 call upon the dead,

527
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,760
 and communicate with them with this Ouija board.

528
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,440
 Now this was a secret in the school.

529
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,320
 One, not every girl knew about it.

530
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,920
 And the girls that did know about it

531
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,360
 kept their mouths shut.

532
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,440
 Out of fascination, out of fear.

533
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,600
 Hovita one night,

534
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,560
 as the Ouija board experiments were going on on the rooftop,

535
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,160
 Hovita one night wakes up

536
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,960
 and goes into the bathroom, has stalls in it.

537
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,960
 She's in the first stall

538
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,960
 and she hears a noise in the last stall.

539
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,880
 And then the toilet flush.

540
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,440
 Hovita knows she's the only one in there,

541
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,280
 but she has to be for sure.

542
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,360
 So she goes and she moves open the stall next to her.

543
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,080
 No one's in there.

544
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,320
 She moves open the stall next to that one.

545
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,200
 There's no one in there.

546
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,040
 She gets to the last stall

547
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,400
 where she actually hears the noise,

548
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,920
 opens the stall.

549
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,880
 There's no one in there.

550
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,440
 And then in the stall where she was before,

551
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,160
 the first stall,

552
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,400
 she hears a noise in toilet flashes.

553
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,120
 She runs out of there.

554
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,160
 Now that is obviously could be 100% pipes,

555
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,560
 anything that does not mean,

556
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,920
 that's not the end of the story folks.

557
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,360
 It's not like, well, see you later.

558
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,000
 See you tomorrow.

559
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,640
 But it starts to set a precedent

560
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,680
 that now we're starting to have

561
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,920
 what could be paranormal activity at this school.

562
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,440
 Hovita started to have this weird delusion.

563
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,880
 So again, to create,

564
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,360
 you want to have a sense of order in these communities,

565
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,520
 but they also don't want the kids to get too comfortable.

566
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,320
 So they would rotate the kids through the bunks

567
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,680
 in their dorm.

568
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,840
 And Hovita flat out refused to take a bunk

569
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,040
 that was near a window.

570
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,480
 She would not do it.

571
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,440
 She was actually fighting against the establishment,

572
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,880
 which was big no-no.

573
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,960
 And the nuns would go,

574
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,400
 "Why don't you want to be by a window?"

575
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,840
 And she would come to them with a low voice and say,

576
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,920
 "Because I know out in that field,

577
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:20,800
 there's a girl, a dead girl, dressed in all white.

578
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,520
 She just runs through the field.

579
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,360
 And I just lay there and I'm so afraid if I roll over,

580
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,400
 if I look, I'll see her out there.

581
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,880
 I don't even want to have the chance

582
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,560
 that I see her and that she sees me."

583
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,840
 These rules were set up.

584
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,280
 They have to follow these things.

585
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,480
 And you have a girl actively saying,

586
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,080
 "I'm not going to follow this rule."

587
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:50,000
 This all comes to a head when there's a school-wide basketball tournament.

588
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,640
 And Maria has a friend named Liz who's in a different dorm.

589
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,120
 All the dorms that's grade level and dorm level,

590
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,440
 so the different houses compete against each other.

591
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,880
 And the winner gets bragging rights.

592
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,000
 Maria's best friend Liz was in another dorm.

593
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,640
 And Maria wanted Liz to win.

594
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,080
 So she called upon the powers of the Ouija board

595
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,840
 for Liz's team to win.

596
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,040
 And Liz's team dominated and took the championship.

597
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,200
 Now, the girls who knew that this

598
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,400
 black magic had been going on had been keeping their mouth shut.

599
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,120
 But this, this is what broke the camel's back,

600
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,640
 because she cheated.

601
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,240
 Not only did she cheat, she cheated against her own dorm.

602
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,760
 Maria's dorm should have won.

603
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,640
 She used her power to make her friend's dorm win.

604
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,640
 So now you had girl.

605
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,680
 That was too much.

606
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,000
 Calling upon the dead and the demons flowing around

607
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,480
 and the girl running around in the yard and toilets flesh.

608
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,280
 And now it's all fine.

609
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,960
 But cheating.

610
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,680
 Don't do that.

611
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,800
 So they begin complaining to the house mothers.

612
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,160
 The house mothers go to Mother Superior and say,

613
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,760
 there's a Ouija board on campus.

614
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,480
 We've been alerted.

615
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,240
 Black magic has been used.

616
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,280
 All this stuff.

617
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,320
 And the mother superior goes, what's a Ouija board?

618
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,640
 In South Korea, they don't exist.

619
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,760
 It's not a thing.

620
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,360
 They explained to her exactly what it was.

621
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,640
 So they go to Maria.

622
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,320
 All the nuns go to Maria and they go,

623
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,920
 we know that you're using Ouija board.

624
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,360
 Maria completely denies it.

625
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,960
 I'm not using Ouija board.

626
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,240
 They search her bed.

627
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,520
 Ouija boards under her bed.

628
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,680
 Maria goes, okay, I use the Ouija board.

629
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,240
 I might have used it to rig a basketball game.

630
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,640
 But I'm sorry.

631
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,440
 Sorry for that.

632
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,320
 I shouldn't have done that.

633
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,760
 But I wasn't the only one either.

634
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,600
 Like all we've been doing it for months

635
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,680
 and all these other girls, that girl and that girl

636
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,600
 and that girl, we'd go up to the rooftop

637
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,080
 and we do this stuff which has been going on for months.

638
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,520
 And Mother Superior looks at Maria and says,

639
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,520
 you're expelled.

640
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:45,120
 Now Maria is just apocalyptically mad at what's going on now.

641
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,400
 Because it's not fair.

642
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,600
 She wasn't the only one.

643
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,440
 Sure, she made the board.

644
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,840
 And sure, she may have led the ceremonies,

645
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,600
 but she's not the only one who used it.

646
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,360
 Girls have been using it for months, expelled.

647
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,120
 But you don't understand.

648
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,800
 It wasn't just me expelled.

649
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,240
 I can't go back out there.

650
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,640
 This school is everything to me.

651
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,320
 It's, I've been here for three years now.

652
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,920
 You don't know what it's like out there.

653
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,560
 Expelled.

654
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:11,200
 You're going to stay in a isolated room

655
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,360
 until someone can pick you up.

656
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,360
 Or if we have to, we will drive you home.

657
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,080
 You are no longer a student at Villa de las Niñas.

658
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,000
 In a moment, all of the hopes and all of the dreams

659
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,600
 that Maria had vanished.

660
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,720
 And not only that, she saw it as an unfair.

661
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:34,880
 A couple days later, there is a terrible screaming

662
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,480
 coming from the room that Maria was staying in.

663
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,800
 Girls obviously come out of the rooms.

664
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,800
 House mothers come out of their rooms.

665
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,720
 And there is Maria bleeding.

666
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,800
 Blood is shooting out of her hand.

667
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,720
 Tip of her finger is gone.

668
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,920
 And it's spraying all over the walls.

669
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,880
 The nuns run up, they grab her.

670
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,800
 They begin dragging her through the hallway.

671
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:06,800
 Now, what her exact quote was, no one can quite remember.

672
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,920
 There's multiple people in the hallway,

673
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,080
 and they all heard something different.

674
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,640
 But the gist of it was this.

675
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,040
 "Every one of you in my generation who accused me

676
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,280
 or thought badly about me will fall sick.

677
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,520
 You will be sick in your legs.

678
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,720
 You will not be able to walk.

679
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,880
 You will be cursed."

680
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,520
 The girls of the school never saw Maria again.

681
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,520
 She is expelled.

682
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,960
 The official story was that when Slammed the door shut

683
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,400
 and must have chopped her finger off.

684
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,440
 But there are whispers that she had done it on purpose.

685
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,320
 That this was a blood ritual.

686
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,680
 She was casting a spell.

687
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,800
 It wasn't just the piercing sensations in the legs

688
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,720
 which started shortly after this.

689
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,560
 It wasn't just the piercing sensation in the legs

690
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,080
 the nausea, the fever.

691
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,520
 It wasn't even just the nightmares,

692
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,960
 but the girls complained about visions.

693
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,840
 They'd be walking through the school hallway.

694
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,880
 Life would be bustling around them, middle of the day.

695
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,800
 No one else can see them.

696
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,880
 But every show, often you'd look up

697
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,400
 and you'd see a dead girl hanging

698
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,840
 from the ceiling,

699
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,040
 eyes staring lifelessly at them.

700
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,000
 Sometimes you'd wake up late at night

701
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,600
 and you'd hear the sound of a baby crying.

702
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,800
 And you'd be lucky if that's all that happened.

703
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:27,360
 Some children woke up and they saw bloody babies

704
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,840
 floating through the school.

705
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,160
 The girl in white who Hovita had worried about.

706
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,520
 There was a legend that she was the ghost of a young girl

707
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,880
 who died of a bleeding mouth disease.

708
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,560
 And other girls began to say they would see her

709
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,600
 running through the field.

710
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,920
 Some said they would see her walking through the school.

711
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:54,160
 While others said sometimes they were walking up the stairs

712
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,040
 they'd look up and they'd see her staring down at them,

713
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,360
 blood pouring from her mouth.

714
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,040
 Shadowy figures would haunt them,

715
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,480
 things out of the corner of their eyes.

716
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,480
 These weren't just physical sensations,

717
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,320
 these girls were seeing phantoms.

718
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,760
 Before the federal government got involved,

719
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,520
 Mother Superior brought in a priest to exercise the place.

720
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,160
 It didn't work.

721
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,240
 More of these girls are getting sick,

722
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,400
 more of these girls are claiming of seeing these phantoms.

723
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,600
 Mother Superior then ordered the school find Maria.

724
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,720
 She's a witch, she cursed the school,

725
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,560
 we need the witch to uncurse the school.

726
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,600
 They never found her again.

727
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,720
 They went back to the hometown that she came from

728
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,640
 and it turns out she moved to Vera Cruz

729
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,400
 and nobody knows where she's at.

730
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,920
 Even when this article was being written,

731
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,240
 they have no idea where Maria went.

732
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,840
 They said she could be in the United States,

733
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,560
 she could be anywhere in the country of Mexico,

734
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,280
 nobody knows.

735
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,080
 And that is when the federal government stepped in,

736
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,680
 started testing the water and all that stuff.

737
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,280
 These girls would talk about the same nightmare they'd have.

738
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:03,200
 They'd fall asleep and they'd see Maria consumed by flames,

739
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,080
 burning alive,

740
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:08,160
 but she would stare at the dreamer.

741
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,760
 Smile.

742
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:14,960
 Begin laughing as the flames moved across her body.

743
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:21,840
 "This is because you blamed me," Maria would say through the flames.

744
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,480
 "And this is what will happen to you."

745
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,480
 Now, you have the physical ailments of this hysteria.

746
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,680
 You have these mental issues as well, the visions, the dreams.

747
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,600
 Some girls though reported there was another phantom.

748
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,560
 They would whisper among each other that one of the housemothers

749
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,520
 would come to them late at night and massage their legs

750
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,000
 to ease the pain, to do what she could to help them sleep through the night.

751
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,240
 Jovita woke up one night and saw this housemother coming into her room, a silhouette.

752
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,080
 But as she got closer, she realized the housemother was wearing a veil.

753
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,880
 The housemother was dressed in all white.

754
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,720
 The girls believed that this was the Virgin Mary coming to console them.

755
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,360
 Hysteria? Absolutely possible, right?

756
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,000
 That is the most logical answer.

757
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,520
 And that one girl would say, "I had a dream that I saw Maria and flames,

758
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,600
 and then the other girls would be talking about it.

759
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,200
 This was a disease that is communicated by seeing it and hearing it.

760
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,200
 You are susceptible."

761
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,680
 Totally true.

762
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,880
 And we did see it start in October and in June.

763
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,400
 Mother Shapiri eventually was relieved of her command and she went back to South Korea.

764
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,080
 And she said, "I love Mexico. I love those girls.

765
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,040
 It was terrible that this thing happened.

766
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,240
 I don't know why it happened."

767
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,720
 She looks back on that whole time period as she failed.

768
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,240
 And Jovita?

769
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,040
 She ended up being pulled from the school.

770
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,720
 A lot of the girls ended up leaving the school.

771
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,680
 I think a total of 300 girls were removed from the school.

772
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,640
 And Jovita went back, pulled out of the school,

773
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,480
 because they didn't know what was going to happen next.

774
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,280
 You're being told one thing that's hysteria.

775
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,120
 You believe that a witch may have cursed you.

776
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,880
 And she left the school.

777
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,200
 She wasn't able to go back to school.

778
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,640
 She had to get a full-time job.

779
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,680
 She lives a life of labor.

780
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,960
 Did the witches curse work?

781
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,280
 Did she truly punish those who betrayed her?

782
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,840
 I think an interesting footnote to this whole story

783
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,560
 is that the psychiatrist herself, Dr. Loa Navallo,

784
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,280
 would go home from interviewing these girls all day long.

785
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:37,920
 Would go home.

786
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,080
 She'd fall asleep.

787
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,600
 And she'd begin to have nightmares.

788
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,320
 Now she told herself that I'm having nightmares

789
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,600
 because I'm hearing these stories about these girls' awful life experiences

790
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,040
 outside of the school, before the school.

791
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,360
 I'm hearing about abusive parents.

792
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,320
 I'm hearing about horrible things that happened to them.

793
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,320
 And then I'm coming home just hearing that all day long

794
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,600
 and then I'm coming home and I'm having these nightmares.

795
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,280
 These creepy visions while I'm sleeping.

796
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,400
 It must be that.

797
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,320
 It must be that.

798
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,600
 But there was one session in particular

799
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,680
 that she's sitting across the young girl.

800
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,120
 The young girl's talking to her.

801
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,680
 And the psychiatrist is listening, taking notes.

802
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:27,040
 And then she feels a sharp pain into her leg.

803
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,360
 And then another one.

804
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,360
 And then another one.

805
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,280
 And another one.

806
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,160
 Her legs begin to burn.

807
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:40,160
 Her legs begin to feel like the muscle is being pierced.

808
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:46,640
 And she sits there across from this girl and doesn't show her worry.

809
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,000
 Doesn't show her fear.

810
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,760
 The girl continues to talk.

811
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:57,200
 But the psychiatrist is thinking, this is all in my head.

812
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,280
 This is all in my head.

813
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,920
 This is all in my head.

814
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:07,760
 And she focuses on the sensation not existing.

815
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,720
 And eventually the sensation leaves.

816
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,680
 Was the mastosteria starting to set in

817
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,920
 and take the doctor who was sent there to cure it?

818
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:21,760
 Or was the witches curse trying to claim one more victim?

819
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,560
 Science will tell us one thing.

820
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,520
 Magic has another answer.

821
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,360
 But there is one person who may know the truth.

822
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,280
 And that would be Maria.

823
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,000
 She's never been found though.

824
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,920
 But I'm sure there's a lot of people who hope that she has never found.

825
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:45,840
 I doubt even Dr. Loa Navala ever wants to cross paths with Maria again.

826
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:55,040
 She may be a true witch able to strike down 500 people with a few drops of blood.

827
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,080
