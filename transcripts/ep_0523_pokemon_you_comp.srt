1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
 Did the creator of Little Shop of Horrors actually predict his own future?

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,080
 And then we take a look at a bizarre conspiracy theory coming out of the world of gang stalking.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:20,000
 Is it possible that people are playing Pokemon Go, but you are the Pokemon today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,680
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

5
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,720
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys are going to have

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,680
 an awesome weekend. I'm all sunburned. I'm gonna be inside. I'm gonna hopefully be inside an igloo

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,040
 all weekend is my skin replenishes itself. I'm not an outdoorsy guy. I'm sure you guys have picked up

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,880
 on that. First off let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, HowToSurviveDamnereAnything.

9
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,280
 HowToSurviveDamnereAnything. Thank you so much for supporting this show. Really, really helps out a lot.

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,840
 He's actually suggested stories in the past. He had the one about Trump was building the space

11
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,960
 force to fight aliens and then that went into North Korea, Utopia. So two episodes really. Thank you

12
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,560
 very much for that. If you get to where the Patreon that's fine too. Just help get the word out about

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,720
 the show. That also really, really helps out a lot. And a lot of you guys are doing it so I really,

14
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,000
 really appreciate that. The show is growing. I'm looking at all the metrics. It's doing quite good.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,400
 HowToSurviveDamnereAnything. Let's go ahead and we're gonna start off in the Jaysangelapi.

16
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,440
 We're leaving behind Oregon. We're gonna drive on out to Broadway. So we're headed to New York.

17
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,600
 We're driving through Broadway. This is bulletproof. The car's been made bulletproof now.

18
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,840
 I will always remember New York as 70s New York because when I grew up in the 70s and the 80s

19
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:44,240
 New York was just known for its rampant crime. It was basically Robocop without the Robo or

20
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,840
 really without the cops either. It was just a crime ridden hellhole. So we're driving real

21
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,800
 faster to Broadway. Go, go, go, go. We're passing Broadway. We're going to Off-Broadway,

22
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:00,880
 which is another section of the city where plays that aren't the big marquee plays. They're not

23
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,200
 the Phantom of the Opera. They're not the Lion Kings. Those are performed on Off-Broadway.

24
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,200
 But I tell you to keep driving because we're going to Off-Off-Broadway. On Off-Off-Broadway,

25
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,200
 you tend to get more experimental shows. We're actually back in the year 1982 and there is a

26
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,400
 show opening up called Little Shop of Horrors. So we're going to walk in the theater with

27
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,440
 a ton of tickets. It's still the production time. They're still getting everything together. And

28
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,280
 we're actually going to meet the writers of the play, Alan Menken and Howard Ashman. Now,

29
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,400
 they became a writing team. They actually met at a musical workshop, which sounds quite whimsical,

30
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,840
 right? But I'm sure they just sat around and talked about what's better, the trumpet or the tuba.

31
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,640
 So in this workshop, Howard Ashman and Alan Menken met up. And first off, they did a musical

32
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,840
 based on a Kurt Vonnegut novel. Not any of the good ones. I.e. the ones that I know the title to.

33
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:56,080
 What, Slaughterhouse 5? Wasn't that him? Who wrote Fahrenheit 451? I don't think that was him. I think

34
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,680
 that was Ray Bradbury. Or it might have been. I don't know. It wasn't any of the-- it wasn't one

35
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,240
 of those two that might not even be a Kurt Vonnegut novel. It wasn't one of that. It was like,

36
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,800
 "God, where are the roses?" or "Can I pick some flowers?" "Jesus" or something like that. But

37
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,800
 I could easily research it. But we're not-- that's not the point of this topic. So,

38
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,080
 their second play, though-- and that play did okay. The second play, though, they go, "Let's make a

39
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,800
 musical based on that old movie we watched when we were kids. Little Shop of Horrors." It was a

40
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,200
 old, spooky movie about a plant eating people. And they go, "Let's turn this into a 1950s

41
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,440
 doo-wop stage musical. We're barely gonna have any cast. We'll have a puppet and maybe like

42
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,440
 six people on stage. Perfect for a low-budget play off-off Broadway." Now, Howard Ashman wrote the

43
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,520
 lyrics for Little Shop of Horrors. And when you have a stage musical, you tend to have a ton of

44
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,080
 songs in it. But when it gets transformed into a movie musical, you end up cutting a bunch of those

45
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,880
 songs out just for time or pacing just doesn't work. One of the songs that was carried over from

46
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:01,360
 the stage musical to the movie, which was a huge hit-- the movie itself was a huge hit-- was a song

47
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,560
 called "The Meek Shall Inherit." And it's funny. It's actually my favorite song in the entire musical.

48
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,000
 It's on the movie soundtrack. It's a very, very interesting song, especially for fans of the

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,920
 paranormal for what we talk about on this show. The whole movie is catering to people who love

50
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,960
 other people getting dismembered and fed to plants and Faustian bargains. The whole thing,

51
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:30,240
 Audrey, to the plant is telling this meek little man, "Feed me. Feed me, Seymour. And I will give

52
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,360
 you your heart's desire. Make you rich. You want women. You want cars. You want money. Whatever."

53
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,600
 I guess that goes along with rich. It's a separate thing. You got to ask for money, too.

54
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,840
 And that's-- we really know is it the deal with the devil. This song, "The Meek Shall Inherit,"

55
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,040
 is a really interesting song because the setup is everyone's telling Seymour, who,

56
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,440
 previous to getting this plant was dirt poor. He was an orphan who's super poor. The song's

57
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,600
 about everyone trying to get him to sign contracts. And then he does this solo. Seymour does this

58
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,720
 solo and he says, "If I sign these contracts, I am okay with murdering people to feed to my plant."

59
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,280
 Because the whole story up to now, he's been really, really cagey about it. Like, he's doing it,

60
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,280
 but he doesn't feel really good about chopping people up. This song says, "I never knew success

61
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,680
 would come with such messy, nasty strings." That whole idea of the Illuminati like to become a

62
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,920
 superstar, you have to do something horrible. That's really common in like the Illuminati lore.

63
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:33,040
 The reason why all of these superstars, Brad Pitt, Bradley Cooper, other actors named Brad,

64
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:40,080
 Brad Dorf, that Brad from Everyone Loves Raymond, all the brads, all the hits, they've all had to

65
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,440
 do something horrible. Anytime you see like Ariana Grande or Madonna, Lady Gaga, they're involved in

66
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:51,120
 this horrible stuff. Who knew success would come with messy, nasty strings? He goes on to say,

67
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,560
 "If I sign these contracts, that means I'm willing to do these things." Originally, he didn't know

68
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,360
 what he was getting into. He did it and his life started to be successful, but from this point

69
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,120
 on, if he continues to sign these contracts, he will pay for it. It's a really, really good song.

70
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,200
 He comes to the conclusion, "I have to do it because the only woman who's ever loved me

71
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,200
 loves me because I'm rich," which isn't true. She actually loved him before that, but

72
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,960
 so he signs the contracts and that sets the stage for the rest of the play. The play was a hit.

73
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,160
 The play was such a hit that it moved from off-off-Broadway to off-Broadway and it was

74
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:33,520
 winning all these awards. What happened was Broadway came a-knockin'. "Hey, we want to put

75
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,320
 your show on one of our premier theaters. We want to blow this up. You're going to be one of the

76
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,840
 biggest plays that have already been running for years and years and years, but we're going to

77
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:48,560
 make it even bigger." Howard Ashman says, "No, this isn't a Broadway show. This is an off-Broadway

78
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,200
 show." Millions of dollars left to the table because of that decision. Now, they didn't make the movie.

79
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,600
 They didn't make the movie, but that takes them down a different path. So he makes the movie,

80
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,200
 becomes a big hit. There was a lot of struggles with that too because they wanted to change the

81
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:07,360
 ending. So Howard Ashman and Alan Menken do the movie. And because they do the movie, Disney is at

82
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,640
 this point thinking about doing musicals again. They really haven't committed. They'd have a movie

83
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,520
 would maybe have one or two songs in it, but this is the time period of the Great Mouse Detective,

84
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,280
 the Black Cauldron, and Oliver and Company. So Disney goes, "Hey, we're putting together this

85
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,600
 movie about some dancing cats or something. We don't really look at any of the notes.

86
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,000
 Do you want to write a song for it? We know you guys are hot from Little Shop of Horrors."

87
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,440
 So the writing team of Howard Ashman and Alan Menken write a song for it. But while they're

88
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,520
 there, Howard Ashman finds out that they're making a movie called The Little Mermaid.

89
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:48,640
 And Howard starts going, "Hey guys, you need to do a musical like you used to do. Remember back

90
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:54,880
 when we weren't kids? Remember back when Walt Disney was a kid? You had Snow White, Sleeping Beauty,

91
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:01,120
 Cinderella. We need musicals again." And he goes, "I'm the guy to write them and my partner. His

92
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,240
 partner walks by right then." He's like, "Oh, that guy too." It's his eyeshift side to side.

93
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,200
 Nothing without this dude. He goes, "We want to write The Little Mermaid. Animation and music

94
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,360
 are the perfect combination." So they write all the songs for The Little Mermaid, this writing duo.

95
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,880
 And it starts what's known as the Disney Renaissance. Because when I was like at Disney

96
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:24,160
 was kind of lame. Like I did like the Black Cauldron and stuff like that, but I saw The Black

97
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,120
 Cauldron, the theater was empty. The opening day of Disney movie was empty. When I went to go see

98
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,600
 Great Mouse Detective, I think it was like opening weekend in the theater. Three or four families.

99
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,080
 People were not watching Disney movies in the theaters. Little Mermaid came out massive hit.

100
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,280
 It was known as the beginning of the Disney Renaissance. Around this time, he tells his

101
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:50,320
 writing partner and friend that he has AIDS. Now again, we're talking the late 80s. AIDS was a

102
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,640
 death sentence then. You had seven years max to live. Seven years and that's if you're lucky.

103
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,520
 A lot of times three years, five years. No cure, no treatments in sight. He has AIDS.

104
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,800
 So he doesn't have a lot of time left. And this is what I think is interesting. The story of Seymour

105
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:13,920
 was about a guy who came out of really nothing and signed a contract with a creature to be successful.

106
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:20,400
 Ended up destroying him. How that parallels to this is that Howard Ashman's next project that he

107
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:26,640
 wanted to do with Disney was Aladdin. He wanted to write all the songs for Aladdin. He's like,

108
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,080
 "You guys got to do this story." He might have actually been the one who was pushing for it

109
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:36,000
 behind the scenes or even came up with it. He was a very, very strong proponent of doing a full

110
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,560
 movie musical of Aladdin. He wrote all the songs. He had all 13 songs written by Howard Ashman and

111
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,160
 then Alan Menken was doing the composing. But while he's working on Aladdin, Disney goes, "Listen,

112
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,720
 we got another movie we want you to do. We want you to do Beauty and the Beast." And Howard didn't

113
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,760
 want to do it. Howard's like, "I don't want to do that. I want to keep working on Aladdin." And they

114
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,080
 go, "No, no, no, no, no, no. You got Aladdin in the bag. We've seen it." Or in the lamp,

115
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,080
 and they're nudging him. He's like, "I have no time for that. I want to do no nudging. I want to

116
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,880
 do Aladdin." And they go, "No, just write a couple songs for Beauty and the Beast." This was his

117
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,640
 contract moment. It was a really, really interesting story. Back in 1982, he'd written a story about

118
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,840
 a man who had to make this decision. Now, he wasn't chopping up Disney executives, but he said,

119
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,000
 "Fine." He finally breaks down and he goes, "Fine. I will do Beauty and the Beast. I'll do Beauty and

120
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,400
 the Beast." So he stopped working on Aladdin. He starts writing the songs for Beauty and the Beast,

121
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:34,800
 which is considered Disney's like best animated film. He signed that contract and worked on those

122
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:41,360
 songs, perfected those songs before he could finish Aladdin. He ends up bedridden due to AIDS.

123
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,680
 He wasn't able to finish composing Aladdin now. When Beauty and the Beast opened to critics,

124
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:56,080
 he was a 40-year-old man who weighed 80 pounds, and he was blind. The disease ravaged his body.

125
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:00,560
 He's laying there in his hospital bed. These executives run in. Maybe they walked in. I don't

126
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,120
 think they were pushing nurses out of the way, but they came to him and they said, "Hey, Howard,

127
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,800
 I hope you know that Beauty and the Beast was a huge hit. It was amazing. Everyone loves it.

128
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:17,360
 It's great." But the project he really wanted, Aladdin, he never got to see. He died before

129
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,400
 they came out. And not only did he not get to see it, because he stopped working on Aladdin to do

130
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,640
 Beauty and the Beast. They only kept three of his songs. The rest of them, they just scrapped. They're

131
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,800
 probably in a vault somewhere. The reason why I wanted to tell that story is a lot of times we've

132
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,480
 talked. He obviously didn't murder a bunch of people and feed them to a planet. It wasn't that

133
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,600
 insane, but that's kind of the point. He signed a contract to work on Beauty and the Beast,

134
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,600
 and in the end, he didn't get his magnum opus. He didn't get his Aladdin. Little Mermaid was

135
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,200
 something he was just walking by the office and goes, "Hey, you should make that a musical."

136
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,800
 Aladdin was his passion project, but he sold out. He sold out to do Beauty and the Beast,

137
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,640
 and he didn't get to finish the Little Mermaid. And then 10 of his 13 songs were scrapped,

138
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,880
 but out of all the work he did, that he had to stop. Only three of his songs made it. One of the

139
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,680
 songs was "Be a Friend" or "You Have a Friend Like Me." And then two other songs I didn't know

140
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,640
 the title to. But that's a lot of times when we talk about selling our soul to the devil,

141
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:22,720
 that's what it actually is. It's not the brads getting together and sacrificing a non-Brad baby.

142
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,040
 It's the fact that they're constantly making decisions and they go, "I don't want to do this,

143
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,800
 but I'll make money doing this. This project sucks and I'm embarrassed, but I'll make a lot of money."

144
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,840
 Or, "It'll get me connected with this film company because I want to do my own project." You can

145
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:44,560
 always look at actors, especially actors. They'll always have a passion project, right? Brad Pitt's

146
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,520
 was World War Z. He was pushing for that for years. So they'll have these passion projects

147
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,240
 and they'll go forward. And even that movie got cut off at the knees, see. And then he was back

148
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,480
 to shooting whatever he's in nowadays. What's the one? I don't even know what Brad Pitt's

149
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:05,680
 last movie was. We sell our souls in far more mundane ways. We do it all the time.

150
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:11,760
 The most common example is working a job you hate. He didn't like doing Beauty and the Beast. He

151
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,360
 wanted to do Aladdin. And if he had listened to Seymour's song that he wrote, he wouldn't sign

152
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,760
 that contract. He goes, "No, I don't want to do Beauty and the Beast. I'm sure you guys need help with it,

153
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,600
 but I want to finish Aladdin because I honestly don't have much time left." You probably didn't

154
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,960
 tell them that, but none of us have much time left, right? Working jobs we hate is really

155
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:36,720
 how we sell our soul to the devil. I mean, there may be a minority of people who actually literally

156
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:43,200
 sell their soul to the devil for fame and power, but I don't think it's everyone in entertainment.

157
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:48,000
 I think everyone in entertainment, everyone that hype in the industry has sold their soul in some

158
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,600
 fashion, whether it's promoting a product that they don't want to be in, whether it's their

159
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,040
 anti-gun, but they're only doing action movies or their pro-gun, but they only do movies. They only

160
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,120
 do dramas like Doubt and they're like, "Oh man, I wish I had a bunch of guns right now." That's the

161
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,960
 way we really sell our soul, right? By working 20 years for a job we hate and we make good money,

162
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:15,280
 right? We live very comfortably, but you figure, you know, I could cut my comfortable living down.

163
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:22,240
 I could live off 20,000 a year as opposed to 50,000 a year and be a park ranger or something like that.

164
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:29,120
 That's really selling your soul. That's really selling your soul in a very, very daily way,

165
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,440
 and he did it. When he was a young man, he was able to turn down millions of dollars and say,

166
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,680
 "No, I don't want to take it on Broadway. It's an off-Rodway show." But when you get older and

167
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:44,720
 your expenses grow, someone offers you money, you're less likely to turn it down. I think that's a

168
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,960
 really, really interesting story. Obviously, it's a tragic one that he passed away. His writing

169
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,760
 partner is still making musicals. He's still working with Disney, but yeah, that's the story of

170
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,920
 Howard Ashman and a man who wrote a song that really predicted not only his life, but the lives

171
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:07,280
 of really everyone who sells their soul, whether it's for a plant, to a literal devil, or just to

172
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:13,200
 life's expectations of you. Fascinating story. How to survive damn near anything? Let's go ahead

173
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:22,080
 and we're going to hop in that carpenter copter. We are going to head out. We're going to fly on out

174
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:29,920
 to your local Home Depot. He's like, "What is the land cycle?" It's flying over. We see a pretty

175
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,400
 empty parking lot, so we're going to land off in the field. We don't want to interfere with what

176
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,800
 we're about to see. So let's all hop out of the carpenter copter and I have my official Jason

177
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,880
 Carpenter binoculars. We're looking through, it's just one pair though. We have to share,

178
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,720
 so wait your turn. We're looking through the binoculars. We see a young woman get out of her car.

179
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,640
 She's walking through the parking lot and then we start to see some other cars pull into the

180
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:59,920
 parking lot. And I'm like, "Hmm? Hmm?" And you're like, "Jason, it is a parking lot of a major retailer.

181
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,720
 Cars will pull in." No, no, wait, wait. She's walking through the parking lot. We see even more

182
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,240
 cars pull up. Until eventually the parking lot is full of cars. You see why we didn't land the

183
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,080
 carpenter copter there? She walks into the Home Depot and there's not a lot of people in it.

184
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,000
 She's like, "This is good. I've always wanted to come in and buy hammer and nails and not be accosted

185
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,480
 by anybody. Otherwise I might use that hammer and nails on them." She's walking through the store.

186
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,200
 She gets to a section, the nail section, and she's like, I don't know, just bumping,

187
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,840
 dumping nails into her car. They're like falling through the car. She's like, "Oh no." And then

188
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:40,480
 she notices that Home Depot is packed. And you're like, "Jason, this is basically just doing a story

189
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,360
 about cause and effect. Does this have some moral story? Like the last one at the end?" You're like,

190
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,200
 "Well, you know, if you go at this hour, there's going to be a bunch of people there." No. Because

191
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:54,640
 what she notices is not only is the Home Depot full, it's full in her area and she keeps getting

192
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:01,440
 bumped with shopping carts. Ow, ow, she's holding nails in her hands. Every time they bump her,

193
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,800
 another one digs deep into the skin. She knows what's going on. She knows what's going on.

194
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:12,320
 Within about five or 10 minutes, everyone's gone. She once again is alone in the Home Depot,

195
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:19,280
 safe for a few employees. She walks back out to her car. The parking lot is pretty much empty,

196
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,560
 except for her car. She looks around and she knows what just happened. We don't, right?

197
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:31,040
 We don't because we're not nuts, but she does. What just happened was a game of Dark Web tag.

198
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:37,760
 I got this on the Reddit for gangstalking and that's something that AZ recommended to me a

199
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,440
 long time ago. So thank you, AZ. As we're walking around Home Depot, we go in. I have to buy some

200
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,760
 nails now too. They're all strewn across the floor. Where's your magnet section, sir?

201
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:55,120
 This woman tells the story about Dark Web tag and she uses this Home Depot example as what actually

202
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:01,440
 Dark Web tag looks like. So she believes herself to be a targeted individual in a sense. So in the

203
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,160
 world of gangstalking, you have the stalkers and then you have targeted individuals. And these are

204
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,600
 people that are being followed around by either the government or some sort of Illuminati group.

205
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,400
 The brads, the great brads are running the whole thing. They're just looking for all

206
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,520
 brad babies. Everyone else is just cattle, cattle for the slaughter, or to breed more brads.

207
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,720
 You have that going on, right? You have this high, you don't, you don't, but they believe that you

208
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:33,120
 have this high level group that's monitoring them and trying to drive them crazy by doing weird stuff.

209
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,840
 So whenever they see something weird happen, they go, "Oh, that's just the gangstalkers."

210
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,960
 That guy scratching his belly, he's trying to make me see that he's actually a gangstalker.

211
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,960
 It's supposed to psychically hurt me, because then I know that I'll never be unseen. See that guy jumping

212
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,560
 out of that flaming building and asking for water? "I am not falling for your tricks." I've seen that

213
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:00,000
 too many times because I hang out in place full of arsonists. But there's also this thing called

214
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,480
 dark web tag, where you're not always a targeted individual. Just every so often. This is actually

215
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:13,680
 fascinating. This could work. This could work. This isn't just some weird look into a mind of

216
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,760
 someone who believes in gangstalking. This actually could work. I think someone could actually make

217
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,840
 some good money off of this, honestly. So if you're an app developer, grab your notebook now and start

218
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,520
 taking notes. So she starts off by saying that she found out about this from her stalker's brother.

219
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,840
 So I guess they're hanging out. Which would be really easy to gangstalk someone that you're

220
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,480
 friends with, right? Because you'd just be like, "Oh man, I'm late. I'm late for stalking. Oh wait,

221
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,720
 I'll just walk over there." Say, "Hey, you punch in." And then you walk in, you're like, "Hey,

222
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,960
 you want to play some GoldenEye?" That would actually be a pretty chill job. I figure being a

223
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,880
 stalker, I always imagine it to be someone literally stalking you, not sitting next to you,

224
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:59,040
 sharing a chasticola. That's just a friend. That's just a friend who's a weirdo, who lives in the

225
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:04,800
 bushes and then comes out and drinks some Shasta with you. But the stalker's brother, see, tells this

226
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,600
 story about a thing called dark web tech. So here's how it works. Everyone has a cell phone or

227
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,400
 smartphone nowadays. You have it in your car and your computer as well. So if you're like,

228
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,440
 "I don't have a smartphone," you got a tracking device somewhere near you. Most of us do. Otherwise,

229
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,280
 how are you listening to this podcast? I guess I would say. And randomly, an app will be downloaded

230
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:31,440
 onto your device. And that will make you it. So you're the unwilling participant in the game.

231
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,520
 But there are people who actually want to play dark web tech. They download the app through

232
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:41,040
 Google or Apple Store. I'm sure it's an official app. And it basically is a GPS locator. So what

233
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:47,920
 it does is it tells me where you're at. So they just show up at a Home Depot. You're in a Home Depot,

234
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,720
 everybody shows up. So what's the point of this game other than to just be kind of a hilarious

235
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,720
 prank? There's a lottery system built into this. So what it is, this is super bizarre. Let me say this.

236
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:06,240
 Her version of it is just dumb. My version of it will work. Let me tell you what she says it's

237
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:12,000
 going to happen. So let's say that I want to play deep web tag and you're it. I take my phone,

238
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:19,280
 I walk up to you. And as we get closer, my phone acknowledges that I'm within one

239
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,400
 foot, which is actually super close. That's a subway sandwich close. Let's say I'm within five

240
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:32,640
 feet of you. Money will be deducted from my account and it will go to the deep web server.

241
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,400
 So that part doesn't make sense. Why would I play a game where I lose money? If it was,

242
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,520
 if you get within five feet of the subject, you're going to lose money. I'd be like, okay,

243
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:47,280
 well, I'm not going to do that then. I'm not going to do that. It's a weird detail. And then they can

244
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,800
 also buy lottery tickets with the app. That's the thing with these type of theories that I don't know

245
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:58,640
 who's saying the crazy stuff, the targeted individual or the stalker's brother or the stalker

246
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,960
 disguised as their brother. I don't know, but that doesn't make sense. But anyways, the whole point

247
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,800
 is basically GPS system and there's a chance there's a game of chance and they just show up. It's

248
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,880
 like a mass mob, but it's centered around one person and they're not supposed to know they're

249
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:19,120
 being followed. She's a targeted individual. She knows the science to look for. And then

250
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:25,360
 everybody leaves. Everybody goes about their business. Is that true? Probably not. Little

251
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:31,120
 asterisk there. We'll get into that in a second. But is her version of it true? Probably not.

252
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:37,760
 Asterisk's on that one too. A lot of asterisks this episode. So she says that apparently the person

253
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:43,040
 who is it, which actually now to think about it is TI spelt backwards. I bet she didn't even figure

254
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:48,960
 that one out. It, if you're it, it's supposed to be totally random. But her stalker's brother is also

255
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,000
 a hacker. And he's been constantly hacking the deep web, all of it, the whole deep web. He's been

256
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,920
 hacking the deep web to constantly make her it. So she keeps getting attacked, not really attacked,

257
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,280
 just people walking within five feet of her. She said that's why everyone was getting closer

258
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,240
 with the shopping cart. They're trying to get within that window. Here, let's break this down

259
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,760
 real quick before I give you your money making scheme that might ruin the world. It may exist.

260
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,640
 Something like this may exist, but it wouldn't be 80 people in a single town, right? Because then you

261
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,200
 would hear about it. If you had multiple people, if you had enough people to swarm a Home Depot,

262
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,560
 to fill up a Home Depot parking lot, then it's on Twitter. People are talking about on Twitter,

263
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:33,760
 on local Facebook pages, Albuquerque Facebook. And there's like, how to get a job and like,

264
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,720
 how to sell Lulu lemon leggings. And then it's ones like, do you want to stalk people for money?

265
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,280
 And little asterisks there, they take the money from you. If it was that big in one area,

266
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:48,320
 you would know about it. So I don't think her experience is true. I'm sure it happened. I'm

267
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:54,640
 sure she showed up to a busy Home Depot one day. Like, that's not unusual. That's just bad timing.

268
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,680
 But that probably happened. I don't think she made that part up. I don't think she was standing

269
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,920
 in the middle of a Home Depot empty parking lot. And she goes, stop hitting me with your

270
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:09,920
 cards. Nails are everywhere. I don't think that happened. They probably she showed up right before

271
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:14,320
 it got busy. It got busy. Everyone bought their stuff and bounced. But here's how you could actually

272
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,000
 do this. First off, don't charge the people. Don't take money out of their accounts. Because

273
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,320
 there's also some weird she goes in this whole thing about phishing information that leave that

274
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,960
 part out. App developers leave out the part where you're basically just mass harvesting

275
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,720
 information and leave out the part where you're stealing money from them. Here's how you do this.

276
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:37,360
 Build an app and it's basically Pokemon Go. But it's the other people are set up as the Pokemon.

277
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,600
 And here's the key though. You have to make it so the other person doesn't know they're it.

278
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,680
 Because I know they have app games where it's like the blue side versus the red side. Who can take

279
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:51,200
 people's territory? It's actually that predated the apps. It's called the Bloods and the Crips.

280
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,320
 But you know those like go stand in the spot. It's blue territory. Stand there for five minutes.

281
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,600
 Actually that still is basically gang warfare. You have a Crip going to the wrong neighborhood

282
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,040
 and be like no I'm selling drugs here now and they're like well we're gonna have to shoot you.

283
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:11,840
 That's the way this game works. You only get one life. But I've seen games like that. The key is that

284
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,400
 you would have to have that thing where you would have the app downloaded on somebody's phone without

285
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,640
 them knowing. Because that's the spooky part right? If everyone knows they're part of the game.

286
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,080
 I guess you don't have to make it super spooky. I guess you could have everyone download the app

287
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,640
 and at random you're chosen as it. But the point is you shouldn't know that you're it. People should

288
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,440
 just start to pour into your hometown and start like looking around. Having their phones out.

289
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,440
 Wouldn't that be an awesome game? I mean there'd probably be a lot of traveling involved because

290
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,120
 I don't think you'd get millions and millions of people playing here. Like hey boss can I take

291
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:47,120
 a week off work? I have to drive down to Albuquerque and stalk somebody. They would have to win a

292
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,520
 prize. Like this one they had lottery tickets and stuff like that. So you would say the person who

293
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:58,400
 could get closest to... Oh here we go. The person who can get closest to it without it hitting an

294
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,800
 alert. Oh see I have to change something. Whoever gets close to you're like Jason what is this

295
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:08,960
 podcast now? Is this Shark Tank? What are you doing? What is this segment? You want somebody to

296
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,360
 build an app for you is what you want to do. I do not want to be associated with this app in any way.

297
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,240
 I don't want it to be called the DeRav radio fun time stalker app or anything like that. I'm not

298
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:24,480
 even being sarcastic. Leave me out of this. I'm just pitching this idea into the universe. The

299
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,360
 person who knows they're it they'll have a they don't know they're it. You never know if you're it

300
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:34,320
 right? But the app does have an alert button. So if you think you're it and you think someone's

301
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:41,040
 being really weird around you, you hit the button. If you hit the button and someone who's a tagger

302
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:48,480
 is not by you, you actually get penalized. It shocks you. It gives you a 30 second 20,000 volt

303
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,600
 shock through your phone and completely drains your battery in the process. But if you hit the button

304
00:26:53,600 --> 00:27:00,720
 and the dude is that actually is a weirdo walking next to you, then you win a prize. You win some

305
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,880
 money. You win money out of their account. Two dollars have been deposited and they get a 30

306
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,600
 second 20,000 volt shock. But if they don't hit the if you're able to walk within five feet of

307
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:18,960
 someone who's it and they don't hit that button, then you win. You win. You get their phone. You

308
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,920
 get their phone. Their phone becomes bricked until they give it to you and then you get a phone. There

309
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:31,760
 you go guys. That is my new way. No, it's not mine. It's not mine. Leave me out of this. But that is

310
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,440
 your new app. That's how you're going to spend your weekend. I want you to program that app.

311
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,480
 I got to be honest. I don't know where I was going with this segment. I don't know where I was going

312
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,760
 with this segment. I did want to talk a little bit about weird gangstalking stuff again and then

313
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:51,120
 it just kind of morphed. I said in the beginning a game that could ruin humanity. Let's see if I

314
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:57,280
 can wrap it up like that. If you had this imagine if everyone was stalking each other 24/7. Everyone

315
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:02,720
 was in a constant state of alarm. Everybody wanted to win a brand new phone and nobody wanted to get

316
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,760
 electrocuted. And so you had everyone in the country because they're hearing great things.

317
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,920
 People are walking around with two phones, three phones. They're really good at this game. So everyone's

318
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:16,240
 always has their little finger on that alert button. Afraid that they're it. They never know

319
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,920
 that people are super paranoid. The president of the United States is like, "Stay away so you can

320
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:26,720
 service." I know one of you are like, "They're like, "Sir, sir, no, no." People are hiding out in

321
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:32,160
 doomsday bunkers because they don't want to be tagged." They're like, "I'm not it. I'm not it.

322
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,320
 I'm not it." Rocking back and forth in the darkness. People are pounding on the door.

323
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,240
 You're running out of oxygen. "Oh, that's just a trick. That's just a..."

324
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:49,040
 You could destroy society if you made everyone so paranoid that any moment, any moment, any time

325
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:54,240
 they can be electrocuted and lose their phone, you would have a world of people that were super

326
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,320
 paranoid. And then you would have a whole group of people being like, "You know what? I'm not even

327
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,920
 going to have a phone. I'm not going to have a laptop. I'm going to stay away from technology."

328
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:06,160
 Because people keep stealing it. People keep taking my laptop when I'm out at a coffee shop

329
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:12,800
 because I didn't hit a button in time. No way. And then we'll return to a blissful time where

330
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:19,440
 man lives in harmony with nature. Somewhere off in those things, the old timers called

331
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:27,200
 "sit-tees." There are still half men, half electrical, half men, half electrical current,

332
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,480
 still roaming the "sit-tees." Apparently playing a game where they steal each other's phone.

333
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:39,120
 But most of humanity has evolved to live in a green, lush wonderland. And then one day a kid picks

334
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:46,640
 up a pine cone and he goes, "If I pick up..." Hey, Billy, you got a pine cone too? And he's like,

335
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:53,200
 "Yeah, I do." He goes, "Uh, let me pull a piece of my pine cone out." That's like an app now.

336
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,120
 And if I put my finger in it, I don't know. You guys get it, right? Circle of life. Like,

337
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,600
 eventually the kids are just going to turn pine cones into phones. I don't know. You guys get it,

338
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,240
 right? Twist ending. Oh, and the whole story takes place. They're actually all fleas on the back of

339
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:12,880
 a dog. I bet you didn't see that twist coming. But let's go back a choice. Do I even have to

340
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,200
 explain it? Do I even have to explain it? Society will eventually begin to evolve to the point where

341
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,960
 they're doing this stupid game again. But again, they're just fleas on the back of a dog, so it

342
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:28,720
 doesn't really matter. DeadRabbitRadio with gmail.com. Who's crazier? The person who believes in gang

343
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:34,560
 stalking or the person who covers gang stalking? Like, really, the fact that I've had to read so

344
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:34,560
 much about this stuff and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and... and
