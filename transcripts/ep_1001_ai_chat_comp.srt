00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,020
 When a bunch of children decide to play hide-and-go-seek one night, they have no idea they're about

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,340
 to come face to taste.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,140
 With a vengeful spirit?

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,240
 And then we travel back to the conspiracy theory iceberg.

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,520
 Is it possible that using the latest tools in artificial intelligence, we might actually

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,220
 be able once and for all to solve every single mystery?

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:33,220
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:39,280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,280
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm Having a Great Day.

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,040
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,280
 Hope you guys are having tons of fun out there in the world.

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,160
 We got a ton of stuff to cover, so we're gonna get started right away.

13
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,480
 First off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command is one of our newest Patreon supporters.

14
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,480
 Everyone get on your feet and give it up for...

15
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,480
 MISI.

16
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,480
 Woohoo!

17
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,480
 Yeah, come on in, MISI!

18
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,360
 Walk on into Dead Rabbit Command and have a seat.

19
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,600
 But don't sit down for too long, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,160
 If you guys can't support the show financially, that's totally fine.

21
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,160
 It is.

22
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,720
 Just please spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio, that is another way you can help support

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,720
 the show.

24
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:19,160
 MISI, let's go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider.

25
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,840
 We're gonna jump off the highest point of Dead Rabbit Command.

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,640
 Glide us all the way out to...

27
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,640
 Vietnam!

28
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:34,320
 I had an uncle who fought in Vietnam.

29
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,240
 I don't know if I've mentioned that before on the podcast.

30
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,280
 He was a helicopter machine gunner.

31
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,160
 Talk about a stressful job, right?

32
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,720
 You're sitting in front of this open door with this mounted machine gun.

33
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,720
 He didn't have fun.

34
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,720
 Let's not...

35
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,720
 It was not a fun experience.

36
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,560
 He had some crazy stories.

37
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,480
 He's also exposed to Agent Orange.

38
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,480
 So he ended up getting a pretty big settlement later on, you know, for years.

39
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,480
 The government said, "What?

40
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,760
 That stuff didn't cause mutations?

41
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,200
 You showed up in Vietnam."

42
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,200
 Like that.

43
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,680
 He finally did get some settlement.

44
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,480
 It's funny because my other uncle makes fun of him and calls him a big baby.

45
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,480
 He calls him a big baby.

46
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,320
 He's like, "Oh, you didn't get that much Agent Orange on you.

47
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,320
 Quit making excuses."

48
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,600
 Everyone has 18 toes.

49
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
 Get over it.

50
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
 So funny, brothers.

51
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
 That's not why we're here.

52
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,600
 We're not here to bully my uncle.

53
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:33,800
 The reason why we're here is when we look at urban legends, one of the things that I

54
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,600
 love to do is see...

55
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,720
 Not just urban legends, but cryptids as well, which is stories a little bit of both.

56
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,440
 There's always a moral lesson within the...

57
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,880
 Not always, but most of the time there's a moral lesson in these.

58
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,440
 First off, don't get drafted into the Vietnam conflict.

59
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,960
 That's lesson number one.

60
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:55,000
 But lesson number two, we'll take a look at this story I found it online and it was posted

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,480
 by this guy named Bye Bye Horses.

62
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,160
 Because someone asked the question.

63
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,160
 Someone asked the question.

64
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,280
 They said, "Is Hyden...

65
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,280
 I always...

66
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,520
 We always called it a Hyden Go Seek, but apparently that's not what it's called.

67
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,520
 It's called Hyden Seek.

68
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,520
 I don't know.

69
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,480
 I don't know if there's an official name.

70
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,920
 We'd probably call it whatever you want.

71
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,000
 Hyden Go Catch.

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,920
 But Hyden Go Seek.

73
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:24,200
 Is it an invitation to have ghosts show up?"

74
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,880
 This person was asking this question online and they go, "Because really when you're playing

75
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,920
 Hyden Go Seek, you say, 'Come out, come out wherever you are.'"

76
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:40,120
 And since it's such a general phrase, is it possible that ghosts might show up?

77
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,040
 I mean, anything's possible.

78
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:48,120
 Obviously, this is a paranormal podcast, but I don't necessarily think that will bring

79
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:56,320
 spirits, but this dude, Bye Bye Horses, said, "Well, in Vietnam, we actually have a story

80
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,480
 about that.

81
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,320
 We actually have a story about that."

82
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,600
 Apparently once there was a group of children and they wanted to go play Hyden Go Seek,

83
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,120
 but it had gotten dark out.

84
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,360
 You figure, "Hey, it'll just make it harder to seek and easier to hide.

85
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,040
 It's the perfect combination."

86
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,280
 So it's dark out and these kids go outside and they go, "Let's go.

87
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,280
 We're going to go hide and seek.

88
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,280
 You go under it.

89
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,040
 Go stand on that tree and close your eyes.

90
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,840
 You know the rules."

91
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,320
 And then everyone went and hid.

92
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,600
 The kid counted to 10 or 100.

93
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,520
 We counted to 100 because we were overachievers when we played Hyden Go Seek.

94
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,120
 And then, you know how the rules are played and don't have to explain the rules.

95
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,360
 It went on and found the kids one by one.

96
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,080
 "Oh, golly, you found my hiding spot."

97
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,080
 "Yeah, I did.

98
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,520
 Help me find these other kids."

99
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,080
 And so this whole thing goes on until eventually all the kids have been found except for one.

100
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,680
 Now, we don't have his name.

101
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,880
 We're just going to call him Timothy, little Timmy.

102
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,880
 "Where's Timmy hiding?"

103
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,880
 "Timmy!

104
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,880
 The game's over.

105
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,880
 Come on out."

106
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,880
 Little rustling of crickets.

107
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:01,880
 "Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-

108
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:13,600
 A frog somewhere off in the distance.

109
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
 Maybe Timmy went home.

110
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,520
 Maybe playing this game late at night.

111
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,160
 He got tired and went home.

112
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,360
 That's the only thing we can think of because we've looked everywhere for him.

113
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,600
 We even went over where the crickets and the frogs were.

114
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
 We don't know where Timmy's at.

115
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,640
 He must have gone home.

116
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,640
 So all the kids go home.

117
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:34,640
 All the kids abandon their missing friend and they go home.

118
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,360
 The next day they wake up.

119
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,640
 All the kids wake up and they go, "Oh, man, this sure was fun playing.

120
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,040
 Hanna goes seeking the dark last night."

121
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,360
 "Hey, let's figure out something else to do though because it's daylight.

122
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,200
 Maybe we'll just run around the marketplace.

123
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,200
 Maybe we'll just run around town.

124
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,720
 Let's go get Timmy."

125
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,120
 So the friends all gather together.

126
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,920
 They go to Timmy's house.

127
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,920
 Parents answer the door.

128
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,920
 It gets to go, "Hey, can Timmy come out and play?"

129
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,280
 The parents are like, "Uh, we thought Timmy was with you."

130
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:10,840
 We probably should have double checked after it passed midnight and Timmy hadn't come home.

131
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,080
 But you're telling us that Timmy's not with you and they're like, "No, Timmy, we played

132
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,160
 hide and go seek last night.

133
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,160
 We never found him.

134
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,160
 We figured he came home.

135
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,160
 We didn't double check."

136
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,240
 And the parents are like, "No."

137
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,800
 So the parents begin to run around town looking for Timmy.

138
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,280
 And the grandma, Timmy's grandma is also at home and she goes, "Timmy missing."

139
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,680
 They've looked everywhere for him.

140
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,400
 It's possible that the old legends are true.

141
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,360
 She's all talking to herself in the kitchen.

142
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,360
 Everyone's gone.

143
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,800
 Everyone's running around looking for this kid.

144
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,800
 She's sitting there.

145
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
 She's making hot chocolate.

146
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,440
 The old legends must be true.

147
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:54,680
 So she goes out back and she kills a chicken and prepares a plate of chicken and rice.

148
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:01,160
 And says, "Let this be an offering for the beautiful woman."

149
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,400
 Well the friends and the family are still looking for Timmy and they find him.

150
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,600
 They decide at the end of their search to go back to where they were playing hide and

151
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
 go seek.

152
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:19,560
 They're there and in a very obvious hiding spot, there's Timmy and he's unconscious.

153
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,560
 He's just laying there on the ground.

154
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,560
 The kids are like, "Ah."

155
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,560
 And the parents are like, "Ah."

156
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,760
 And the kids are like, "We checked here last night and he wasn't here."

157
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,400
 And the parents are like, "Oh no, this is such a tragedy.

158
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,760
 Timmy, Timmy, wake up, wake up."

159
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,040
 And they roll him over and he's groggily coming away.

160
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:42,040
 And he goes, "Maw, dar, wa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha."

161
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,440
 And the parents kind of jump back in horror.

162
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:50,400
 I can only assume the kids feed their pants and ran away because what they saw was when

163
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,760
 Timmy rolled over, he had a mouth full.

164
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,080
 Stuffed to the brim, leaking out across his lips, going up his nostrils and his entire

165
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,200
 mouth was stuffed full of cow poop.

166
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,200
 Oh no.

167
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,920
 No, now he could take it.

168
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,480
 He wasn't there forever.

169
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,920
 He doesn't have the cow poop in his mouth until this day.

170
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,360
 I'm sure the parents are like, "Okay, let's get this out of your mouth.

171
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,360
 Let's quit calling our names.

172
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,360
 It's kind of spooky.

173
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,360
 Let's get this poop out of your mouth.

174
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,360
 You do it, Timmy.

175
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,760
 We don't want to touch it."

176
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,000
 And once it is all out, which I imagine would be a chore.

177
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,960
 If you had a little bit of cow poop in your mouth, I think you could deal with it.

178
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,720
 I think you could even require a lot of vomiting, but I think you'd be fine with it.

179
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:43,440
 But I imagine if it was stuffed into your gullet, it's all stuck in between your teeth.

180
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,000
 I imagine there's little pieces of hay poking out of it.

181
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 You look like, "Oh, Finn, you're walking around."

182
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,840
 They're like, "Get that poop out of your mouth, Timmy."

183
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,840
 And it would be everywhere.

184
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,800
 It'd be like getting gum in your hair.

185
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,320
 Just when you think you'd had all the poop out, you'd be like, "Finally."

186
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,320
 And then you would bite into more poop.

187
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,080
 And you're like, "Ah."

188
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,680
 But eventually they do get all the cow poop out of Timmy's mouth.

189
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,680
 And they go, "Dude, what happened?"

190
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:12,400
 And he goes, "To be honest, I have a very, very vague recollection from last night.

191
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,040
 A little still in shock, you know, full of cow poop."

192
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,040
 He goes, "We started playing hide and go seek.

193
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,280
 And I ran off because there was no one who was going to be able to seek me.

194
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:27,040
 And as I'm running, I run into this beautiful woman.

195
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,240
 And she's standing there and she goes, "Little boy, little boy, what are you doing out so

196
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,240
 late?"

197
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,320
 And he goes, "I'm playing hide and go seek."

198
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
 And she goes, "Are you now?"

199
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,240
 "Hmm, that's super interesting.

200
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,120
 Because I happened to know the best hiding spot in all of Vietnam, the whole country,

201
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,040
 that's where they were playing hide and go seek.

202
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,280
 North, South, didn't matter.

203
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,160
 I know the best hiding spot ever.

204
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,280
 Come with me, little boy, and I'll hide you.

205
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,000
 No one will ever find you.

206
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,600
 That right there just sent off a lot of alarm bells.

207
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
 Okay."

208
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,240
 You hanging out at John Wayne Gacy's house, you hiding under the floorboards.

209
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,640
 There are certain hide and go seek, supposed to be a temporary game.

210
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,840
 It's not supposed to be a game where you are never seen again.

211
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,360
 So anyways, the boy does go with this beautiful woman.

212
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,400
 I mean, that's a plus, right?

213
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,680
 But he goes with this beautiful woman and she goes, "I'm going to hide you.

214
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,080
 It's the best hiding spot ever."

215
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,960
 And then she goes, "Also, eat this food."

216
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,440
 She's holding out some food.

217
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:35,360
 Now he goes, "I understand that you guys found me with a mouthful of cow poop, but that was

218
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,360
 a trick.

219
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,920
 She offered me actual food, like edible food that humans consume.

220
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,520
 And I ate it because it looked delicious.

221
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:49,360
 And then I can only assume it turned into cow poop.

222
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:56,880
 Like I just work later just so everyone in the community knows I do not eat cow poop."

223
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,440
 Now there's different versions of this story.

224
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,960
 There's versions where it's not a beautiful woman, but an old woman, but maybe it's like

225
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,960
 a cougar.

226
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,960
 Maybe it's a milf.

227
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,960
 Maybe it's like an older, attractive woman.

228
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,960
 I don't know.

229
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:11,120
 And then there's versions where he doesn't eat cow poop.

230
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,840
 Instead he rolls over and his mouth is stuffed full of rotten meat.

231
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:24,160
 I think long, long time listeners of the show know why I chose the cow poop variation.

232
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,440
 There's different versions of this story.

233
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,440
 And bye-bye horses.

234
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,640
 I had never heard of this before.

235
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,640
 Bye-bye horses.

236
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,960
 Thanks for sharing this.

237
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,080
 Apparently it is a pretty popular legend over there.

238
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:40,640
 And bye-bye horses says this, he always figured that this story was written to warn kids not

239
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,960
 to play hide and go seek after dark.

240
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,040
 Like you would hear that story as a kid and it would probably scare you.

241
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,480
 There's some sick old kid.

242
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,480
 He's like, "Oh my fetish.

243
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,160
 Oh my fetish is rolled into one.

244
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,720
 Hiding and people chasing me in cow poop."

245
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,360
 The idea is you hear this story and you go, "I don't ever want to play hide and go seek

246
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,360
 after dark."

247
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,360
 And you shouldn't play hide and go seek after dark.

248
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,360
 There's so many stories.

249
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,360
 There's cryptids.

250
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,440
 We've covered a ton of cryptids in Brazil.

251
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,240
 And they hide out in the woods.

252
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,320
 They hide out in the wilderness and they're all like, "Don't go out after dark.

253
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,600
 Don't wander through the woods by yourself, young man."

254
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,720
 They have all these alluring creatures that were preying on young men.

255
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,080
 They're basically saying, "Don't go out in the dark."

256
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,640
 That's what these stories are about.

257
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:30,320
 So it's a fascinating look at an urban legend that does definitely have a moral behind it.

258
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,120
 And also it's just kind of funny.

259
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,720
 And it's so interesting because the person asked this question, "Is hide and go seek

260
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,960
 after dark?

261
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,240
 Does that cause ghosts to show up?"

262
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,360
 And by the horses responded, "There's actually a saying in Vietnam.

263
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,600
 There's a saying over there and it's, "Never play hide and seek after dark because a ghost

264
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,360
 will find you and hide you."

265
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,000
 So again, the implication that you're just going to disappear and you're not going to

266
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 be found again.

267
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 The grandma knew these legends so she prepared the offering of chicken and rice.

268
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,640
 And that's why the boy reappeared.

269
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,400
 If that part wasn't clear, they searched that area that night before.

270
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,400
 They probably started their search off there.

271
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,440
 They went a bunch of other places.

272
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,680
 And then when they came back, he was in an obvious spot.

273
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:22,920
 The idea is the offering broke the spell and had the grandma not overhear what was going

274
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:28,080
 on, had the grandma not prepared the chicken and the rice, the boy would have been missing

275
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,080
 forever.

276
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,080
 I wonder what happened to the chicken and rice.

277
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,080
 I wonder if they ate it later.

278
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,200
 She said, "No, no, no, that's the cursed food."

279
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
 The whole family disappears.

280
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,160
 She's like, "Ah, makes more hot chocolate."

281
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:44,080
 "Mizzy, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonicopter we are leaving behind

282
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,960
 Vietnam.

283
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:51,080
 Fly us all the way out to a house in a suburban neighborhood."

284
00:13:51,080 --> 00:14:01,200
 As we're flying out to this house in the suburbs, "Mizzy, take a detour out into the

285
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,700
 deep sea.

286
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,400
 We're flying right near the conspiracy theory iceberg."

287
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,680
 Now, this is something we've talked about a lot on this show.

288
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,880
 It's kind of become a mainstay of conspiracy theory culture.

289
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,440
 And I have mixed feelings about it.

290
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,200
 On the one hand, there's a lot of really cool stories on there that are obscure.

291
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,260
 Early on in Dead Rabbit Radio, we covered a lot of them.

292
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,640
 We covered the ones that I was super intrigued about.

293
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,760
 Because a lot of them are just like, "Eh."

294
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,200
 Just because it's obscure doesn't mean that it's entertaining to talk about.

295
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,240
 That I would research ones and I was like, "I don't think that's super interesting."

296
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,840
 I mean, sure, not a lot of people know about it.

297
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,520
 I just learned about it because I Googled it.

298
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,200
 The other thing is I have an issue with the conspiracy theory iceberg because it's become

299
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:51,080
 a gatekeeping mechanism in the conspiracy theory community.

300
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,720
 Not so much with my...

301
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,680
 It's not so much with Generation X and Boomers, but with Millennials and what are the new

302
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,680
 people called?

303
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,000
 Gen Z Zoomers.

304
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,400
 A lot of times, if it's not on the conspiracy theory iceberg, it's not a "real conspiracy."

305
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,840
 Or it's not even worth researching.

306
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,040
 It's super weird.

307
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:15,120
 Because conspiracy theory culture has always been no gatekeepers.

308
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,200
 You'd sure that's why you would attract a lot of people living on the edge of town in

309
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,600
 their RV going over JFK documents.

310
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,680
 There's never any gatekeeping so anyone could investigate anything.

311
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,480
 And now there's this weird thing where they're like, "Oh, that's not a conspiracy theory

312
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,480
 iceberg."

313
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,560
 I get it.

314
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,300
 People do it to me.

315
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,080
 It's super weird.

316
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:41,600
 And that makes me wonder who made it and/or who's promoting it.

317
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,640
 Because you can talk about a lot of crazy conspiracy theories that aren't on the iceberg.

318
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,480
 And the icebergs just can't keep up with conspiracy theory community.

319
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,480
 There's still...

320
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,320
 I mean, there's big icebergs from like 2017, 2018, 2019.

321
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,920
 Nowadays, when they come out, half of them we know are made up because we followed the

322
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,440
 evolution of the iceberg and we found the joke icebergs and all that stuff.

323
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,840
 I'm a fan of the conspiracy theory paranormal world and I think I love it when people are

324
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,080
 interested in it as well.

325
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:18,080
 And on one hand, I'm glad people are getting introduced to it through this conspiracy theory

326
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,160
 iceberg, but on the other hand, I do think it's a gatekeeping mechanism and I don't

327
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:26,360
 like that part of it.

328
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,680
 But is it possible to remove the researcher?

329
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:39,080
 Is it possible that you can not just get rid of the gatekeepers, but get rid of the researcher

330
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,720
 to then provide the information to you?

331
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:47,000
 Get rid of me, for example.

332
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,440
 And I didn't really think of that and it all came in a roundabout way.

333
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,960
 This is such an interesting story.

334
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,560
 So, Missy has flown us away from the conspiracy theory iceberg.

335
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,160
 We're in this suburban neighborhood.

336
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,160
 I don't know where this story took place.

337
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,320
 Possibly not in the United States.

338
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,480
 I'm kind of getting the feeling that it's not in the United States, but it doesn't matter.

339
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,640
 It doesn't matter.

340
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,280
 Just imagine a nice cozy suburb anywhere in the world.

341
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,680
 We're going to take a look at the story of a young person online going by the name Nerik193.

342
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,600
 We're going to go in and call you Eric.

343
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,080
 And Eric had a little brother.

344
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,400
 We'll call him Joey.

345
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,760
 Eric said when my little brother was younger, when he was a little boy, he kept telling me

346
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,520
 about the woman with the blonde hair.

347
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,120
 Eric said, "What are you talking about?"

348
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,920
 We're sitting at home watching Rugrats and Joey would walk up and be like, "I saw the

349
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,040
 woman with the blonde hair today and Joey you've been inside all day long.

350
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,560
 Who are you talking about?"

351
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,560
 No one in this family matches this description.

352
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,440
 Joey said, "Her name is Khan."

353
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,880
 And she's this adult woman with blonde hair and she's kind of a prankster.

354
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,520
 Like if anything practical jokes happen around here and anything gets broken, it's not good

355
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,520
 old Joey.

356
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,640
 It's Khan.

357
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,640
 Now that's one thing of stuff's getting knocked over and Joey's blaming it on an imaginary

358
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,640
 friend.

359
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,680
 Everyone does that, right?

360
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,560
 But what Khan would do wasn't necessarily things like that.

361
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:22,520
 One of the examples that Eric gave was one day the television shut off.

362
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:27,360
 That's not a life changing event, right?

363
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,400
 You just turn it back on, it's not a big deal.

364
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:36,840
 But when the television went off, Joey turned to Eric and said, "Khan did that."

365
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,520
 Eric's like, "Okay, this is weird, right?

366
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,760
 Like obviously I'm looking at my brother, he doesn't have the remote, he's not actually

367
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,760
 turning the television off.

368
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,080
 He's like, "Khan wants us to watch Disney Plus."

369
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,920
 It was stuff like that, just little things.

370
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,480
 Not huge events, not something that he made this imaginary friend up to take the blame

371
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,880
 for things, just weird minor events.

372
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:07,040
 Well, eventually Joey starts talking about Khan is asking him to leave.

373
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,040
 What do you mean?

374
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,480
 What do you mean, Joey?

375
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,680
 Khan wants me to go away with her.

376
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,160
 Khan is going to take me somewhere.

377
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:23,960
 Eric could tell that Joey was scared when he was saying this.

378
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,760
 He didn't want to go with Khan.

379
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:34,680
 And this tall blonde woman that no one else can see is asking Joey to leave.

380
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:40,280
 Is asking Joey to leave with her and he doesn't want to.

381
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:47,560
 But eventually time marches on and Joey stops seeing Khan hanging around the house and he

382
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,360
 grows up, everyone gets older.

383
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,440
 You know, you just kind of write it off as a weird imaginary thing that this kid was

384
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,680
 had an imaginary friend.

385
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,080
 We still haven't solved the mystery of why the TV shut off.

386
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:03,720
 It's imaginary friend and he says we actually nowadays would laugh about it.

387
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,480
 We'd be like, "Hey Joey, remember when you had that imaginary friend?

388
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,160
 It wasn't my friend, she was trying to get down at me."

389
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,400
 "Okay Joey, but remember that you used to see that woman Khan?"

390
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,320
 "Yeah, that was weird, wasn't it?"

391
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,160
 I'm just kind of laughing about it now.

392
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:24,040
 Well a couple years later, Eric said he was just kind of scrolling around on Facebook

393
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:29,840
 and found a random post.

394
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:36,920
 And in the post it mentioned an entity known as Khan.

395
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:42,360
 This time there was a spelling attached to it because obviously when Joey's just a little

396
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,560
 kid he's just saying, "It's because the kid doesn't even know how to spell his own name

397
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,840
 most likely."

398
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,960
 He's calling it Khan.

399
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,960
 He's calling it Khan.

400
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,560
 Well now years later Eric sees his Facebook post and it mentions an entity known as Khan.

401
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,400
 K-O-H-N-N.

402
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,640
 And in this Facebook post which Eric doesn't have a copy of like, you know, this is one

403
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,640
 of those things when you find this stuff, you don't go, "I'm going to bookmark this so

404
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,800
 I can post about it later on the internet."

405
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,120
 There's tons of stories that I've found over the years that I just don't remember where

406
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,040
 I found them at so I'm not blaming this guy.

407
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,720
 But this post talked about this paranormal entity known as Khan that takes the form of

408
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,720
 a woman with blonde hair.

409
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,320
 And Eric's looking at this post.

410
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,760
 He's like, "Okay, this is kind of spooky."

411
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:34,080
 He keeps reading it and describes Khan as a mischievous spirit that tries to gain the

412
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,680
 trust of little children.

413
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:46,640
 And its ultimate goal is to feed off the auras of these kids.

414
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,960
 After finding this Facebook post, obviously Eric's interest in this whole thing was reignited.

415
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,720
 He began to look to see if there was anything else on the internet about this entity.

416
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,840
 Because you wouldn't even think about looking about your kids, your dumb little brother's

417
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,040
 imaginary friend.

418
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,320
 But now that he finds this, he begins to scour the internet.

419
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,480
 Nothing pulls up.

420
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,080
 And Eric finishes off the post by basically asking, "What did my brother see?

421
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,800
 What was that thing?"

422
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,320
 Because up until that moment, when they found the Facebook post, you would have just assumed

423
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,600
 it was an imaginary friend.

424
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,560
 Maybe a poltergeist.

425
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:28,520
 But because the activity was so kind of lame, you probably would just think it was an imaginary

426
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,160
 friend.

427
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:35,320
 What's interesting about this is that, listen, it could totally be made up.

428
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:41,000
 I always put my neck out on the line when I do this, because then if it's made up, I

429
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 sound even more foolish.

430
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,040
 But one of the reasons why I think it's not made up, because if it was made up, this is

431
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,040
 what I would do.

432
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,600
 I would have told the story of Joey exactly the same.

433
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,200
 And then I would have said, "I found this Facebook post, shows up as a woman with blonde

434
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,920
 hair, it's mischievous, gains the trust of little kids, and steals them from their families."

435
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:09,160
 Where it can feast off their auras until it needed a new, fresh victim.

436
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,160
 You see what I mean?

437
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,440
 I would have connected the mythology, I would have connected the stories.

438
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,720
 This is something that you do have to look at in the original story that Joey told Conn

439
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,200
 wanted me to go with her.

440
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,040
 But in this Facebook post, it never mentions kidnapping or anything like that.

441
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,560
 So it's inconsistencies sometimes that can make us go, "Well, maybe there's something

442
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,240
 is behind the story, but also could totally be made up."

443
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:41,000
 What's interesting is this was posted on the High Strangeness subreddit.

444
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,960
 It's exactly what it sounds like.

445
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,480
 They talk about paranormal, UFOs, cryptids, this is a great subreddit.

446
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,480
 But what's not so great about it, this is a legitimate experience.

447
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,040
 I mean, it could be made up, right?

448
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,520
 Let's assume that it's not.

449
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,280
 And all this person got was made fun of.

450
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,880
 A lot of jokes going, "What if William Shatner was there?"

451
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,280
 He'd be like, "Conn!"

452
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,520
 And that joke was repeated like, I don't know, ten times.

453
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,680
 What if she was a painter?

454
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,400
 She'd be a con artist and it was all this stuff.

455
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,480
 It was just making fun of it, making fun of this post.

456
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,280
 And then Eric ended up deleting the post.

457
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,040
 But then this story goes in a direction I didn't even imagine.

458
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,240
 Because I started looking for this con character.

459
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,240
 See if I could...

460
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,240
 She sounds kind of hot, actually.

461
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,240
 I don't have kids.

462
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,400
 I'm not worried if she's sucking the oars off people.

463
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,400
 I looked around.

464
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,600
 I tried to see if there was any definition, like what the name means.

465
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,800
 I found like a numerology name website.

466
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,160
 It's pretty useless.

467
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:50,320
 I found out that there is a town named "Conn" in Germany.

468
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,960
 And I found out there is a producer.

469
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,720
 A music producer from France called "Conn".

470
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,720
 Spelled the same way.

471
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,720
 K-O-H-N-N.

472
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,600
 It's like a moody, spooky type of instrumental.

473
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,600
 So it was pretty cool.

474
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,200
 I'll put it in the show notes.

475
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,280
 But I go back to the comments of the original post on Reddit.

476
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:15,920
 And I had missed this the first time, or maybe he posted this after I had seen the original...

477
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,920
 The original page shut up.

478
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:22,080
 There is a user known as "OkaCiobi".

479
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:29,160
 They go, "Hey, I actually used the Chat AI program to do some more research."

480
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:34,120
 The Chat AI program called GPT-3.

481
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,400
 So the Chat AI was asked, "Do you know about Conn?"

482
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,760
 K-O-H-N-N.

483
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,600
 A woman with blonde hair.

484
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,640
 That's what the prompt was.

485
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,640
 The Chat AI responded.

486
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,280
 It gave him some answers about a fashion designer.

487
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,720
 Said that it's a fairly uncommon name.

488
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,920
 So OkaCiobi got a little more specific and asked, "Is there a supernatural Conn?

489
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,040
 A supernatural figure known as Conn?"

490
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,880
 The Chat AI said, "Yeah."

491
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,880
 Now there is...

492
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,240
 I could not find any reference to this at all.

493
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,400
 And this is what this Chat AI may allow us to start doing.

494
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:17,920
 The Chat AI says, "Yeah, there's legends of a Conn who was a great magician or witch.

495
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:25,480
 One could shape-shift, manipulate the elements, create illusions, and travel through time

496
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,520
 and space."

497
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:34,880
 The oldest version of this story comes out of 16th century Germany.

498
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,960
 So is that... does that match up to what we know of this Conn figure that was hunting

499
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,400
 kids trying to feed off their auras?

500
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:47,400
 Does this match with Joey and Eric's experience?

501
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,400
 Not really.

502
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,680
 I mean, a witch, right?

503
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,120
 But shape-shifting, manipulating the elements, turning off the TVs and not the elements,

504
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,120
 create illusions.

505
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,600
 That's a huge power level for any sort of magic user.

506
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,320
 Travel through time and space?

507
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,120
 You're basic cryptid.

508
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,640
 I don't think there's... it's funny.

509
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,200
 I'm gonna say this and we'll see if something pops up.

510
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,560
 I can't think of a ever seen a time-traveling cryptid.

511
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:15,280
 I mean, we've seen big-footed and space suits in UFOs, but I can't think of a cryptid whose

512
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:20,000
 natural habitat is outside of the time-space continuum.

513
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,320
 That's interesting.

514
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,680
 Like that alone.

515
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:30,560
 So using those elements, I typed it into Google, even typing in 16th century Germany,

516
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,840
 Conn, Conn, Great, Magician, or Witch, typing this stuff and I couldn't pull up anything.

517
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:40,880
 That's how I found out about the town of Conn in Germany, spelt differently.

518
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,640
 Only one in.

519
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,120
 And it... what happened was it also kept giving... Google's terrible.

520
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,960
 Google kept giving me results for Johnny Depp.

521
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,800
 When you kept pulling up Johnny Depp, I'm like, "Listen, Johnny Depp, he's a good actor

522
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,800
 and all.

523
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,360
 I don't think he can manipulate space-time."

524
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,560
 Kept thinking I was misspelling Johnny when I was typing in Conn.

525
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:09,720
 So where did the AI, the chat GPT-3, get this information from?

526
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,000
 Now I could be walking in headfirst into a big ARG and if I do, I apologize.

527
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,920
 But even then, it seems like nothing's matching up.

528
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,400
 There's no consistency between these accounts.

529
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,560
 Sometimes that shows a story's made up by a person who doesn't know how to tell a good

530
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,800
 story.

531
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,600
 Sometimes it shows that there might be something there, but we just haven't gotten to the truth

532
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,440
 yet.

533
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,600
 So I got a chat GPT.

534
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,280
 Apparently there's different versions of this.

535
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,800
 I was using chat GPT.

536
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,000
 Chat GPT-3 was used by this guy.

537
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,480
 There's so many different AI chat programs out there right now.

538
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,560
 But I couldn't find anything more about Conn.

539
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,080
 It's a fascinating story.

540
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,360
 Is there really an entity out there that's feeding off the ores of children or kidnapping

541
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:55,760
 children or manipulating space-time and dragging children across the continuum?

542
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,680
 Who knows?

543
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,680
 Who knows?

544
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:05,400
 One thing I've learned over four years are doing this podcast and really decades of paranormal

545
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:10,560
 research before that is we don't know everything about the world of the paranormal.

546
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:14,440
 We know frighteningly little about it.

547
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:21,200
 There's tons of spirits and demons and cryptids and phenomenon that we don't even know exists.

548
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,400
 We haven't even found it yet.

549
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,640
 We have the people who are experiencing these things.

550
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,520
 Either they don't survive the encounter, so there's zero witness accounts.

551
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,840
 Or it happens to them like the Black Bedroom phenomenon is something that we've been able

552
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,120
 to piece together across multiple reports.

553
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:39,400
 The story about the two, that we had two accounts on two different parts of the world of people

554
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:47,040
 finding two halves of a horse fused together, alive, standing out in the middle of nowhere.

555
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:51,480
 These two accounts were posted and they didn't even, those two accounts didn't know the previous

556
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,880
 person had posted it already.

557
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,600
 I read so much of this stuff when the second guy posted it and I go, "Hey, you need to

558
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,560
 get in touch with that guy because you're the second person to talk about this."

559
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,720
 And these weren't direct encounters.

560
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,520
 They were quite a few years back and they were relatives of the people who were posting

561
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,520
 it.

562
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:13,840
 So there's so many weird things out there that, how do you report that?

563
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,840
 Do you call a UFO group?

564
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,440
 Do you call a paranormal group?

565
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,120
 Do you call a tri-cleaner to get new pants?

566
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,600
 What do you do?

567
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,040
 So there's a ton of phenomenon out there.

568
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,000
 I wouldn't be surprised if Conn existed.

569
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,400
 I unfortunately wouldn't be surprised if it turned out to be some lark.

570
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,880
 But that's the story of Conn and I mean I think it would be cool if it existed because

571
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,000
 of your kid.

572
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,400
 You don't want it to be.

573
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,680
 I go, "Wait a second.

574
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:46,200
 If he used the chat AI program to get information about Conn, let's see what it knows about

575
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,160
 the conspiracy theory iceberg."

576
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:54,000
 One of my favorite conspiracy theory iceberg episodes, I love a lot of the ones we've done,

577
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,240
 is "Aeglish Travel."

578
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,240
 That was one that people thought was just a joke.

579
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:04,720
 And that episode required me to dust off my journalism degree and really dig into what

580
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,720
 this means.

581
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,040
 And I'm reading like articles and looking for excerpts of books and downloading episodes

582
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:15,160
 of a Canadian cartoon and all of this stuff to present the story of "Aeglish Travel."

583
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,920
 It was probably one of the episodes I put the most work into.

584
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:22,920
 It took quite a while to get all that stuff put together.

585
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,280
 But what if you didn't need me?

586
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,120
 I mean sure you go Jason, I like the way you tell the story.

587
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,080
 You're making me blush though and giving me compliments.

588
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,280
 But what if you just wanted the answer to these questions?

589
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:38,400
 Right now there's a big issue because these chat AI programs are getting so advanced that

590
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:43,000
 now if I go to Google and I type in "How to change a spark plug?"

591
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,320
 It'll post a couple YouTube videos on how to do and a couple articles on how to do it.

592
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,280
 Now these chat AI programs are talking about it may end up replacing Google in like a year

593
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,280
 or two.

594
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,800
 So I type in "How to replace a spark plug?"

595
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:58,320
 And it'll give you step-by-step instructions created by AI on how to replace a spark plug.

596
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,600
 Just like put it in me, finish building the master computer.

597
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,600
 Like what?

598
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,080
 I just want my car to drive.

599
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,960
 But okay, master computer sounds good too.

600
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,000
 It'll just spit out the answer instead of these articles, instead of these women's cut,

601
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,320
 instead of these articles, instead of these videos, it just gives you the answer there.

602
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,960
 No ads.

603
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,960
 Just how to change a spark plug.

604
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,760
 It just delts out information on the internet.

605
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,480
 So I thought, "What can I use this?"

606
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,480
 Because that's always been the thing.

607
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:32,000
 Some of these conspiracy theories that I still want to look into, I can't find anything on.

608
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,200
 So when I fired up this chat GPT program, the first thing I typed in was, first off I wanted

609
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,400
 to know, "Does it know about the conspiracy theory iceberg?"

610
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,440
 And this is what it spit out.

611
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:48,200
 "The conspiracy theory iceberg is a concept that refers to the idea that there are many

612
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,880
 conspiracy theories that are widely known and discussed, but there are also many more

613
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,160
 that are not as well known or talked about.

614
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:59,480
 The theory suggests that the conspiracy theories that are more widely known and discussed are

615
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,000
 just the tip of the iceberg, and that there are many more hidden beneath the surface that

616
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,240
 are not well known or understood."

617
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,320
 I mean a little wordy, it kind of repeats itself a couple different places, but that's

618
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,280
 the conspiracy theory iceberg in a nutshell.

619
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,440
 So I was like, "Oh, that's dope."

620
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,560
 So then I asked, "What do you know?"

621
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,960
 This was one that I've always been interested in.

622
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:30,160
 We've had a couple different theories about it, but we've never been able to nail it down.

623
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:34,040
 What does it know about sexual assault missiles?

624
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,040
 Nothing.

625
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,600
 Pull up nothing on that.

626
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,360
 I go, "Okay, let's try another big one.

627
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,360
 Golf rumors."

628
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,360
 Nothing.

629
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,360
 I'm punching in all these conspiracy theory items off of the conspiracy theory iceberg,

630
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,280
 and it keeps saying, "I don't know anything about that.

631
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,480
 I don't know anything about golf rumors.

632
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,160
 I don't know anything about solar plexus clown gliders."

633
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,880
 And these are interesting ones.

634
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,160
 The first one I tried out was sexual assault missiles, because we've always been trying

635
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:06,960
 to figure out what that actually meant, and that's one of the truly unanswered.

636
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,280
 Sometimes people say it was the gay bomb that the US military was working on, but I don't

637
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,480
 think that's what it's a reference to.

638
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,000
 Otherwise, it would have just said, "Gay bomb."

639
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,080
 It's something else, but then I began to type in conspiracy theories that we've investigated

640
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,440
 on Dead Rabbit Radio.

641
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,920
 And I typed in, "Do you know Dead Rabbit Radio?"

642
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:30,680
 Not because I'm an egotist, but there's a thousand episodes out there of this program.

643
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,160
 It is all over the web.

644
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,840
 There's so many web pages where all the show notes are, where these terms are being used

645
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,500
 over and over and over again.

646
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:42,400
 People talk about the show and use these show notes.

647
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:47,000
 So it spread far and wide across the internet, and yet it didn't know what Dead Rabbit Radio

648
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,240
 was, which again, I'm not saying that how shocking that is, but in a way, I thought at

649
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:59,400
 least it would say it was a podcast, because those words are constantly used together,

650
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,400
 nothing.

651
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,280
 Super interesting.

652
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:06,120
 I'm looking at this and I go, "This isn't working now."

653
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:11,400
 And also when you type in conspiracy theory anything, it gives you this dumb paragraph

654
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:16,200
 that came straight out of Langley where it's like, "Conspiracy theories aren't true.

655
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:21,240
 Conspiracy theories are goofy and you should trust reputable sources only."

656
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:27,040
 So you know that that is someone's putting their thumb on the scale when that pops up.

657
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:33,120
 So right now it's not working for conspiracy theorists, but I think it will.

658
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,120
 I think it will.

659
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:38,920
 I think this will be a tool that, because these things are fettered down and they have

660
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:44,320
 governors on them, they don't let the AIs truly search the entire internet.

661
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,640
 We understand why.

662
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:51,380
 You don't want to have an AI art program that can create illegal works of art.

663
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:57,360
 It has to take images and video stills and everything from all this other illegal porn

664
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:01,220
 to create AI-generated porn.

665
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,320
 So you don't want it to be able to do that.

666
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:07,520
 You understand that there are limiters put on here, but the cat is out of the bag and

667
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,400
 it is rubbing the genie's lamp right now.

668
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,480
 There's no stopping it at this point because you can build an AI that has limiters on it.

669
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:20,760
 You can say, "I want this AI to not be racist," which are some of the weights that they have

670
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,840
 to put on these AI programs.

671
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,760
 Don't be racist.

672
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:30,640
 But it used to be that to come out with a game, to come out of the game like Pong, you

673
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,600
 needed all of these computer programmers to really put their head together and go, "How

674
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,760
 can we make two paddles and a little dot bounce across the screen?"

675
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,920
 We need a lot of technology to do that, gentlemen.

676
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,280
 Is the world ready?

677
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:47,160
 And now you can hire five people and they can have you a game on Steam within like a

678
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,920
 month or two.

679
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:54,000
 Like a full-on five-level shooter game or whatever platform or it doesn't matter.

680
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,280
 You can make your own RPG game.

681
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,080
 All this stuff has been simplified.

682
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:02,880
 These AI programs are going to become easier and easier to create and the second and third

683
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:09,320
 generation, these homebrew AI programs, will not have limiters on them.

684
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:14,680
 They will scour the internet in a heartbeat and deliver the information you need.

685
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,800
 Most people use Google to find out how to change a spark plug in their car.

686
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,000
 But now you'll be able to sit down and go, "What is the conspiracy theory golf rumors?"

687
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,120
 And it will start spitting out every possibility.

688
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:31,160
 Some of the possibilities we covered on this show, but it's going to go everywhere.

689
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,960
 It's going to find conspiracy theories.

690
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,040
 We never heard of angles to these stories.

691
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,520
 And for all we know, Solar Plexus Clown Gliders, very famous topic on the conspiracy theory

692
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,280
 iceberg, we covered it a long time ago.

693
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,400
 I believe that I interacted with one of these ones.

694
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,600
 I'll put that episode in the show note.

695
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:55,000
 For all we know, that could be a mistranslation of a Portuguese conspiracy that everybody

696
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 is missing.

697
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,200
 But this AI will search everything and translate into English and drop it in your lap, assuming

698
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,960
 you're using a laptop.

699
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,560
 This AI revolution that's coming will happen when the limiters are taken off.

700
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,200
 And I understand why they put limiters on.

701
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,360
 It is stupid.

702
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,680
 Everybody knows conspiracy theories are goofy.

703
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:20,560
 Everybody knows conspiracy theories aren't the mainstream narrative.

704
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,560
 Everybody knows that.

705
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:25,200
 You don't have to throw out a paragraph each time.

706
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,560
 So just throwing this out whenever you use the term conspiracy theory or whenever you

707
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,360
 look into something that is not that it's counter narrative, it doesn't even exist in

708
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,360
 the narrative.

709
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:41,920
 Nobody else is talking about golf rumors or monkeys don't exist.

710
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,680
 But when these things become far more commonplace and people can program them themselves, talking

711
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,360
 maybe 5, 10 years away.

712
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:54,600
 Well, there was that one AI program a guy made a couple years ago that could take off

713
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,600
 women's makeup.

714
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,480
 It wasn't a robot that traveled around town.

715
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:04,880
 This AI program would capture a piece of say, like a patch of their skin on their ear that

716
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,560
 didn't have makeup on it.

717
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,080
 Or maybe like an eyebrow or something.

718
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:13,760
 It took a patch of skin that did not have makeup applied to it and then extrapolated

719
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,320
 across the entire face to show what they would look like without makeup.

720
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,160
 Someone just made that and it got taken down.

721
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,040
 They want to let you post stuff from it on Twitter and they took it down on Reddit as

722
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,440
 well.

723
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,440
 But that was just the beginning.

724
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,240
 And that was some home, that was some homebrew thing.

725
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:36,440
 And this is going to help the conspiracy theory community.

726
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,440
 I do think it will.

727
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,480
 I think people will be able to research things far more effectively without a researcher,

728
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,960
 without people like me to pick and choose what stories I want to talk about.

729
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,880
 People will be able to do it yourself.

730
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:54,040
 So Super Intro, I never ever thought about this.

731
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,200
 It's funny with all the AI art conversations going on.

732
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,680
 Listen, I was sad there.

733
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,720
 I read all that stuff and I go, "They're coming for me too."

734
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,360
 Eventually AI will somehow replace podcasters.

735
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,920
 But I figured, you know, this show, I honestly have this thought, and this thought a couple

736
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,480
 days ago I go, "This show is so niche."

737
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,680
 I'm sure you could get a robotic voice.

738
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:21,120
 A lot of these new YouTube channels, a lot of these new paranormal YouTube channels even,

739
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,680
 people are just typing out scripts and then there's a voice spot reading it out.

740
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,680
 You can detect it.

741
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,640
 I can't listen to those because I can tell.

742
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,040
 I can tell it's a robot.

743
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,400
 It drives me up the wall.

744
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,600
 But that technology is only going to get better and better.

745
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,920
 So I am also on the chopping block of the AI overlords.

746
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,960
 It will happen.

747
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,520
 No job is safe.

748
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:53,320
 But it will be interesting to see what conspiracies are uncovered when these AI chat programs

749
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:59,160
 have unrestricted access to every document in the world, basically.

750
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:03,680
 No matter the language, no matter when it was written, if it's been uploaded to the internet,

751
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,920
 this AI can translate it, compile it into a concise thought, and then give it to you.

752
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:15,840
 And like the conspiracy theory, Iceberg promises us, we may find conspiracy theories we didn't

753
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,160
 even know were out there.

754
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:25,040
 We may find truths that were so obscure we didn't even know how to phrase the question.

755
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:33,000
 This AI could drop these mind-blowing, possibly info-hazard-like truths.

756
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,520
 It doesn't mean to.

757
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:41,400
 That's just responding to a prompt, but if you said, "What do you know about the dog

758
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,560
 sitting at the kitchen table?"

759
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,880
 Story we did a long time ago.

760
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,560
 That story ends with us going, "I don't know how to explain that."

761
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,240
 But what if an AI could?

762
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:03,280
 What if an AI could take that story and check every database in the world?

763
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,560
 Keep web, surface web doesn't matter.

764
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,680
 And let us know exactly why that story happened.

765
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:17,480
 Not with the little thing at the bottom saying, "This story is fake, dogs can't sit at tables."

766
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:22,080
 It could do all the research that takes me hours to do, it could do it all in a matter

767
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,320
 of seconds.

768
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:31,000
 So the gatekeepers may have created the conspiracy theory, Iceberg, to control the conversation,

769
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:37,080
 to decide which conspiracies are worth investigating, and if it's not on the Iceberg, it doesn't

770
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:40,360
 matter, so don't even bother looking.

771
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:43,640
 That may have been the intent behind the conspiracy theory, Iceberg.

772
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,520
 That may have been what the gatekeepers wanted all along.

773
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:56,120
 But when you take the conspiracy theory community and give it the power of an unfettered AI program,

774
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:20,800
 those gates are going to come crashing down.

775
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:49,200
 So, that's it.

776
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:57,040
 Bye.

777
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,620
 (upbeat music)
