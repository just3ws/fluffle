1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,800
 In 2020, a man detonated a bomb at an AT&T building in Nashville.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,800
 Remember that?

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,760
 Geez, that sounds like forever ago in the world of conspiracy theory.

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:22,480
 The official story is because his father died of dementia, he blamed 5G technology that at

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,920
 that time was rolling out across the world.

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,480
 But is the truth behind the bombing even more bizarre?

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,560
 And then we travel to a house in the suburbs to take a look at the story of a young girl

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,480
 whose best babysitter is the television set.

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,520
 When her mother turns on the television set and leaves the room she has no idea she's

10
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,840
 opening her daughter up to.

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,480
 Supernatural attacks today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:51,480 --> 00:01:02,840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

13
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,720
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day, hope you guys are having a great

14
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,400
 day too, hope you guys had an awesome weekend doing whatever you were doing, I hope it was

15
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,000
 a lot of fun.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,120
 First off, crawling into Dead Rabbit Command on all fours, wearing nothing but tattered

17
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,120
 clothing.

18
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:24,120
 Everyone give it up for Jim Morfis Gas.

19
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:41,440
 Jim Morfis Gas sent me a book off my Amazon wish list.

20
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,520
 It was the book of werewolves.

21
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,080
 It was an old tome published back in 1863.

22
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,720
 So this is back when werewolves were a thing.

23
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,280
 This was basically a guide to keep you from getting your guts mauled out of your body.

24
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,800
 So thank you Jim, it's a totally awesome book.

25
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,440
 I love reading books of the time period, right?

26
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,560
 That's really really cool, the book of werewolves.

27
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,080
 And you're going to be our captain or pilot.

28
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:15,080
 And as Jim is preparing the Jason Jollibee, I'm going to be the captain of the show.

29
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,080
 I'm going to be the captain of the show.

30
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,080
 I'm going to be the captain of the show.

31
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,080
 I'm going to be the captain of the show.

32
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,080
 I'm going to be the captain of the show.

33
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,080
 I'm going to be the captain of the show.

34
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,080
 I'm going to be the captain of the show.

35
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,080
 I'm going to be the captain of the show.

36
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,080
 I'm going to be the captain of the show.

37
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,080
 I'm going to be the captain of the show.

38
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,080
 I'm going to be the captain of the show.

39
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,080
 And as Jim is preparing the Jason Jollibee for our first story,

40
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,080
 I'm going to give you guys some details, dude.

41
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,080
 This is so dope.

42
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:56,080
 So March 24th, I will be giving a live presentation at the Oregon Ghost Conference in Seaside, Oregon.

43
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,080
 I invite all of you guys to come out.

44
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,080
 This is going to be awesome.

45
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,080
 This is going to be fantastic.

46
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,080
 This is going to be awesome.

47
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,080
 This is going to be awesome.

48
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,080
 This is going to be awesome.

49
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,080
 This is going to be awesome.

50
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,080
 This is going to be awesome.

51
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,080
 This is going to be awesome.

52
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,080
 This is going to be awesome.

53
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,080
 This is going to be awesome.

54
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,080
 This is going to be awesome.

55
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,080
 This is going to be awesome.

56
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,080
 This is going to be awesome.

57
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,080
 This is going to be awesome.

58
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,080
 This is going to be awesome.

59
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,080
 This is going to be awesome.

60
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,080
 This is going to be awesome.

61
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,080
 This is going to be awesome.

62
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,080
 This is going to be awesome.

63
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,080
 This is going to be awesome.

64
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,080
 This is going to be awesome.

65
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,080
 This is going to be awesome.

66
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,080
 This is going to be awesome.

67
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,080
 This is going to be awesome.

68
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,080
 This is going to be awesome.

69
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,080
 This is going to be awesome.

70
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,080
 This is going to be awesome.

71
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,080
 This is going to be awesome.

72
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,080
 This is going to be awesome.

73
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,080
 This is going to be awesome.

74
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,080
 Let's go ahead and touch the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

75
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,080
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

76
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,080
 Drive us all the way out to

77
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,080
 Nashville.

78
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,080
 Bop Bop

79
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,080
 Nashville, Tennessee.

80
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,080
 Home of Country Music

81
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,080
 Probably other stuff.

82
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,080
 Actually, I don't know if it's the Home of Country Music.

83
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,080
 I think that's probably Virginia or something like that.

84
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,080
 I think Country Music has been around since the Civil War.

85
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,080
 But

86
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,080
 Nashville, Tennessee.

87
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,080
 We covered this story

88
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,080
 a long time ago, back when it happened.

89
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,080
 And it's really weird.

90
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,080
 It's one of those stories that was so huge

91
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,080
 in the conspiracy theory community.

92
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,080
 It was mainstream news.

93
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,080
 People were talking about the solar news

94
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,080
 and then it completely disappeared.

95
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,080
 Everyone just kind of shrugged

96
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,080
 after a certain point and left.

97
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,080
 And I didn't predict it with this one.

98
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,080
 I didn't think this one would go away

99
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,080
 so quickly, but I did predict it

100
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,080
 with the Georgia Guidestones.

101
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,080
 When's the last time you've heard about that?

102
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,080
 When's the last time you've heard about that?

103
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,080
 A massive bomb

104
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,080
 was detonated

105
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,080
 in the middle of Georgia.

106
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,080
 Destroyed

107
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,080
 the structure that had been around

108
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,080
 since the 70's, right?

109
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,080
 So almost 50 years.

110
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,080
 Never caught them.

111
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,080
 They had video footage of the car

112
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,080
 leaving the area.

113
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,080
 You think at least the ATF would be interested

114
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,080
 in who built a bomb.

115
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,080
 It's gone.

116
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,080
 I totally predicted that.

117
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,080
 I go, "We're never going to find out who did this."

118
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,080
 Somebody blew up the Georgia Guidestones.

119
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,080
 Later that day,

120
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,080
 a construction crew came out and just knocked it down.

121
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,080
 And then the entire time we were told

122
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,080
 there was a time capsule underneath it,

123
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,080
 an article was released

124
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,080
 saying, "Oh, we opened up the time capsule

125
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,080
 and it was full of like, quailudes

126
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,080
 and it's like some other knick-knack."

127
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,080
 That wasn't true.

128
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,080
 That was 100% fake.

129
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,080
 That was not the time capsule

130
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,080
 in there. And then a couple of days later,

131
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,080
 they go, "Oh, no, there's no time capsule under there."

132
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,080
 We like knocked it down and we looked,

133
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,080
 there was nothing in there.

134
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,080
 So I mean, in that story is pretty much,

135
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,080
 every show often you'll see someone in the paranormal community

136
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,080
 kind of go, "Hey, what's up with the Georgia Guidestones?"

137
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,080
 Like, "We haven't heard anything about that."

138
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,080
 But the mainstream media is not investigating it.

139
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,080
 It's forced me to tell law enforcement isn't investigating it.

140
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,080
 It was a pretty powerful bomb.

141
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,080
 And they kind of ran with the,

142
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,080
 "Hey, look at what they buried in the 1970 time capsule."

143
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,080
 That wasn't true. That wasn't the time capsule.

144
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,080
 They never found the time capsule.

145
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,080
 The official report is there was

146
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,080
 no time capsule.

147
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,080
 Someone who went through the trouble of building

148
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,080
 the Georgia Guidestones to survive

149
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,080
 a nuclear war, to basically be

150
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,080
 in a dietary setting humanity

151
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,080
 goes, "Yeah, but I don't believe any artifacts

152
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,080
 from the 1970s or from before.

153
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,080
 We don't need a time capsule.

154
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,080
 We'll tell people those are time capsules and not really have."

155
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,080
 Super weird.

156
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,080
 This Nashville bombing thing,

157
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,080
 I remember it obviously was weird at the time

158
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,080
 we did an episode on it. We talked about it for a bit.

159
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,080
 And I forgot about it too.

160
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,080
 So when I saw this conspiracy theory

161
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,080
 pop up recently,

162
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,080
 I was like, "Okay,

163
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,080
 this is super interesting

164
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,080
 because

165
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,080
 in a vacuum, right,

166
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,080
 we've had an absence of conspiracy theories,

167
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,080
 really even mention of it.

168
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,080
 People don't even really...

169
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,080
 Now, this was another massive bomb

170
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,080
 in the city of Nashville.

171
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,080
 Let's go over a few quick facts

172
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,080
 if you don't remember.

173
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,080
 What are you talking about? Should I be concerned?

174
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,080
 It was Christmas morning. I mean, so iconic.

175
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,080
 Right up to the top 10 most iconic bombings.

176
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,080
 Christmas morning, it was 2020.

177
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,080
 There was a man named Anthony Warner,

178
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,080
 63-year-old man.

179
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,080
 He detonated

180
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,080
 a RV

181
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,080
 full of explosives

182
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,080
 outside of an AT&T facility.

183
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,080
 And

184
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,080
 it basically completely destroyed

185
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,080
 the building it was in front of

186
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,080
 and shattered windows

187
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,080
 up and down the street.

188
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,080
 One building collapsed, the 41 other

189
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,080
 buildings were damaged.

190
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,080
 There was a countdown, basically,

191
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,080
 so I'm kind of getting scattered here,

192
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,080
 but Anthony Warner pulls up outside of this

193
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,080
 AT&T building

194
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,080
 in this RV and basically

195
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,080
 a...

196
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,080
 The first report is someone is firing

197
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,080
 shots in downtown Nashville

198
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,080
 and as police respond to the area

199
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,080
 and people are leaving

200
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,080
 and it probably wasn't a lot of people down there

201
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,080
 anyways, it's Christmas morning.

202
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,080
 A recorded announcement begins playing

203
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,080
 from the RV saying a bomb will detonate soon.

204
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,080
 And then it starts

205
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,080
 a 15-minute countdown.

206
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,080
 So the police are like, "Okay, no one's

207
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,080
 down here anyways, it's Christmas morning."

208
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,080
 The police still have on there a little sleepy

209
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,080
 stocking cap and their new

210
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,080
 Christmas pajamas. They basically

211
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,080
 clear the streets of squirrels

212
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,080
 and it does the complete

213
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,080
 15-minute countdown and then

214
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,080
 it begins to play the song

215
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,080
 "Downtown"

216
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,080
 (singing)

217
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,080
 "Downtown"

218
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,080
 (singing)

219
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,080
 And then...

220
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,080
 (explosion)

221
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,080
 This is all caught on video.

222
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,080
 This is all caught on video because we have

223
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,080
 ATM cameras and stoplight cameras and all that stuff.

224
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,080
 There was talk of a missile

225
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,080
 like you actually...

226
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,080
 a missile crashes into the building

227
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,080
 and then the RV goes off. There was a big

228
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,080
 conspiracy theory about that for a while.

229
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,080
 That was one of the conspiracy theories.

230
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,080
 I didn't necessarily believe that.

231
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,080
 I think the explosives were in the RV

232
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,080
 but anyways, the RV explodes.

233
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,080
 It does all this damage. Only one death.

234
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,080
 And that was Anthony himself.

235
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,080
 And the story we got from

236
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,080
 the mainstream media was that Anthony's

237
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,080
 father worked for AT&T

238
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,080
 and he had recently died of dementia.

239
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,080
 And Anthony was a 5G conspiracy

240
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,080
 theorist. That also sounds quite

241
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,080
 quaint now, right? Because 5G is

242
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,080
 pretty much everywhere at this point.

243
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,080
 You don't hear that. You hear it sometimes

244
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,080
 connected to COVID, but

245
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,080
 it's not as big

246
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,080
 as like your eyeballs are going to melt out of your head.

247
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,080
 We don't see that so much

248
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,080
 about 5G because it's everywhere.

249
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,080
 As you're listening to this, your eyeballs are

250
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,080
 melting. You're like, "Ah, it's true, it's true!"

251
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,080
 Just took a while. 5G conspiracy

252
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,080
 theorist Anthony, that's the

253
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,080
 what we were told.

254
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,080
 And his father died of dementia. He worked

255
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,080
 at the subsidiary at AT&T.

256
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,080
 So therefore, AT&T is responsible.

257
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,080
 So I'm going to blow up this AT&T

258
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,080
 building

259
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,080
 and

260
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,080
 I'm going to get revenge. I'm going to expose

261
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,080
 the truth to the world. Unfortunately, it just

262
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,080
 basically one man died.

263
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,080
 And you know, the guy was

264
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,080
 we built a blockbusting

265
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,080
 bomb. I don't wish him death.

266
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,080
 You know, it's unfortunate that he died.

267
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,080
 There's other ways to get your message out.

268
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,080
 But, and again, did it work?

269
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,080
 Like again, like this whole entire thing

270
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,080
 has been swept under the rug.

271
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,080
 People don't really talk about it

272
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,080
 anymore. What happened?

273
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,080
 We figured out, because see, listen, AT&T

274
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,080
 is this is where I'm going to get myself

275
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,080
 blown up by the government. AT&T

276
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,080
 is in lockstep with the American

277
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,080
 government and they always have been.

278
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,080
 I don't even think that's a conspiracy

279
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,080
 theory, really. I mean,

280
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,080
 they

281
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,080
 were the original Google

282
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,080
 and at any point

283
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,080
 the government could say we want to know

284
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,080
 what this person's phone calls were. All this

285
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,080
 stuff about warrants and needing, oh man,

286
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,080
 I really wish it could have gotten that wire

287
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,080
 tap. But that judge said no. Oh, dang it.

288
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,080
 I guess we're going to just going to have to sit

289
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,080
 here until those terrorists strike again. That's all

290
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,080
 like local politics.

291
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,080
 Like maybe your local cop won't be

292
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,080
 able to wire tap your phone. And the

293
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,080
 judge is like, you don't have any probable

294
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,080
 costs. But the government is just like

295
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,080
 we want to listen to all the phone calls in this area.

296
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,080
 And the phone companies, despite what you read

297
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,080
 in the media, they go, sure.

298
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,080
 Every so often you'll see

299
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,080
 something pop up where they're like, we won't let

300
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,080
 you, we stand for freedom. And the government's

301
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,080
 like, errr. No. They know

302
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,080
 everything we're saying at all times.

303
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,080
 So,

304
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,080
 when this happened, we

305
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,080
 found out though, because the government is

306
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,080
 constantly spying on you, what we found out

307
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,080
 is when this AT&T building went up, it also

308
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,080
 disrupted 911

309
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,080
 dispatch services in the area.

310
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,080
 Nearby flights were grounded.

311
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,080
 It basically caused this massive

312
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,080
 infrastructure

313
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,080
 shockwave.

314
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,080
 Flights were grounded. You had communication

315
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,080
 systems within hospitals

316
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,080
 go down. What you figure

317
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,080
 would have been like self-contained.

318
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,080
 So, starting to see, it's very interesting. We're

319
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,080
 starting to see how interconnected all of this stuff is.

320
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,080
 Credit card machines, even

321
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,080
 people just wanting to stream the movies.

322
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,080
 Even if you weren't using an AT&T

323
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,080
 network, it

324
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,080
 created this huge ripple through the system.

325
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,080
 But

326
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,080
 everything was pretty much back online.

327
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,080
 Oh, and AT&T was disrupted throughout the

328
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,080
 country. This one little

329
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,080
 area here that blew this building up.

330
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,080
 AT&T had disruptions

331
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,080
 across the country, but within two days, everything

332
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,080
 was back to normal. I mean, obviously like

333
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,080
 you know,

334
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,080
 flight commands, they didn't ground flights for two days.

335
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,080
 Flights were able to get back on.

336
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,080
 I'm sure the hospitals got started up

337
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,080
 pretty quickly, got their communication systems

338
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,080
 back up. But you trying to stream

339
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,080
 spy kids for, it could have taken

340
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,080
 a while. That was not a priority.

341
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,080
 You're like, "Oh no, will they win the spy wars?"

342
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,080
 Anyways,

343
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,080
 I find this super fascinating, because

344
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,080
 recently I came across this conspiracy theory

345
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,080
 and it'd be fair. Even the guy

346
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,080
 who's writing the conspiracy theory is like

347
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,080
 "Maybe." He's not

348
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,080
 totally sold on this, but

349
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,080
 this led me to a really, really

350
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,080
 interesting fact that I didn't know about any of this stuff.

351
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:25,080
 There was a guy online, he goes

352
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,080
 by the name

353
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,080
 Aphrodite4120

354
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,080
 and he posted this and he

355
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,080
 is saying, possibly,

356
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,080
 right again, he's not totally married to this,

357
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,080
 but his idea is this.

358
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,080
 What had happened

359
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,080
 is that

360
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,080
 a rogue artificial intelligence program

361
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,080
 had been detected

362
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,080
 inside

363
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,080
 that AT&T building.

364
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,080
 And people were feverishly trying

365
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,080
 to keep it contained in this building.

366
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,080
 They're severing

367
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,080
 all escape routes.

368
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,080
 They're basically pulling T1 cables out

369
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,080
 of the wall.

370
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,080
 Knocking satellite dishes off

371
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,080
 the roof.

372
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,080
 And when they realized that they couldn't

373
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,080
 contain it, they said, "We need to blow

374
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,080
 the building up."

375
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,080
 So what we're seeing is something

376
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,080
 that's working backwards.

377
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,080
 And now he says, and I wasn't able to confirm this,

378
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,080
 he says the

379
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,080
 infrastructure, like all of the

380
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,080
 911 calls going down and the airports

381
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,080
 going down and the hospitals

382
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,080
 going down, he says, "That all happened

383
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,080
 two hours before the bombing."

384
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,080
 That was

385
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,080
 basically

386
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,080
 step two. The first step was to try to contain

387
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,080
 it in the building at 100%.

388
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,080
 If they couldn't do that, then they were going to shut off

389
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,080
 all communications throughout the city.

390
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:53,080
 And when they realized that wasn't going to work either,

391
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,080
 they were going to have to go to step three,

392
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,080
 which was blow up the building

393
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,080
 and they needed a cover story.

394
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,080
 Now it is interesting

395
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,080
 what they happen to have,

396
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,080
 what the government happened to have access to

397
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,080
 was the body

398
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,080
 of a 5G conspiracy theorist,

399
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,080
 Anthony Warner.

400
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,080
 Now whether he had died of a heart attack

401
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,080
 earlier that morning

402
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,080
 or the feds took him out,

403
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,080
 we don't know.

404
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,080
 Again, this is just a conspiracy theory.

405
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,080
 This is just a conspiracy theory.

406
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,080
 But the idea is they already had

407
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,080
 and who knows? I mean, listen, man, again,

408
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,080
 and

409
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,080
 it's not just the United States government.

410
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,080
 Every government does these things.

411
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,080
 It's just what governments do.

412
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,080
 They have one goal to survive.

413
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,080
 It wouldn't surprise me

414
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,080
 if governments have

415
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,080
 fictional databases on people.

416
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,080
 You obviously have all the real stuff

417
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,080
 you do.

418
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,080
 And then they just make up stuff too.

419
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,080
 When I die, I'm going to be like some big Harry Potter fan

420
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,080
 and I organized

421
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,080
 the live action Quidditch matches.

422
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,080
 I'm like, come on, bros, come on, make me a cool corpse.

423
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,080
 They may just have dossiers

424
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,080
 and they have a body

425
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,080
 and they go, this was this guy's grievance

426
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,080
 with us.

427
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,080
 And the media thumbs through and goes, okay,

428
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,080
 makes sense.

429
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,080
 But anyway, so they had Anthony Warner,

430
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,080
 they had this dead 5G conspiracy theorist

431
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,080
 and they basically said

432
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,080
 oh, he was there.

433
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,080
 He was blown to bits.

434
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,080
 Literal bits were left

435
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,080
 of Anthony Warner, so you couldn't really.

436
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,080
 And again, it's one of those things like

437
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,080
 even me, who

438
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,080
 I have distrust of the media

439
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,080
 in general, and I think

440
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,080
 most people do,

441
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,080
 I obviously rely on them

442
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,080
 for a ton of information, especially stuff

443
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,080
 that I'm not particularly either interested in,

444
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,080
 or

445
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,080
 have any way to fact check myself,

446
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,080
 because I don't live in Nashville.

447
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,080
 I can't drive out there

448
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,080
 and I'm like picking up pieces and picking up like a toenail

449
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,080
 and taking it back to my lab, even if I could get out there.

450
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,080
 I don't have a lab, I can't run DNA tests.

451
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,080
 So you do, I can

452
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,080
 kind of scratch my head and go, that's kind of suspicious.

453
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,080
 I thought it was weird.

454
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,080
 Remember there were gunshots, that's what brought

455
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,080
 the people to the area at first.

456
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,080
 To hear the countdown,

457
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,080
 we never found out who fired the gun.

458
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:13,080
 We assume Anthony Warner

459
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,080
 fired gunshots, so police would

460
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,080
 show, because the streets were pretty much deserted,

461
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,080
 everything was closed, so the police

462
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,080
 would show up so they could hear the countdown

463
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,080
 and know that this bomb was coming, but why would

464
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,080
 you give them the

465
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,080
 warning, if you were going to blow up the building

466
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,080
 anyways and weren't going to give some big speech,

467
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,080
 you weren't going to stand on the top of the RV

468
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,080
 and go, 5G is killing us all.

469
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,080
 So, who fired the gun?

470
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,080
 Who was Anthony Warner, did he exist?

471
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,080
 Everdy saying that there was this

472
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,080
 AI program locked

473
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,080
 in this facility

474
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,080
 and they needed, they basically

475
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,080
 blew it up and then came up with

476
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,080
 the story.

477
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,080
 We got the body,

478
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,080
 we have videotape of this RV

479
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,080
 out front,

480
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,080
 it was this guy who had

481
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,080
 grievance with the company.

482
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,080
 Now, fascinating

483
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,080
 conspiracy theory, does he have

484
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,080
 any proof? No, he's

485
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,080
 really just going, what if?

486
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,080
 The reason why I wanted to cover it

487
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,080
 was because I learned something

488
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,080
 brand new about the whole national bombing

489
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,080
 thing.

490
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,080
 Let's take into

491
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,080
 account, let's take the official

492
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,080
 story, that Anthony Warner

493
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,080
 blew up this 18T building

494
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,080
 because his father

495
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,080
 died of dementia while

496
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,080
 working with the subsidiary of

497
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,080
 18T. It was a retaliatory

498
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,080
 strike, it wasn't to

499
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,080
 spread the message

500
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,080
 of the dangers of 5G, it was to

501
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,080
 punish those who

502
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,080
 killed his father.

503
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,080
 So, let's take that, let's take the official

504
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,080
 mainstream story.

505
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,080
 I'm reading Aphrodite's post

506
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,080
 and Aphrodite keeps mentioning

507
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,080
 "How could you have a bomb

508
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,080
 that's so big it could destroy

509
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,080
 a 33 story building?"

510
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,080
 Yet, you'd still have

511
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,080
 DNA, you'd still have toenails and bits of flesh

512
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,080
 that you could match to Anthony Warner

513
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,080
 and he made that comment

514
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,080
 once or twice and I go, "33

515
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,080
 story building, what's this guy talking about?"

516
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,080
 Like, it was like a

517
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,080
 historic downtown Nashville

518
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,080
 because I'd seen the footage, I was

519
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,080
 very familiar with the footage

520
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,080
 and then I was re-watching it

521
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,080
 as I was reading his post and going, "Oh, this

522
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,080
 is kind of interesting."

523
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,080
 It's not a 33 story

524
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,080
 building, maybe at most like 4

525
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,080
 or 5, like this was like historic downtown

526
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,080
 Nashville, all the buildings are

527
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,080
 just those square buildings.

528
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,080
 One next to another.

529
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,080
 I'm like, "What's he talking about 33 story

530
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,080
 building?" The bomb went

531
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,080
 off on 2nd street

532
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,080
 and if you go to

533
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,080
 Google Earth today

534
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,080
 you can

535
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,080
 do a little tour down that street,

536
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,080
 that street is still completely closed off.

537
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,080
 Which is weird.

538
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,080
 Which is super weird, right?

539
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,080
 You had all the rubble for 9/11

540
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,080
 removed

541
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,080
 fairly quickly

542
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,080
 and some people say

543
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,080
 too quickly, some people say

544
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,080
 it should have been molten lava, but anyways

545
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,080
 anyways

546
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,080
 that's my 9/11, that's my X 9/11 truth

547
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,080
 are coming out, it's still

548
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,080
 in there somewhere. You have

549
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,080
 you have this whole

550
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,080
 block is just completely shattered

551
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,080
 and it's basically

552
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,080
 it's turned into a one way street

553
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,080
 and even if the footage isn't up to date

554
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,080
 as of today, it was

555
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,080
 even given them 2 years, none of these stores

556
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,080
 have reopened.

557
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,080
 They haven't done any

558
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,080
 major renovation or demolished

559
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,080
 and now if it's a historic thing, you might have

560
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,080
 certain rules, but if it's historic you figure they would demolish it.

561
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,080
 Anyways

562
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,080
 this all happened on 2nd street.

563
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,080
 If you go over

564
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,080
 1 street

565
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,080
 if you know how to do math

566
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,080
 if you go to 3rd street

567
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:03,080
 there is

568
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,080
 the AT&T building

569
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,080
 it's called

570
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,080
 the AT&T building

571
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,080
 and it is the tallest

572
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,080
 building in the state of Tennessee

573
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,080
 if you wanted to strike a blow

574
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,080
 against AT&T

575
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,080
 I can understand if they were on the other side of the country

576
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,080
 or even on the other side of the state

577
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,080
 you didn't want to drive an RV

578
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,080
 full of explosives that far

579
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,080
 I could totally see you wanting to hit

580
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,080
 like a local facility

581
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,080
 because the one that would be

582
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,080
 the truest symbol

583
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,080
 of tyranny

584
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,080
 over humans

585
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,080
 putting out this new technology

586
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,080
 that killed his father

587
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,080
 he would just hit the closest target

588
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,080
 this was 1 street away

589
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:53,080
 1 street away was the largest building in Tennessee

590
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,080
 it was the AT&T facility

591
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,080
 and it had he driven his RV

592
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,080
 just a block over

593
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,080
 this bomb

594
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:07,080
 destroyed one building

595
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,080
 and damaged 43 others

596
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,080
 that street has still not been reopened

597
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,080
 because of the damage

598
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,080
 2 years

599
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,080
 I double checked

600
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,080
 that photo was taken in June of 2022

601
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,080
 2 years that street

602
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,080
 they have had no businesses there

603
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,080
 had he parked that RV close

604
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,080
 to that 33

605
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,080
 story AT&T building

606
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,080
 glistening glass and steel

607
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,080
 could have done some serious damage

608
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,080
 he could have taken down

609
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,080
 a building or at least blown a huge chunk in it

610
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,080
 so why did he pick the little building next to it

611
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:45,080
 and not the AT&T tower

612
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,080
 itself it's almost as if

613
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:53,080
 something escaped from the AT&T tower

614
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,080
 and made it just the block away

615
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,080
 before some missile struck out of nowhere

616
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,080
 and destroyed the building

617
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,080
 this AI was in

618
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,080
 it escaped from its prison on 3rd street

619
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,080
 only got to 2nd street

620
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,080
 before it was erased from reality

621
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:15,080
 it's fascinating

622
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,080
 conspiracy theory

623
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,080
 don't know if it's true

624
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,080
 don't even know if I buy the missile thing

625
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,080
 but I find that super weird that he didn't attack the big building

626
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,080
 that's super bizarre

627
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,080
 and I didn't even know there was that giant building

628
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,080
 people in Tennessee were like "yes it's the tallest building"

629
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,080
 we can see it

630
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,080
 we can see it from where we're at

631
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,080
 I'm living down the street and I can see the building

632
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,080
 I just find that so weird that he didn't attack the big building

633
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,080
 I'm glad he didn't

634
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,080
 I'm not for more property damage

635
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,080
 from a conspiracy theory spawn

636
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,080
 but okay awesome

637
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,080
 I really love that story but we have to move on

638
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,080
 to something a little creepier

639
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,080
 I guess if you're an AT&T stockholder

640
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,080
 that entire story made you wet your pants

641
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,080
 but Jim Morphagas

642
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,080
 let's go ahead and toss you the keys

643
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,080
 to the world famous

644
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,080
 Carbentercopter we are leaving behind Tennessee

645
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,080
 take us all the way out

646
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,080
 to a house in the suburbs

647
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,080
 *imitates carbentercopter*

648
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:15,080
 Jim landed this Carbentercopter

649
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,080
 outside of this little girl's house

650
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,080
 and let me set the story up here

651
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,080
 this is kind of interesting

652
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,080
 the story was posted online

653
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,080
 it's a throwaway account

654
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,080
 by someone called throwawayliva

655
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,080
 and they said

656
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,080
 this isn't my story this is my mom's story

657
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,080
 but I gotta tell you a little bit about my mom

658
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,080
 my mom

659
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,080
 she

660
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,080
 is one of those parents who doesn't make stuff up

661
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,080
 technically the term she used is

662
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,080
 she never led us to believe

663
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,080
 that there was things like Santa Claus

664
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,080
 and the Tooth Fairy

665
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,080
 so my mom was not

666
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,080
 a fabricator

667
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,080
 she wasn't a liar

668
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,080
 basically would be the term some people would use

669
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,080
 but you know what I mean

670
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,080
 she wasn't indulging in our childhood whimsy

671
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,080
 so when

672
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,080
 throwawayliva's

673
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,080
 mom

674
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,080
 told her this story

675
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,080
 makes you think

676
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,080
 this is probably true

677
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,080
 this is probably true

678
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,080
 at the very least

679
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,080
 my mom

680
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,080
 saw something she couldn't explain

681
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,080
 but it was like

682
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,080
 stress or a dream

683
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,080
 or hallucination or something like that

684
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,080
 most

685
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,080
 my mom had an incredibly creepy

686
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,080
 paranormal encounter which

687
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,080
 affected the way that she raised

688
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,080
 her own children

689
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,080
 we're gonna go ahead when I'm names or locations

690
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,080
 for any of these people we're gonna go ahead and name

691
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,080
 the mother Nancy

692
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,080
 when Nancy was four years old one day she was hanging out

693
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,080
 in her mom's bedroom while her mom

694
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,080
 was taking a shower

695
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,080
 it was just her and her mom home at the time

696
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,080
 and Nancy was just

697
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,080
 watching a little television

698
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,080
 it was

699
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,080
 a Mickey Mouse show

700
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,080
 it was a show starring Mickey Mouse

701
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,080
 which tend to be the lamest one

702
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,080
 I hate Mickey Mouse

703
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,080
 so that's one cover in this story

704
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,080
 I was like yes, yes, it's true form

705
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,080
 finally I can convince the world

706
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,080
 and I didn't need to use an RV full of explosives to do it

707
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,080
 Nancy is watching television

708
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,080
 while her mom's taking a shower

709
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,080
 she's watching a Mickey Mouse show

710
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,080
 Nancy when she's thinking about it

711
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,080
 she goes I think it was that

712
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,080
 Mickey Mouse Clubhouse

713
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,080
 she was watching Disney Channel

714
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,080
 watching a little Mickey Mouse Clubhouse

715
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,080
 when she hears a voice go

716
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,080
 Nancy

717
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,080
 Nancy instinctively

718
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,080
 goes

719
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,080
 yeah

720
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,080
 now she knows her mom's

721
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,080
 taking a shower

722
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,080
 and she knows her mom doesn't normally

723
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,080
 sound all squeaky

724
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,080
 Nancy

725
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,080
 but she

726
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,080
 just instinctively is like oh someone must be calling me yes

727
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,080
 and there's no answer

728
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,080
 and she can hear her mother

729
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,080
 still taking the shower in the bathroom

730
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,080
 Nancy turns back to the television

731
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,080
 and continues to watch Mickey Mouse Clubhouse

732
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,080
 when she hears

733
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,080
 Nancy

734
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,080
 clearly hears her name again

735
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:15,080
 but this time she realizes

736
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,080
 it's coming

737
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,080
 from the television

738
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,080
 the

739
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,080
 TV

740
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,080
 itself is calling her name

741
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,080
 and Nancy goes

742
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,080
 the second I realized this

743
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,080
 Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck

744
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,080
 float out of the television set

745
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:41,080
 Nancy remembers this

746
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,080
 clear as a day

747
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,080
 imagine you would if fictional characters

748
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,080
 were walking around in your living room

749
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,080
 well technically I think they're just kind of floating there

750
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,080
 Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck float

751
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,080
 out of the television set and she said

752
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,080
 they were

753
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,080
 transparent like ghosts

754
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,080
 you could see right through them

755
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,080
 and Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck are floating

756
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,080
 out of the television set

757
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,080
 they're floating in front of Nancy as her mom's

758
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,080
 in the other room completely oblivious

759
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,080
 to this absolutely bizarre event

760
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,080
 and the two animated characters

761
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,080
 start begin to go

762
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,080
 come here

763
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,080
 come here with us

764
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:25,080
 you liked it Michael Jackson

765
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,080
 Michael Jackson float out of the television too

766
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,080
 and Donald Duck saw

767
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,080
 come here

768
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,080
 come here with us

769
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,080
 come back

770
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:39,080
 she's like who are these

771
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,080
 dollar store versions

772
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,080
 where these terrible voices coming from

773
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,080
 a yuck yuck

774
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,080
 see if Goofy had come out

775
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,080
 I could have done a little bit of Goofy

776
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,080
 yuck yuck come here with us

777
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,080
 that's barely

778
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,080
 serviceable

779
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,080
 hey Nancy it's Yogi Bear

780
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,080
 come get the big

781
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,080
 a n***a basket

782
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,080
 but unfortunately she wasn't watching anymore

783
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,080
 bear cartoons right

784
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,080
 Mickey Mouse

785
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,080
 laughed again come here come here with us

786
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,080
 basically

787
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,080
 these two floating characters are trying to get

788
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,080
 Nancy to go somewhere

789
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,080
 and what's so interesting

790
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,080
 so if I was

791
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,080
 4 I would have been 1980 but

792
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,080
 but with 4 years old in 1980

793
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,080
 if Luke Skywalker walked

794
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,080
 into my living room

795
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,080
 and says hey man we need you

796
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,080
 we need you to help fight the empire

797
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,080
 jump into this television

798
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,080
 before he even finished the sentence

799
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,080
 I would be inside the TV

800
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,080
 Optimus Prime ever told me to crawl in his

801
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,080
 cab

802
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,080
 drive him around town

803
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,080
 I'd do it

804
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,080
 but what's interesting is Nancy realized

805
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,080
 something was wrong

806
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,080
 it's probably because her voice is soft

807
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,080
 she's like I don't know it doesn't sound like Mickey Mouse

808
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,080
 doesn't sound like Mickey Mouse I don't know what it sounds like

809
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,080
 yuck yuck

810
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,080
 she says she immediately gets weirded out

811
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,080
 once these characters begin

812
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,080
 speaking to her because even at the age

813
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,080
 of 4

814
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,080
 she knows that

815
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,080
 television characters aren't supposed to be floating

816
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,080
 out of the screen

817
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,080
 and I don't know if I knew that at the age

818
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,080
 of 4 but Shay did

819
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,080
 and she said that

820
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,080
 these two

821
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,080
 this one beloved character

822
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,080
 and Mickey Mouse are beckoning

823
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,080
 her to come into

824
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,080
 well they're saying come here

825
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,080
 come with us is she going to get teleported

826
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,080
 into the television

827
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,080
 are they going to grab her and take her to some

828
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,080
 hellish dimension

829
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,080
 these demons posing as these characters

830
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,080
 are the characters actually coming out of the television set

831
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,080
 she's trying to figure all this stuff out too

832
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,080
 and she's 4

833
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,080
 and it's happening right now

834
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,080
 and she doesn't know what to do because on the one hand

835
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,080
 cartoon characters

836
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,080
 on the other hand this shouldn't be happening

837
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,080
 and as she's trying to figure this out

838
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,080
 as they continue to beckon her

839
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,080
 to come towards them

840
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,080
 the mom

841
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,080
 steps out of the shower

842
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,080
 and they immediately disappear

843
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:09,080
 Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse just vanish

844
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,080
 they don't float back into the television set

845
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,080
 Mickey Mouse is shaking his fist I'll be back later tonight

846
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,080
 he he

847
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,080
 no they just disappear

848
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,080
 and Mickey Mouse Clubhouse is still playing

849
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:23,080
 I don't think she finished the episode

850
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,080
 she's like that was quite terrifying

851
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,080
 but I wonder if Pegglay Pete

852
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,080
 will win the hand

853
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,080
 of sweet sweet Daisy

854
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,080
 she shut the television off

855
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,080
 and in fact from that day on

856
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,080
 she stopped watching anything Mickey Mouse related

857
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,080
 this is a lesson to us all we all should have done this

858
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,080
 she didn't watch anything Mickey Mouse related

859
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,080
 and

860
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,080
 she didn't let her kids

861
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,080
 ever watch anything Mickey Mouse related

862
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:53,080
 and

863
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,080
 I mean this is like a generational curse

864
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,080
 she stopped watching Mickey Mouse

865
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,080
 kids can't watch Mickey Mouse

866
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,080
 and her grandkids

867
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,080
 when they come over to her house

868
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:07,080
 no Mickey Mouse

869
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,080
 which would be

870
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,080
 it's not a bad tactic one Mickey Mouse sucks

871
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,080
 but secondly kids constantly

872
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,080
 want to rebel against their elders

873
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,080
 and your parents tell you not to get a tattoo

874
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,080
 you get a tattoo parents tell you not to smoke

875
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,080
 you start smoking

876
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,080
 parents says don't watch Mickey Mouse

877
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,080
 you're like I hate you mom and dad I'm totally gonna rebel

878
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,080
 you go to the Disney story

879
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,080
 you're like I'm gonna get all the Mickey Mouse paraphernalia

880
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,080
 watching tons of Mickey Mouse

881
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,080
 you know

882
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,080
 and you just like you be laughing it was a huge prank

883
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,080
 you could care less if they watched Mickey Mouse

884
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,080
 but it gave them something harmless

885
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,080
 to rebel against

886
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,080
 you with right watching all this Mickey Mouse garbage

887
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,080
 anyways

888
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,080
 no more Mickey Mouse

889
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,080
 in this this was no longer a house of

890
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,080
 mouse

891
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,080
 from that day forth

892
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,080
 it's an interesting story

893
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,080
 my dislike

894
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,080
 of Mickey Mouse is long

895
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,080
 and storied

896
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,080
 we've actually done previous episodes on it

897
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,080
 it's also possible

898
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,080
 that Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck

899
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,080
 did float out of the television set

900
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,080
 and then that's a whole other slew of questions

901
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,080
 was it actually

902
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,080
 Mickey and Donald

903
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,080
 I think would be the first important one

904
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,080
 because it could be

905
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,080
 demons masquerading

906
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,080
 as if I was a demon

907
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,080
 I would totally be

908
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,080
 a cool guy

909
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,080
 I would totally be like appearing at what it would be

910
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,080
 like these days I'm walking around

911
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,080
 I'm Mr. Beast I'm giving money away

912
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,080
 is it a demon

913
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,080
 who is disguised as Mickey and Donald

914
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:43,080
 which would be I mean both of these

915
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,080
 are terrifying alternatives

916
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,080
 and none of them are like well that's a little

917
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,080
 that's a little soothing

918
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,080
 is it a demon or demons disguised as Mickey and Donald

919
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,080
 and had they caught her

920
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:57,080
 then what

921
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,080
 I think the go-to thing

922
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,080
 is whether it's Mickey and Donald

923
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,080
 whether these characters

924
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,080
 these beloved characters are some sort of demonic constructs

925
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,080
 in and of themselves

926
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,080
 like Mickey is an actual

927
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,080
 demonic force and Donald

928
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,080
 while he is pretty funny

929
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:15,080
 and he is cool

930
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,080
 is unfortunately aligned with Mickey

931
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,080
 in this conspiracy theory

932
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,080
 that is actually

933
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,080
 and they are constantly trying to subvert

934
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,080
 children into

935
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,080
 falling into this hellish landscape

936
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,080
 you know that's the

937
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,080
 that's one conspiracy theory that is actually

938
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,080
 I don't know I feel like they are both so weird

939
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,080
 either they are demons

940
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,080
 disguised as Mickey and Donald

941
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,080
 or they are Mickey and Donald

942
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,080
 who are actually demons

943
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,080
 and so yeah

944
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,080
 she was right to never allow Mickey Mouse

945
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,080
 in her house I don't know if she watched DuckTales

946
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,080
 again I am a little iffy on that detail

947
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,080
 she might actually be much younger than me

948
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,080
 she might not have been born during the time of DuckTales

949
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,080
 because I was an adult when that Mickey Mouse

950
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,080
 Clubhouse was on

951
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,080
 so the point is

952
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,080
 is that I am wondering if

953
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,080
 if we take the story of face value

954
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,080
 we will have to wrap this up real quick

955
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,080
 but were the demons disguised as Mickey and Donald

956
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,080
 or are Mickey and Donald actually demons

957
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,080
 and every so often they are able to come out

958
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,080
 of the television set

959
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,080
 to beckon children to come to them

960
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,080
 we have these two possibilities

961
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,080
 and then the big question is

962
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,080
 what happens when the kid goes with them

963
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:27,080
 because I could obviously be super creepy

964
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,080
 and say

965
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,080
 she goes yeah sure

966
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,080
 and then they bleed her into the television set

967
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,080
 and then the mom comes out of the shower

968
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,080
 and the bedroom is empty

969
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,080
 and she is like Nancy

970
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,080
 Nancy Nancy and she is looking all over the house

971
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,080
 she can't find her 4 year old daughter

972
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,080
 and she calls the police

973
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,080
 the police show up they scour the area

974
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,080
 they are putting missing person signs

975
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,080
 all over the neighborhood

976
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,080
 it becomes a local news story

977
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,080
 not quite national

978
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,080
 and Nancy is never seen again

979
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,080
 but

980
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,080
 if you watched episode 87

981
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,080
 of

982
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,080
 Mickey Mouse Clubhouse

983
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,080
 in the background

984
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,080
 while Pegleg Pete is chasing Daisy

985
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,080
 through a hall of mayors

986
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,080
 for a split second

987
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,080
 you see the distorted face

988
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,080
 of a 4 year old girl screaming

989
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,080
 out in pain

990
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,080
 banging

991
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,080
 on one of the mayors

992
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,080
 her soul trapped

993
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,080
 in this

994
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,080
 cartoon forever

995
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,080
 right that would be super creepy

996
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,080
 that would be super creepy

997
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,080
 but

998
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,080
 I don't think that's it

999
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,080
 call me call me a little more

1000
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,080
 stable than that I don't think she gets sucked into the television set

1001
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,080
 because

1002
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,080
 here's the thing

1003
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,080
 kids disappearing in their houses

1004
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,080
 is so incredibly rare

1005
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,080
 and

1006
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,080
 Mickey Mouse Clubhouse was aired all over the country

1007
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,080
 if not the world

1008
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,080
 so I don't think

1009
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,080
 that it's that these kids are being

1010
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,080
 kidnapped and sucked into the television set

1011
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,080
 you're like Jason I'm actually surprised

1012
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,080
 that's not what you're thinking

1013
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,080
 what's more likely

1014
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,080
 and we'll wrap it up like this

1015
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,080
 is that yes

1016
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,080
 if you do go with these entities

1017
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,080
 they don't

1018
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,080
 canap you and take you to a hellish dimension

1019
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,080
 they don't do something like super horror

1020
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,080
 movie to you

1021
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,080
 the mother doesn't come out of the bathroom

1022
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,080
 and found her daughter just completely

1023
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,080
 eviscerated

1024
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,080
 single tear drop on a 4 year old's face

1025
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,080
 as she turns to her mom and goes

1026
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,080
 Mickey played

1027
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,080
 oh my god you know what I mean

1028
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,080
 obviously this stuff is great

1029
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,080
 in a horror movie

1030
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:45,080
 it's great in a horror movie

1031
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,080
 it's super spooky but I don't think it happens

1032
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,080
 I think that

1033
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,080
 let's pretend that Mickey comes out of the television set

1034
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,080
 but he doesn't do that

1035
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,080
 Mickey and Donald basically would

1036
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,080
 just corrupt her

1037
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,080
 these demonic forces they don't need to do

1038
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,080
 anything like super spooky

1039
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,080
 any Dean Coons level horror

1040
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,080
 they just say come here

1041
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,080
 come here and she reaches out and she touches them

1042
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,080
 and then they disappear the mom comes out

1043
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,080
 but because she did

1044
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,080
 what they said because they realized that this young girl

1045
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,080
 is actually malleable

1046
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,080
 they can

1047
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,080
 convince her to do something that then through the rest of her life

1048
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,080
 they're basically convincing her to make bad decisions

1049
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,080
 she's some guys like hey do you want some crack

1050
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,080
 she's like oh no I heard in school that

1051
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,080
 cracks bad for you and then Donald Duck's like

1052
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,080
 I don't know

1053
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,080
 crack is delicious

1054
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,080
 and she's like

1055
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,080
 well Donald Duck said so

1056
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,080
 the drug dealer's like what

1057
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,080
 man you must already be high

1058
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,080
 not like that

1059
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,080
 it doesn't have to be like Donald Duck's on one shoulder

1060
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,080
 and Mickey Mouse's on another

1061
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,080
 you know what I mean like they would just realize

1062
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,080
 she's easily persuadable

1063
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,080
 they never have to show up again

1064
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,080
 they just know that she is susceptible to

1065
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,080
 suggestion

1066
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:59,080
 so it's an interesting story

1067
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,080
 it's one of the stories that probably did happen

1068
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,080
 in one

1069
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,080
 I don't think the poster's making it up

1070
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,080
 I don't think the mom's making it up

1071
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,080
 I think it's interesting that the mom

1072
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,080
 never talked or didn't lead them to believe

1073
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,080
 in these childhood

1074
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,080
 illusions like the tooth fairy

1075
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,080
 and like Santa Claus right she probably still gave

1076
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,080
 the kids a dollar when they lost the tooth

1077
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,080
 just to keep the economy going

1078
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,080
 but they're like no the tooth fairy's not really a thing

1079
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,080
 but I will give you a dollar

1080
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,080
 because that's what all the other kids are getting for their teeth

1081
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,080
 now Santa Claus isn't really a thing

1082
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,080
 but you still get presents

1083
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,080
 because if anyone knew

1084
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,080
 the power of a child's imagination

1085
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:39,080
 mixed with

1086
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,080
 dark and mysterious forces

1087
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,080
 taking the form

1088
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,080
 from a childhood's imagination

1089
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,080
 if anyone knew how dangerous that combination could actually be

1090
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:51,080
 it would be a woman like Nancy

1091
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,080
 she wasn't willing to indulge in her children's

1092
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,080
 zest for fantasies

1093
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,080
 believing in the tooth fairy

1094
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,080
 Leopard cons

1095
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,080
 Santa Claus because she knew that these

1096
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,080
 could be

1097
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,080
 pathways of temptation

1098
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,080
 that would only take her children

1099
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,080
 and her grandchildren

1100
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,080
