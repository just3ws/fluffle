1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,920
 Is it possible that the real reason we've never found Bigfoot is because we're looking

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,840
 in all the wrong places?

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:18,480
 And then close encounters of a canine kind week continues as we take a look at another

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,660
 story of what happens when dogs encounter aliens.

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,980
 When three kids are out in the middle of nowhere with their two loyal dogs, they figure they

6
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,880
 are just going to have a nice time in the outdoors.

7
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:40,880
 Little do they know that their dogs are about to encounter an alien life form and the climax

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,760
 is drenched in blood today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:56,160
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,480
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,480
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,960
 Hope you guys are staying warm.

13
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,360
 I have to shut my heater off to record these episodes and the temperature immediately dropped

14
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,360
 to 15 degrees.

15
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,840
 It's miserable in here.

16
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,080
 I could probably put on more clothes but nah, it's too much work.

17
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,640
 Someone who always loves putting clothes on me though, someone who always loves dressing

18
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,320
 me every single day is one of our newest Patreon supporters.

19
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,760
 Everyone give it up for Snail Eyes.

20
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,760
 Woohoo!

21
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,760
 Yeah, come on in Snail!

22
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,760
 Snailies!

23
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,760
 He's not an actual Snail.

24
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,760
 His name is Snail Eyes.

25
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,760
 It's far more disgusting.

26
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,040
 Snail Eyes, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode if you guys can't

27
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,040
 support the Patreon.

28
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,680
 I totally understand.

29
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,920
 Just help support Dead Rabbit Radio by getting the word out.

30
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,480
 That's another way you can help the show grow.

31
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,360
 Snail Eyes actually met Snail Eyes in person.

32
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:53,720
 They came out to meet me at the UFO Festival last year and good old Snailie is going to

33
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,520
 be at the Oregon Ghost Conference.

34
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,680
 I will be giving a speech on March 24th at 6pm.

35
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:06,120
 You guys want to meet me and listen to me, which you already kind of do both right by

36
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:13,160
 listening to the podcast, but March 24th, 6pm at Seaside, Oregon, the Oregon Ghost Conference

37
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,960
 I'm giving a presentation, Why Are There No Fat Ghosts?

38
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,520
 So hopefully I'll learn how to pronounce the word ghost correctly before then and it'll

39
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,520
 be a lot of fun.

40
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,520
 I should come out.

41
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,040
 There's a bunch of other speakers, vendors and all of that stuff, but I can't wait to

42
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,040
 do it.

43
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,640
 Snail Eyes will be in attendance.

44
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,640
 So no salt, no salt allowed.

45
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,640
 Snail Eyes, I'm going to go and entach you the keys to the hair hydrofoil.

46
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,440
 If you guys want to see what hydrofoil looks like, I'll point to a picture of a 1980s G.I.

47
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,440
 Joe toy.

48
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,760
 I'm not entirely for sure, but we're in a hydrofoil now.

49
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,920
 Snail Eyes, let's go ahead and leave that rabbit command and foil us all the way out

50
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,920
 to Florida.

51
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,280
 I don't even know what they sound like.

52
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,280
 Is this a new vehicle?

53
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:06,200
 I know we have the hair hovercraft, the hair hydrofoil I guess is new.

54
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,160
 We're going all the way out to Florida.

55
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:15,000
 The Joes are quick on our heels trying to destroy us, but we get out to Florida specifically.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 We're headed to Placida, Florida and we're off the coast.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,440
 We're not in the town of Placida.

58
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,400
 We're actually in the Gulf of Mexico.

59
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,920
 The year is 1970 and it's late.

60
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,960
 It's late evening.

61
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:40,360
 And in the Gulf of Mexico, you had two fishermen fishing from their boat, throwing their rods.

62
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,280
 You know that noise that fishing poles make?

63
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,520
 Little hook floating in the water.

64
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,520
 Fish are looking at it.

65
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,280
 You like that theater of the mind?

66
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,720
 You're like, "Wow, Jason, I felt like I was right there."

67
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,440
 And I know what hydrofoil looks like.

68
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,440
 And you don't.

69
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,240
 They don't make that noise.

70
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,640
 Anyways, fish looking at bait, looking at worms stuck on hooks and stuff like that.

71
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,160
 That's not the weirdest part of the story.

72
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,160
 That's normal.

73
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,320
 That's what we just call fishing.

74
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:15,000
 These two fishermen are on this boat and all of a sudden, they see Bigfoot.

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,920
 They're like, "Whoa, kid, this is weird, right?"

76
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,560
 They're off the coast of Florida.

77
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,920
 Florida had, they call it the skunk ape down there because it's super smelly because it's

78
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,920
 living in swamps.

79
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,040
 Bigfoot's in general are fairly smelly creatures.

80
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,720
 A lot of times you smell them before you see them or even hear them.

81
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,440
 They smell like rotting flesh or dried dung.

82
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,440
 That's just Bigfoot.

83
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,520
 So you can imagine if there's a variation called a skunk ape.

84
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,240
 Smells worse than just the normal old Bigfoot.

85
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:53,680
 But whether or not we're Bigfoot hunting or skunk ape hunting, you don't expect it

86
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,600
 to be in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico.

87
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,560
 It's not on its own boat.

88
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,000
 It's not stuck on a rock going, "Help me."

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 No.

90
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,840
 Which would be quite the quandary, right?

91
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,560
 Would you help Bigfoot or in a fishing boat and you came across them sitting on a rock?

92
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:17,400
 I think the humanity in us would say, "Of course I would help Bigfoot get off that

93
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,800
 rock and onto my boat."

94
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,160
 But again, this isn't 8 foot tall Harry Monster.

95
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,280
 I don't want an 8 foot tall human on my boat.

96
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,480
 I hate boats.

97
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,040
 I hate boats.

98
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,360
 I'm always afraid they're going to tip over.

99
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,760
 So if I saw an NBA player on a rock in the middle of nowhere, I'm like, "Sorry, bro.

100
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,600
 I'm already scared enough I'm on this boat."

101
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,800
 He's like, "I haven't eaten in days."

102
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
 I was like, "I don't know.

103
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
 Catch some more clams.

104
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
 Here's a fishing pole.

105
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,840
 I'll radio in for help."

106
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,200
 But he's not on a rock.

107
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:53,640
 They're in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico and these two fishermen see Bigfoot swimming.

108
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:59,080
 He's just swimming in the Gulf of Mexico.

109
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,640
 And obviously these two guys are braver than I am.

110
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,960
 They're in a boat for one.

111
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:11,240
 When they see Bigfoot swim by them, they look at each other and they're like, "We've got

112
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,400
 to follow this guy."

113
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,800
 Now he's not swimming towards the coastline either.

114
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,080
 He's swimming away.

115
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:24,480
 These witnesses said that they followed Bigfoot for 29 miles.

116
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,880
 For 29 miles and they're like, "Okay, that's enough."

117
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,520
 We for the once in a lifetime saw this cryptid that people have been searching for for over

118
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,520
 100 years.

119
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,040
 But we have obviously just been swimming for too long.

120
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,680
 They're like, "We better return home."

121
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:49,600
 They actually don't say in the report if he kept swimming and they just pulled away or

122
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
 if he drowned.

123
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,600
 I don't know.

124
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,600
 He might have.

125
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,600
 They don't say.

126
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,400
 They followed him for 29 miles and then they stopped.

127
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,640
 Did they lose sight of him?

128
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,640
 Who knows?

129
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,640
 Who knows?

130
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,720
 These two guys do, but they didn't tell us.

131
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:10,200
 And what's interesting is as they're watching Bigfoot swim away from the coastline, he's

132
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:16,240
 29 miles away when they finally just lost sight of him or just gave up.

133
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,360
 One of the fishermen turned to his buddy and said, "Yeah, this isn't the first time I've

134
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,360
 seen this."

135
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,080
 And the buddy's like, "Wait, what?

136
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,080
 This is old hat to you?"

137
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,720
 Following a swimming Bigfoot and the other dude goes, "Yeah.

138
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:39,400
 One time I saw a Bigfoot swimming underwater."

139
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,960
 So what is with this?

140
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,040
 What is going on?

141
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,800
 Why is Bigfoot swimming through the Gulf of Mexico?

142
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,240
 You would go, "Jason, this obviously, obviously, maybe it's not actual, maybe it's not actual

143
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,240
 Bigfoot.

144
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,440
 This can't, this doesn't fit anything in with Bigfoot lore that we know of.

145
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:02,280
 Bigfoot is the giant guy in the woods walking around using squirrels as toothbrushes and

146
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:07,840
 porcupines as toothpicks and just walking around.

147
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,120
 Those are the only two things he does.

148
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,880
 That's why we've never found him because we're like, "No, that's gross.

149
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,240
 We're not going to do that."

150
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,360
 He walks around the woods.

151
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,800
 He sometimes throws rocks at people.

152
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,480
 Stuff like that.

153
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,640
 Why would he be swimming?

154
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,200
 Actually, I wonder because I know Gorillas can't swim.

155
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,800
 I learned that fact watching Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes.

156
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
 I actually fact-checked that.

157
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
 I was like, "Wow, that's true.

158
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
 Gorillas can't swim.

159
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,680
 They couldn't get to marking marks, spaceship that crashed in a lake."

160
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,080
 I was like, "Wow, that's fascinating.

161
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,580
 Thanks, Tim."

162
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,680
 But I wonder if Bigfoot can.

163
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,240
 I wonder if having big feet would help you swim.

164
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:51,200
 He would probably be a trade-off, the 30 pounds of back hair, probably make it difficult

165
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,520
 to swim well, but with the big feet.

166
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,280
 Like Michael Phelps, he has some big old feet.

167
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,840
 It looks like a dolphin evolved and then put on a speedo and started swimming around.

168
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,320
 He's not a freak.

169
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,320
 You're like, "Oh, really?

170
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,320
 That's what it looks like."

171
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,320
 You're only going to picture.

172
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,320
 You're all disappointed.

173
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,040
 You're like, "Oh, man, yeah, he does have big feet, but his skin's not great.

174
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,040
 He doesn't have a blowhole."

175
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,840
 A bit of an exaggeration there, Jason.

176
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,040
 Bigfoot might be a powerful swimmer.

177
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,040
 And it would make sense.

178
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,360
 This could be one of the reasons why we can't find Bigfoot, because we're looking in the

179
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,360
 wrong places.

180
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,360
 You're looking in the forest.

181
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,640
 If you're in Florida, you're looking in the swamp.

182
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,340
 We never thought to check the lakes.

183
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,880
 We never thought to check that he might be taking a dip.

184
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:42,480
 But if you think that story is weird, there's another story of maybe this is why we can't

185
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,360
 find Bigfoot.

186
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,320
 I do have to say too, let me give credit.

187
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,320
 I found that story of the swimming Bigfoot on, think about it, docs.com.

188
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,000
 They got it from a website or a book magazine.

189
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 I don't know what this is, but it's called Sliksters.

190
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,080
 If you can't trust the source that has Slikster in it, who can he trust?

191
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,680
 Sliksters skunk apes sightings.

192
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,680
 So this would be like a local Florida repository of Bigfoot/skunk apes stuff.

193
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:22,560
 If you think that's weird, there is another even weirder one of Bigfoot sighting.

194
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:29,040
 This is one that's kind of gone a little viral, and we don't have any information on it.

195
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,760
 It's an un-dated, unsourced image.

196
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,000
 There was someone going by the initials of AR.

197
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,480
 They said at one point they were in an undisclosed location.

198
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,520
 I know this is super vague and it's so bizarre.

199
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,760
 You're like, Jason, someone just made this up.

200
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:54,720
 But someone was in a place and they looked up, they looked up into the sky and 75 yards

201
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,680
 off the ground, they see Bigfoot.

202
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,880
 Not because he's that tall, they're like, wow.

203
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,120
 Inflation's got really bad.

204
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,640
 Bigfoot needs to be 75 yards tall just to get our attention.

205
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:14,320
 No, Bigfoot is sitting on three red balloons.

206
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,760
 You're like, Jason, come on, man.

207
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,760
 It's clearly made up.

208
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,760
 Hold on.

209
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,200
 Let me finish before he decides that this is made up.

210
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,400
 Bigfoot is sitting on three red balloons.

211
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:38,960
 So they're giant balloons floating there and they are described as either glowing red or

212
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,440
 a metallic candy apple red.

213
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,680
 But he's sitting on these three balloons.

214
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,800
 I just looked over at my notes again.

215
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,280
 The person who saw this goes, okay, maybe it wasn't Bigfoot.

216
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,720
 I probably should have checked my notes closer.

217
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,800
 He goes, well, it was a tall, hairy man.

218
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
 It looked like Bigfoot.

219
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,000
 It looked like Bigfoot.

220
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,160
 It's possible he was just wearing a suit, a hairy suit or hat on a hairy cape.

221
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,680
 It should be hilarious.

222
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,080
 So I was like, hey, let's fake one of those Bigfoot sightings that everyone's talking

223
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,080
 about.

224
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,080
 We'll do that.

225
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,840
 We'll go on the woods, put footprints, fake footprints, walk across the freeway in a furry

226
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,840
 suit.

227
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,760
 And his buddy goes, that sounds like a great idea.

228
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,360
 But what if we did it on balloons?

229
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,360
 He's like, what?

230
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,680
 Yeah, he got a Bigfoot suit.

231
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,680
 It's super authentic.

232
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,920
 If you see it, you'll think it's actually Bigfoot.

233
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,240
 But instead of, I don't know, walking through the forest, we'll just fly around in the suit.

234
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,640
 It'll be the best fake Bigfoot sighting ever.

235
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,320
 So this is fake.

236
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,160
 They're doing it wrong.

237
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:50,600
 But anyways, Bigfoot or a man in a Bigfoot costume is floating through the sky.

238
00:12:50,600 --> 00:13:00,160
 He's sitting on these red balloons and the balloons traditionally have strings hanging

239
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,800
 down.

240
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,320
 So this guy's watching these balloons float by.

241
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,440
 Bigfoot is not hanging from them.

242
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,960
 Like he's floating away.

243
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,040
 Like he was a clown who put too much helium in his balloons.

244
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,480
 He's sitting on top of them.

245
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,400
 And then the rope of the balloons are hanging down.

246
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:26,520
 And the rope is tied to the-- the rope is where Bigfoot's floating on the balloons.

247
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:35,720
 The rope, the string from the balloons are tied to the corpse of a dog.

248
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,760
 There's a dead dog floating through the sky held aloft by balloons.

249
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,760
 Bigfoot's sitting on top of it.

250
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,840
 It's one of the weirdest Bigfoot sightings I think we-- I've ever heard of.

251
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,640
 We've covered Bigfoot's getting in and out of UFOs.

252
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:55,400
 I almost feel like I've covered this one before as well.

253
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,360
 It's hard to tell if I've covered this one because we've covered some crazy ones.

254
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,880
 I wasn't able to find any proof of it.

255
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,840
 But if I did, then this is one of the few times I don't mind covering it again because

256
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,840
 it's so weird.

257
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,680
 And if I didn't, it's just absolutely bizarre.

258
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:16,160
 And AR, what's interesting is he-- the witness, like again, there's this kind of viral meme,

259
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,360
 this image that's going around.

260
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:24,880
 And it says, listen, I was driving and I saw this guy floating by Bigfoot, dead dog, red

261
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,320
 balloons.

262
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,400
 And it started-- I was headed towards Smith Road.

263
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,640
 It specifies the road they're on.

264
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:37,760
 So I think there's a longer account somewhere that I could not find unless I already covered

265
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,760
 it.

266
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,000
 Unless I already covered this story.

267
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,800
 But he's driving down a very particular street and he saw this guy floating-- this Bigfoot.

268
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,480
 I don't know why you say this guy.

269
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,160
 It's actually a cryptid floating around on these balloons with a dead dog.

270
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,160
 It was a black and white shellty.

271
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,160
 He just went out into my dog.

272
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,160
 He's having a black and white shellty.

273
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,000
 I came out one day and he wasn't there.

274
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,800
 There was just like a balloon string on my yard.

275
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
 I was like, what?

276
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,920
 Jack, Jack, where are you?

277
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,920
 He should have just looked up.

278
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,120
 If your dog ever goes missing, you look up in the sky.

279
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,000
 People are like, hey, dude, aren't you going to put up some missing dog flyers?

280
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,200
 You're like, nah, who he'll float by eventually.

281
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,680
 This guy's following him in his car AR.

282
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,160
 He's following Bigfoot on the balloons in his car.

283
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:34,240
 And once Bigfoot realizes he's being followed, apparently he changed the directions of the

284
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,240
 balloons.

285
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,920
 The Bigfoot tries to lose the witness so he actually flies back the way he came and the

286
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,080
 driver wasn't able to make a U-turn quick enough.

287
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:49,080
 I don't know how fast these balloons were flying around.

288
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:54,960
 But you would have to say that any speed is too fast for Bigfoot to fly at.

289
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:00,200
 Now, like I said, we've covered stories where Bigfoot has gotten out of UFOs and Bigfoot.

290
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,760
 I've covered stories of people turning into Bigfoot.

291
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:10,280
 There's a lot of weirdness involved in the phenomenon that gets left out, honestly, because

292
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,480
 we're so-- there's the two camps.

293
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,200
 Most people believe, if you believe in Bigfoot, that it's a biological creature out there

294
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,640
 that we can eventually capture and steady and maybe communicate with.

295
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:26,000
 Another group of people believe it's an interdimensional thing.

296
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 That's what I believe.

297
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 I don't believe that.

298
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,080
 I believe that it can-- obviously it's a biological form.

299
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,080
 You could shoot it.

300
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,920
 You could kill it.

301
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,360
 But I don't think it evolved alongside humans.

302
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,000
 I don't think it's a-- I think it's more of a-- I think it's more-- there's something

303
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,720
 more paranormal to the phenomenon that it's not just like, "Oh, we just haven't found

304
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,960
 this guy in-- we could.

305
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,320
 We could document its breeding habits and all this-- some perverts out there in the

306
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,320
 woods with this logbook."

307
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,400
 He's like, "Oh, he was particularly randy tonight."

308
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,480
 I don't think that.

309
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,480
 I don't think that.

310
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,840
 I don't think that it's a biological entity.

311
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,200
 But I do believe that there's something to it.

312
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,760
 Anyways, maybe that's one of the reasons why we can never find it.

313
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,760
 That's the interdimensional belief, because it's able to slip in and out of realities.

314
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,840
 But even-- I'll put all those episodes in the show notes.

315
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,440
 We've covered all sorts of crazy, cool stuff about Bigfoot.

316
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:21,760
 But again, I would have never thought to look up, right?

317
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,200
 You hear tromping through the woods and you smell that rotten egg smell and you're like,

318
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,440
 "Oh, I think-- I think either Bigfoot's here or somebody ate it."

319
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,280
 It's how it goes bell right before this camping trip started.

320
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,680
 And then you hear a roar.

321
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,880
 And then like a rock comes flying at you.

322
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,960
 And you're like, "It's Bigfoot, everybody.

323
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,960
 It's Bigfoot."

324
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,880
 And then you're looking for him in the forest.

325
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,280
 That's where you would look for him.

326
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,040
 You're having all these telltale signs.

327
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,800
 He's flown above you.

328
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,800
 I'll tell you this.

329
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:56,240
 There's not a Bigfoot researcher worth their salt.

330
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,240
 The Bigfoot researchers that you see on like animal planets-- the fact that they're on

331
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,240
 animal planet.

332
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,840
 But they would not acknowledge this to even be possible.

333
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,080
 Maybe the swimming story.

334
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,320
 But if you're like, "Hey, you go out squatching lately.

335
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,120
 You're talking to one of the hosts of the show.

336
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,120
 You broke into his house.

337
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,280
 You have him tied up to a chair."

338
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,000
 You're like, "Hey, did you go squatching lately?"

339
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 He's like, "Yeah, yeah.

340
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Let me and my family go."

341
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,800
 I'll answer whatever questions you want, you weirdo.

342
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,520
 And then you go, "Did you ever look up?

343
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,520
 Did you ever look up?"

344
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,400
 And he's like, "What are you talking about?

345
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
 Please."

346
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,400
 I'm so scared.

347
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,400
 I'm so scared, man.

348
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,400
 Cheryl, look up.

349
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
 Is that what you want?

350
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
 Is that what you want?

351
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,400
 I don't know why this turned into all of a sudden.

352
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,400
 I don't know why.

353
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,800
 I just didn't say you were asking him something at a convention.

354
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,840
 I don't know why it became you breaking into his mansion and tying up his family.

355
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,480
 But anyways, I think they'd be like, "No, that's absolutely ridiculous.

356
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,040
 Bigfoot does not float on balloons with a dead dog unless you've kidnapped my family.

357
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,280
 And if that's what you want to hear, if that's what will get you to leave my family alone,

358
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,280
 sir.

359
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,280
 Bigfoot's on balloons.

360
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,280
 Bigfoot's on it.

361
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,280
 How many balloons do you want him to be on?

362
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,280
 He's on that many balloons.

363
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,280
 Please, please let us go."

364
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:17,600
 Fascinating Bigfoot escape stories, swimming away, floating away.

365
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,360
 Who knows what other things he can do?

366
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,840
 Maybe he's really good at digging tunnels.

367
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,840
 Have you ever looked underground?

368
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,680
 Have you ever looked underground, Mr. Bigfoot Researcher?

369
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,680
 Fascinating stuff.

370
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,920
 And I'll put all those other Bigfoot episodes in the show notes because what a blast we've

371
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,480
 had researching that furry man.

372
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,640
 Snail eyes, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carbonicopter.

373
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,400
 We're leaving behind this animal planet host house.

374
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,800
 We've let all of his family members go because he answered the questions correctly.

375
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,000
 Take us all the way out to Texas.

376
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:01,240
 We're headed back to the year 1914.

377
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:08,640
 There's like a guy playing a banjo outside of a store.

378
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,160
 We're walking in.

379
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:15,160
 We're here to get some supplies, some cornmeal, some grubs.

380
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,360
 We're going to have a picnic.

381
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,880
 We're going to have a picnic.

382
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,760
 That's all we're going to eat.

383
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,240
 Cornmeal and grubs and maybe a head of lettuce.

384
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:29,000
 And we're walking out and we're like, man, it sure is cool living in 1914.

385
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,920
 We're in Farmersville, Texas.

386
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,080
 We're watching the sun rise over this beautiful landscape.

387
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,320
 We're like, part of the animal and grubs.

388
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,480
 This sure is country living.

389
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,520
 And we're about to meet three country boys.

390
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,480
 That's how they describe themselves.

391
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,120
 We're two and a half miles outside of Farmersville.

392
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,120
 It's about two and a half miles west of Farmersville.

393
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,200
 It's 10 in the morning.

394
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,720
 There's a trio of children.

395
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,640
 They are headed out to this field to chop cotton.

396
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,800
 I had to look that up.

397
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,800
 I didn't know what that was.

398
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,520
 It's where you thin it out.

399
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,680
 It's the first process.

400
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,840
 When cotton's growing, you kind of get rid of all of the gunk.

401
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,560
 They're like, who threw all these grubs?

402
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,600
 Who buried our crops in cornmeal?

403
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,440
 What type of ecological terrorist was there?

404
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:24,600
 You go and you cut down all the weeds and the weaker cotton

405
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,160
 plants, the ones that aren't going to produce.

406
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:32,800
 Because back then, your chores were part of your economic life.

407
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,840
 Nowadays, it's like make your kids wash the dishes.

408
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,920
 Back then, if your kids didn't do their chores,

409
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,160
 your family didn't make money.

410
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,920
 So they get these three kids to go out there.

411
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:45,360
 We're going to meet Silby, Silby J. Latham.

412
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,480
 And that's the main person who's telling the story.

413
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,680
 Silby J. Latham.

414
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,880
 And he goes, I was about between 13 or 14 years old.

415
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,960
 That's where he's placing this.

416
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,960
 And then he had his two older brothers, Sid and Clyde.

417
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,040
 And they're walking around with their hose.

418
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,920
 They're going to go out.

419
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,520
 They're going to chop down this cotton.

420
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:09,960
 And they bring with them their two loyal dogs, Bob and Fox.

421
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,000
 [BARKING]

422
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,720
 The dogs are barking as the boys are walking two and a half miles

423
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,560
 out to do their chores.

424
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,680
 And he said, we're sitting there.

425
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,680
 We're chopping this cotton, probably whistling.

426
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,640
 And the dogs are just kind of wandering around.

427
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,280
 The dogs are no use in the cotton chopping thing.

428
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,040
 They just brought them out there to keep company.

429
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,360
 Probably wrestle the dogs on their break.

430
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,960
 They let their dogs wander around otherwise.

431
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,520
 And all of a sudden, they hear--

432
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,120
 it's an interesting term.

433
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:51,440
 Silby said that he heard a deathly howl erupt from the distance.

434
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,560
 [SCREAMING]

435
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,560
 And it's funny because these are country boys.

436
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,760
 It's the year 1914.

437
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,360
 Imagine in your reality, you're sitting in your house.

438
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,760
 And all of a sudden, your dog emits a noise

439
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,840
 that you've never heard of make before.

440
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,960
 And you can only describe as a deathly howl.

441
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,600
 You're going to pause the Netflix movie

442
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,040
 and get up and be like, you OK Ralph?

443
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,920
 Ralph, what's going on out there?

444
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,120
 These kids are kind of like, what?

445
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,920
 What's that?

446
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,440
 Dogs are making some weird noise.

447
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,600
 So they just saunter on over.

448
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,920
 They don't even see the dogs at this point.

449
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,920
 They're just kind of walking on over.

450
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:41,480
 And honestly, Silby and Sid are taking their sweet time.

451
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,920
 They're walking super slow because whatever.

452
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,720
 It's the country.

453
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,920
 We hear weird noises out here.

454
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,680
 Clyde gets to the dogs first.

455
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,880
 And so Silby's walking and he sees his brother Clyde kind of

456
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,520
 stopped and he's looking at something.

457
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,520
 And this is a good--

458
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,200
 like they've now walked about 75 yards.

459
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,880
 There's the same distance of a Bigfoot balloon.

460
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,840
 They've walked 75 yards from where

461
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,200
 they were chopping the cotton.

462
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,680
 There's this fence row there, which

463
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,920
 is a fence that divides two uncultivated plots of land.

464
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,200
 I had to look that up too.

465
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,200
 There's a fence row.

466
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,400
 They're in the middle of nowhere,

467
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,160
 but they're still separating their land over who owns what.

468
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,280
 They get to this fence row.

469
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,200
 Well, they don't actually.

470
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,040
 Silby and Sid are taking their sweet time.

471
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,800
 Clyde is at the fence row now with these two dogs.

472
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:37,560
 And they hear Clyde yell out, "Boys, there's something in there.

473
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,560
 It must be something kind of bad."

474
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:46,360
 Silby and Sid are just still strolling over there.

475
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,800
 Their brother's freaking out because he realizes

476
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,800
 that these dogs are losing their mind.

477
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,800
 These dogs are barking so loud at something

478
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,800
 and Clyde can't figure it out.

479
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
 His two brothers are just staring at each other.

480
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,120
 His two brothers are just kind of wandering closer and closer.

481
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,520
 And that's when they hear Clyde go, "It's a little man!"

482
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,800
 So that's going to make you walk a little bit faster, right?

483
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,440
 You hear the sound of dogs barking.

484
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:19,640
 Your brother begins shouting about a little man nearby.

485
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,000
 And Silby and Clyde finally get there.

486
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,960
 And Silby goes, "I walk up and I see Bob and Fox.

487
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,000
 And they're just losing it."

488
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,920
 They're barking and doing that little thing

489
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,680
 where they're jumping from side to side,

490
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,120
 but not in an excited way, almost like in a way

491
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,480
 of trying to intimidate something.

492
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,280
 They're kind of digging their hands in the dirt

493
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,040
 and doing all that weird stuff that dogs do

494
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,840
 when they're ready to go.

495
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,360
 And all I see-- I mean, I see the two dogs.

496
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,160
 I see my brothers.

497
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:59,400
 But standing against the fence row is a little man.

498
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:09,400
 He goes, "The guy was about 18 inches tall.

499
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:16,040
 And he was either all green

500
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:21,880
 or he was wearing a skin-tight green suit."

501
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,280
 He goes, "I couldn't really tell."

502
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,840
 He goes, "There's either the type of suit

503
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,200
 that a frogman would wear, like a diver."

504
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:34,840
 He goes, "This 18-inch man was either a little green man

505
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,280
 like you hear about."

506
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,320
 Well, it's funny.

507
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:42,240
 In 1914, the idea of a Martian was still so new.

508
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,000
 You read about it in the newspapers.

509
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 We had newspaper hoax about Martians and stuff like that.

510
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,400
 But these boys are a country.

511
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:55,000
 They're not getting Jules Verne's novels shipped to them.

512
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 They're also not idiots.

513
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,680
 You can obviously tell that this isn't normal.

514
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,680
 There's an 18-inch man here who's green

515
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,400
 or wearing a green skin-tight suit.

516
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:09,200
 Sylvie goes, "He also had a wide-brimmed hat."

517
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,160
 This little 18-inch man had a wide-brimmed hat

518
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,520
 that was also the same color as his skin or suit.

519
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,720
 And he goes, "It wasn't on his head.

520
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,760
 It was actually kind of on the back of his head."

521
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,200
 He goes, "It almost looked like he had taken the hat off,

522
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,440
 but it was part of the suit.

523
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:29,960
 It was just sitting there, kind of just there."

524
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,040
 And he's looking at this little guy.

525
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:42,600
 He says, "He is completely ignoring the dogs and us.

526
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:47,840
 He's just looking north."

527
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,600
 This 18-inch man is kind of just staring off,

528
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,440
 even though he's towered over by all of these things, right?

529
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:03,080
 Even the dogs are three, four times his guy's height.

530
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,040
 Now, you would think that if your dogs were barking

531
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,400
 and emotionless, for the most part,

532
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,920
 they don't really say that he's like completely frozen in time,

533
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,200
 but he's definitely not acknowledging anything that's going on.

534
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,360
 If your dogs are barking at a motionless 18-inch man,

535
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,600
 you would go, "Maybe that's not real.

536
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,040
 Maybe that's like a toy or a doll."

537
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,800
 Because it's not moving.

538
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,120
 It's not reacting to the fact like I would be terrified

539
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:35,040
 if two dogs ran up on me and I'm bigger than them.

540
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,360
 But he's just looking north.

541
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:40,400
 He's not acknowledging any of this going on.

542
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,680
 And you could obviously start to think,

543
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,920
 like, maybe we should pick him up.

544
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,480
 Maybe we should figure out what this is.

545
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,720
 But here's the thing.

546
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,160
 And this is why we don't have a ton of details over whether or not

547
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,640
 this was a suit or whether or not this was a skin,

548
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,320
 whether or not the hat was always a fix to the back

549
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,120
 or that's how this little guy wore a hat.

550
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,600
 We don't have any of that information

551
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,600
 because Sylvie, everything that he saw,

552
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:16,520
 everything when he walked up, he had to take in all of that detail

553
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:22,240
 in about five seconds, maybe 10.

554
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,080
 Because according to Sylvie, he goes,

555
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,840
 "Once me and Sid walked up and I looked down

556
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,680
 and I saw that guy, once all three of us boys were there,

557
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:41,360
 Bob and Fox ripped that thing to pieces.

558
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,600
 They were worked up into such a frenzy that the second

559
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,440
 the two other boys got there and Sylvie just had a moment

560
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,440
 to really take in what he was looking at,

561
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,200
 these dogs shredded it.

562
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:59,240
 They took it into their jaws and were ripping him limb from limb,

563
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,160
 tearing the head from the torso.

564
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,800
 Everything, they annihilated this little guy.

565
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,360
 And what's interesting is that you would think it's just a toy.

566
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,040
 It was a little statue, whatever it was,

567
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,960
 except for Sylvie's description of what happened.

568
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,400
 And he said, this was his quote,

569
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:24,880
 "Blood and guts went everywhere.

570
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,400
 The blood was red and the guts looked like guts looked.

571
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,640
 And that's super interesting because again,

572
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,400
 if it was a toy, it'd be like,

573
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,400
 "Oh, they tore it apart. There's a bunch of stuffing."

574
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,400
 But this was a biological entity.

575
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,400
 It sounds like such a simple statement to make,

576
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,400
 being like, "Yeah, they ate it in like real blood shot out of it."

577
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,400
 And it had intestines and a little heart and things like that.

578
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,880
 But that does set it apart.

579
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,400
 Whatever this thing was, it was a totally ignoring them.

580
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,400
 It was a living, breathing thing.

581
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,400
 "Blood and guts went everywhere.

582
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,400
 The blood was red and the guts looked like guts looked."

583
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:14,400
 This is so funny. He continues his quote.

584
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,400
 And he goes, quote,

585
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:21,400
 "We were all just country as hell and didn't know what to do.

586
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,400
 The dogs just chewed him to pieces after they killed him.

587
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,400
 And we just went back to hoeing."

588
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:35,400
 That's fascinating and that's honest, right?

589
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,400
 You have these kids in the middle of Texas in 1914.

590
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,400
 They've probably heard about, you know,

591
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,400
 fantastical creatures and fairy tales or nursery rhymes and things like that.

592
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,400
 But it's the middle of the morning.

593
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,400
 You have a job to do.

594
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,400
 You just saw the dogs just shred this guy to pieces.

595
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,400
 This tiny guy and they're like, "Okay, like what are we doing now?

596
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,400
 I mean, the dogs are eating it.

597
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,400
 The dogs are eating the remains of this thing.

598
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,400
 Let's just go back."

599
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,400
 This is one of those stories, like a story we covered yesterday,

600
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:12,400
 the Dade City Flowers, where the person knows that something odd is happening,

601
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,400
 something not normal just occurred.

602
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:20,400
 But it's a different time.

603
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,400
 They just go back to doing their job.

604
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,400
 They go back to chopping cotton.

605
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,400
 But again, they knew there was something weird about this,

606
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,400
 but not so much that they're like, "Let's analyze the pieces.

607
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,400
 What is this a piece of a skin or a suit?

608
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,400
 Let me taste it."

609
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,400
 That's synthetic.

610
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,400
 That's synthetic plastic.

611
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,400
 The dogs pretty much ate everything that they could.

612
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,400
 And the boys went back to hoeing.

613
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,400
 Now again, though, after they were done with their chores,

614
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,400
 because that was their job, that was not just them out there for fun,

615
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,400
 when they went back home, they go, "Hey, Ma, Pa, guess what?

616
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,400
 You'll never believe what happened.

617
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,400
 The dogs ate a little man.

618
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:05,400
 The dogs ate a little 18-inch man, and the parents didn't believe them.

619
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,400
 The parents were like, "What are you guys talking about?

620
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,400
 Did you guys just chop in the cotton?"

621
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,400
 "Yeah, we did, but the dogs ate some."

622
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,400
 "Well, wash your hands and get ready for supper."

623
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:20,400
 Sylvie said that day we went back out there a couple times.

624
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:27,400
 We went back to that fence row, and we just looked around.

625
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:36,400
 But after that day, we never went back to the fence row.

626
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,400
 We never investigated it further.

627
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,400
 It's a fascinating story on so many levels.

628
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:50,400
 On the one level you have, this, you know, Sylvie, Sylvie J. Latham, has this story.

629
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:57,400
 And it's something weird that happens to him, and I can almost guarantee he remembered it.

630
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:04,400
 He always thought it was weird, but that happens in 1914.

631
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:11,400
 When he's older, think about it, he was 13 when that happened.

632
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:20,400
 By the time of the UFO flap, right, in the 1950s, when it really kicked off, 1947, to be specific.

633
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:27,400
 But in the 1950s and 1960s, at that point he would still be like, "I know I'm bad at math, but in his 60s himself."

634
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,400
 Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

635
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,400
 He was 13 in 1914.

636
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:38,400
 And then, whatever, the point is that he would be an adult, and you'd be hearing about little green men.

637
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:47,400
 You'd be hearing about these invaders from Mars, you'd be catching stuff at the local movie theater, and he'd be like, "Oh, that's what that was."

638
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,400
 Like, I don't know, I'm just country's hell.

639
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:58,400
 I just thought that was something that happens sometimes, that a little man will show up occasionally and get torn to pieces by dogs.

640
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,400
 And then, he would go to the Lord, these dogs ate him.

641
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:08,400
 They ripped him to pieces and spread his blood and guts everywhere and then enjoyed the meal that they had just created for themselves.

642
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:17,400
 And Sylvie, it would take Sylvie time to put that into context and be like, "Oh, that's what that is. That's what they ate, was an alien."

643
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,400
 A little green man.

644
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,400
 Now, we don't use the term "little green man" anymore.

645
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,400
 It's used as a pejorative nowadays to kind of dismiss people.

646
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:33,400
 There are accounts of, they're not super common or not as common as, you know, the FBI and the CIA tried to make out when they would disparage these people through the media, right?

647
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,400
 Oh, you believe in little green men? They're anal probes, all that stuff.

648
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:43,400
 All of that stuff was not necessarily misinformation, because some of it happened, but mal-information.

649
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:49,400
 It was put out by intelligence agencies to dismiss UFO sightings.

650
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,400
 I mean, like, that's not even a conspiracy theory at this point. We know that's true.

651
00:35:53,400 --> 00:36:01,400
 They used the media to mock people who saw this stuff, and so people would stop reporting it.

652
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:06,400
 But then you have people who saw something like before you even knew of the term "flying saucer."

653
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:13,400
 Before, I mean, back then, the term "alien" meant someone from another country.

654
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,400
 So you have that, but it's so-- like, what was this thing?

655
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,400
 The idea that he was looking off into the distance and he wasn't acknowledging what was going on--

656
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:26,400
 there's two ways to read that. Well, there's three ways. One of them is that it was a doll or a toy.

657
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,400
 Someone had made it as a joke. It's kind of a super specific joke.

658
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,400
 They placed this little doll out in the middle of nowhere.

659
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,400
 Maybe some boys will bring some dogs along.

660
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,400
 It's possible that there-- when I read this, because I read this a couple of times to get ready for this,

661
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:51,400
 it's possible that what the creature, what this alien was doing, was not-- it wasn't aware of what was going on.

662
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:56,400
 If it was coming-- this is going to sound, you know, probably a little esoteric, a little hippie-dippy,

663
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:02,400
 but imagine it is moving from one dimension into ours, and the process isn't complete,

664
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,400
 and he's still trying to figure, you know, like-- I don't know.

665
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:12,400
 It just sounds like I'm making stuff up, but I was thinking that, like, what if he's crossing a barrier,

666
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,400
 and normally he would be able to blink out or run away or something like that,

667
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,400
 but in this case he's frozen because this process is still going on.

668
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:26,400
 That's possible. What I actually think is happening, which is far more depressing than that scenario,

669
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,400
 is I think this little guy realized that he was done.

670
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:40,400
 He knew he wasn't getting out of this situation, and like a man at the gallows,

671
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:50,400
 with his eyes fixed on the beautiful blue horizon, he's looking-- he's taking in one last look before he dies.

672
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,400
 Like, he doesn't want to face the threat. He knows it's an inevitable death.

673
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,400
 There's nothing he can do at this point.

674
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:03,400
 He's just looking at the one peaceful thing he can see, because he has these giant humans towering over him,

675
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:14,400
 these vicious dogs, right, all up on him just barking and ready to devour him, and he just is looking at nature.

676
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,400
 He's just ignoring that, and he realizes I'm not getting out of this, but I'm not going to--

677
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:25,400
 I don't want my last sight to be drool dripping off of an insane dog's jowls.

678
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:30,400
 I'm just going to look-- I'm going to look north, and I'm going to think of better times and happier times

679
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:40,400
 and my few remaining moments of life. I think that's what it was. I think he was resigned to death.

680
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,400
 That's a fascinating story. This is Close Encounters of the Canine Kind Week.

681
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:51,400
 On Monday's episode, we covered two dogs. It's actually interesting. It's such a similar setup to the Monday's episode.

682
00:38:51,400 --> 00:39:01,400
 Two dogs who encounter a UFO and the effect that that had on them. Today, we covered two dogs taking down an 18-inch man.

683
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:09,400
 It wasn't a fair fight. It totally wasn't a fair fight, right? This guy was ill-equipped for country Texas life.

684
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:17,400
 But on Friday, we're going to cover one more case of Close Encounters of the Canine Kind.

685
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:32,400
 When a man and his dog go hiking high up in the mountains, the final showdown between man's best friend and humankind's worst enemy will begin.

686
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,400
 But that's in a future episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

687
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:42,400

00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:49,400
 TikTok is @DeadRabbitRadio. DeadRabbitRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

689
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:53,400
 You don't have to listen to it every day. I'm glad you listened to it today. Have a great one, guys.
