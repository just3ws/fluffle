1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,700
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio Classics, where we listen

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:13,480
 to some old episodes with new intros, new insights, a little behind the scenes stuff.

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,300
 This is one of the episodes that really kind of flew under the radar, so we're going back

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,060
 to episode 113.

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:29,200
 At this point the show had, I don't know, two, three hundred listeners, so much bigger than

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,000
 a lot of podcasts, but not to the level we're at today.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,680
 So when we start going this far back in the catalog, a lot of people, and this wasn't like

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,680
 a golf rumors, this wasn't something that was big on the conspiracy iceberg that people

9
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,480
 were actively looking up.

10
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:49,040
 This episode is one of those that really flew under the radar, but actually I think is kind

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,600
 of one of the important episodes of the Dead Rabbit canon.

12
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,280
 Again, yesterday's episode has three stories, which I always like that.

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,120
 The first story, it's a pretty cut and dry UFO story, but it's notable because it's the

14
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,880
 first fatality ever connected with a modern UFO sighting.

15
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,880
 And then we have, and I like doing historical stuff, we have some more historical stuff coming

16
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,800
 up in season nine.

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,240
 Season seven and eight didn't have a lot, but season nine I'm going to do a couple more.

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,760
 I like looking back at history and looking at all these weird events.

19
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,520
 This one is D.O. Genes.

20
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,520
 He's hanging out.

21
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,640
 He's the trolliest troll.

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,680
 When I was listening back to this episode, I was like, "Oh, you filthy old man.

23
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,320
 I really love going back and doing little things about history."

24
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,200
 I think that's always an interesting thing.

25
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,200
 But then we end it with a conspiracy iceberg topic that actually kind of spun off into

26
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,800
 its own conspiracy theory.

27
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,200
 And again, it's like yesterday's one.

28
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,680
 It's one that I don't think anyone's ever looked at.

29
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,560
 And I think this episode, I would really like to see someone who's much smarter than me

30
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,720
 really dig into the numbers on this.

31
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,560
 Because listening back to the, again, this was episode 113.

32
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,800
 So this came out in 2018.

33
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:11,320
 This was an early episode, probably early 2019, 2018.

34
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:18,040
 I listened to the episode again and I'm like, "I'm even more sure now of my belief that

35
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:24,320
 there is a connection between pedophiles and school shooters."

36
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:30,880
 Both people are just so, they're so consumed with darkness that it seems like such a small

37
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,480
 bridge to cross to go from one to the other.

38
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,120
 A lot of people say this is the first podcast they've ever listened to.

39
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,840
 There's a podcast called Hunting Warhead.

40
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:47,800
 It's about two, it's about a journalist and a hacker go into the dark web to try to track

41
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,920
 down people who profit off of child abuse and child abuse images.

42
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,360
 And it's about six episodes.

43
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,680
 There's only six episodes long.

44
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,440
 It's a really, really good podcast.

45
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,240
 And I just recently listened to that and then I listened to this episode maybe a week later.

46
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:09,000
 And especially after listening to Hunting Warhead, these people are so disturbed mentally.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,400
 At this time I'm talking about people who commit child abuse and people who profit from child

48
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,400
 abuse.

49
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,800
 I believe there is a connection.

50
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,920
 And I think that it takes away a lot of the power that school shooters or mass shooters

51
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,420
 get in society.

52
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:30,960
 People are like, "Oh, the dude who shot up Virginia Tech or the Columbine people, people

53
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,720
 turn these guys into martyrs or into myths.

54
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,680
 But if it turns out that these dudes are just a bunch of pedophiles, no one wants to idolize

55
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,680
 them."

56
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,680
 Right?

57
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:47,800
 So, I think this is possibly one of those conspiracy theories that I feel like I made

58
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,160
 a compelling case for.

59
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,640
 But you're like, Jason, you're really selling that one.

60
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,640
 I think that I did.

61
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:59,680
 I think that this episode, again, it's limited to how much research I can actually do.

62
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,920
 I would love to see someone actually really, really dig into this.

63
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:11,280
 But I recorded this episode 300 episodes ago and I'm even more sure now in my hypothesis

64
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,200
 that there is a connection between school shooters and pedophiles.

65
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,840
 There is one there.

66
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:22,920
 And whether it's being intentionally obscured, because sometimes the real facts are just

67
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:29,400
 too gross for humans to handle, what you read in the newspaper as grim as it can be is nowhere

68
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,160
 near as dark as it actually is.

69
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:39,440
 Or it could just be that no one's really connected the dots until a young, handsome podcaster

70
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,560
 shone a light into the darkness and said, "Look over here, guys."

71
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,440
 And all of a sudden the research community looked over.

72
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,240
 I would love for someone to really kind of dig into this.

73
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,960
 You don't even have to give me credit.

74
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,120
 If you don't, yeah, you don't have to give me credit for this one.

75
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,040
 I don't want to be known for that guy.

76
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,880
 They're like, "He had a really good insight on disgusting human beings."

77
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,680
 I would just...

78
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:07,400
 Because if my hypothesis is true, I think it might be easier to stop school shootings,

79
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,400
 right?

80
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,320
 I think if you can kind of hone in on people who collect child abuse images and use that

81
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,600
 as a stepping stone for investigating these school shootings, maybe it would help.

82
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,800
 Maybe it would help save lives.

83
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
 I don't know.

84
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,240
 The whole topic's completely disgusting and to be honest, I question whether or not I

85
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,920
 wanted to revisit this episode.

86
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,880
 I was really like, "It fits the theme of the week.

87
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,000
 I think it's an important episode.

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,320
 Not a lot of people have heard it.

89
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,080
 But at the same time, the topic itself is gross.

90
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,600
 Just the title of the podcast this episode, you're like, "Oh, gotta listen to this for

91
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,240
 20 minutes."

92
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:45,760
 But maybe you out there have more insight on this and can actually do some work, some

93
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:52,960
 legwork and actually look into this and prove it right and maybe help people.

94
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,440
 Help people connect the dots and then we can address both problems at the same time

95
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,440
 if they're connected.

96
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,440
 I don't know.

97
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,440
 At this point, I'm just rambling on.

98
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,160
 So now I'm gonna let the podcast play, which is just more of me rambling on.

99
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,960
 This is episode 113, The School Shooter-Pedophile Connection.

100
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,000
 An early UFO encounter changes the way the media looks at the phenomenon.

101
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,480
 We take a look at a Greek philosopher who if he lived today would most likely be described

102
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,680
 as a troll, not physically, but you know, "Internet troll."

103
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:33,120
 And then we take a look at a bizarre connection between child pornography and mass shootings

104
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,880
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

105
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:45,120
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

106
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,280
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

107
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,280
 I'm having a great day.

108
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,760
 I hope you're having a great day too.

109
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,120
 I hope everything is going really fun for you.

110
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,120
 We have a couple stories.

111
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,320
 We're gonna do three stories today, so we're just gonna again just kind of jump right into

112
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,320
 it.

113
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,520
 So the first story I want to talk about is just a brief one, but I think it's fairly

114
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:05,000
 interesting because it really kind of signified the change in the way that the media portrayed

115
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 UFOs.

116
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 So we're back in the 1940s.

117
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,480
 Now at this point, the war's over.

118
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,800
 We dropped the nukes.

119
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,040
 And there's been some theories of correlation between that, like the nukes made the aliens

120
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,600
 go, "Oh no, they've developed these super powerful weapons.

121
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:24,200
 It's time to come down and float around and not contact them and draw circles in their

122
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,200
 wheat."

123
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,400
 That'll show them.

124
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,120
 But anyway, so the nukes dropped.

125
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,040
 We started having incidents like Roswell.

126
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,480
 We started having incidents like the UFOs that were sighted around.

127
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,320
 I think it was Mount Adams or Mount Shasta, one of the two.

128
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,560
 But it was kind of the start of the UFO flap.

129
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,280
 And at the time, the media portrayed it like, "Oh, look at these little people believing

130
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,920
 the little green men are getting you for drinking a little too much."

131
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,920
 You know?

132
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,920
 They, they, they, they.

133
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,840
 They hung in cheek the way that they covered a lot of this stuff.

134
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,880
 And there's been theories that the government was the one being like, "Cover it up.

135
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,800
 Don't let anybody know about this stuff."

136
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,360
 But what happened was in 1948 on January 7th, Captain Thomas F. Mantrell, he was an Air

137
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,360
 Force pilot.

138
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,440
 He was a decorated pilot in World War II.

139
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,120
 He was out with his squadron with the Kentucky National Guard.

140
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,720
 The war's over, so what else are you gonna do?

141
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
 Go back to Kentucky.

142
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,720
 They're flying around.

143
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,760
 They get a report that there is an unidentified flying object in the area.

144
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:20,920
 It is large, well, it's 100 feet, but I mean that's, like, I don't know, 30 jasons.

145
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,920
 Wait.

146
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,480
 I'm, what, what would that be?

147
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,080
 We'll just round up to six.

148
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,080
 What's six divided into a hundred?

149
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,880
 What's a hundred divided by six would be, oh wait, no, that's not, that's only like,

150
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,880
 wait, no, no, no, 'cause 10 jasons would be 60 feet.

151
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:49,280
 And then we need another five jasons, 'cause that would be five times 30, so if we had

152
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,780
 60, 90.

153
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,360
 So maybe another seven jasons.

154
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,320
 So it would take 17 jasons to be the size of the ship.

155
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,240
 I know that took a while to figure out, but, and it's in diameter, so we'll have to figure

156
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,320
 out some more jasons in there.

157
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,200
 But from point to point, you imagine 17 jasons float in the sky.

158
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,840
 It was consistent with the idea of what people thought was a UFO at the time.

159
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,160
 It was large, metallic, and cone shaped.

160
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:18,120
 So the Kentucky National Guard, they, their little fleets, like, they're like, check it

161
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,320
 out, check it out.

162
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,520
 I don't know why they talk like robots back then, but anyways, the planes are going.

163
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:28,760
 Now it keeps ascending into the sky, and the jets are flying after it, and eventually

164
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,600
 they are going too high up, and the rest of the team are like, dude, we gotta, we gotta

165
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,680
 call this off.

166
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,000
 Like we're, it's going too high, then we can fly.

167
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,880
 So they start to back down, but Mantrell, Captain Mantrell, is like, no, I'm gonna get

168
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,680
 to the bottom of this once and for all.

169
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,320
 He continues to ascend at 25,000 feet up.

170
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,520
 The plane starts to spiral into a dive, and it crashes.

171
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:56,920
 What it came, the official story is that that was what's known as a skyhook balloon, and

172
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,520
 at that time it was a top secret program.

173
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,400
 Nobody knew what they were unless they really worked on it or had the top secret clearance.

174
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,240
 It was made out of reflective aluminum, it was 17 jasons white.

175
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,000
 So that was the official, that's an official report, 17 jasons.

176
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,200
 So the story's notable because after this, the media stopped really kind of making fun

177
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,720
 of the whole UFO phenomenon, because somebody had lost their life because of it.

178
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,720
 And it's interesting to look at because when I was growing up, the media was back to making

179
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,400
 fun of people looking at UFOs, you know, oh, little green man, you're doing, you're hitting

180
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,760
 that moonshine, eh, eh, eh, eh.

181
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,120
 But for a period of time, they stopped joking about it because somebody lost their life.

182
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,120
 So yeah, I just thought it was kind of a little interesting story.

183
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,400
 Technically he would be, as far as we know, the first casualty that was involved in a

184
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,400
 UFO encounter.

185
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,840
 You know, assuming that UFOs aren't abducting people and blowing their brains out with laser

186
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:00,600
 beams and stuff, but on the record, Captain Man Trail is the first person to die in pursuit

187
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,240
 of a UFO.

188
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,040
 And it turned out to just be a skyhook balloon, at least that's the official story.

189
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:12,240
 So I thought it was an interesting tale from the old days of UFOs.

190
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,000
 The next story we're going to look at, I told you it was going to be short, the next story

191
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 we're going to look at is also going to be relatively short because it's almost just

192
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 a list of stuff this dude does.

193
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,200
 This was a recommendation, so I did a story about Mr. Haji, he was the dirtiest man alive.

194
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,800
 I did that story a couple weeks ago.

195
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,880
 There was a YouTube commenter named Emanuel who said, "Hey, this guy, okay, now I'll

196
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,880
 say this.

197
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:45,640
 I, okay, I called the dude Herodotus and everyone's like, "No, it's Herodotus."

198
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:50,520
 And again, I don't know if I said this earlier, "Do you really know his name is Herodotus?"

199
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,360
 Because his name was an ancient Greek.

200
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,160
 And there's no one around who speaks ancient Greek who spoke it back then, like there's

201
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,240
 people who can like translate it.

202
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,740
 But technically for all we know it sounded like a bunch of crows kind and then just other

203
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,160
 languages he developed.

204
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,160
 I don't know.

205
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:16,720
 I, I'm sure I, I'm sure you guys are probably right that it's pronounced Herodotus, but

206
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,400
 it's spelled Herodotus.

207
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,960
 So that is, but I do appreciate the feedback, but I got a lot of comments on that episode

208
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,400
 in real life as well.

209
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:31,240
 People being like, "I'm out at a party with some people and they're like, it's not Herodotus.

210
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,760
 It's Herodotus."

211
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,680
 And I'm like, "Well, according to the ancient Greeks, we don't know.

212
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,920
 Maybe they went like, you know, like they're just clicking and clacking.

213
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,920
 We don't know.

214
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,720
 There's no sound recordings back then."

215
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,520
 So all that being said, in defense of what I'm about to talk about, let's talk about

216
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,520
 deogenes.

217
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:57,600
 Now, deogenes is a Greek philosopher who lived in the 400 BCs.

218
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,360
 So he's around back then.

219
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,600
 I can already hear the sound of history majors pulling their hair out.

220
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,360
 And I had someone try to explain to me how you pronounce his name, but, but again, I,

221
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,080
 it's spelled deogenes.

222
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,200
 And I'm a deo like the rock band and then genes.

223
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
 It's very obvious.

224
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:20,000
 But anyway, so deogenes was this philosopher and he was one of the first cynics.

225
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,380
 And cynicism, we know now, like cynicism is kind of like, I could call to cynic every

226
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,380
 once in a while.

227
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:30,000
 I could call to cynic the other night actually, but cynicism as a philosophy was, is basically

228
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,680
 that true happiness is not found in material wealth and things around us.

229
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,800
 Or, you know, being healthy or having political power or things like that.

230
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:47,840
 It doesn't lie in any sort of fleeting things, which I got that definition from Wikipedia

231
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,720
 and it's a baseline definition.

232
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:56,600
 It's kind of a, but see what I don't understand is how, how does that tie into me just being

233
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,960
 like, I just, I don't believe in that.

234
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,880
 I guess that is kind of, kind of that.

235
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:07,200
 But anyway, cynicism, I think, let me actually look up the definition of cynicism real quick.

236
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,560
 Highly, highly prepared for this episode.

237
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,560
 How are you guys doing?

238
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,200
 I'm on my phone if you're wondering how I'm still recording while I'm doing this.

239
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,960
 You guys having a good day?

240
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,960
 Cynicism.

241
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,640
 I know how to spell it, so there's that.

242
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,720
 And I'm pronouncing that right.

243
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,320
 Get some credits for that.

244
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,880
 Oh, okay, cynicism.

245
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,240
 An inclination to believe that people are motivated purely by self-interest skepticism.

246
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,480
 So yeah, same thing.

247
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,600
 Just cynic is kind of a philosophical model of that.

248
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,680
 So let's go on with the episode.

249
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:41,280
 So Dio Jeans was this dude who lived in what is now modern-day Turkey.

250
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,440
 And the dude from the start was, he's a troll.

251
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,760
 He's an absolute troll.

252
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:52,440
 He would do stuff because he's a cynic, because he would basically look at people who respected

253
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,320
 power and material wealth and all that stuff.

254
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,880
 He was spitting in their face all the time.

255
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,360
 And there's a lot of stories about him and a lot of them people go, yeah, that probably

256
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,760
 didn't happen the way that we remember it.

257
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:10,160
 But it's funny that's a fitting tribute to him because he probably wouldn't really want

258
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,360
 to be remembered.

259
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,080
 I think he probably would find it funny that nobody knows the exact details of what went

260
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,080
 on.

261
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,480
 His dad was a moneymaker.

262
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,960
 His dad minted coins and Dio Jeans would deface it.

263
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,720
 So he got in trouble for that.

264
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,720
 Because what's the point?

265
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,160
 You're making this money and you draw little mustaches on it, if they had mustaches back

266
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,160
 then I'm assuming.

267
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,200
 He would, he basically, and this is why I think he got compared to the dirtiest man

268
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,200
 in the world.

269
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,000
 He just ate onions.

270
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,120
 He used to have a single cup to drink water out of until he saw a kid drinking water out

271
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,120
 of his hands.

272
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,280
 And Dio Jeans was like, I don't need this cup.

273
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,840
 This kid hasn't more figured it out than I do.

274
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,920
 Now, the kid probably washed his hands more than you do, but fair enough.

275
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,920
 He was a bum.

276
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,620
 He was a total bum.

277
00:15:53,620 --> 00:16:00,120
 He lived in a giant barrel in the middle of the city, like Oscar the Grouch.

278
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,880
 Some people say barrel, some people say jar.

279
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,960
 The point is he lived in a container.

280
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,320
 A Dio Jeans sized container is what he lived in.

281
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,560
 And he would just be like, wake up, big birds walking on the street.

282
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,080
 He's like, hey, let me masturbate on you.

283
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,160
 Because he was a frequent public masturbator.

284
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,760
 At one point, one of the stories about him was he was sitting on the street jacking off.

285
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,840
 And so the dude walks up and goes, hey, Dio Jeans, quit jacking off.

286
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,760
 And Dio Jeans, his response was, I wish it was as easy to banish hunger by rubbing my

287
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,760
 belly.

288
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,920
 I mean, I'm assuming he finished masturbating.

289
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,320
 But I mean, I guess that does make sense.

290
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,400
 Like wouldn't it be nice if you're hungry, just rub your belly and it goes away just

291
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,000
 like you can be like, you know what, I'm bored.

292
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 I'm going to jack off.

293
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 I'm horny.

294
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 I'm going to jack off.

295
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,320
 This episode is definitely getting an explicit filter.

296
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,040
 You'll have to be over 18 to listen to this episode on YouTube as well.

297
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,520
 But so he was just like a troll.

298
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:01,720
 He lived in a barrel or a box or just a Dio Jeans shaped container, which I believe you

299
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,080
 can buy at Bed Bath and Beyond.

300
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:08,360
 But he, when masturbating in public, he would poop in public, pee in public.

301
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,520
 He didn't care.

302
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,680
 Now people were like, they kind of got it to a certain point.

303
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,880
 They're like, you know, he's living freer than I am, but he's also a disgusting filthy

304
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,880
 human being.

305
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,480
 He thought that people should be more like dogs.

306
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,040
 He thought dogs had it all figured out.

307
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,480
 It was a very simple way of a living life.

308
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,880
 And the word "cynic" actually comes from basically a deviation of the Greek word for

309
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,960
 dog because just live your life simple like a dog.

310
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,680
 I'll get to that in a second.

311
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:41,520
 Eventually, another great thing that he did, so we know of Socrates and we know of Plato,

312
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,380
 these great Greek philosophers and people, there's a lot of people who would give their

313
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:52,400
 left arm to be able to speak to Socrates, to speak to Plato, to hear, just to hear these

314
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,360
 great minds think, well, Dio Jeans didn't care.

315
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,720
 Dio Jeans flat out didn't care about these guys.

316
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,880
 I think that he cared about, no, I don't think he cared about them at all.

317
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,320
 I mean, he might have cared a little bit about their philosophy, but he thought it was too

318
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,320
 hoity-toity.

319
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,120
 He was like, oh, they're giving speeches in these big arenas and stuff like that.

320
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,280
 If I was a philosopher, I would jack off in front of them while I'm talking about stuff.

321
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,120
 So he would go to Plato.

322
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,840
 Plato would have these big seminars like this Tony Robbins type of thing.

323
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,120
 And Dio Jeans would show up and I'm assuming, I can just, just from reading about this guy,

324
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,600
 I can imagine the smell of him.

325
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,600
 Because why?

326
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,600
 Why would he care about bathing?

327
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,800
 He lives in a bucket for crying out loud.

328
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:40,600
 So he would go to Plato seminars and as Plato was delivering these pearls of wisdom to these

329
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:46,280
 philosophers who have traveled hundreds of miles to sit in front of Plato, Dio Jeans would

330
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:50,400
 unwrap food and eat it noisily, just to distract everybody.

331
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,480
 That's, that's master level trolling.

332
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:01,880
 Like that is, you could take the best troll today and he could never live up to sitting

333
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:07,240
 in front of one of the greatest minds of the Western world and eating noisily while he's

334
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,840
 trying to do a presentation.

335
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,640
 That is Dio Jeans.

336
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,760
 That is 100%.

337
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,760
 That's great A-Stuff.

338
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,440
 When I saw that anecdote, I was like, okay, this guy, I'm going to talk about this guy

339
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,080
 however briefly, because that's amazing.

340
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,240
 He ended up getting caught, sold into slavery.

341
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,440
 The, well he got caught because he was running around or something like that.

342
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,640
 I think he had to leave the city because he was doing some stuff, defacing the money maybe.

343
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,920
 He gets caught by slavers, sold to someone and ends up, and ends up teaching his master's

344
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,800
 children because he was a brilliant mind.

345
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,680
 He was just so outside the box.

346
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,360
 If he wasn't living in the box, he was outside of it.

347
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:49,960
 So he goes into this rich dude's house, he's teaching his kids, he starts to gain more

348
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,760
 stature, he finds another philosopher who shares the same viewpoints as him and that's

349
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,640
 really where the school of cynicism kind of took off.

350
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:03,560
 And then, like, so he finally has some prestige, he has a house that he lives in where he tutors

351
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:08,000
 these children, he's the second hand man to this other famous philosopher who actually

352
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,840
 like they see eye to eye, it's all about people being simple and having disregard for these

353
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:13,840
 material things.

354
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,680
 And he moves into a jar.

355
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,840
 He moves into a jar.

356
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,920
 He's in a brand new city and he has a job and he has all this respectability and he just

357
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,680
 gets a big jar and crawls inside of it.

358
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,400
 And he lives in a jar in this city as well.

359
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,920
 But again, now he has more clout people like, "Oh, hey, Theo James, he's like jacking off

360
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,920
 in the jar."

361
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,920
 They're like, "Oh, you scamp."

362
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,320
 I wonder what Oscar the Grouch does in that garbage can all the time.

363
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,800
 I think there was an episode of Sesame Street and I could have just be a little kid and I

364
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,800
 could have been dreaming this, but I thought it was an episode where they go into the garbage

365
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,080
 can and there's like a full apartment down there.

366
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,040
 I don't remember, but it almost sounds something like I would have dreamt rather than actually

367
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,840
 being real because actually that's kind of creepy.

368
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,400
 That's basically Oscar the Grouch's like murder dungeon.

369
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,680
 There's something underneath the garbage can.

370
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:03,240
 So and again, Theo James goes out in the weirdest possible way.

371
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,560
 They don't know exactly how he died.

372
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,360
 There's one of three ways.

373
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:11,640
 Then died of an infected dog bite, which would be ironic because cynics basically want to

374
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,560
 live like dogs, which I guess that's how other dogs died back then.

375
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,880
 They got bit by other dogs.

376
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,280
 Eating raw octopus.

377
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,800
 Now obviously he wasn't like swimming in the ocean and like took a bite out of one, but

378
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:27,400
 you know, just eating raw octopus food or oddly enough, and this is actually physically

379
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,400
 impossible.

380
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,040
 I don't even know why they include this in this list of his possible deaths.

381
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,320
 Holding his breath until he died.

382
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,560
 Your body won't let you do that, but maybe held his breath and like fell into some wet

383
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,680
 cement and couldn't breathe anymore.

384
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,920
 And they asked him before he died, not like while he was dying.

385
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,040
 He's facing down in the cement and they're like, hey, Theo James, Theo James, how do you,

386
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,040
 how do you want to be buried?

387
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,880
 But they asked him before he died and he said, they go, what do you want to do with your

388
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,880
 body when you're dead?

389
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,200
 Because again, he had more clout in this new city.

390
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,000
 He said, yeah, just throw it out and just throw it over the city wall.

391
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 The dogs eat it.

392
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 I don't care.

393
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,120
 And they go, well, don't you mind?

394
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,360
 And he goes, I won't care if you do that as long as you give me a stick so I can fight

395
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,360
 the dogs off.

396
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:13,960
 And they go, well, dude, if we throw you over the wall, you're dead and we give you a stick.

397
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,600
 Why are you asking for a stick?

398
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,600
 You're dead.

399
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,600
 You can't do anything.

400
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,240
 And he replied, if I lack awareness, then why should I care what happens to me when

401
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,240
 I am dead?

402
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,240
 I think there's definitely elements from Theo James' life that we can look at.

403
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,720
 Public masturbation is not one of them.

404
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,720
 Don't do that.

405
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,200
 Or maybe if you had a nice lid.

406
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,640
 But I wouldn't do it unless it had the murder dungeon underneath it.

407
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:43,040
 OK, so not saying I would use the murder dungeon, I would just want more room down there.

408
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,800
 Hey, everyone.

409
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,840
 So I'm back and you're thinking, wait, what do you mean you're back?

410
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,840
 You were just talking.

411
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,400
 This is actually being recorded a couple hours later.

412
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,160
 Had to go to physical therapy appointment, came home, ate a block of jalapeno cheese,

413
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,760
 took about a two hour nap.

414
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,680
 Now I have to get ready to go to one of my jobs.

415
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,680
 I have three of them.

416
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:07,000
 But I originally recorded this following story and I just didn't like the way it came out.

417
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,840
 It just was basically just listing facts.

418
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,080
 I didn't think it had a really strong narrative hook.

419
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:17,760
 I do have to say though, it's not very funny because both topics are incredibly disturbing.

420
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,600
 So we'll see where we go with this.

421
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,000
 I'm actually glad I'm including this story in this episode because then I can just explicit

422
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,920
 adult filter the whole thing after deogenes.

423
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,920
 Jacking off everywhere.

424
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,480
 Now we're onto this story, which we'll also all have to put warnings on.

425
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,360
 So this theory here came off of the conspiracy iceberg.

426
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,920
 We've talked a lot about that.

427
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,360
 The Sentinelese having alien artifacts that came off the conspiracy iceberg.

428
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,040
 It's basically just a list of all the conspiracies and the farther you go down, the more rare

429
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,040
 they are.

430
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,280
 One of them is just listed as a phrase.

431
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,000
 Nambla shootings.

432
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,400
 Now if you don't know, if you're lucky enough to not know that this group exists, I wasn't.

433
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,640
 I've unfortunately been aware of their existence for decades.

434
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,840
 Nambla is a quite disgusting group.

435
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,840
 They fall in and out of operation.

436
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,280
 Sometimes they're around, sometimes they're not.

437
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,080
 But I'm sure they're always functioning on some level.

438
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,280
 Nambla is the North American.

439
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,560
 Oh that sounds nice.

440
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,560
 North American.

441
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,000
 A lot of good stuff comes from there.

442
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,200
 The North American Man-Boy-Love Association.

443
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,480
 So it's a group that encourages pedophilia between adult men and young boys.

444
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,920
 Nambla, it pops up in the newspapers every once in a while, but like I said, they don't

445
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,080
 seem to be as functional as they used to be.

446
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,000
 Here's a little quick history lesson for you.

447
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Back in the day, like in the 60s, first off, when the gay rights community was trying to

448
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,800
 fight for their rights back in the 50s, the gay rights organizations and the lesbian rights

449
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,240
 organizations did not get along.

450
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,640
 They didn't communicate with each other.

451
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,320
 They didn't work on the same beat.

452
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,640
 They weren't working together because the issues they were facing were completely different.

453
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:03,160
 The lesbians were not facing the same level of aggressive policing that the gay groups

454
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,160
 were.

455
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:09,040
 The main issues with being gay back in the 50s was the police crashing into your gay

456
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,280
 bar.

457
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,280
 Not literally.

458
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,760
 They didn't have like their cop cars going through the wall, but they would do these

459
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,720
 stings, they would break into gay bars, arrest everybody.

460
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:23,000
 They would arrest men who were cruising for sex because, you know, they're gay and it

461
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,080
 was illegal.

462
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,420
 So basically you'd go out to a restroom and you would try to hook up with someone.

463
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,080
 This was before Grindr, obviously.

464
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,200
 This was before cell phones or probably even phones.

465
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,880
 They would show up at a restroom to meet another guy and it would be an undercover cop.

466
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,160
 So when the gay rights organizations started trying to fight back, the lesbian groups were

467
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,400
 like, "Those aren't problems that we face.

468
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,560
 Like quit going to restrooms and put hanging out at these gay bars or being raided by these

469
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,840
 police and you'll be fine.

470
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,520
 Just be like housewives like us."

471
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:56,120
 But they finally did become a coalition to both of their benefit because, you know,

472
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,560
 strength in numbers, right?

473
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:02,960
 But another group tried to glom onto them early on in the gay rights struggle and that

474
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,040
 was groups similar to Nambla where it was basically they're like, "You know what?

475
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,040
 We're gay too."

476
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,040
 And everyone's like, "Oh, that's awesome.

477
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,040
 You can help in this fight."

478
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,840
 Yeah, we're gay with little boys.

479
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,040
 And it didn't take long.

480
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:20,960
 It took a matter of seconds, actually, for the gay rights organizations to be like, "You

481
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,960
 can't.

482
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,960
 You're not part of this.

483
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,120
 Like that's totally different than what we're looking at.

484
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,440
 That's 100% different.

485
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,560
 We're not going to do that."

486
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:32,800
 But they've tried warming their way into the sexual rights organizations and the sexual

487
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,720
 rights like freedoms, protestants like that for a while.

488
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:43,080
 So Nambla as a group has existed, I think, since the 70s or 80s.

489
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,120
 I haven't done any research on them in particular.

490
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,280
 It's just kind of the knowledge that I've gained about them over the years.

491
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:52,720
 I don't want to type Nambla into Google over and over again like I had to do just to start

492
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,720
 the story.

493
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,600
 But so I went in with the assumption that maybe somebody shot up a Nambla meeting.

494
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,800
 As much as I despise their ideology, I don't think anyone should go in and shoot them up,

495
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,680
 but I didn't find any record of that.

496
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:09,200
 And then I thought maybe it's doing something where they're encouraging shootings, which

497
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,200
 would fall a little more in line.

498
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:19,720
 You know, there's basically this sexual ladder that people tend to descend over time.

499
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,480
 I was talking to one of my bosses at one of my jobs.

500
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,480
 We were talking about porn and he goes, "Yeah, you know, it's weird how nobody like..."

501
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:32,240
 He goes, "It's weird how you start off just watching normal stuff."

502
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,080
 And then I said, "Yeah, I go, "Nobody starts off with trap porn."

503
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:42,160
 I'm sure some people do, but most guys are like, "Ooh, big boobs."

504
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,480
 And they watch that for a couple months or a year or whatever and then over time now

505
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:52,480
 they're watching hardcore BDSM or they start to find their fetishes.

506
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,440
 They have to find new things to arouse them because they're not getting aroused from just

507
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,200
 big boobs anymore.

508
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:04,200
 And so it wouldn't completely shock me if all of a sudden it came out that pedophiles

509
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,520
 also were equally disgusting in other areas of society.

510
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:14,240
 And that if there were pedophiles who got off on kids being killed or mass shootings

511
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,640
 and things like that.

512
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,920
 And so I kind of started an approach from that level.

513
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,760
 And you go, "Well, Jason, that's an extreme jump."

514
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,400
 But I have something to back that up.

515
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,160
 And I'm going to go over this real quick because the last time I recorded this it was like

516
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:29,360
 20 minutes long and I just read a bunch of facts and it just didn't work.

517
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,280
 So I'm going to go over these relatively quickly.

518
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,440
 The big one to support this evidence is Adam Lanza.

519
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,520
 Now Adam Lanza is the dude who went and shot up Sandy Hook.

520
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,720
 Yes, Sandy Hook actually happened.

521
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,520
 Adam Lanza was most likely the perpetrator.

522
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,520
 The event 100% happened.

523
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,520
 Kids were killed there.

524
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,720
 The fact that we have to debate that to me is ridiculous.

525
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,120
 Whether or not Adam Lanza was the shooter, I believe he was the shooter.

526
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,080
 But you could argue with me on that.

527
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,680
 But for the sake of this, Adam Lanza, he did go, he killed his mom.

528
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,960
 Yeah, that doesn't make sense.

529
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,720
 If everyone thinks it was like a hit job, why would they go to his house and kill his

530
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,440
 mom first and then fake the whole thing?

531
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,080
 Anyways, so Adam Lanza was the dude who walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School and shot

532
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,080
 it up.

533
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,600
 It wasn't the first elementary school shooting.

534
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,760
 It's just the most recent and it had quite a high body count.

535
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,960
 And what it came out afterwards was he tried destroying his hard drive, but he wasn't able

536
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,960
 to completely destroy it.

537
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,760
 We were able to recover some documents and not only on his hard drive, but around his

538
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,760
 house.

539
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:36,320
 He definitely had an interest in the rights of pedophilia and advocating for pedophiles

540
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,840
 to have rights.

541
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,160
 It's hard to draw the concrete conclusion that he was 100% a pedophile.

542
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:47,240
 They didn't find any child porn in his home, but they did find a script called Love Bound.

543
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,000
 I couldn't tell whether or not he wrote it or someone else wrote it, but they did find

544
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 a script called Love Bound.

545
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,120
 It is the story of a 30-year-old man and a 10-year-old boy.

546
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:01,280
 People that he spoke to online said that he did what he talked about and he would advocate

547
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,400
 like, you know, pedophilia is not evil.

548
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,720
 It's just a sickness and it's something that needs to be treated.

549
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,120
 Again, there's no concrete proof that he was a pedophile, but it is interesting because

550
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,960
 he did once tell somebody.

551
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,200
 He thought that and when he was talking about this, no one really took it seriously because

552
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,840
 it was just a big weirdo, but he made the comment that if you killed the children, it would

553
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:30,360
 actually save them and help them escape the brainwashing and harmful influences from adults.

554
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,600
 One of the key things that we see in pedophiles, I told you this is not a very funny episode,

555
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:42,600
 but one of the key things we see in pedophiles is they want to retard or completely stop

556
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,400
 a child's development.

557
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,600
 Like you fall in love with an 8-year-old, we as realistic humans are going to go, "Dude,

558
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,840
 you know in like 10 years she's going to be 18."

559
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:57,080
 But they want to stop that mental development because they look at 18-year-olds and they're

560
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,680
 like, "Look at all these thoughts running around.

561
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,000
 Look at all these women corrupted.

562
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 Look at all this stuff."

563
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,720
 They want to keep them in that childlike state.

564
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,320
 Now, obviously that's pretty much impossible, so they keep going from kid to kid to kid.

565
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,240
 So he's saying, you know, we don't want them brainwashed.

566
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,400
 We don't want these kids becoming, you know, horrible members of society or looking down

567
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,040
 on me because I'm a big old weird looking nerd and all that stuff.

568
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,440
 Let's just shoot him.

569
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,120
 It's weird.

570
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,880
 It's a weird connection.

571
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,400
 But again, it's not concrete proof that he's a pedophile, but we can start to draw conclusions

572
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:33,000
 from his weirdo behavior and the weirdo behavior of other people.

573
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,480
 Cho Sung Hoi, and I don't care if I mispronounce his name because he's a total asshole, he

574
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,920
 was the guy who shot at Virginia Tech.

575
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:42,880
 His hard drive was completely missing and he'd go, "Well, maybe he just wanted to hide

576
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,880
 some stuff."

577
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,360
 He made public videos talking about his plan.

578
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:51,480
 So if the only thing on his hard drive wore his plans, then they would have just added

579
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,880
 to his power level.

580
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,080
 But if he had a bunch of child porn on there, it would actually decrease him.

581
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,760
 He's no longer the bad boy with the fight against the world.

582
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,120
 He's a big old pervert.

583
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,560
 So it's possible that he had child porn on.

584
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,040
 It can't prove it, but again, we're going to keep going here.

585
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,640
 Same thing with Steven Paddock, the dude who shot at Vegas.

586
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,120
 We're moving out of school shootings now, but he's the guy who shot all those people

587
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,120
 in Vegas.

588
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,120
 His hard drives were missing.

589
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,880
 It's a good time giving him a motive for that.

590
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,720
 But a prostitute did come forward and say that when I was with him, he wanted me to

591
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,800
 dress up as a preteen girl in a private school girl uniform.

592
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,840
 So short skirt above the knee, knee-high socks, little button-down shirt.

593
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:34,120
 And he would talk about how I was a virgin while their role playing, having sex, how

594
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:39,520
 I was a virgin, how that was the first dick I had ever seen, and all sorts of stuff.

595
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,800
 So he's definitely living out these preteen fantasies.

596
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,960
 Suddenly we had a guy, and this is totally alleged because he has not been convicted

597
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,960
 of this at all.

598
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,960
 But there was a guy named Randall Drake.

599
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,080
 The police were actually investigating him for distributing child pornography.

600
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,360
 That's how he got on the radar.

601
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,040
 They come to the house.

602
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,360
 They see a locked closet.

603
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,920
 They go, "That must be where the child porn is."

604
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,920
 They break the lock.

605
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,040
 They found a ton of weapons, pipe bombs.

606
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:07,680
 They found Google Earth maps of local schools, a Google Earth map of like a water refinery,

607
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,360
 and a letter talking about how the world needs to burn.

608
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,760
 Everyone's so evil to me, blah, blah, blah.

609
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:17,520
 Now they haven't located the child porn yet, but again, it's an interesting connection.

610
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,520
 He's locked up right now.

611
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,520
 I think they have him on a 50-150 hold because they just don't know.

612
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,720
 Or they charge him with just building the pipe bombs or something like that.

613
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,880
 But you have all--oh, and Steven Paddock's brother was arrested for child porn, and that

614
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,000
 was a whole weird story.

615
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,640
 He actually got released.

616
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,520
 Even though they found him with child porn, they released him because they said, "Oh,

617
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,520
 there's no witnesses.

618
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,520
 We'll testify against you."

619
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,640
 What about the cops who walked in the room with all the child porn?

620
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:44,600
 Anyways, they released him, and then another agency arrested him again and said, "No,

621
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,240
 we'll charge him with the child porn."

622
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,680
 So we have this thread and just these four links of this child porn being linked through.

623
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,760
 Is it possible that there is a connection between the two?

624
00:33:53,760 --> 00:34:00,200
 Again, I will go towards that idea that these people--I would say yes, other than Randall

625
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,960
 Drake, which hasn't been convicted yet, so we'll put him back in the box.

626
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:10,160
 Steven Paddock, Cho Sung Hoi, Adam Lanza, I'd say very likely that they had child pornography

627
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,680
 on their computers.

628
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:18,800
 So the question is, is there actually a link between the consumption of child pornography,

629
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,120
 being a pedophile, and being a mass shooter?

630
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:25,240
 I don't think that every child molester is a mass shooter, but I think you might find

631
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:30,360
 the odds of being mass shooters are more likely to be pedophiles or have child porn.

632
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,920
 And I would say that if you're already nutty enough to go and shoot up a whole group of

633
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,840
 people for absolutely no reason other than whatever stuff is wrong in your head, click

634
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:45,480
 in a link on a dark web website full of child porn, which should be the least of your worries.

635
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,480
 And I think it's something that one thing may lead into the other.

636
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:55,600
 Because again, when you're killing someone, that person is now frozen as a young person

637
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,200
 in their photo forever.

638
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,800
 You're locking them in to that age group that you like, that photo forever.

639
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,960
 It's never going to go away.

640
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,960
 You keep them forever young, just the way that a pedophile would want it.

641
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:15,240
 So I mean, I think if somebody out there listening to the show is a research psychologist and

642
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:20,040
 you're listening to it to figure me out, this might be a good dissertation to actually go

643
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:25,000
 through and really dig in to the people who are still alive.

644
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 The shooters are still alive.

645
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 You could really aggressively ask them if they're pedophiles.

646
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,520
 I don't know.

647
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:34,880
 But go through the victim numbers and find the ages of the victims and see how they correlate

648
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,400
 and all of this stuff.

649
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,440
 It wouldn't shock me.

650
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,920
 It just wouldn't shock me, unfortunately.

651
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,560
 But I wanted to kind of cover that story for you because I thought it was just kind of

652
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,120
 a weird blip on the conspiracy iceberg.

653
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,920
 Like it's just two words strung together.

654
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,880
 Was it part of the word "soup"?

655
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,920
 Or was it actually a hint to a bigger problem that we don't know about?

656
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,240
 We always talk about bullying with school shootings.

657
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,440
 We always talk about anti-anxiety medicine with school shootings.

658
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,040
 But is there something else we need to look at?

659
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,960
 Are school shootings linked to pedophiles and child molestation?

660
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:15,200
 And this is something we should look at as it seems that both of those lifestyles are

661
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,920
 starting to be a little more accepted in our world.

662
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,920
 That's not a good thing.

663
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,160
 It's not a good thing.

664
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,760
