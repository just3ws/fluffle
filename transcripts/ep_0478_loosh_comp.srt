1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 When vigilanteism goes wrong, it really goes wrong.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 And then we take a look at the Bazaar theory that humans are simply cattle,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 being cultivated to be eaten by some sort of shape-shifting demonic entity.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Or the only reason why we're here on Earth is to give our overlords some of that sweet, sweet loosh today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 [Music]

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 [Drums]

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 That's our breaking news segment. I'm adding this to the beginning of this episode, because we had some breaking news.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Gilein Maxwell got arrested on sex abuse charges. If you don't know, Gilein Maxwell is basically the second in command of the Epstein, allegedly, was a close personal confidant of the Jeffrey Epstein Empire.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 And he killed himself. Long pause there. He killed himself back in 2019.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 It's funny, I was having this discussion with someone the other day. I go, "My theory was always this.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 He probably killed himself, but he was probably being threatened to kill himself."

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 He may have killed himself because he didn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 But I don't think someone snuck into the cell and did a little ninja move on him. I think that he did take his own life.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 I just think he was probably forced to. So is that still a murder? Yes, that's still a murder.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 But who knows? And again, that's a small line, whether he took his own life because someone forced him to, or someone came into the cell and made him take his own life, or someone murdered him.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 He still died. Allegedly a very, very horrible man, but still. You don't want anyone to die in a cell like that.

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 You'd like him to face justice. This will be an interesting thing to see what happens with Gilein, obviously.

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Obviously, she has to be under watchful eyes 24 hours a day. Right? Right?

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 There's no way she can have an accident or die. I think people would... The Jeffrey Epstein thing turned a lot of people...

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 I have a lot of friends who are not conspiracy theorists at all. I think the concept of the show is hilarious.

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 They can't believe the stuff that I talk about, and they're like, "Oh no, Jeffrey Epstein definitely... someone murdered him."

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 People who have never been into conspiracy theories before, ever!

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Are totally like, "Oh no, that dude, there was something up with that guy."

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 So if it happens with Gilein... Dude, that would be a huge awakening.

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 And what's interesting is this came on the heels of an insane, probably one of the best posts on X in five, six years maybe?

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 This guy last night on the X board, and I want to give a shout out to the hooded A-hole on Twitter.

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 I'm not going to say it now. I don't... You know, I don't cover this show, but the hooded A-hole sent me this over too,

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 but I was already reading this thread last night on the X board.

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Last night on the X board, a guy wrote "Storytime with a Deadman."

30
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 And it's this write-up saying that he used to work with Jeffrey Epstein, and he's going to kill himself today.

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 But first he's going to mail out these packages to the media and expose what he knows about the Epstein storyline.

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 I read it last... I was up late reading it last night as it was happening.

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 It was probably one of the best posts I've seen on X in five years maybe?

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Since the "Skinwalker" story, honestly, since "Skinwalkers" became a thing.

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 I really don't think it's... There's some inconsistencies in the story time-wise,

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 and the one thing that will make it difficult to cover if I ever do cover it,

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 he names private citizens. He gives out private people's names.

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 And that's basically doxing people.

39
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 And then you have to make a decision as a podcaster, like, do you add to that dox? Right?

40
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 But there's some timeline issues with it. There's some factual things with it.

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 There's some other things with it that I'm suspicious of it.

42
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 But whatever, whether or not it... If it's true, it's absolutely horrifying.

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 If it's not true, other than the little inconsistencies, it's an interesting narrative.

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 It's an interesting look behind the scenes.

45
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 He says that he was working... I'll tell you what my concern is with it,

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 other than naming private citizens, is that he says he worked for them.

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 He worked with Jeffrey Epstein up until he died.

48
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 He worked with them for about eight years is how the narrative starts off.

49
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 But then it turns out like he's disposing of a body in 2011.

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 And Jeffrey Epstein died in 2019.

51
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 So even if he started working at the very big... If he worked for almost eight years,

52
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 so that's less than eight years, that wouldn't mean right when he got started with him,

53
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 he was already dumping bodies and delivering drugs to Rihanna at a concert.

54
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Like, right when he got started. That part of the... When I went back,

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 you're wrapped up in the narrative as you're reading it.

56
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 You're like, "Oh, this is very interesting." Hopefully this isn't true. It's quite tragic.

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 And then to this morning when I woke up and I saw the Aegean Lane news,

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 and people are now saying, "Whoa, this guy is dropping the story,

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 and he's mailing this stuff out of the media, and Elaine gets arrested the next day."

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 But stuff like that. There's issues like that where he says it's eight years.

61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 He'd been working with him for almost eight years, but 2011 would have been eight years,

62
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 and he's already disposing of a body for the Romney family was this thing.

63
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 He goes on the story that... That's the thing.

64
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 You can make claims. You can make... You shouldn't.

65
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 But you can say stuff about Mitt Romney or Donald Trump or John McCain or Jeffrey Epstein

66
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 and G. Lane Maxwell for that matter. They're public figures.

67
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 But he names a member of the Romney family who I can't verify is a member of the Romney family.

68
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Then someone posts the Twitter of this guy.

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 There's Twitter, this Twitter handle, or this dude.

70
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 He only had seven followers, and he followed 53 people.

71
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 It was all photography-related stuff.

72
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 So there was no connection that this account actually was related to the Romney family.

73
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 I couldn't find the Romney family. You see how difficult it is, though,

74
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 because I don't want to name this dude, because at that point I'm doxing this guy.

75
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 I'm doxing this guy.

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 And he names two other people that he said helped to murder a YouTuber,

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 or an independent blogger, or something like that.

78
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 He's saying these people's real names and you have to go, "Is this a legit story?"

79
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 And he's naming these people.

80
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 "Is this a troll?" And he doesn't like people with these similar names,

81
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 because he says what area they're from.

82
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 So it makes it difficult for me to cover, honestly.

83
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Even me linking it in the show notes.

84
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 If they try suing, they could say, "Well, da-da-da."

85
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 So I have to be real careful with that.

86
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 But it was an interesting thread on the export.

87
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 And then you have this thing with Gilean Maxwell happening the next day.

88
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 We'll see where, if anything, comes from this...

89
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 And, you know, another thing with the export is that you never know

90
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 if the first person who posted, or at what point they stopped posting,

91
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 and someone else is filling it in, and stuff like that.

92
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 An interesting story, if it is a lark, if it is just a story,

93
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 it was a fun read.

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 If it's real, it was absolutely tragic.

95
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 The truth may lie somewhere in between.

96
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 But that is where we're at.

97
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 I wanted to go ahead and tell that story for this episode.

98
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 And again, if your more developments pop out, maybe we'll cover the X thing.

99
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 But it's just difficult.

100
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 It's just difficult.

101
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 I will say this, one puzzling aspect to it, and again,

102
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 the thing that made me a little suspicious was,

103
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 he saw a man, just get your kids out of the room for this part,

104
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 but he saw a man, he walks into a shed, a work shed,

105
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 and he sees a man sexually assaulting another man.

106
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 And he can only see the guy's back.

107
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 And he says on the guy's back was a Richard Nixon tattoo.

108
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 And I didn't know who the guy was.

109
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 So then I went and I googled Richard Nixon tattoo,

110
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 and I saw it was Roger Stone.

111
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 What I found interesting about that detail was, you have to have,

112
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 that's another thing that made me very suspicious about the story,

113
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 because, one, you had to have a tattoo that you could google, right?

114
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 If he walked in and he saw it, and I saw a tattoo of like a ying-yang symbol on his back,

115
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 we would, as readers, we would never believe he would know.

116
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 He typed in ying-yang tattoo on back and it brought up a celebrity.

117
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Roger Stone, a huge Republican operative, a close ally to Donald Trump,

118
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 helped get Donald Trump elected.

119
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 Roger Stone having a Richard Nixon tattoo on his back is pretty well known.

120
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Not everyone's going to know it, you may not have known it,

121
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 but when I read that part, I go, "Oh, that's Roger Stone."

122
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 So, and then he says, you know, I googled it later,

123
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 "It would have to be a tattoo that you could google."

124
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 Oh, he had a bird on his arm, sorry, googled bird tattoo on arm,

125
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 and it turned out to be Popeye.

126
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Like, that made it a little weird.

127
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Plus, also, when you're walking into a room and you see a man,

128
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 sexually assaulting another man, so sorry,

129
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 so sorry that I have to go into this detail,

130
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 but you walk into a room, you see a man sexually assaulting another man,

131
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 would you recognize the Richard Nixon tattoo on his back?

132
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Like, you may see a face on his back.

133
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 He's also wearing a bowl mask, a giant bowl head.

134
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 So, when your brain's picking up these things in this room,

135
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 you have this horrible crime taking place,

136
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 you have a naked elderly man, you have a bowl mask,

137
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 but somehow you're able to look at this face on his back

138
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 and recognize it as a President of the United States.

139
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 He recognizes it immediately as Richard Nixon,

140
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 he goes and he googles it and he's able to tell us it's Roger Stone.

141
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 I think, that's another reason why I think the story's not true.

142
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 It's just too great of a narrative there,

143
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 because I don't think you would, I don't want, I don't think you would recognize,

144
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 it's such a shocking act, I don't think you would recognize

145
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 the President's face on this dude's back.

146
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 And it had to be a tattoo that was so memorable that we could understand it.

147
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Again, if it was a tattoo of anything else,

148
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 if it was a giant serpent on his back,

149
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 or a piece of a Kentucky Fried Chicken being held by a goblin,

150
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 if it was just any other tattoo, you never would have been able to Google it.

151
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 So, a very, very convenient story,

152
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 but, again, interesting story nonetheless.

153
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 It's definitely going to be legend.

154
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 The reason why I'm covering it is, it's going to definitely become a legendary story,

155
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 because of the timing of it.

156
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Because of the timing of it.

157
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Story or not, I hope this guy doesn't kill himself.

158
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 I'm leaning towards LARP on it.

159
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 I really am leaning towards LARP on it because of some of these details.

160
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 And a couple other people in the Expo were like,

161
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 "This is real, you'll be able to name the type of phones that Jeffrey Epstein used."

162
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 It's not in any of the police reports,

163
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 but insiders know the type of phones and there is no answer for that.

164
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 So, there are other people kind of pushing back on it.

165
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 Other people, like me, were just kind of engaged in this narrative.

166
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 And then this morning I wake up, I'm doing all my research,

167
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 and then I see that Elaine Maxwell.

168
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Coincidence, most likely, he wasn't even saying that he was going to the feds or anything like that.

169
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 He said he was just going to send out documents to CNN,

170
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 and then the SNBC and Fox News explained,

171
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 that was another interesting thing about it.

172
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 He said that he had these typed up documents he was going to send out,

173
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 but when he was posting on the Expo, it was in chunks.

174
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 So, he could have simply copied and pasted the document he already had created.

175
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 He could have dropped the whole thing in X instead of posting,

176
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 and then saying, "I'm going to go to the liquor store and get some alcohol."

177
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 And then posting and saying, "Oh, you know, I'm sorry, I heard a car outside my house.

178
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 I'm a little scared right now."

179
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 He could have just posted what he had ready to go to CNN, MSNBC.

180
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 So, there's some narrative issues with the story,

181
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 but again, one of the best things I've read on X in five years,

182
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 again, I don't think it's accurate for those reasons,

183
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 and it's an engaging read.

184
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 I don't necessarily say if I was entertained, because it was tragic stuff,

185
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 but it was definitely an interesting read.

186
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Had some details that made you go, "Oh, that might be real," and then had some other details that made you go,

187
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 but anyways, interesting story nonetheless, storytime with a dead man.

188
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 It'll be gone by the time that you listen to this episode,

189
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 probably the way the Expo just kind of disappears stuff,

190
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 but I again don't feel comfortable linking it in the show notes for legal reasons,

191
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 not because I think it's true or it's not true.

192
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 You know, people have already started contacting,

193
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 I noticed one person already friended this guy on Twitter,

194
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 and I don't think that dude knows what's going to happen.

195
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 I don't know if that dude is now going to start getting an onslaught of people asking him about all this stuff.

196
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 So, that is that.

197
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 Today's episode is going to be long because I just recorded this whole intro,

198
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 but I wanted to get this information out to you,

199
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 and I know some of you guys may be upset that I don't link it in the show notes,

200
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 but it's a legal thing, and it will be archived and all this stuff throughout the world,

201
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 but be careful tracking down these people too,

202
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 not like because you're afraid you're going to break into your door,

203
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 but when you're naming private citizens, we've seen this happen before too,

204
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 you're naming private citizens, it's totally different,

205
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 and don't harass them, you know what I mean?

206
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 Fine, if you've got a problem with Romney or Roger Stone or Yelaine, whatever,

207
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 they're public figures, but if you're reading this, just remember that.

208
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 That would be my concern, the people that he's naming,

209
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 because he doesn't name himself, see,

210
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 even though he's going to kill himself when he's sending out these letters,

211
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 people co- if you're going to kill yourself, who are you, what is your name?

212
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 He never names himself, but he doesn't name these other people.

213
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 For all we know, these people could have been his roommates,

214
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 and they burned him on six months lease, we don't know.

215
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 He's dropping them in there, we don't know, we don't know,

216
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 but that is part of the mystery.

217
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 So yeah, this episode is going to be very long because this turned out to be about a ten minute intro.

218
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 Have a great weekend, I wanted to get that out to you guys,

219
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 have a great weekend, and here's the episode.

220
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 [music]

221
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

222
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day,

223
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

224
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Hope you guys are ready for a really cool weekend.

225
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Rain on your nail!

226
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 It's guitar rift.

227
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 This is the first time you've ever listened to this show, that's not normal.

228
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Don't do that all the time, don't be worried.

229
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, SqueezeGod.

230
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 SqueezeGod, thank you so much for supporting the show.

231
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 I don't know if you're saying that you're the God of squeezing, or you want to squeeze God.

232
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 Either way, you support the show, so you get a shout out.

233
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 You'll also be our captain, our pilot, this episode.

234
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

235
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 Just help get the word out about the show, that really, really helps out a lot.

236
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 We have a merch store, and we have the Minecraft server,

237
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 and hopefully by the time you're hearing this episode, it's updated to 1.16.

238
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 So come and join us on the Minecraft server, it's cool.

239
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 We're building like little cities and stuff.

240
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 So Squeeze, let's go ahead and squeeze you into the Jason Jalopy,

241
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 or maybe you can fit in it normally.

242
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 We are leaving behind Hood River, Oregon, and we are headed out to Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

243
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 So we're driving out to Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

244
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 We're going to cover this briefly.

245
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 I think it's a really interesting story though.

246
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 What happened was on this super recent, super recent, on June 21, 2020,

247
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 two girls, a 13 year old and a 15 year old girl, go missing.

248
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 And there's this neighborhood in Wisconsin.

249
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 The articles give the address of the house, which I guess they kind of had to do.

250
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 I'm not going to do it.

251
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 But there was a house in this neighborhood in Milwaukee.

252
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 The neighbors go, "Oh, we saw Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer."

253
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 They're talking about cops.

254
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 They're not talking to Richard Geer walking down the street.

255
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 It's an old reference.

256
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Anyways, anyways, Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer, and the cop pulls over there like,

257
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 "We know where the girls are. There's two missing girls. We saw them go into this house."

258
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 So the cops go, knock on the door, "Do you have any missing girls here?"

259
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 And then I just imagine the owner of the house looks like a wolf in human clothing

260
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 and being like, "No, I do not. Good sir. Do not check my house."

261
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 But I guarantee I have no runaways or kidnapped girls here.

262
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 The cops go like, "Okay." And they leave.

263
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 Now this happens actually a couple of times.

264
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 The cop, they keep getting these calls, go to this house.

265
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 They keep showing up at the house, but really without probable cause,

266
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 they can't go into the house.

267
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 And the person's not letting them in.

268
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 As far as that's what it seemed like the articles were showing,

269
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 they went missing on June 21st.

270
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 On June 22nd, the cops are going to the house multiple times that day,

271
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 each time leaving empty handed.

272
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Each time you see a wolf-shaped silhouette go, "Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha!"

273
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 behind the curtains of the house.

274
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 But on June 23rd, the neighborhood's like, "No, we're not going to deal with this,

275
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 not by the hair of our chinny-chin-chin."

276
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 They basically lay siege to the house.

277
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 They had a bunch of vigilantes, mob justice,

278
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 surrounds the house and they're like, "Hey, let the girls out."

279
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 The wolf at this point is like, "Ugh!"

280
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 "Let the girls out, we know the girls are in there, we saw the girls go in."

281
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 And the person in the house is like, "Absolutely not, I'm pretty sure."

282
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 "I'm pretty sure, I hope he has a better answer than that."

283
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 He's like, "Um, what girls? I have these girls that aren't mine."

284
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 But no, he was like, "No, I don't have any girls here."

285
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 Well, you're surrounded by vigilantes.

286
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 The cops show up again.

287
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 And I don't know who called the cops at this point, the vigilantes or the guy in the house.

288
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 The cops show up again and this time there's cops in the house, they're searching the house.

289
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 There's cops outside the house, holding back the vigilantes.

290
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 That's about 10, 11 in the morning.

291
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 By the afternoon, hundreds of people in the area have shown up.

292
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 It's all over Twitter and Instagram.

293
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 There's one guy, he livestreamed it, Frank Nitty.

294
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 He's a community organizer, he livestreamed it.

295
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 I think it was like two hours long, the livestream.

296
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 People are coming from all over.

297
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Someone drives by, "Pop, pop, pop, pop!"

298
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 Opens fire into the crowd. People are panicking.

299
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 The cops are holding the people back.

300
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 People want to get in the house, they start tussling with the cops.

301
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 You have investigators trying to control the crime scene.

302
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Someone runs out of the house down the street.

303
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 Chaos. It's absolute chaos here.

304
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 But then something happens.

305
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Something very, very important happens to this story.

306
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 A fire breaks out in the back of the house and a van that was parked outside the house.

307
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 You have a car burn and a part of the house burns.

308
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 And Frank Nitty goes, "Guys, you're burning evidence.

309
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 You're destroying evidence."

310
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 That was a bad move.

311
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 Nine girls in total had gone missing.

312
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 It was the two girls that they saw go into this house.

313
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 But in this area, nine girls in total are missing.

314
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 By the end of this event, three of the girls are found, not in this house.

315
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Again, not that I could tell. It seems like they were found in other locations.

316
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 It doesn't mean this house had nothing to do with it,

317
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 but it definitely doesn't mean the house did have something to do with it.

318
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 But one of the rooms in the back of the house is burned.

319
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 One of the vans parked by the house is burned.

320
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Frank Nitty goes, "This is counterproductive."

321
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 And then there's an interesting quote.

322
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 I was reading the article in the Urban Milwaukee,

323
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 the Urban Milwaukee website had this article,

324
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 "Suspected sex trafficking house burned."

325
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 It was by Jeremy Jane.

326
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Here's this quote.

327
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 So Frank Nitty is talking to Sergeant Todd Smolin.

328
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Police Sergeant Todd Smolin.

329
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 And Todd Smolin says to Frank Nitty,

330
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 "I'm telling you you're being used."

331
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 "I'm telling you you're being used."

332
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 I think that's an interesting quote.

333
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 Because the way that I read this

334
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 and the way it was kind of presented in the articles was that

335
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 the vigilantes set fire to the house because they were so enraged

336
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 that the cops weren't doing anything.

337
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 And that was definitely part of it.

338
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Girls are missing in the area.

339
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 You feel like the cops can't do anything about it.

340
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 The cops, as far as they're concerned, are following the rules.

341
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 And they didn't consider the girls, quote, "high risk,"

342
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 which generally means they're at risk of injury.

343
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 They have some sort of mental deficiency and stuff like that.

344
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 And you'll think of Jason, they're 13 or 15 years old.

345
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 Of course they're high risk.

346
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Generally, the cops probably thought they were at their boyfriends' house

347
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 or something like that.

348
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 But you have a community that's really upset

349
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 because multiple phone calls saying these young girls

350
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 and others had been in and out of this house.

351
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 The police, their hands are tied, they can't kick down doors

352
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 and go, "Where's your kids?"

353
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 I mean, they can.

354
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 But then there's all sorts of other cases get thrown out by judges and stuff.

355
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 So everyone is doing what they feel is the right thing to do.

356
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 And then a crime scene starts burning, a van starts burning.

357
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 I was reading this article and I thought the mob of vigilantes did not set that fire.

358
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 I'm telling you, you're being used.

359
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Somebody, this is my theory, some that I don't want to say that that house was involved in sex trafficking

360
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 because I don't legally know.

361
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 But let's put on our conspiracy caps and say that that's what the case is here.

362
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 We'll agree with the mob in this case.

363
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 With our conspiracy caps firmly on, it would be very easy for me to have one of my associates

364
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 sneak in with the mob and start burning evidence.

365
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 And it would look like the mob did it.

366
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 It would look like it was just an-- it looks like it was just vigilante justice.

367
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 But in reality, I know where there are school ID cards.

368
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 I know where there are things that can tie me to other missing people.

369
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 I'm going to burn this location down, burn this room down, burn the van down

370
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 where I'd been transporting these people, and then sneak off into the crowds of hundreds of people.

371
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 All allegedly conspiracy cap firmly on the police as far as I've read in these articles, suspected sex trafficking.

372
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 There's no proof.

373
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 No one's been taken to jail as of now, not even the vigilante group.

374
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 But quote, I'm telling you, you're being used.

375
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 That's a very interesting comment coming from the police sergeant.

376
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 Is it possible that they did have an ongoing investigation into this house and this prompted them to jump the gun?

377
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 And now they are able to destroy the evidence?

378
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 This other group of people? Who knows? Who knows?

379
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 Vigilanteism is really cool when it's done for the right reasons.

380
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 And as long as you do it-- I guess part of being a vigilante is not having a book.

381
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 You can't do it by the book, but you do have to think long term.

382
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 I cover a lot of vigilantes on this show.

383
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 I think it's a very, very interesting topic.

384
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 But sometimes this can happen too, and you can have third parties come in and use that chaos to their advantage.

385
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 So interesting story.

386
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 Squeeze God, thanks for driving us out here to Milwaukee.

387
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 You know what?

388
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 Let's, before we go anywhere else, let's drive to the local library.

389
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 Because I found this thing.

390
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 We're going to take a look at it.

391
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 You guys are like, great.

392
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 So we go to the Milwaukee library.

393
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 I'm sure there's a giant one in the middle of the city.

394
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 We're going to walk around.

395
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 Hello? Hello? Hello?

396
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 Is anyone there?

397
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Empty library is your spooky.

398
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 But we're walking around the spooky library because I'm going to show you a--

399
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 I'm going to show you a grammar trick.

400
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 Don't shut it off.

401
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 This will change your day.

402
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 This will blow your mind, maybe, or you can just skip ahead 30 seconds.

403
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 What do all of these--

404
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 What do all of these words-- Squeeze God is just tapping his watch.

405
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 He's still in the Jason Jalopy.

406
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 He didn't even come into the library with this.

407
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 What do all of these words have in common?

408
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Yeah, we're doing this.

409
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 Flip-flop.

410
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Tick-tock.

411
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Ping-pong.

412
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Hold on.

413
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 Dilly-dally.

414
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 Hip-hop.

415
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 King Kong.

416
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 All these words have this thing called--

417
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 It's so funny because I can't pronounce this.

418
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 But it's called ablout reduplication.

419
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Ablout reduplication.

420
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 So this is weird.

421
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 It's one of those weird grammar rules.

422
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 We covered something like this before, like the order of adjectives.

423
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 And what's funny is a lot of people from--

424
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 There's a thing about order of adjectives in the English language.

425
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 They're in a specific order.

426
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 And a lot of people from other countries who listened to the show

427
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 emailed me, messaged me on YouTube, and said,

428
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 "We were taught that in school.

429
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 "Native English speakers aren't taught the rule.

430
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 "It's just something we pick up.

431
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 "But there's people from all over the world listening to the show."

432
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 And they go, "We were taught that.

433
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 "We were taught the order of adjectives."

434
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 It's some-- Yeah, we were never taught this.

435
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 But this is something called ablout reduplication.

436
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 Nobody knows why this is a grammar rule.

437
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 It's a conspiracy.

438
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 So it fits.

439
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 It fits the theme of the show.

440
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Nobody knows is the illuminati behind it.

441
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 It is-- Do you repeat a word with a modified vowel?

442
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 That's kind of the rule here.

443
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 So if the first word has an i, the next word will have an a.

444
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Or an o.

445
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 And if there's three of them, it'll go i-a-o.

446
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 So ding dong.

447
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 It'll never be dong ding.

448
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Or ding dang.

449
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 It'll never be dang ding.

450
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 I made that up.

451
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 It's not even a real thing, but chit chat, crisscross, zigzag.

452
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 It will-- You can't think about it.

453
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 Dong ding.

454
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 What?

455
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Flop flip.

456
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Are you going to wear your flop flips?

457
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 People-- It sounds weird.

458
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 And they don't know why.

459
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 They think it has something to do with the physics of sound.

460
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 Because hip goes up and hop goes down.

461
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 So like, if you go hip hip, hooray.

462
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 It won't be hooray.

463
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 Wait, what?

464
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Hooray.

465
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Wait, what?

466
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 Hip hip, hooray.

467
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 Hooray, hip hip.

468
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 See, it doesn't work.

469
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 But what if you go hip hip, hooray, hip hip, hooray, hip hip.

470
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 Hip hip, hooray.

471
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 I guess that stops.

472
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 Hip hip, hooray, hip hip, hooray.

473
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Now everyone's sitting in the Jays to Jalopy tapping their watch.

474
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 I'm almost done, guys.

475
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 But isn't that weird?

476
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 I put away the big grammar book.

477
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 It's weird.

478
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Again, that might be something they teach in other countries when they're learning English.

479
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 But I would have never thought that you can't just do cross-cris apple piss.

480
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 It's always going to be criss-cross applesauce.

481
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 Plus apple piss doesn't exist.

482
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 Ooh, that rhymes.

483
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 I'm just going to have that down and punch that down in my freestyle book.

484
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 I'm going to use that someday.

485
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 Yeah, so anyways, there's that grammar rule.

486
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 Weird grammar rule number two.

487
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 That's what that was written in my notes as.

488
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 And I'll let you guys know, I do not have a weird grammar rule number three.

489
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 So we've done the two.

490
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 So if you guys like this segment, that's all I got.

491
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 I'm sorry.

492
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 Okay, we're ready.

493
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 I put the book away.

494
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 I actually put the book in my back pocket.

495
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 I'm going to look for another weird grammar rule.

496
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 Squeeze God, let's hop in the one, the only, Carpentercopter.

497
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 Hey guys, if you haven't supported the Patreon yet, I'm going to be revealing.

498
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 I got more of these stickers to send out.

499
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 Hopefully by the time this episode airs, because I'm recording them in advance,

500
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 because I'm going on vacation soon, everyone will have their sticker.

501
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 But pretty soon I'm going to reveal the design of this Patreon sticker.

502
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 It's dope.

503
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 I'm getting a lot of emails from people who've gotten it.

504
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 They want to keep it as a surprise as long as possible, but Carpentercopter is a hint for what the sticker is.

505
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 Let's go ahead and hop in that beautiful Carpentercopter and squeeze God.

506
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 I want you to take us up, up and away.

507
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 That's I own that.

508
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 No one else came up with that.

509
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 Don't sue me DC Comics.

510
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 Let's go away up and up.

511
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 We are going to fly out to the Monroe Institute.

512
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 Let's say, non-descript building.

513
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 The Monroe Institute actually borders on the realm of the real and the unreal.

514
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 This was a request from Dogbirth on YouTube.

515
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Thank you very much, Dogbirth.

516
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 This was an interesting topic.

517
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 I hadn't come across, I think I had come across this in passing,

518
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 but it's interesting to take a deeper look at this.

519
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 We're going to land at the Monroe Institute and we're wearing our white doctors coats, our lab coats.

520
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 We walk in, we pass our security cards over the thing, beep, beep, and we go and pssshhhh.

521
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 Doors open up.

522
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 The Monroe Institute was started by a guy named Robert Monroe.

523
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 He wanted to work on learning while you're asleep.

524
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 He wanted to build this program, this learning thing, technique teaching is what they normally call it.

525
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 So you can be taught while you're sleeping.

526
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 That would be cool.

527
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 Very matrixy.

528
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 But while he's working on that, he actually begins using all of his equipment and fancy doodads, not dad-dos.

529
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 He realizes that joke's done.

530
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 He realizes that he can leave his body.

531
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 See, right before he's falling asleep, right before he loses consciousness, he would feel his soul float out of his body.

532
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 He was able to astrally project his spirit and float around and he would fly around dimensions.

533
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 Now, do I find it suspicious that this is, that he's able to travel beyond the realm of the real while he's sleeping or, quote, "almost sleeping"?

534
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 I mean, last night I had a dream.

535
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 I was Dean Winchester and I was fighting an impossible demon.

536
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 I was half awake towards the end of the dream, but I would never confuse that with reality.

537
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 But that first thought should give you an idea of what I think of a lot of the stories.

538
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 So if you're a fan of Robert Monroe, you may want to shut the podcast off.

539
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 But there's a little suspicious, right?

540
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 That's a little suspicious.

541
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 I'm able to do, I'm able to travel to this amazing world where I'm married to my high school sweetheart and all my kids are totally awesome,

542
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 but only when I'm, only when I'm, quote, "almost asleep", which most of us really, that's your sleep.

543
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 But anyways, he invents this way to astraly project.

544
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 He's also seems to be, okay, he's also the innovator behind like, binaural beats, bior, bior, anyways, those beats that like, are supposed to get you high.

545
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 That was like the most TLDR version of, it's basically supposed to present, it's supposed to put off these sound waves, like one in one ear and one in the other.

546
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 And you're like, "Isn't that normal headphones?"

547
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 No, no, no, it does it at different wavelengths.

548
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 The right amount is supposed to get you high.

549
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 You can buy them online and it'll be like, do this one if you want to like know what ecstasy is like.

550
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 I think, in my opinion, that there's no scientific proof to back it up.

551
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 That if I put a pair of headphones on you and I tell you these will simulate the feeling of cocaine, there is a higher chance if you believe in the technology that you will get euphoria from listening to that.

552
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 And if I put in, "Lynne," and said, "Steal my sunshine," will give you the equivalent of taking ecstasy and you had never heard that song before.

553
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 You didn't hear, you didn't know how good that song was, even without the ecstasy.

554
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 And you listen to that song, but a researcher or a pamphlet that written in very scientific terms told you it would make it feel like it was ecstasy, then you may feel like it was in ecstasy, right?

555
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 And to be fair, a lot of medicine can be considered placebo medicine, but you have an anti-inflammatory.

556
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 It either anti-inflames your muscles or doesn't.

557
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 And it may not work on a small amount of people and it may give a small amount of people an allergic reaction, but for the most part, steady after steady, it actually de-inflames or anti-inflames your muscles.

558
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 By Narl Beatz, and the fact that I can't pronounce it doesn't mean that I can't die trash about it.

559
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 And I've tried it. I mean, that's something that I actually looked into before.

560
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 It's like, "Oh yeah, I want to simulate this stuff and I had good quality headphones."

561
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 Maybe I'm in the super small percentage I want to work on, but again, it's not something that science will back up or that really any long-term studies will back up.

562
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 But he does that stuff. He came up with that stuff. I don't know if he invented it, but that was a big part of his process.

563
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 And you can pay $1,200 to go to one of these seminars at the Monroe Institute and go into this long thing.

564
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 And we'll actually cover a bit more about the Monroe Institute in a Monday's episode, because I got a whole other story about the Institute itself.

565
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 Very, very interesting story. But for now, we've talked about Robert Monroe.

566
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 We're going to take off our lampcoats and now we're wearing like this sleek, shiny armor.

567
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 It's like suits, like those suits from Pacific Rim. And we are going to go into the realm, the astral realm.

568
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 We're flying around. There's like rainbow colors coming all around us and stuff like that.

569
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 Squeeze God, no! He gets lost in the void. Well, that's okay. As long as I get his paycheck on money, he'll be fine.

570
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 And so we're flying through the astral realm and we land in a void.

571
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 But this isn't just any normal void. This isn't any normal pitch black darkness.

572
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 And there's Squeeze God. He showed back up. I knew he would. I had faith in him all along.

573
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 This one, we see like this monster there, right? Whatever monster, whatever boogie man you picture.

574
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 I picture these guys. This is how I picture these guys. I picture these guys.

575
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 They're like bird people, like big old beak monster man. And then they have like gold cloaks on.

576
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 Like something from the dark crystal, but they're all yellow. And then they got gold cloaks.

577
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 I don't know. They're not really good at clashing. They're not really good at color coordinating.

578
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 That would be like a human wearing flesh colored jacket. That's what they look like.

579
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 These, and I don't know why I think of them like that, but these things are known as archons. Archons? Archons?

580
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 One of the two. It doesn't matter. They don't exist. So anyways, these things, these dark entities sit on the edge of the universe.

581
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 They're in this void and we're floating in our suits. Now we're wearing our suits to protect ourselves from these non-existent creatures.

582
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 But in the course of these story, they're real. And it's not just one of these archons. We see a bunch of them.

583
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 And they're just sitting in the void and they're kind of like, yes, here it comes guys.

584
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 Oh yes, yes, the darkness will finally be filled. Finally, we will have our revenge.

585
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 And then we're like, what? We're kind of looking kind of just standing there.

586
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 We're invisible to these guys as well. Just again, for a sake of the story, these imaginary creatures may get us.

587
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 And they're sitting in this void and we see a little light coming from Earth.

588
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 We see this light traveling through the astral void. It's getting bigger and bigger.

589
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 And we could tell the archons are getting, or the archons, here, every pronounce it.

590
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 The archons are getting more and more like they're salivating now.

591
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 And we see this light getting bigger and bigger. And it's like a Honda Accord, right?

592
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 It's this car that's driving the... We're like, what? That's kind of weird.

593
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 The archons are like, oh yeah, oh yeah. And the Honda Accord gets bigger.

594
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 And we see there's a little sign on the top of it. And it says, "Lush Delivery Service."

595
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 You're like, what? I'm like, hold on, hold on. It'll get closer.

596
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 This Honda Accord traveling through the astral realm, parks in front of the archons and the door opens up and some dude, some 19-year-old kid gets out.

597
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 And he's holding a big box of steaming lush. And then he takes it to the archons and goes,

598
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 "That'll be 495, please, 495 dimensional lifetimes, please."

599
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 And the archons allow him to reincarnate for another 495 lifetimes.

600
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 And they're just, while the one's having to pay him, everyone else is just...

601
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 "Oh yeah, yeah." ...eating the lush. The archons cannot get enough of that sweet, sweet lush.

602
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 So what is lush? Lush? So Robert Monroe, while he was floating around, while he was dreaming, really, right?

603
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 While he was dreaming. He was floating around in the void. He meets this being of light.

604
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 That tells him this story. It basically goes, listen, there are these crea...

605
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 Basically, this story I just told you, except for the Honda Accord.

606
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 They're outside of the universe. There are these creatures known as archons.

607
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 And they feed off human misery. They feed off human souls. All of our energy is called lush.

608
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 But the more misery we go through and the more chaotic stuff we go through makes the lush far more delicious.

609
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 So they actually cause evil and cause wars and chaos and stuff like that.

610
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 So by the time we die, they got that sweet, sweet lush, baby.

611
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 Eat it up like spaghetti noodles. So, apparently, this part I can't really make fun of, because this part's sad.

612
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 Robert Monroe, when he came across this belief, what happened was after Robert Monroe had this vision, dream, however you want to say it, dream,

613
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 he went into a horrible depression because, as I'm laughing, he went into a horrible depression because he goes,

614
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 "What's the point of living if when I die, some being's just going to eat me?"

615
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 Eat my soul and everything like that. And what's the point of existing if all of life is aimed towards misery just to make me more delicious?

616
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 A lot of people believe this. A lot of people believe this. Yesterday I was talking about 2028, man.

617
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 And I was like, "How does this guy get 134,000 followers? How do people fall for this so quickly?"

618
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 It's because people want to believe. They want to believe. We really want to believe that this stuff is true.

619
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 2028, man, whatever. He wants to talk about, he obviously scared a bunch of people. He ended up doing an apology video.

620
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 He was like, "Hey, to any kids that I scared, I didn't mean to scare you. We can change it by being more gentle."

621
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 This stuff scares people. I'm not saying that you can't tell scary stories, because obviously there are scary things,

622
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 but there's a difference between me going, "Hey, dude, watch out, don't fall off that cliff!"

623
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 Rather than me going, "Well, if I say, "Watch out!" that might scare him. I'm going to let him fall off the cliff."

624
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 Right before I fell asleep, I had a vision of a white light telling me that all life is meaningless,

625
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 and I'm going to share that with you guys, saying it's true. And a lot of people believe this.

626
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 Like I said, people pay a lot of money, go to the Monroe Institute and things like that.

627
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 A lot of people believe all sorts of stuff. You can go, "Jason, you've talked a lot about your faith as being a Southern Baptist.

628
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 That's just equally ridiculous." That's totally fine too. That's totally fine too.

629
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 But, I mean, you know, the most major religions, they kind of have a happy ending at the end, right?

630
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 It's not that if you do everything right, you're eventually going to be devoured by God.

631
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 He's just going to swallow you up like you're a, whatchamacallit bar.

632
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 Like the end, most religions at the end, there's hope. There's hope.

633
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 In this version, there's no hope. You just get gobbled up.

634
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 Now, I have two ways to look at this. Three ways to look at this.

635
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 One is, I don't believe it. I don't believe it. But let's say I did. Let's say I did believe it.

636
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 That in the end, some dimensional creature gobbles me up.

637
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 When I read that, I thought, "That's what we do, right?"

638
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 And it doesn't mean the pig's life was worthless.

639
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 Like, I wouldn't necessarily, like, sure, if a pig had a choice between getting turned into bacon and me eating it,

640
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 or getting turned into a bacon and Paul Pot eating it, I don't think the pig's going to be like, "Yeah, it doesn't matter."

641
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 Like, I would want my energy not to go to some sort of interdimensional tyrant.

642
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 But, if that was the end, that's what we do, right? Every leaf we consume, except for poison ivy, something eats that, right?

643
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 Everything's consumed on some level, and it doesn't mean that the fact that I'm eating the pig or the cow or whatever

644
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 doesn't mean that its life was worthless, that its existence was worthless. Its existence carried on through me.

645
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 But, Jason, you're not eating the pig's soul. Let's say I was consuming the pig's soul, right? I'm straight up a death eater.

646
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 So, it doesn't mean that the pig's life was worthless.

647
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,000
 Let's look at a quote from one of the believers of this. There's a author named Bronte Baxter.

648
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:58,000
 And they wrote this, um, they have this blog. This is from "Bloying the Whistle Chapter 5." Can you believe it?

649
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 "Bloying the Whistle Chapter 5, Tracking the Crack in the Universe." The universe is built on, so here's this quote,

650
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 and really the thesis is the universe is built on killing and eating. Here's this quote,

651
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 "The other day I grabbed an onion from a basket to chop up, and I saw it had sprouted a beautiful, tender, light green shoot.

652
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 It had life inside it, a consciousness that wanted to take root, breathe air and thrive.

653
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 Any tears in chopping that onion did not come from the fumes."

654
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 Come on, bro, it's just an onion. And the onion, like, really dude? I don't understand how, you might,

655
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 I'm sure you're a totally awesome person, like, I'm not bad-mouthing you, but I don't understand how someone can go through the day like that,

656
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 because everything you eat used to be alive. Everything used to be alive. Unless you're the rockbiter from Never-Ending Story,

657
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 everything you eat used to be alive. But yeah, so we have interesting statements like that coming out of this belief that the Archons-

658
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 and another thing that we see in this is that God, there's no God. There's no God in this philosophy.

659
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 It's the Archons, and they've created the idea of a God, and we worship this idea of God,

660
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 and the Archons are also able to feed off worship. So they feed off misery, they feed off joy,

661
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 they feed off turning joy into misery, they feed off worship, and it's basically no matter what you do, you're back to the wall.

662
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 They have an answer for everything. It's one of those conspiracy theories, or one of those beliefs that has an answer for everything.

663
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 To be fair, a lot of religious systems do have an answer for everything, but most of them weren't made up right before somebody falls asleep.

664
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 Right? Right? That's the thing. And the reason why, I mean, if you want to believe this stuff, it's fine.

665
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 I believe in ghosts and aliens and all sorts of weird stuff that a lot of people don't believe in.

666
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 But hope. Hope. I think it's such an integral part of the belief system.

667
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 I think when you have a belief system that is devoid of hope, that in the end nothing matters,

668
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 which I guess you could- I don't even think atheism falls into that category, and I'm not an atheist.

669
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 But I don't even- I wouldn't even consider an atheist devoid of hope.

670
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 They just go, "I didn't exist before I was born, and I'm not going to exist after I die, and I didn't know what life was like before I was born,

671
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
 and I'm not going to know what it was like after I died, and I'm okay with that."

672
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 Versus, "All your misery is caused because some space eagle," that Jason pictured,

673
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 a bunch of these archons want to consume you. So every evil thing that happens in your life is out of your control, you have no control over it.

674
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
 These demonic creatures are making you do it. And if you happen to have a good day, they're going to eat that too.

675
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 They're going to eat everything, and in the end you're nothing more than a chicken nugget to these creatures.

676
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 And on the one hand I would say, "Well, that chicken was nothing but a chicken nugget, a literal chicken nugget for me,

677
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 and I ate it, and it powered me throughout the day." It's a very, very nutritious chicken nugget.

678
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 And if it turns out that I die and my soul's floating around, then I'm like, "Oh, this is pretty dope."

679
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 And then I see some space eagle in a golden robe. Yeah, I might be a little disappointed, but I'd be like,

680
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 "Oh, I did eat a lot of stuff, and then this is, I mean, well, just desserts.

681
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 Literally, I'm just a dessert." And then I fly into its mouth and give it indigestion.

682
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 You know? But just even reading this stuff, this article, people were like,

683
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
 "Oh yeah, I really got depressed when I heard about this." It's fake. I mean, come on, man.

684
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 You know, it's weird because I feel like if Robert Monroe, or somebody like him, had had a dream,

685
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 had hooked himself up to these headphones, and then the next day says, "I've realized that Jesus Christ is the Lord and Saviour."

686
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
 This would have gained no traction, right? If he put these headphones on and takes them off and he goes,

687
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 "I had a vision that I need to go to Mecca and become a Muslim." People would be like, "Uh."

688
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 But because he states this completely bizarre conspiracy theory that's spooky and counterintuitive,

689
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:59,000
 really, to what we think will happen. Because there's no reincarnation in this.

690
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 If you went, this guy's written three books. So maybe in some one of his books, he has some sort of out clause

691
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 where you can get reincarnated or something like that. From what I gathered, it's just you get eaten.

692
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 You get eaten in the end, right? If he had gone under into this astral realm

693
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,000
 and come back and stated a mainstream belief and decided to become a minister in Louisiana,

694
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,000
 no one would pay $1,200 to go to his institute, right? If 2028 man had popped up and said,

695
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:33,000
 "I'm from the future and just do normal stuff, nothing bad's gonna happen, everything's gonna be fine for the next 20 years."

696
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 There'll be some hiccups and stuff like that. But yeah, guys, don't worry. I'm from the future and everything's okay.

697
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 He'd have 5,000 followers if that.

698
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,000
 Fear sells. Fear sells. People love to buy it.

699
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,000
 Let's put on our conspiracy caps to finish our episode like this.

700
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 So all the legend, this is in the realm of creative, this is in the realm of dreaming.

701
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
 Let's all put on our little sleepy caps like we're in the 1920s cartoon.

702
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 Put on some headphones and close our eyes. In the old religion, in the old world, you'd have a god speak through a messenger.

703
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 Say what the afterlife holds. Say the rules you need to follow to get into said afterlife.

704
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 Lay down the law of what will happen to those who don't believe.

705
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
 Why wouldn't the Archons be any different than that?

706
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 They're sitting in the void, the black void.

707
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,000
 There's not enough fear to feed on anymore. I mean, yeah, there's a lot. There's a lot.

708
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 But we want more. We want existential fear.

709
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:43,000
 People are afraid of war and famine, but we want something more.

710
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,000
 So they send a messenger to Earth to deliver a message of hopelessness.

711
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 A message that no matter what you do, you are feeding something dark and evil.

712
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:03,000
 Which in turn makes you despair even more.

713
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:09,000
 Before when you were sick or you were afraid of dying, you thought the end is over soon.

714
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 But now that you've heard this new doctrine, you're even more afraid of dying.

715
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 Because not only will you die, but you will be consumed by something dark and evil.

716
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 You're nothing but a little treat to it.

717
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:31,000
 Your entire existence led up to simply being a little more energy for a creature from beyond the realm.

718
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 God has sent messengers to Earth. Why couldn't the Archons?

719
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:43,000
 Why couldn't they have sent Robert Monroe not to stumble across binaural beats,

720
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 but with an implicit purpose to spread the doctrine of hopelessness?

721
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
 I'm not saying that's true. I'm not saying that's true.

722
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:56,000
 I'm not saying that Robert Monroe was created by a race of space eagles wearing golden robes.

723
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
 But if he was, he did a really good job.

724
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:05,000
 Because when you look up the story of Lush, you see a lot of stories of hopelessness and fear.

725
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 And I think that's very convenient, that that's exactly what the Archons feed on.
