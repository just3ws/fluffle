1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
 When a fire engulfs a house and two bodies are found, people start to think it was a

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,560
 horrible accident.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:15,040
 But then a man comes forward and says, "A demon did it."

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:22,280
 And then we travel to Russia to spend a nice afternoon with a man enjoying his hobby, diving.

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:28,760
 But while he's exploring the dark depths of Finnish Bay, he comes face to face with

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,480
 a homicidal creature today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:42,440
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,440
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,440
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,440
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,680
 If you listened to yesterday's episode, I'm true to my word.

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,680
 I'm recording this episode only an hour after yesterday's episode.

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,920
 It's so hot, I'm gonna really see how many of these guys I can get.

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,560
 It's not quantity over quality.

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,560
 It still will be good.

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,480
 Don't skip the next couple episodes.

17
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,800
 I just want to see if I can get these done because it's so hot.

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,880
 I really have to find that perfect time to record.

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,480
 I am in a closet after all.

20
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,640
 A haunted closet, which makes it 10 degrees hotter.

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,600
 Let's go ahead and give a shout out to one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

22
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,120
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now, everyone get on your feet.

23
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,640
 I don't care if you're driving a car.

24
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,000
 Stand up and give a round of applause to Al Tyus.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,800
 Everyone give a round of applause to Al Tyus.

26
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,080
 It just caused 10 car accidents, but it was worth it.

27
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,360
 Al, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

28
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,200
 You guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,760
 Just help spread the word about the show.

30
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,760
 Really helps out a lot.

31
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,600
 Now, long-time listeners of the show know I take a break every 50 episodes, but I'm

32
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,040
 gonna take three weeks off in July.

33
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,240
 There's not gonna be any bonus episodes.

34
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,240
 I'm not gonna...

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,120
 I mean, a ghost's gonna literally possess me and I won't report on it.

36
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,840
 I'm not doing anything with the show for three weeks.

37
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,360
 So really, I'm looking at it like this.

38
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,480
 If I can get these next 13 episodes done, 'cause I'm gonna have enough episodes to take me

39
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,600
 to the three weeks, I'm golden, dude.

40
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,160
 You're like, "Jason, just focus on the quality of the show.

41
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,800
 Don't go on this break next week."

42
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,320
 But yeah, so I will be taking a three-week break in the month of July.

43
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:16,280
 So from July 8th to pretty much August 3rd will be my break.

44
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,280
 It's gonna be glorious.

45
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,280
 It's gonna be glorious.

46
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,680
 Apparently, I'm getting possessed by a ghost.

47
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,520
 Oh, and I wanna say this.

48
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,400
 It's a three-week, non-interrupted break, except for one thing.

49
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,800
 And I'll do constant reminders for this.

50
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,600
 We are going to have a July...

51
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,680
 Of course, we gotta do this.

52
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,640
 A July 18th Alien Invasion Special, and it's brought to you by the movie The Quiet Place

53
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,640
 2.

54
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,200
 So, we're gonna be doing that on July 18th.

55
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,880
 We're gonna do it as a YouTube livestream.

56
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,440
 So if you wanna join us, we'll have more information of like times and dates, obviously,

57
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,160
 July 18th.

58
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,840
 And then we're gonna upload that to the podcast.

59
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,840
 I'm gonna clean up the audio, do a little bit editing.

60
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,800
 So if you don't do the YouTube thing or if you're not there immediately.

61
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,200
 But I guess I can announce the time right now.

62
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,200
 Let's do...

63
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,360
 No, I'm too hot to figure out a time.

64
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,360
 I'll let you know.

65
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,560
 I'm too hot to literally understand how clocks work.

66
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,920
 But I'm not too hot to tell you some stories, some spooky, spooky stories.

67
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,920
 Altias.

68
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,160
 I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the...

69
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,160
 Rabbit Rocket Ship.

70
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,160
 We don't use this enough.

71
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,160
 We're not going to space, but we don't use it enough.

72
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,240
 I'm gonna toss you the keys to the Rabbit Rocket Ship.

73
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,080
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

74
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,840
 We are headed out to Burnley in England.

75
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,840
 [BOOM]

76
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,040
 Dead Rabbit Rocket Ship is taking us over there.

77
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,640
 It's October 1st, 2020.

78
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,640
 We're in Burnley.

79
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,000
 That's in Lankanshire in England.

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,600
 October 1st, 2020.

81
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,360
 A fire is burning through a house.

82
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,360
 And the firefighters...

83
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,640
 [MAKING FIREFIGHTERS]

84
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,240
 They have different sirens over there, 'cause they're weird.

85
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,240
 Fire engine pulls up.

86
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,240
 What's all this then?

87
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,720
 And the firefighters get out and they start spraying the house with water.

88
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,720
 Pshh.

89
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,560
 If you don't know what firefighters do, I don't know why I'm going to so much detail.

90
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,320
 And then eventually the firefighters do go into the building.

91
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,960
 They're chopping down doors.

92
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,680
 And they go, "Ohhh!"

93
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,440
 Somebody call the cops.

94
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,440
 The police get there.

95
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,680
 And what's happened is the firefighters have discovered two bodies.

96
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,680
 One, the body of Dr. Suman Mir Sakharvi, 49-year-old woman.

97
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,360
 It's her house.

98
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,920
 And they found the body of her daughter as well.

99
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,680
 Vian Mangrio, a 14-year-old girl.

100
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,120
 So the police are investigating this and they go, "Does it look like they burned to death?"

101
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,280
 The firefighters are like, "What are the coroners?

102
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,280
 Go take...

103
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,280
 We don't know?"

104
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,680
 So the police are like, "Oh, we're open.

105
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,720
 We'd be able to have a short date if I solve 13 murders today.

106
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,600
 I get to take a vacation."

107
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,200
 So the police, they go take the bodies to the corner.

108
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,640
 Corner goes, "Oh, these people have been murdered."

109
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,880
 They actually died before the fire because they don't have any smoke on their lungs.

110
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,160
 So now it's a murder investigation.

111
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,960
 They thought it was an accident, but it's not.

112
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,760
 And so they start watching CCTV because literally every square inch of Britain has a camera pointed

113
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,880
 at it.

114
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,520
 And they see the handyman of the house.

115
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,240
 Dr. Suman hired a handyman.

116
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,040
 It is Shabazz Khan.

117
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,320
 He's a 51-year-old man.

118
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:16,360
 And they see him like just kind of walking out of the house the day before the fire.

119
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,520
 So they don't really have video of him on the day of the fire, but the day before he

120
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,520
 was there.

121
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,520
 So they go talk to him.

122
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,160
 And he's like, "Yeah, I'm a handyman."

123
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,160
 She hired me.

124
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,600
 I come and do the stuff at their house.

125
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,840
 He is like giving all these answers.

126
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,320
 And he's like, "Yeah, I'm a handyman."

127
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,600
 You know, he's telling them about the job.

128
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,120
 He has the perfect alibi, right?

129
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,680
 I was there the day before, but I wasn't there when these bodies were found.

130
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,120
 And the police officers are walking around and they go, "What's all this then?"

131
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,360
 And it's the doctor's jewelry.

132
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,000
 Dr. Suman's jewelry was at his house.

133
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 And they go, "Why do you have this?"

134
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,720
 And he's like, "Uh, I don't know.

135
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,720
 I don't know.

136
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
 I don't know.

137
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,560
 Why does anyone have anything, officer?"

138
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,400
 And then the officers get a subpoena for us.

139
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
 It's Britain.

140
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
 I don't even know if they need a subpoena.

141
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,520
 They get his phone and they find a Google search on there.

142
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,120
 What is DNA?

143
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,560
 That's one of the Google searches.

144
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,960
 That could have been anything, right?

145
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,800
 He could have been trying to figure out who Dana was.

146
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,160
 He misspelled it.

147
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,680
 Or maybe he just watched an episode of Beakman's World.

148
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,000
 His other Google search.

149
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Can we get...

150
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 This is bad grammar, too.

151
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,760
 I mean, I guess he is suspected of murdering people.

152
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,000
 But you should at least have good grammar.

153
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Here's his Google search, word for word.

154
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,520
 Can we get DNA from burn bodies for investigations?

155
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,800
 So at this point, the cops are like, "Okay, this guy is our best suspect.

156
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,160
 He's the last person who left the house alive, even though it was a day before.

157
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,680
 He knew the house inside and out.

158
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,680
 There's jewelry here."

159
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,080
 And he was trying to see if burn bodies would hide DNA.

160
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,580
 So they arrest him.

161
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,080
 And he confesses.

162
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,280
 Kind of.

163
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,840
 So this is currently working its way through the court system.

164
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,100
 This case is currently working through the court system.

165
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,600
 So everything I said was alleged.

166
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,640
 Now it's over-directive alleged.

167
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,640
 His alibi?

168
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,680
 He says, "Yes.

169
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:09,560
 My physical body murdered those people, but I was possessed by a gin."

170
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,720
 Now this is interesting because we've covered gins on this show before.

171
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,480
 We've covered them a couple of times.

172
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,800
 And a gin is basically the Islamic version.

173
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,840
 What's interesting about this was I always thought it was an Islamic version of a demon.

174
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,240
 That they were kind of interchangeable.

175
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,440
 They were fallen spirits.

176
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:35,120
 But this dude, Shabazz, uses the term interchangeably with just a run-of-the-mill ghost.

177
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,160
 We don't think of Abraham Lincoln's ghost floating through the White House.

178
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,200
 We don't compare him to Bal Bereth.

179
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,440
 There's two separate things.

180
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,520
 So I don't know if gins are ghosts, if there is, if all ghosts are considered gin in Muslim

181
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,520
 culture.

182
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,520
 I don't know.

183
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,480
 But he says he was possessed by a gin, and this gin was actually, used to be a living

184
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,520
 person, which is something else we covered in an episode.

185
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,040
 Can he be possessed by a ghost?

186
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,800
 So this guy is basically a greatest hits of Dead Rabbit Radio.

187
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,040
 He believes that he was possessed by a gin.

188
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:12,640
 And when the cops are talking to him, he starts, I know this is a podcast.

189
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,840
 You couldn't see what I was doing, but maybe you heard it.

190
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,600
 He started doing jerking motions.

191
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,200
 He started getting all herky jerky.

192
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,800
 Like he was walking like the girl from the ring.

193
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,480
 If the cops come over, they're like, "We don't have to ask you a few questions."

194
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,120
 He's like, "Sure, can I get you some tea?"

195
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,280
 He's all jerking around, spilling tea everywhere.

196
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,680
 He has to build his alibi somehow, right?

197
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,840
 Which is like some soup, some super hot soup.

198
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,840
 They're like, "No, sir.

199
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,880
 Tea, the empty tea cups you gave us was enough."

200
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,480
 He starts herky jerking.

201
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,680
 This is the story he says.

202
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,160
 He goes, "Listen, you caught me.

203
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,040
 You searched my phone.

204
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,360
 You found the jewelry, but I didn't do this."

205
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,080
 I was at her house and she wanted me to do renovations on it.

206
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,840
 I am a handyman.

207
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,760
 And while I was there, I was using my hammer.

208
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,520
 I was putting some nails and stuff.

209
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,640
 And a gin named Robert Smith Wood showed up.

210
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,240
 It was actually a 620 year old spirit who had been haunting this house.

211
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,040
 I don't know how old the house was.

212
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,520
 I don't know if this was Castle Grayskull.

213
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,320
 But apparently this old wrinkly old 600 year old ghost is floating down the street one

214
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,720
 day and goes, "That'll look like a nice spot."

215
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,600
 But anyway, so the 600 year old ghost is haunting this house and he goes, "It got mad that I

216
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,120
 was doing renovations on it."

217
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,440
 And there was actually another ghost there named Rita.

218
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,560
 She was a little more polite, but he would throw stuff around.

219
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,760
 One time he moved the dining room table.

220
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,560
 One time Vian, the young girl, was walking around and Robert would grab her hair.

221
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,680
 This ghost out of nowhere would grab her hair and start yanking on it.

222
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,880
 And it hated them.

223
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,800
 Rita loved them.

224
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,560
 He goes, "I remember the last day I was there.

225
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,240
 I was walking out of the house.

226
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,080
 And as I was walking out, Dr. Simone was sitting there and she was talking to Rita, just sitting

227
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,760
 in the kitchen, just talking to her.

228
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,520
 Talking to the spirit.

229
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,720
 But I didn't murder anybody.

230
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,360
 I didn't murder anybody.

231
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:10,760
 My guess is that the gin known as Robert Smith Wood possessed me and I went back there and

232
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,280
 I murdered everybody.

233
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,280
 But I didn't do it.

234
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,440
 I think it was just, I was possessed.

235
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,320
 Now the police obviously aren't like, they're not scared, they don't run to the car and

236
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,320
 call for backup.

237
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,680
 They just arrest the guy, because really what he's done is he's confessed.

238
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,240
 They arrest the guy and they take him into a cell.

239
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:33,240
 Then at one point he's sitting in the cell and he is told, you know you're under observation.

240
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,840
 Like there's a camera in this cell.

241
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,360
 We can see what you're doing all the time.

242
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,200
 And then they let, I don't know if they were setting them up for this or something.

243
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,160
 But I guess he was just sitting in the cell totally normal.

244
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,080
 And this is the prosecutor's argument, right?

245
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,520
 This is the prosecutor's argument.

246
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,520
 But because they showed this tape during the trial, I would have loved to see this.

247
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:55,680
 They say that they told him that he was being observed in his cell and then after that he

248
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,200
 started flying around the room.

249
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:05,040
 Okay, that's a bit of a, he began, I don't want to say floating, because even that the

250
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,160
 jury would be like not guilty.

251
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,840
 He's clearly not on the ground.

252
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,440
 He threw himself around the room.

253
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,120
 He's like, oh, and he's basically acting like Robert Smith Wood is throwing him around.

254
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,880
 And the cops came in while he was getting pummeled and he goes, oh dude, the second

255
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,360
 you guys told me I was under observation, Robert Smith Wood is like, ah, I'm going to

256
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,640
 beat you up on camera.

257
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,120
 He began choking me and he threw me on the bed.

258
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,480
 The cops are looking at each other and they're like, make sure, make sure we use this in

259
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,840
 the trial because it shows that he's lying.

260
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,880
 He was perfectly fine in here until we told him he was being videotaped and then he started

261
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,600
 flying around the room, quote unquote flying around the room, throwing himself around the

262
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,440
 room.

263
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,880
 So this is an interesting story.

264
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,240
 It's an ongoing criminal trial.

265
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,880
 We'll see if we get any more news of it going forward.

266
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,280
 I'd love to watch that video.

267
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,280
 It's Britten's funny some videos.

268
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,080
 He's like, ah, but here's the thing.

269
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,840
 Let's put on our conspiracy caps for this.

270
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:03,760
 We're being told this guy faked it, but for all we know there's hours of footage of this

271
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,760
 guy just getting horribly throttled by this demon.

272
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,680
 He's floating around, his head spinning around, his legs are sticking out of his ear.

273
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,480
 It's just like all this inhuman stuff.

274
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,400
 And the prosecutor's like, no, we're not going to show the part where a portal opens up and

275
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,160
 Satan comes down, starts punching him in the stomach as Robert is holding him down.

276
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,160
 We're not going to show that.

277
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,400
 We're going to show this one clip.

278
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,320
 And I don't even know if the clip is a cop looking through the cell and being like, you're

279
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,200
 on candid camera and then leaving and then him throwing himself around.

280
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,320
 Or if they just took a clip of him throwing himself around and go, oh, we told him he

281
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,320
 was on camera.

282
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,320
 So who knows?

283
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,680
 You know, when we're talking about this show, Dead Rabbit Radio, we know that there's

284
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,840
 frauds out there.

285
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,160
 We talk about them a lot, but we believe in this stuff.

286
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,360
 Or maybe you don't believe in this stuff.

287
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,920
 Maybe you just find entertainment value in it.

288
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,120
 And that's totally fine too.

289
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,040
 Like, I personally believe in demons.

290
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,240
 I personally believe in ghosts and things like that.

291
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,880
 So it's not outside of the realm of possibility that he could be telling the truth.

292
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,360
 I don't think he is.

293
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,800
 I don't think he is.

294
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,800
 And I think that it's, but you know what's weird about it?

295
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,860
 What I can't wrap my head around is they see him walking out the day before the fire.

296
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,640
 So who said the fire?

297
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,640
 That's not answered.

298
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,360
 So are they saying he murdered them a day before and then the fire just spontaneously

299
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,560
 - which would make me think a demon has something to do with it, right?

300
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,040
 So who knows what's going on with it?

301
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,120
 He'll most likely be found guilty, right?

302
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,480
 Most juries are gonna just agree and go, "He probably killed this guy."

303
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,600
 Especially with the phone search and stuff like that.

304
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,600
 But who set the fires?

305
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,320
 This is the problem with juries.

306
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,560
 This is the problem with juries because you get people like me.

307
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,520
 You get people like me where you have all this evidence laid out against them you have.

308
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,080
 He has possession of his jewels.

309
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,240
 Oh, the demon stole them.

310
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,960
 You have the searches on the phone.

311
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,360
 The chin loves Google.

312
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,360
 He loves it.

313
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,160
 You have all this stuff, but then there's like one unanswered question.

314
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,560
 I'm like, "But wait a second.

315
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,560
 Who set the fires?"

316
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,960
 So I'm like sitting in the car and I'm like, "Not guilty."

317
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,680
 I was on a grand jury the other day and they basically were like, "This was actually two

318
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,680
 or three years ago."

319
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,960
 I think it was even before I did the podcast, but I was not invited back.

320
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,080
 I was not invited back.

321
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,200
 I don't know how much I can talk about it.

322
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,560
 Like a cop comes in and tells you the story and then the cop leaves and we discuss it

323
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,240
 and then a cop comes in and tells a different story.

324
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,440
 He tells spooky stories.

325
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,440
 We're like, "Oh no, it's so scary.

326
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,440
 Is he still out there?"

327
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,440
 They're like, "Yes.

328
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,400
 If you do not indict this man, he will murder again."

329
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,680
 I was not invited back.

330
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,040
 They had a reunion party.

331
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,400
 They're like, "Yay, we indicted everyone.

332
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,960
 Let's not call Jason."

333
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,080
 But yeah, I would be not a good juror.

334
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,080
 I've gone.

335
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,480
 I've never, I've sat through trials, right?

336
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,080
 But I've never been selected as a juror before.

337
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,560
 Probably could have been tons of criminals on the streets.

338
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,400
 Anyways, so we'll see if we get more information about this, but it is creepy.

339
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:01,240
 And it would be creepy too if we lived in a world where this was so common that that

340
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,560
 was a viable defense.

341
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,440
 Like you could actually say, "Well, yeah, they did get murdered and I did do it."

342
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,760
 So yeah, we'll see if we get more information on that, but I thought it was a really interesting

343
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,760
 story.

344
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,640
 It's a true crime and paranormal collide and conspiracy is just sitting in the corner.

345
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,120
 He's like, "I'll get you next time."

346
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,640
 I love it when we have a confluence.

347
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,280
 Is that a word where things kind of come together?

348
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,280
 Altias.

349
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:29,040
 I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to that famed carpenter copter.

350
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,720
 We are leaving behind England.

351
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,600
 We are headed out to Mother Russia.

352
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,840
 [MUMBLING]

353
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,840
 Specifically, we're headed to Finnish Bay.

354
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,560
 That's in the St. Petersburg region in Russia.

355
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,760
 It's summer 1997.

356
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,680
 It's the middle of the day.

357
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,240
 And at Finnish Bay, we're going to meet a young man.

358
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:57,800
 His name is Nikolay M. He is an officer on a submarine in the Russian military and an

359
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,920
 amateur diver.

360
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,880
 He's like, "Oh, these submarines, they're so lame.

361
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,200
 I'd rather do it myself."

362
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,960
 He's carrying torpedoes everywhere he keeps sinking.

363
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,800
 But he does on his off time when he's not underwater with 100 men.

364
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,920
 He likes to go underwater by himself.

365
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,400
 He's swimming in the shallow waters of Finnish Bay.

366
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:19,600
 And while he's down there, he sees a cucumber-shaped object.

367
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,680
 It's quite large.

368
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,680
 I mean, it's not the size of a submarine, but it's about the size of a man.

369
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,480
 So maybe six, seven feet long.

370
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,720
 Just a tube that's kind of bent.

371
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,800
 It's not like a metal cylinder.

372
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,000
 It looks like a cucumber.

373
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,800
 It looks a little natural, maybe?

374
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,800
 Like a rock outcropping.

375
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,720
 It doesn't look like it's a piece of a vehicle.

376
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,280
 It looks more natural than that.

377
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,520
 He's swimming down and he sees this large cucumber-shaped thing.

378
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,400
 He goes down, he's kind of fiddling around with it and realizes it's loose.

379
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,640
 He's never seen anything like this.

380
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,960
 And he can tell that it's not a rock.

381
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,720
 So he goes, "I'm going to tie some ropes to it and try to drag it to shore, because we're

382
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,280
 on the shallow end of it."

383
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:03,960
 So he ties some ropes to it and he's trying to swim away and he can't budget.

384
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,000
 That only peaks his interest even more.

385
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,520
 He's trying to figure out what this is.

386
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,520
 He goes back on land, he gets some gear.

387
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,600
 And he brings his car closer to the water and starts wrapping on these straps.

388
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,200
 His goal is to just pull it out with his car.

389
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,480
 I mean, this guy's the term.

390
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,160
 It's the tastiest cucumber ever.

391
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,840
 He has a giant salad he needs to make.

392
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:29,120
 He swims back under there and he knows that he's going to have to attach the straps to

393
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,680
 this cucumber by drilling holes into it.

394
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,160
 He actually has a drill, like an underwater drill with him.

395
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,800
 I don't know if that's normal amateur diving gear, but he has that underwater drill.

396
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,080
 Maybe it's just a regular drill that he wrapped the plastic bag around.

397
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,080
 I don't know.

398
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,480
 But he takes this drill, he goes underwater and he has these hooks that are tethered to

399
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,480
 his car bumper.

400
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:54,080
 But he has to drill into the cucumber to get these hooks into this cucumber thing.

401
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:01,520
 He takes the drill and he goes, "Ding!" and he feels the drill going into this cucumber

402
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,800
 shaped object.

403
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:10,840
 And then a dark oil like liquid starts to seep out of the hole he's creating.

404
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,840
 "Ding!"

405
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,840
 "Ding!"

406
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,840
 "Ding!"

407
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,200
 And he's pushing that drill.

408
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,680
 He's pushing that drill.

409
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,960
 And when he sees that black oil start to leak out more and more, he pushes it in harder.

410
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,960
 "Ding!"

411
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:30,760
 And when he pushes it down even harder, he hears a loud crack from inside the cucumber.

412
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:37,640
 Now the black oil has been replaced with a thick blood like liquid.

413
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,280
 It's surrounding him, he's underwater and he has this drill in his thing and now he

414
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,200
 just sees thick red fluid surrounding him.

415
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,640
 The object cracks open.

416
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,200
 And this is a really curious word.

417
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,840
 I'm taking this exactly how it's said in the story and I can't really visualize it.

418
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:05,480
 The cucumber cracks open and a dull bubble floats out.

419
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,520
 That's really, I mean like I can picture it?

420
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,600
 You know because when you blow bubbles you they're kind of shining reflective but it's

421
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,600
 hard for me.

422
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,480
 I mean I can picture it but it's just, it seems unnatural.

423
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,000
 A dull bubble floats out of this thing.

424
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:28,280
 And then a humanoid creature starts to rise out of the cucumber.

425
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:35,120
 He said its skin was unnaturally white and it's just kind of floating.

426
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,160
 It looks like it's not moving under its own volition, it's just kind of floating with

427
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,680
 the water.

428
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:45,720
 And he sees its back has this massive hole in it.

429
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:52,080
 It's this drill bit sized hole in its back.

430
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:58,280
 He drilled into this cucumber and when he pushed harder it penetrated this thing's back.

431
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,080
 It's now bleeding underwater and it's just floating there.

432
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:10,600
 But as it's floating it's starting to rotate and Nikolai is looking directly into its eyes.

433
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:16,920
 He doesn't give any description of this creature other than its humanoid.

434
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,400
 So we have to assume it has the typical eyes, nose, mouth.

435
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:27,400
 The skin is unnaturally white and one thing he learns very very quickly.

436
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,040
 As this creature is turning and it's looking straight at Nikolai its mouth is opening and

437
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:38,560
 closing silently.

438
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:48,760
 And as he's looking into this creature's eyes they felt hypnotic.

439
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:55,240
 He felt Nikolai felt that he couldn't stare at this thing's eyes too long.

440
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,240
 Something fills Nikolai with fear, probably the giant monster in front of him.

441
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,840
 And he pushes this thing away from him.

442
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,880
 He just has this feeling he needs to get it away from him.

443
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,960
 And when he pushes it this creature grabs Nikolai's wrist and that's when he realizes

444
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:16,880
 another inhuman feature about this thing, long razor sharp fingernails.

445
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:23,840
 They dig into his wrist and blood begins to shoot out of his own body.

446
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,840
 This creature has a vice like grip on his wrist.

447
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,840
 And it's holding him.

448
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,320
 It's shredding the skin.

449
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,920
 It's tearing muscle.

450
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,840
 It's getting towards the bone.

451
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:41,120
 And in Nikolai's other hand he has a power drill.

452
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,840
 He pushes that drill right into this creature's chest.

453
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:53,000
 The next thing, this is so interesting, the next thing Nikolai knows he's back on surface.

454
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,080
 And there's people standing around him.

455
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,560
 Someone drug him out of the water.

456
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,880
 He was unconscious underwater.

457
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,920
 They drag him out and you think oh was it just a dream?

458
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,200
 Does he have one of those underwater dreams?

459
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,080
 Was he pretending he was in a submarine and he just forgot that he wasn't and then thought

460
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,080
 he could breathe?

461
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,080
 No.

462
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,280
 It wasn't just a dream because when he regains consciousness he also regains the searing

463
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,560
 pain in his hand.

464
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,400
 He actually lost part of his hand in this attack.

465
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:25,280
 Whatever it was took off a chunk of his hand.

466
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,920
 He told people what had happened and other people went in to find this thing.

467
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:38,400
 The object, nor the creature, was ever seen again.

468
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,560
 This comes from a magazine called Secret Researchers.

469
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,800
 It actually was a Russian magazine.

470
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,960
 Secretine Islo Devonia.

471
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,000
 Which means Secret Researchers.

472
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Number 12.

473
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,280
 It was published in 1999.

474
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,840
 I got it from one of my favorite websites.

475
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,640
 Think about it docs.com.

476
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,640
 Great story.

477
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,240
 I love this one.

478
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,560
 I actually had this in my file for a pretty much since 1997.

479
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,120
 I've had this one for probably about a year.

480
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,960
 And I don't know why I haven't told you yet.

481
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,360
 I really like this story.

482
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,760
 It pops for me on so many levels.

483
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,760
 One, I love it because it takes place during the day.

484
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,120
 You don't get a lot of paranormal stuff that takes place during the day so things are more

485
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,120
 clear.

486
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,360
 It's not like I've not seen something in the woods.

487
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,720
 Two, you have someone go and you have a human.

488
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,800
 Which I'm very pro human going toe to toe.

489
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,600
 Some sort of spooky monster.

490
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,960
 The human comes out on top.

491
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,080
 Well, he did lose part of his hand.

492
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,400
 But you know what I mean?

493
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,320
 I always like stories where the human race overcomes these creatures.

494
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,800
 To be fair, to be fair he did put a power drill through this thing's back.

495
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,520
 So I mean we as a species kind of started this thing.

496
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,520
 But I love this story.

497
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,440
 You got a man being attacked by a monster.

498
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,440
 The man surviving.

499
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,800
 Now obviously like I say all the time, this story could be fake.

500
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,600
 This story could totally be fake.

501
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:03,800
 But if the story is true, it has really interesting implications.

502
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,840
 Because we talk so when we, if one, what was this thing?

503
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,840
 Right?

504
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,840
 There's a couple different things.

505
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,000
 You could think, when I read this story what my go to thing was, and yours could totally

506
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,240
 be different is that this was alien.

507
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,840
 This was kind of how I figured this out.

508
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,560
 I think this is really interesting.

509
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:25,440
 We always think of aliens as like fleets and organizations.

510
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,120
 Just you know the Galactic Federation coming down, get rid of your nuclear bombs, we're

511
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,400
 going to wave our finger at you until you do.

512
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,760
 I mean I'm not that, it's probably a noble goal in the end.

513
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,760
 But the aliens are constantly putting their noses on our business, clean up the environment

514
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,080
 and all that stuff.

515
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,560
 Or they're reptilians and they have this massive armada and they're eating our children and

516
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,880
 antartic and stuff like that.

517
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,400
 I don't, and while those stories are interesting, I mean they're pretty mainstream, but what

518
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,400
 I think is more realistic when we're talking about aliens is what I call the, the, the

519
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:01,760
 I don't know, the Spanish Galleon theory.

520
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:08,400
 We're sure there was an organization to move boats from Portugal and Spain and England

521
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,600
 and France, they're all trying to explore and find new trade routes and stuff like that.

522
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:19,800
 But before we got to the age of discovery or whatever it's called, there were just ships

523
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,520
 that were launched and everybody died.

524
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,120
 There was probably four more explorers who have died and we never knew about, like some

525
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,680
 Viking dudes or some dudes in Brazil who are like we're going to build this giant boat,

526
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,120
 we're going to see what's out there and then they just disappeared.

527
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:41,940
 There's probably way more explorers that died that history never knew about way before Christopher

528
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,600
 Columbus and stuff like that.

529
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:50,960
 There's probably uncounted explorers from every corner of the planet that went out.

530
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,720
 And so I think, yeah sure, alien federation and stuff like that, but I think there's

531
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,240
 no proof of that, that's all theory, that's all theory, but if aliens are out there you're

532
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:07,200
 more likely to have that alien ship that is launched from a planet that is that set of

533
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,480
 alien explorers.

534
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,760
 And the mission goes wrong because most of them would.

535
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,760
 Space is a very hostile environment.

536
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:23,360
 I love the movie Alien for a lot of reasons, but one of my favorite reasons is one of the

537
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,920
 most simple.

538
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:30,280
 In the movie Alien, they're on this ship and they're going to land on this planet because

539
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,440
 they've got a distress call.

540
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:38,000
 And it's like a five minute scene, maybe three minute scene, but of the ship, and these people

541
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,760
 have been in space for like, humans have been in space for like three or four hundred years

542
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,760
 at this point.

543
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,120
 It's not unusual to be in space, they have all the vehicles, they're actually like just

544
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,240
 mining planets, they're like ore miners.

545
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:54,040
 Space has become so mundane that you could just get a nine to five job where you're flying

546
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,240
 around in space.

547
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,160
 But when they go to land on this planet, it's like three minutes of them constantly hitting

548
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,560
 gears and buttons and the ship's getting all wrecked and everything like that.

549
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:10,040
 And that scene is so brilliant because it shows that even though you've been flying in space

550
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:14,680
 for four hundred years as a civilization, every time you landed on a planet you'd have no idea

551
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,040
 what was going to happen.

552
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:22,120
 It wasn't until you built space ports and had an infrastructure that it would be a smooth

553
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,120
 landing.

554
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,640
 It would be the equivalent of trying to land a 747 on just some farmland because you were

555
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,280
 out of fuel.

556
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,360
 Like you could do it, it's not going to be comfortable.

557
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,800
 So I love, that's such an amazing scene.

558
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:40,120
 It would never be mundane to land on an unexplored alien planet, that ship.

559
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,800
 And it's like in the first 20 minutes, it's not even like they're building up this big

560
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,800
 thing.

561
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,400
 It's just to show how dangerous it is to explore.

562
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,360
 And that's what it would be.

563
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,760
 So I'm imagining when I read the story, I go, what if this was some sort of life pod?

564
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:01,960
 And he'd been down there for who knows how long or he just came down a couple weeks ago.

565
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:08,080
 But his ship was in orbit, something happened and this was an escape pod.

566
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,240
 And it lands underwater and this is what it does.

567
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,200
 It just stays there until someone else can pick it up.

568
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,560
 I know that this is headcanon and stuff, I have no proof for any of this, but the reason

569
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:22,160
 why I think it's a life pod is because one, it's a protective container and the guy's

570
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,080
 drilling through it and first it hits like this oil substance.

571
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,200
 But then when it cracks open, that dull bubble floats out.

572
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,080
 I'm like, was that the oxygen this creature was breathing?

573
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,080
 Was this basically the environment this creature was encased in?

574
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:39,080
 Because he wasn't in the bubble, the bubble floats out and then he is floating out after

575
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,720
 it.

576
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:49,880
 So imagine if you were on this explorer mission and something went wrong and your ship crashed

577
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:57,280
 and you're in the middle of the galactic nowhere and you're in this pod and some dude walks

578
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:02,560
 up and puts a drill through it and through you.

579
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:08,720
 Now the creature disappeared, the object disappeared, but Nicolet still bore the injuries of this

580
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,480
 encounter.

581
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,680
 Where did the creature go?

582
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:16,000
 Why did it take the cucumber shaped object with it?

583
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,560
 Where is it now?

584
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,160
 Did it survive the encounter?

585
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,480
 Did it's hypnotic eyes somehow cause Nicolet to lose consciousness?

586
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:28,000
 Was that a other self defense mechanism outside of the razor sharp talent?

587
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,840
 It's just a fascinating story because I do believe in aliens, we can quibble all day

588
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:40,280
 long over where they come from, but I do believe there are other intelligences and things

589
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,280
 like that.

590
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,880
 I'm a little iffy on the galactic federation and stuff like that.

591
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:51,840
 The idea of "We Explore" we put people on an object and push that object off and hope

592
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:58,360
 to get riches or your name on a map or discover a new trade route or exploit resources and

593
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:03,120
 people unfortunately.

594
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:08,240
 I imagine other humanoid type species would do the same thing.

595
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,200
 And we look at our explorers and we go "man those people who go up into space, those people

596
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,480
 on space shuttle, they sure are brave, like anything can go wrong."

597
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,480
 And they're just stranded up there.

598
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:24,880
 And you can imagine on some alien planet they also hold these interplanetary, intergalactic

599
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,440
 possibly travelers and high esteem.

600
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,320
 They wave goodbye and they say goodbye to their families and they get on their ship.

601
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,720
 They take off.

602
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:43,080
 And the distances are so vast and the time they're going to spend is so long, so dangerous

603
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,680
 that no one knows truly if they're going to return.

604
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,800
 But they take the journey anyways, they are explorers of the cosmos.

605
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:56,720
 But then something goes wrong and one of them ends up in the shallow waters in Finnish Bay.

606
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,200
 It gets a power drill through the back.

607
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:07,760
 I just find the story fascinating.

608
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,760
 It's fascinating story.

609
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,800
 Originally I was going to wrap it up with a creepy way of saying maybe there's more

610
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,400
 of them out there.

611
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,840
 Maybe the next time you're in the water you see a giant cucumber.

612
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,240
 Like I said, for now I'm never going to go near it.

613
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,040
 I thought I was telling a scary ending.

614
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,040
 But you know what?

615
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:26,840
 Like yeah, you have to kind of give a respect to that level of bravery to leave behind your

616
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:32,400
 home and not know if you'll ever, ever even see it again.

617
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,400
 What's wrong?

618
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:38,800
 We're not going to give this super white talent filled monster man with hypnotic eyes a sad

619
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,800
 ending.

620
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,880
 We're going to give this monster, we're going to give this underwater monster a salute.

621
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:49,880
 So to all the explorers out there on earth and in the stars, I hope your travels fill

622
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,360
 you with knowledge.

623
00:31:52,360 --> 00:32:19,680
 I hope your journeys are safe and I hope you come in peace.

624
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:47,200
 Bye.

625
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:57,200
 Bye.

626
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,780
 (upbeat music)

627
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:09,780
