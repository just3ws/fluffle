1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
 A horrible crime happens in one of the most innocent locations.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,600
 And then we travel to Lone Mountain in California.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:16,280
 From ghostly re-enactments to horrific creatures attacking humans.

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,440
 What mysteries does this mountain hold?

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,960
 We'll explore them today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:29,360
 [Music]

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,080
 Hey everyone, welcome to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,960
 I'm your host Jason Carvener. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,320
 I hope you're having a great day too.

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,760
 The Surliness is over.

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,880
 You listened to yesterday's episode, was my Surly episode.

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,560
 I ended up taking a walk, taking a shower,

13
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,360
 and going to bed really early yesterday.

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,360
 So I got a lot of sleep.

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,160
 Man, I was just having a headache and I figured I would do the most

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,360
 headache-inducing stories, just pack them into that episode.

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,160
 But some bad news.

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,760
 So a couple episodes ago I said,

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,360
 "I don't think I'm gonna take a break after the end of season five.

20
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,160
 I think I have a pretty good system."

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,960
 That's not true.

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,560
 It was true at the time.

23
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,160
 You know, it's funny because the show is really just me.

24
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,760
 And for the first four seasons, I would go about 50/55 episodes

25
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,960
 and I would take a week-long break.

26
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,560
 And I felt like maybe that was some artificial boundary that I had set up.

27
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,360
 But it's weird.

28
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,160
 That actually, I think, is my limit.

29
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,960
 50 episodes, 50 some-odd episodes in a row.

30
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,760
 I do have to take a week-long break.

31
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,760
 It really just starts, I think, to impact my mental health.

32
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,760
 I just need a break from the recording process.

33
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,560
 I still do some research during my week-off, but I mostly just recover.

34
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,360
 So yes, it wasn't my plan.

35
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,560
 I was thinking the other day,

36
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,360
 "Maybe I'll take a break after 100 episodes."

37
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,760
 But no, I'm gonna take a break.

38
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,360
 So Friday will be the last episode.

39
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,360
 And then I'm gonna take a week-off.

40
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,160
 And then we'll be back.

41
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,560
 April 22nd is when the show will come back.

42
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,360
 April 22nd.

43
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,160
 So I'm gonna take a week-off.

44
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,960
 Just to recover mentally and stuff like that.

45
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,560
 I really enjoyed doing the show, but after 10 weeks in a row,

46
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,960
 it does start to kind of wear me down.

47
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,760
 So one thing I've noticed, too,

48
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,560
 and this may not be universal across all the endings of the seasons,

49
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,560
 but I noticed as the season goes on, the story's tend to get a little darker.

50
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,560
 And I haven't really figured out the mechanism of why I do that.

51
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,060
 I think it's important for people to look at things they do,

52
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,160
 patterns they do in life, and try to figure out why they do those certain type of patterns.

53
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,660
 I'm really...

54
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,760
 I really try to be aware of the patterns in my life

55
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,660
 and whether or not they're good patterns or bad patterns.

56
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,060
 But one thing I've picked up on is, as the seasons progress,

57
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,760
 the stories tend to get darker and darker.

58
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,460
 And today's first story is no exception.

59
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,460
 I also normally end my shows with the darker story,

60
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,660
 but I'm gonna try this.

61
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,960
 I kind of like leaving on a bit of a lighter note.

62
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,760
 So we're gonna switch it up.

63
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,460
 We're gonna do the dark story in the beginning.

64
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,460
 If it gets too much for you,

65
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,960
 you can just fast forward to the lighter story that just involves

66
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,660
 many, many people getting slaughtered.

67
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,260
 This story's more gruesome because it's more recent

68
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,860
 and other factors.

69
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,260
 Let's go ahead and just get started with the story here.

70
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,560
 The year is 1977,

71
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,560
 and we are in the state of Oklahoma at a little Girl Scout camp.

72
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,260
 Camp Scott.

73
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,160
 Bunch of little Girl Scouts running around, merit badges,

74
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,660
 dreaming of the day when they'll be able to sell their Girl Scout cookies

75
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,360
 and make a lot of money for their troop.

76
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,160
 And do other stuff.

77
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,960
 I'm not really for sure what the Girl Scouts do.

78
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,260
 I'm pretty sure they make fires and like play with knives

79
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,660
 and stuff like the Boy Scouts.

80
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,860
 But they also do like sewing and I guess guys do sewing too.

81
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,960
 Otherwise, how do they get their patches on?

82
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,660
 That's what they're called, right?

83
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,360
 Patches or is there a special badges?

84
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,960
 Badge at merit badges.

85
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,460
 Anyways, that's probably the only bit of levity you'll get during this segment.

86
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,160
 So I hope you enjoyed it.

87
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,860
 The year is 1977.

88
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,060
 It's June 12th.

89
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,660
 It's a cold summer morning.

90
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,360
 A huge storm hit the previous night,

91
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,860
 and the Girl Scouts all had their tents.

92
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,460
 They weathered it like good little troopers

93
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,660
 because that's what you're supposed to do.

94
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,560
 You're supposed to be able to weather the outdoors.

95
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,260
 It helps build character.

96
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,260
 A camp counselor wakes up before anyone else

97
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,660
 and she decides to make her way down to the shower area.

98
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,560
 And as she's walking along a trail, leaving her camp,

99
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,860
 she notices something odd in the trail in front of her.

100
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,160
 It's a camper sleeping bag.

101
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,360
 Just laying there in the middle of the trail.

102
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,160
 Now she had already had to walk, not a huge distance,

103
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,460
 but she had already left the camp.

104
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,160
 And now she sees a sleeping bag in the middle of the trail.

105
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,160
 She looks a little further up

106
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,760
 and there's another sleeping bag in the middle of the trail.

107
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,460
 And past that, another sleeping bag in the middle of the trail.

108
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,960
 And she notices that each sleeping bag

109
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,160
 seems to still have somebody in them.

110
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,260
 Earlier that year in April,

111
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,260
 they were doing a training session for the counselors

112
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,460
 at the Girl Scout Camp.

113
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,160
 Everyone's getting ready for the summer.

114
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,760
 They're like, "Hey, there's activities we're going to do.

115
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,960
 Here's the layout of the camp.

116
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,760
 This is how everything is run."

117
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,760
 And the camp counselor, you know,

118
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,260
 you figure they're like teenage girls, young women.

119
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,260
 They start to notice personal items missing.

120
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,860
 Now, at first, you're going to think your hairbrush is missing,

121
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,260
 your little Walkman, they didn't have Walkmans back there,

122
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:54,260
 your little AM/FM handheld radio height of technology for 1977 goes missing.

123
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,560
 And you're going to suspect the other girls.

124
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,160
 You're going to suspect one of the other girls

125
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,060
 that you don't know that well,

126
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,360
 might have taken your brush or taken your radio,

127
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,960
 took in your Danny Bonaducci poster off the wall.

128
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,560
 And then they find, I believe it was this box of donuts?

129
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,360
 They had previously bought the donuts in a magically appear,

130
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,660
 but inside the Boxster was a note and it said,

131
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,360
 it was a very detailed note and the full details haven't been released to the public,

132
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,160
 but it said, "We are on a mission to kill three girls in tent one."

133
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,960
 And then it went on to talk about like aliens and stuff like that.

134
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,460
 So the camp counselors regarded it as a prank, as a hoax.

135
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,960
 Again, one of the other girls must have done this.

136
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,260
 They're stealing stuff.

137
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,660
 They leave this note, "Ha ha, real funny."

138
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,460
 A nervous them a bit, but they go about their day.

139
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,160
 But now we're going back to June.

140
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,960
 June 11th, the day before the sleeping bags are found.

141
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,360
 They have these tents set up in this little camp area

142
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,260
 and there's a big storm coming.

143
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,660
 So they're like, "Okay everyone, you got to get to your tents.

144
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,260
 Let's do this chop chop, get to your tents

145
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,060
 because otherwise you're going to get super rained on,

146
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,560
 you're going to get pneumonia and all this stuff and we'll be liable for it.

147
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,860
 Go, go, go, go, go.

148
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,960
 You're burning daylight."

149
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,160
 Tent eight was the farthest tent away from the camp.

150
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,760
 So they haven't kind of grouped together,

151
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,760
 but for whatever reason, tent eight was farther away.

152
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,660
 And each tent held four girls.

153
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,960
 And one girl, she was, you know, dilly-dallying so long,

154
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,560
 the storm hit and she couldn't make it to tent eight.

155
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,860
 She couldn't go through the storm.

156
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,960
 So someone says, "Okay, fine, use our tent.

157
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,160
 Just crawl in and they're all crowded into this tent."

158
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,360
 He got five people in one tent and three in tent eight.

159
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,660
 At 1.30 in the morning,

160
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,360
 [thunder]

161
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,860
 huge storm, downpour, but even over the sounds of the storm.

162
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,760
 At 1.30 in the morning,

163
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,960
 a couple of the girls wake up and they hear the sound of what they described as moaning

164
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,860
 coming from the area around tent eight.

165
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,360
 "Hey, wake up, wake up, wake up."

166
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,460
 Wake up their camp counselor.

167
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,560
 "I think there's something going on.

168
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,860
 I think there's something going on at tent eight."

169
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,360
 Counselor gets out of her tent.

170
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,460
 Another counselor gets out of her tent and they're like, "Did you, yeah,

171
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,760
 people are saying that they're hearing something from over there."

172
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,860
 So the counselors are standing there and they're like,

173
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,960
 "Let's go check that out."

174
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,560
 Big storm still raging, but it's their job and they start to get towards the tent.

175
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,760
 They don't look in it,

176
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,860
 but they can't identify the sound of the noise that they heard previously.

177
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,460
 They're by the tent, they're looking around.

178
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,960
 They don't see anything amiss.

179
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,560
 They're getting horribly drenched in this rainstorm.

180
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,460
 So they just go back to their tent.

181
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,660
 They figured it was nothing.

182
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,060
 You know, it was no big deal.

183
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:31,960
 It was just a storm.

184
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,460
 You're probably hearing the noises of trees and all that stuff.

185
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,060
 Active imaginations of school girls.

186
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,960
 You can brush it off as that.

187
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:45,160
 At 2 a.m., the girls who are sleeping in tent seven say that someone opened up their tent

188
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:49,160
 and shown a flashlight into their tent, looked around, startling the girls.

189
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,360
 But then the tent flap closes again.

190
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,060
 The flashlight moves on.

191
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,560
 Rain continues to drop on their tent.

192
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,860
 Must have been a camp counselor.

193
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,560
 They go back to sleep.

194
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,760
 3 a.m.

195
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:06,960
 A few girls are woken up in their tents by the sound of screaming coming from tent eight.

196
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,560
 But they're too scared to make the report.

197
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,360
 They're too scared to even leave their tent, plug their ears.

198
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,360
 Hope it was a nightmare.

199
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,960
 Go back to sleep.

200
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,760
 The next morning at 6 a.m., the camp counselor is walking to the showers.

201
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,360
 Finds this three sleeping bags.

202
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,660
 Inside each of those sleeping bags is the body of a young girl.

203
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:33,260
 Dragged from tent eight and left on the trail where they would be found.

204
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,460
 Those are known as the Girl Scout Murders.

205
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,560
 Three young girls killed in the middle of the night.

206
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,560
 Left out in public.

207
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,560
 They were assaulted before they were killed.

208
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,960
 And based on what witnesses are saying they heard, overall it must have taken at least two hours.

209
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,160
 Minimum.

210
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,760
 Police rush into the area after they find this out.

211
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,760
 The camp is shut down.

212
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,160
 It's evacuated.

213
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,660
 They begin going through every single piece of clue, interviewing everyone.

214
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,860
 No one is without suspicion.

215
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:13,260
 Ten days later though, the cops find some items in a nearby cave out on this campground.

216
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,260
 They find some like duct tape.

217
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,860
 They find a flashlight wrapped in newspaper.

218
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,060
 And they find a lot of photographers from a man named Gene LeRoy Hart.

219
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:29,160
 Now Gene LeRoy Hart was already being hunted by the police.

220
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:35,660
 Because in 1973 he had kidnapped two pregnant women and assaulted one of them.

221
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,160
 And really when I'm assaulted he's sexually assaulting these people.

222
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,060
 That crime matched what was going on here.

223
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:46,760
 He didn't kill the pregnant women, but the young girls were also sexually assaulted.

224
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,160
 And because the crimes seemed similar between what happened to the young girls,

225
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,160
 and I don't want to go into detail what happened to the young girls,

226
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,660
 I think you can imagine, but what happened to the young girls

227
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,560
 and what happened to these pregnant women,

228
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,960
 they found photographs that he had developed that they knew that he had took in this cave.

229
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,460
 He was their number one suspect.

230
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:07,460
 They are able to track him down finally after four years.

231
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:12,460
 The heat is on him even more for these three assaults and murders of these Girl Scouts.

232
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:16,460
 But when he is brought to trial for this charge, he is acquitted.

233
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:21,460
 They are not able to definitely prove that he committed this crime.

234
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,960
 However, for the original kidnapping, rape, and escape,

235
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,160
 he ended up getting 305 years in prison.

236
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,160
 So if he is responsible, he's in there anyways.

237
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,460
 In 1989 though, we had two new updates to this case.

238
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,760
 One, they did some DNA tests.

239
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:42,160
 And the DNA tests came back that there was more than one killer in that tent with those three girls.

240
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,160
 One of them might have possibly been a woman.

241
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,760
 They can't rule that out.

242
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,160
 And they can't even with the DNA rule out heart either,

243
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,460
 but they can't prove that he was in the tent either.

244
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,760
 Also in 1989, a Reverend came forward and said,

245
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:00,260
 "I think I might know who did it, but I don't feel comfortable saying the names because I could get sued."

246
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:04,660
 But he then tells the story that he was counseling these four young men and then one night,

247
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,660
 he was driving down the road and one of the men was on the side of the road

248
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,360
 and he helped him with this car, this kind of this convoluted story.

249
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,160
 And then the guy said, "Hey, you want to see something?"

250
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,960
 And then they went into the woods and the Reverend went into the tent.

251
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,360
 And he saw two men he knew and two men he didn't know,

252
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,060
 basically cleaning up the crime scene.

253
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,560
 Who knows? Who knows with that?

254
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,160
 They, the police talked to him and really that story kind of went nowhere either.

255
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,160
 This is an unsolved case.

256
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,860
 The idea that you send your daughter off to a Girl Scout camp,

257
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:40,960
 I can't think of anything more innocent and sweet than that.

258
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,560
 She's going to go off and play with her friends and learn about nature,

259
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,760
 get her little merit badges and then come home with a big beaming smile on her face

260
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,960
 and get to live the rest of her life.

261
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:58,360
 With pride in her heart knowing that she is now a Girl Scout with these badges

262
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,360
 to prove her success in these events.

263
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,360
 But instead of that future, these three girls' lives were cut short.

264
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:14,160
 And the most chilling part of it all is that it's very likely that the perpetrators of this crime,

265
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:24,760
 their life kept going on, beaming with pride and joy of what they got to experience at Camp Scott.

266
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,060
 Dark stories, dark stories.

267
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,160
 Okay, but let's go ahead and move on to a lighter story here.

268
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:36,360
 Let's end it with a light note, because I did not want that story to be the end of the episode.

269
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,060
 Let's hop on the Carverdor Coptor, guys.

270
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,960
 Let's put some levity.

271
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,560
 We're going to put on some nice tunes as we're flying around,

272
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,560
 flying around.

273
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,860
 We're going to go over, we're going to fly over Disneyland.

274
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,860
 We're going to fly over some happy spots.

275
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,260
 We're going to fly through clouds too, because that's awfully fun.

276
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,760
 On purpose, we're going to fly through clouds.

277
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,460
 And once we start getting the ickiness of that last story out of us,

278
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:01,360
 we are going to Lone Pine Mountain.

279
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:07,560
 They used to be called Twin Pines Mountains until Marty McFly drove his car through one of the trees.

280
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,060
 Lone Pine Mountain is down in California.

281
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:10,960
 And it's a mountain.

282
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,360
 It's a populated area, not like super populated.

283
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,460
 There's not like a mega city around it, but you know, there's like houses and stuff.

284
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,360
 It's not really in the middle of nowhere.

285
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,960
 But it used to be, definitely used to be, when the Native Americans were here,

286
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,460
 and then the settlers rolled through and we're going to get to their stories in a second.

287
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:34,660
 But first off, the way I found out about Lone Pine Mountain was there was a particular ghost story that I'd heard about it.

288
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:38,860
 In the 1960s, so you have Lone Pine and Whitney Portal Road,

289
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,160
 which if you want a place to be haunted, name your road portal.

290
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,660
 Why would you do that?

291
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,260
 You're basically just asking ghosts to be like, "Oh, a portal?

292
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,060
 And they'll walk through it."

293
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,360
 That'd be like having a place called Void Street or Abyss Avenue.

294
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,160
 Don't do that.

295
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,660
 Don't name streets weird stuff, because weird stuff's going to happen.

296
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,860
 Lone Pine and Whitney Portal Road.

297
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,160
 There's this woman sitting at home late at night.

298
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,560
 It's 1960s.

299
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,760
 She's watching "I Love Lucy," reading TV Guide, smoking a cigarette.

300
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,460
 Curlers in her hair.

301
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,460
 She's sitting there and she hears gunfire.

302
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,060
 [gunfire]

303
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,560
 Totally freaks her out.

304
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,960
 Of course it's going to freak you out.

305
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,260
 There's gunfire right outside your house.

306
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,260
 And she peeks out her window.

307
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:26,960
 And what she sees is a black man dressed as a Native American Indian.

308
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,560
 And she goes, "That's weird. The Village People aren't supposed to come to town until next month."

309
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,860
 A black man dressed as a Native American and then a bunch of other natives behind him.

310
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,660
 And he's like, "Come on, boys!"

311
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,360
 And they're basically attacking her house.

312
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,060
 And she sees really what she's looking at.

313
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,360
 And she almost can immediately identify them as not real people.

314
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,960
 They are ghosts.

315
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,860
 So I don't know if they were kind of translucent or they didn't have legs.

316
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,860
 They just have that little curly, cute tail like Casper does.

317
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,060
 Oh, I know Casper had legs.

318
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,960
 Who's the ghost with the little, oh, like they're basically like slimmers.

319
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,060
 Like they don't have legs.

320
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,460
 She doesn't say about how much slime they left behind,

321
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:05,560
 but she does say that these ghosts are opening fire on her house.

322
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:11,660
 And it goes on for nearly 15 minutes as they're laying siege to her house.

323
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,860
 [imitates explosion]

324
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,060
 They're reloading.

325
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,060
 They're taking time.

326
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,560
 They're actually like setting up tents.

327
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,660
 One guy's like cooking food for after the battle.

328
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,560
 It goes on for quite a while.

329
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,160
 And then eventually, it just ends.

330
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,160
 Now you may chocolate up to a little too much wine that night.

331
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,460
 Did women drink wine back in the 50s?

332
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,060
 I always imagine they just drink whiskey.

333
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,560
 I think women drinking wine is a very recent thing.

334
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,260
 And I've learned as I get older, a lot of women drink wine all the time.

335
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,660
 A lot.

336
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,560
 A lot of wine all the time.

337
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,760
 But anyways, not judging.

338
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,660
 I just think it's weird.

339
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,460
 Did my, did, I know my mom, she doesn't drink alcohol,

340
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:52,060
 but like when I was a kid, did my friends' parents drink wine all the time?

341
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,060
 Like a lot of wine?

342
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,460
 'Cause trust me, yeah.

343
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,160
 At this age, they all drink wine.

344
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,460
 So you'll learn that too.

345
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,460
 If you don't know that yet, your mom probably drinks a lot of wine.

346
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,660
 Again, not judging, but...

347
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,260
 Anyway, so...

348
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,560
 Let's say that she was drinking just whiskey straight.

349
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,060
 Now you could imagine it was just like an alcohol-induced thing, or it was actual ghosts.

350
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:19,260
 It's most likely that it was ghosts because after this all happened,

351
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,960
 she started telling people about it.

352
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,460
 When people came out and looked at her house, like old property lines there,

353
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:31,360
 you could see bullet holes from the direction where the natives were shooting from.

354
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,360
 Now it's not like her house was Swiss cheese and had much bullets in it,

355
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,960
 but like the fence posts and stuff like that that was older would have...

356
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,260
 Wait, it's that's...

357
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:45,660
 Okay, now I'm calling BS on that because who has a fence post from pre-Civil War?

358
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,060
 Still in their house in the 1960s.

359
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,160
 I don't know about that.

360
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,260
 Maybe they found some bullet holes in a tree and it's just been...

361
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,960
 sexed up to make it sound like there's bullet holes in her house,

362
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,060
 'cause it said bullet holes in her property.

363
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:01,460
 Hmm, I'm a little suspicious of that detail because I think most of that stuff wouldn't last very long.

364
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:08,460
 But anyway, so there were reports too of conflicts between natives and settlers in that area.

365
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,560
 I think it's interesting that you did have the Black Dude leading them,

366
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:16,660
 but it would kind of make sense at the same time because if he was either a veteran from the Civil War,

367
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,560
 it would be more likely that he was a veteran from the Civil War who headed west

368
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:25,860
 and maybe just had a beef to pick with all the people out there, joined a native tribe,

369
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,860
 you know, and led them.

370
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,960
 I mean, that's kind of a cool story.

371
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,460
 It's lost to history, whatever it is.

372
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,460
 If this ghost sightings real, his story and that tribe story and that final standoff,

373
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,660
 that's all been completely lost to history.

374
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,360
 It's also possible that what she saw was a time slip

375
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:45,060
 where they weren't necessarily ghosts because that's a long time for ghost activity, 15 minutes.

376
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,760
 It's possible that what she was seeing was either a recording,

377
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,160
 like a psychic recording of an event that happened there before

378
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,060
 or she was actually looking into the past and seeing that,

379
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:01,760
 which makes me wonder that if in 2019, if you lived in a house across the street

380
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,460
 from that woman's house and you looked out your window one night,

381
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:13,060
 would you see her from the 1960s staring in fear at nothing in her front yard?

382
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:18,660
 Portal Road, don't name places Portal Road because you will see stuff back in time

383
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:23,160
 or slimmers or all sorts of nonsense, but we're not done with Lone Pine Mountain

384
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,960
 because I talked a little bit about the settlers earlier.

385
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,260
 That story is nothing.

386
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:32,760
 I think the story is interesting, but that story is really nothing as far as where we're going now.

387
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,360
 In 1878, a bunch of settlers were traveling through the area.

388
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,160
 They're a little late for the gold rush, but, you know, late's better than never.

389
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,260
 Father Justice Martinez is traveling.

390
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:48,460
 It's a Spanish caravan of settlers and they end up setting up camp for a night.

391
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,960
 Now, Father Justice kept this, which is a pretty badass name, honestly,

392
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,460
 but Father Justice kept this, actually, I think it'd be Father Martinez,

393
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,160
 but Father Justice is better.

394
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,860
 Justice was writing this log, writing this journal, is what they're normally called,

395
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,360
 and he's writing this journal one night.

396
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,160
 Now, this night, the settlers were so happy they were almost at their journey's end.

397
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,360
 They said, "Let's have a party."

398
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,060
 And someone else said, "No."

399
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,960
 "No, no, no, no, party. We're almost at our long journey's end.

400
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,260
 Let's have an orgy of destruction."

401
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:24,160
 So they begin chopping down trees and setting them all on fire, creating this huge bonfire.

402
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,360
 Now, orgy wasn't just a word I came up with.

403
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,160
 It was actually a word that was in Father Justice's journal.

404
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,660
 I don't think it was a sexual orgy because there was a bunch of kids there, too.

405
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,460
 I think it was just this.

406
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,660
 I think the word orgy was just like an out of control party.

407
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,960
 But as this party started raging on and the fire got bigger and bigger,

408
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,860
 Father Justice got a little scared of the events and retreated to his tent.

409
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:54,060
 Father Justice is found wandering around Lone Pine Mountain, dehydrated and starving.

410
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,460
 He's found by another group of settlers and they're like, "Yo, dude, what's the matter?"

411
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:03,860
 He's like, "Uh, water. Water collapses."

412
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,860
 That's weird.

413
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,860
 Maybe he needs some water. I don't know.

414
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:11,460
 Actually, he'd be "Agua, agua" and collapse.

415
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,660
 But anyways, for historical accuracy, that's what he said.

416
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:22,060
 When he comes to them, when he does regain his senses, they go, "Why are we just wandering around in the mountain by yourself, priest?"

417
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:25,460
 And he's like, "Padre is what I'm normally called."

418
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,860
 But I wasn't with myself.

419
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,460
 I'm never with myself. Jesus always walks alongside me.

420
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,660
 Now, he goes, "I wasn't by myself? I came with a bunch of settlers."

421
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,360
 And they're like, "Well, where are they? Should we go look for them?"

422
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,860
 And he's like, "No, don't go look for them. Don't go look for them."

423
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:46,660
 In his journal, this is what he said happened. And this is what he told people.

424
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:51,660
 Party got bigger and bigger and bigger. He retreated to his tent and he closed the flaps.

425
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:59,060
 And at that point, he began to hear horrible shrieking from outside of his tent.

426
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:05,660
 I didn't realize this story both involves people in tents. I didn't realize that until I started getting into the segment.

427
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,660
 He hears his whore.

428
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:13,460
 [whore howling]

429
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,960
 Sound coming down.

430
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,160
 Coming down and from inside of his tent in a very dramatic fashion,

431
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:27,660
 he sees these silhouettes against the flames of the fire, these large shadow creatures.

432
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:34,660
 With bat-like wings sweeping down into the camp and tearing the people of pieces.

433
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:40,660
 [whore howling]

434
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:45,160
 People are screaming. These creatures are moving through the campground looking for their next meal.

435
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,160
 [whore howling]

436
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,260
 Ripping limbs from bodies.

437
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,060
 Multiple monsters are here.

438
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,860
 Not like the Wolfman and the Mummy, but I mean there's a bunch of winged demons.

439
00:21:54,860 --> 00:22:01,160
 It's not just like one or two. It's a good size to mount, eating them up.

440
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,960
 He wrote in his journal, "My God, my God, they are all gone.

441
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,560
 The winged demons have risen.

442
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:13,160
 What sin have they committed against each other and thy sacred earth?

443
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:18,860
 May thy forgiving Lord not abandon their souls which were taken from them into the depths of hell,

444
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:24,060
 and through the earthly fires of man, a soul tree remained on the mountain's peak.

445
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:30,060
 And the devils that spared me returned to the refuge of the lone pine on the mountain."

446
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:35,960
 There are cases today, people say. We'll get to this in a second, but there are cases even today

447
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:41,360
 where people go missing. You have travelers, entire families, prospectors, who go missing

448
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,260
 and when they are eventually finally found, their face is eaten off.

449
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:52,260
 Their torso is eaten of pieces, but all the other meat there is left to rot.

450
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:58,060
 So normally predators will go for like soft tissue, like meaty thighs and juicy biceps.

451
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,660
 These men are just eating your torso like right to the bone,

452
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,760
 but leaving your belly full of those tasty intestines.

453
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,660
 I've heard, I haven't tried it myself.

454
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:11,560
 Or they'll just eat your face off and leave your skeleton, like a glaring skeleton face

455
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,860
 staring up at the sun as it bleaches your bones.

456
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:18,560
 There have been no photographs of what they're called. They're called the lone pine devils.

457
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:23,260
 There have been no photographs of these creatures or cryptids or demons.

458
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:28,160
 But many, many stories of sightings of them from back in times of the natives

459
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:33,560
 to the story of Father Justice to today, people seeing these winged creatures.

460
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:39,760
 Now, it's an interesting story. It really relies on one thing.

461
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:45,260
 The story of Father Justice Martinez. And again, this is something that I've run into a lot.

462
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:52,060
 I've seen that story and that last journal entry repeated over and over and over again on these websites.

463
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:55,060
 But there's no proof that he ever existed.

464
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:59,460
 Like, I wasn't able to find any other excerpts from. He might have.

465
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:06,060
 But normally you would see other excerpts from, you would see other websites kind of cover it from a different angle

466
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:09,560
 and say, "Father Martinez was born here and this is where he was coming from.

467
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:13,460
 They'd give more information, but they were all repeating the same details.

468
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:18,360
 His name, the year it happened, the fact that he was found parched and his journal entry."

469
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:23,660
 I think it's most likely a legend because I can understand people having a big bonfire,

470
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,860
 but to burn every tree on a mountain except for one, it takes...

471
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,260
 I don't think you can even do that in Minecraft.

472
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,960
 You know how long it takes to chop down every single tree on a mountain?

473
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,760
 It's not like there was just four trees and they chopped down three of them.

474
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,060
 They had such a huge bonfire that they chopped them all down.

475
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,860
 That's Paul Bunyan-level legend stuff.

476
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,760
 And the reason why it's called Lone Pine Mountain is because they chopped down all the trees on the mountain

477
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,360
 except for the one at the top.

478
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,260
 I mean, that's shit.

479
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,060
 What were they doing like was the camp at the bottom

480
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,960
 and they were just letting the logs roll down towards the camp

481
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,060
 and everyone was just having to jump out of the way.

482
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,760
 What I think happened, it was a legend that was created to explain

483
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,660
 why there was only one tree on that mountain.

484
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:05,160
 That all being said, I think that there probably...

485
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:11,160
 If there is something like a lone mountain devil,

486
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,860
 if it is a real type of creature, it would be an interesting sort of cryptid.

487
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,160
 We run into these from time to time.

488
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:22,660
 We covered one when we were talking about the South American shape-shifting women, that episode,

489
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:28,160
 where you have a cryptid that is dedicated to protecting the environment.

490
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,960
 More specifically, their environment.

491
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,060
 But it kind of is an interesting angle.

492
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:37,060
 We, as humans, tend to overdevelop land

493
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:40,060
 and we push into Cougar territory.

494
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,160
 We start building houses there

495
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,460
 and then we build running trails and parks and stuff like that.

496
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,960
 And then five, six years after they start doing all this stuff,

497
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,660
 everyone freaks out when there's a Cougar walking through the neighborhood

498
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,660
 and they're like, "Oh my God, this has never happened."

499
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:56,260
 Yeah, because the neighborhood wasn't there before.

500
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:00,560
 And because you keep pushing further and further into Cougar territory,

501
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,860
 it's going to start coming into yours.

502
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:07,860
 I think it's interesting though that there could be a cryptid or a spirit

503
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,560
 because the Native Americans were always really like,

504
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,760
 "Hey, don't go up on that mountain, dude.

505
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,060
 Don't build a house up there. Bad stuff's going to happen."

506
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:19,660
 I think it's interesting when you have these forces of nature that fight back.

507
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,560
 In Iceland, there's this big thing that before they do roadworks,

508
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,660
 they have to talk to the elves.

509
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,160
 That's a bit of an oversimplification.

510
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,760
 It's not before they do any...

511
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,660
 They're like, "I really want to paint this crosswalk.

512
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,660
 Better go talk to an elf."

513
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:35,260
 But they've tried building highways and there is this giant rock there.

514
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,160
 And they could...

515
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,060
 All their construction equipment kept breaking

516
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,360
 as they were trying to build this freeway.

517
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,160
 They wanted to build it like through the rock,

518
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,760
 not through the rock, but like around the rock or move the rock

519
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,160
 and all their construction equipment kept breaking.

520
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,360
 And the government was like, "Dude, get a elf expert over there

521
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,060
 and they'll tell you how many elves live in that rock and we'll find out."

522
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:58,160
 And they ended up diverting the highway because there's too many elves in the rock.

523
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,960
 It's very well known in Iceland that don't go to these certain places

524
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,560
 because the elves are just going to jack up all your equipment.

525
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,660
 You don't want a jackhammer to malfunction.

526
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,660
 That's one of the...

527
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:12,560
 Or a bulldozer or anything capable of crushing a human.

528
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,360
 You...

529
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,160
 Your choice is make a deal with the elves

530
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,860
 and move your freeway or just keep trying to use that jackhammer.

531
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,660
 Make a deal with the elves.

532
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:25,260
 And it's very well known in Iceland that, yeah, elves are going to interfere with stuff.

533
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:25,760
 So you got...

534
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,260
 It's...

535
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,760
 It's bizarre.

536
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,660
 Those are elves and they're just messing up your jackhammer.

537
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:35,860
 These creatures, if they exist, the lone pine demons,

538
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,560
 gave no warning.

539
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,960
 Nothing malfunctioned.

540
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,460
 Your hatchet didn't stop working.

541
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,960
 Your cauldron didn't get a hole in it.

542
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:50,860
 They just sat there and watched humanity keep pushing and pushing and pushing

543
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:54,860
 the limits of how much they could destroy nature in a single night.

544
00:27:54,860 --> 00:28:00,360
 And once the lone pine demons realized there was no stop.

545
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:04,060
 There was no limit to what these humans would do.

546
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,860
 Without warning, they simply ate them.

547
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,060
 Men, women and children.

548
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:16,660
 The only one they spared was the one who did not take part in the destruction of the environment.

549
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:21,460
 It's insane to think that you burned down a few trees

550
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:26,860
 and it cost the lives of 38 people within minutes.

551
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:32,360
 And then you look at the environmental damage that's being done by every community across the planet

552
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,960
 on any given day.

553
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:41,060
 What would be our fate if there are some great cryptids, some great spirit protectors

554
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:44,860
 watching over us waiting to see what our limit is?

555
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:52,860
 Climate change, global warming, hole in the ozone layer, these things could be small and minimal

556
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:58,960
 compared to the wrath of an army of spirits, an army of cryptids,

557
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:05,460
 an army of demons that have one goal to protect Mother Earth.

558
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,460
 How long would we last?

559
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,460
