1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
 When a terrifying urban legend collides with a real-life true crime, we're left to ask

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,840
 the question, "What's worse, the fantasy or the reality?"

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:20,240
 And then we travel to a high school in Arkansas, which is teaching the three Rs. Reading, Writing,

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,000
 and Reality Bending Paranormal Activity, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,320
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,320
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,480
 Hope you guys are still here after yesterday's really bizarre episode.

9
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,720
 What a way this season 19 of a feeling is going to be very, very weird.

10
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,720
 But someone who loves the world of the weird walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now

11
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,280
 is one of our newest Patreons supporters.

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,880
 Everyone give it up for Andrew Bentley.

13
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,880
 Woohoo!

14
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,880
 Yeah, come on in dude.

15
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,480
 Andrew Bentley is running into a cartwheel.

16
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,680
 He's that excited to be in Dead Rabbit Command.

17
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,960
 Andrew, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

18
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,960
 If you guys can't support the Patreon or if you guys can't do cartwheels, I can.

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,960
 That's okay too.

20
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,240
 Just help spread the word about the show.

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,960
 That really, really, really helps out a lot.

22
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,680
 Andrew, let's go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider.

23
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,040
 We're going to jump off the highest point of Dead Rabbit Command.

24
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,240
 We're going to glide all the way out to...

25
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:35,280
 Wallend, Tennessee.

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,120
 In the town of Wallend, Tennessee, this is this old urban legend.

27
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,680
 In the town of Wallend, back in the 1950s, there was a young man named Tom.

28
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,720
 Now by all accounts, he was a playboy.

29
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,480
 He was one of those guys that could charm the pants off of any woman before they were

30
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,480
 even wearing pants.

31
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,280
 This was the 1950s.

32
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,440
 You can charm the panties off of any girl.

33
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,440
 And he did.

34
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,440
 Right?

35
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,280
 He was sleeping around town, sleeping with all these beautiful girls.

36
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,280
 And they didn't mind.

37
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,280
 Right?

38
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,240
 I mean, they probably wouldn't want him to stick around a little bit longer.

39
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,880
 That was just who Tom was.

40
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,880
 Tom was a Tomcat.

41
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,520
 He was always out Tomcatting around.

42
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,000
 He was just a charmer.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,080
 But when you can have everything, when it comes that easy to you, you want what you

44
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,240
 can't have.

45
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,200
 And that's when Tom laid eyes upon Eleanor.

46
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,560
 Now Eleanor was a beautiful woman.

47
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,600
 It was actually everything he wanted in a woman, which was just a beautiful woman.

48
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,160
 This guy didn't sound too deep.

49
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,680
 He falls in love with Eleanor, but Eleanor is married.

50
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,760
 And that actually kind of turns him on even more.

51
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,120
 He's like, dude, you know, I've banged all these single chicks, but a married woman.

52
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,000
 Now that would definitely put me over as a horrible person.

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,560
 So he starts to set his eyes on Eleanor and he starts to slowly seduce her.

54
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,960
 And although she loves her husband, her love for her husband is no match for Tom's wily

55
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,960
 ways.

56
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,080
 He's an expert in seducing women.

57
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,000
 Now he knows that she's married.

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,920
 He might have made a different choice if he knew that Eleanor's husband, his job profession

59
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,600
 was a hunter.

60
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,120
 His job every morning is like, honey, I'm going to leave.

61
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,400
 He goes out in the woods and he would murder things and skin them and come back with a

62
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,360
 big old deer head and be like, here you go.

63
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,480
 And like, just give it to people.

64
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,960
 Just give deer heads to people.

65
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,240
 And then he'd sell the meat and he'd wear the skin.

66
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,560
 Actually, I don't know if he was a furry.

67
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,560
 He's dressing him as a deer.

68
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,520
 He's like, Eleanor, why don't you love me?

69
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,560
 Can't we clop together?

70
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
 He'd sell the skin.

71
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,560
 He'd sell the meat.

72
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,320
 He'd sell the antlers, whatever.

73
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,040
 But we don't know if Tom actually knew that Eleanor's husband was a hunter.

74
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,160
 I imagine if he did, he would just turn them on even more.

75
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,400
 Because this guy loves rolling the dice.

76
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,520
 So he finally does seduce Eleanor.

77
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,200
 They start sleeping together and it actually does get him off that she's married.

78
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,280
 She belongs to another man and he has possession of her now.

79
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,300
 And even when she's not with him, he has possession of her heart.

80
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,520
 And that is the way things go.

81
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,520
 But here's the thing.

82
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:12,960
 Eleanor's husband starts to get, so one night, the expert hunter who tracks things and kills

83
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,120
 him for a living tracks down Eleanor and Tom.

84
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,160
 And they're actually at a local lover's lane in Wallend.

85
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,240
 The hunter is walking through the bushes.

86
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,960
 He ambushes them.

87
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,400
 He gets to the car and sure enough, he sees Tom and Eleanor.

88
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,400
 What is that?

89
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,240
 Enflonco, Domenco or something like that?

90
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,920
 They're having sex.

91
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,960
 And he starts beating up Tom and drags him out of the car.

92
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,160
 Now at this point, Tom realizes the game is up and he starts to beg and plead with the

93
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,160
 husband.

94
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,280
 I didn't know she was married.

95
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,320
 I didn't know she was married, but he knows that's not true.

96
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,960
 And really, the husband doesn't care at that point.

97
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,960
 He's like, "Oh, I'm sorry.

98
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,960
 You didn't know she was married?"

99
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,480
 Well, then I'll let bygones be bygones.

100
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:07,160
 He drags out Tom and he makes Eleanor watch.

101
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,160
 She has no choice.

102
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,360
 She can't really leave the scenario.

103
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,000
 If she does, you know, same thing's going to happen to her.

104
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,360
 The husband says, "Eleanor, you got to watch this."

105
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,360
 And he takes this big hunting knife, this knife that he used to skin animals out on

106
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,360
 the middle of the woods.

107
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,520
 Now they're in the middle of the woods of this lover's lane.

108
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,780
 And with this knife, he slowly, because you wouldn't want this to be over quickly, he slowly

109
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,880
 skins Tom alive.

110
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,880
 Oh, no!

111
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,880
 No, not that piece of skin.

112
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,480
 That's my favorite piece of skin.

113
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,080
 Okay, now that that's gone, but not more of my skin.

114
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,080
 No!

115
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,080
 And he takes off all of Tom's skin.

116
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,640
 And Eleanor is forced to watch as he brutally mutilates her lover.

117
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,640
 Now there's different versions of the story.

118
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:59,840
 One is a slightly realistic version where he skins him and then Tom is just this, like,

119
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,840
 muscular dude all covered in blood.

120
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,480
 He got buffed because of it.

121
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,640
 He's like, "Oh, the skin was holding me back.

122
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,960
 My true form."

123
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,440
 You know, like his muscle tissue.

124
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,600
 All he is is bloody muscle tissue.

125
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,920
 He's still like, "No, like he doesn't have eyelids or anything anymore.

126
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,440
 He's like no lips and stuff like that."

127
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,200
 He's like, "Ah, technically that wasn't skin.

128
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,520
 You should have left those on."

129
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:24,880
 He's just this muscular or this man of, he's just exposed muscle and blood and nerve endings

130
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,360
 and he's scrolling around on the dirt.

131
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,400
 And then there's like a pile of skin, right?

132
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,040
 Then there's a less believable version.

133
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,080
 I mean, I'm sure that can happen.

134
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,120
 There's a less believable version where this guy is such an expert skinner that he is able

135
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,200
 to remove the skin as one piece.

136
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:50,000
 So he actually, basically like he unzips Tom and pull, can you do this?

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,600
 I know you can do this with rabbits.

138
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,080
 You can pull their skin off and then you pull it off like a glove.

139
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,280
 So you're actually holding the rabbit skin.

140
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,280
 I don't think you can do that with human skin.

141
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,280
 And I'm not going to go, I'm not going to go to like Bess Gore or Rotten or whatever

142
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,120
 to find out.

143
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,480
 But there's one version where there's just a bunch of pieces of trash you're slowly

144
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,480
 throwing up in the corner.

145
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,560
 You're like, "Why did I eat a roast beef sandwich today?"

146
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,320
 And listen to Dead Rabbit Radio.

147
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:19,560
 There's either a pile of little slices of human skin sitting in the dirt or there's

148
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,360
 an entire suit of human skin because the husband goes, "Shh!"

149
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,080
 And just perfectly takes it off and he's like holding up the skin and he throws it over

150
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,080
 a branch.

151
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,720
 It's like a Tom suit just hanging there.

152
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,240
 And then we still get the muscle bound.

153
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,840
 Why do I keep saying why?

154
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,960
 I keep imagining it was Armstrong and I go, "The exposed muscle bloody guy rolling around

155
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,960
 in the dirt."

156
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,960
 One of the two.

157
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,240
 And it's likely that he'd have to be slowly cutting the skin off and taking little strips.

158
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,000
 And he's like, "I'm going to have bacon when I get home while this always makes me so hungry."

159
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,880
 But anyways, either way, he makes Eleanor watch this.

160
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,120
 And then he takes Eleanor and he goes to the local police station and turns himself in

161
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,680
 and says, "Yeah, I skinned Tom alive.

162
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,080
 I'm assuming he's still alive.

163
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,080
 He's still alive."

164
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,800
 And I did expose him to the elements of no skin.

165
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,480
 He's been riding around in the dirt for the last hour.

166
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,480
 He's still up there though.

167
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,600
 The officers went up there.

168
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,120
 He was gone.

169
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,120
 He was gone.

170
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,320
 His skin was still there hanging from a branch or just a pile of little pieces of the skin.

171
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,200
 But he wasn't.

172
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,080
 His body was gone.

173
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,600
 And so here's the urban legend.

174
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,560
 It's the story of skinned Tom.

175
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,000
 In the town of Wall in Tennessee, they tell their kids, "Watch out for skinned Tom."

176
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,120
 He hides out in the lover's lanes.

177
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,520
 He hides out in the woods where teenagers will park their car late at night and make

178
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,400
 out, make whoopee.

179
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,920
 And that's okay, right?

180
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,800
 Skinned Tom isn't totally opposed to that.

181
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:55,240
 If you're having consensual sex with another single person, if you're doing that, there's

182
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,480
 just a skinless man sitting in the bushes nodding approvingly.

183
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:05,080
 But if you go out to lover's lane and you're with another man's girl or another girl's

184
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:11,240
 man, skinned Tom will come out of the bushes with no skin.

185
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,200
 He still has no skin.

186
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,200
 But he has the same hunting knife that the man used to tear it off.

187
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,800
 And with that knife, he'll start attacking your car.

188
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,520
 Be like, "Ahh, I'll be all bloody and stuff."

189
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,520
 And I get it.

190
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,080
 Actually, I don't know anything about it.

191
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,920
 There's no reports of him like attacking a human or skinning another person.

192
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,080
 So basically, the moral of the story isn't, don't cheat.

193
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,000
 The moral of the story is if you're going to cheat on someone, keep your windows rolled

194
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,360
 up so a bloody man can't get in your car.

195
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,720
 And you'll probably need to go to the car wash later because there'll be blood stuff

196
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,360
 all over your car, bloody and maybe some scratches on it.

197
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,640
 You're like, "Dude, watch the paint job.

198
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,400
 All I'm doing is having sex with this other man's girlfriend."

199
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,200
 That's the story of Skinned Tom, this urban legend of this guy.

200
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,080
 It's a really interesting urban legend because we talk about this a lot on the show.

201
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,280
 Urban legends in a lot of these stories, they try to tell us something.

202
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,520
 Whenever you hear stories about monsters in the water, watch out because out in the water

203
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,520
 there's a witch.

204
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,520
 She'll drown you.

205
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:15,840
 It's a story to keep kids from mucking around in the water for going too deep in the water.

206
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,080
 Stories about spirits in the woods that will whisk away young men, basically the moral is

207
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,600
 don't muck about in the woods.

208
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,200
 After it gets dark, don't go through the woods.

209
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,200
 You're going to get lost.

210
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,120
 And the best way to tell that's just like the boogie man.

211
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,240
 You tell kids, "Make sure you go to bed before 7pm or the boogie man's going to get you."

212
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,720
 You can say that or you can say, "Go to bed before 7pm."

213
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,240
 They'll be like, "I'm not going to listen to you."

214
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,840
 But they will listen to the boogie man.

215
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,400
 Fear is a great motivator.

216
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,000
 This though, don't go up to lovers lane.

217
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,520
 This isn't trying to caution teens from going out into the middle of nowhere and having sex.

218
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,040
 The people of Wall in Tennessee are fine with that.

219
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,800
 They're saying, "Don't cheat."

220
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,680
 So it's really, really interesting variation on that.

221
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:01,800
 The moral is don't cheat, which is a good moral, but you think skinned Tom would just

222
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,160
 attack everyone and then you'd have probably less people going up to lovers lane.

223
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,040
 I wonder if those are still even a thing.

224
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,960
 I wonder if kids are still driving their cars up into the bushes and making out like nowadays

225
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,720
 that you probably just get a hotel room or just go over to someone's house.

226
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,720
 I don't know.

227
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,720
 I don't know.

228
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,440
 I've never walked up to a teenager and go, "How do you guys have sex these days?"

229
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,760
 Lovers lanes, I don't know if it's still a thing, but apparently if you are doing that,

230
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,760
 you have to watch out.

231
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,560
 Now, I wanted to cover that story for two reasons.

232
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,600
 One, because I love urban legends.

233
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
 Actually, three reasons.

234
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,760
 One, I love urban legends.

235
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,680
 Two, this one has a song associated with it.

236
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,680
 It's always nice.

237
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,960
 Here's skinned Tom's song.

238
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,800
 Have you seen the ghost of...

239
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,200
 It wasn't actually sheet music for this.

240
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,080
 I don't know what the tune is, but...

241
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,680
 Have you seen the ghost of skinned Tom?

242
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,560
 Bloody red bones with the skin all gone.

243
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,760
 Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

244
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,080
 Wouldn't it be chilly with no skin on?

245
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,240
 Wouldn't it be chilly with no skin on?

246
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,600
 I'm gonna give it a B. I'm gonna give it a B for effort.

247
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,920
 I do find it pretty weird that a man who was brutally murdered, skinned alive and left

248
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,240
 for dead.

249
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,200
 And then when the authorities came, his body was gone.

250
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,600
 So the idea that he just ran off into the forest and he's there to this day.

251
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,400
 The worst thing you can think of, it's cold.

252
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,320
 It's the worst thing you can think of, not the exposed nerve endings.

253
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,600
 Not the fact that every night he has to fight coyotes and wolves from eating his tendons.

254
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
 No.

255
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,600
 It's that it's a little chilly.

256
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,600
 Did you know that?

257
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,040
 If you have no skin, you might get cold.

258
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,200
 The second reason, or third reason I wanted to cover this, is that when I was reading

259
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,000
 this, I was on the edge of my seat.

260
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,480
 I was at Lover's Lane at the time.

261
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,720
 I was like, "Oh no.

262
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,000
 Hope skinned Tom doesn't come from me."

263
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,560
 I was reading this and the whole time I was thinking of a true crime story.

264
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,960
 "Andrew, let's jump off another peak here.

265
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,040
 We're taking the hair hang glider all the way out to New Hampshire."

266
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:04,840
 Specifically, we're headed to the New Hampshire, Massachusetts border.

267
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,600
 This happened back in September of 2020.

268
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,880
 The case just really came to a close about two months ago.

269
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,440
 But very creepy story.

270
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,400
 And really, it shows that the urban legends, like when we come up with these stories, there

271
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,600
 may be some truth to it.

272
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,440
 I don't think a man was actually skinned alive, but there probably was a guy named Tom who

273
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,440
 was sleeping around with a bunch of women and probably ran afoul of somebody.

274
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,720
 But there's no historical documentation.

275
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,560
 There was actually this gruesome murder.

276
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,240
 I said it took place in the 1950s.

277
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,440
 The story is always decades ago.

278
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,280
 So as time goes on, it'll probably take place in the 80s and the 90s and stuff like that.

279
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,000
 Back in September of 2020, we know this happened for a fact.

280
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,880
 There was a guy named Armando Barron.

281
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,600
 He was 30 years old.

282
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,800
 And he found out his wife, Brittany Barron, 31.

283
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,320
 So these people are fairly young, right?

284
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,200
 30, 31.

285
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:55,560
 Armando Barron found out that his wife, Brittany Barron, was texting another man named Jonathan

286
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,680
 Amaralt, a 25-year-old kid, 25 years old.

287
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,800
 And Armando got super jealous.

288
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,560
 There was no proof that I could see that Brittany and Jonathan were actually sleeping together,

289
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,160
 but it was very flirtatious texting.

290
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,160
 Or maybe not.

291
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,640
 Again, we don't have a ton of information on what the texts were, but it doesn't matter.

292
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,520
 It could have been like, "Hey, can I get directions to the nearest Chipotle?"

293
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,600
 Or it could have been very flirtatious.

294
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,840
 Armando did not want his wife talking to anyone.

295
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:29,240
 So he actually got her phone and sent these texts to Jonathan luring him out to this area,

296
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,800
 the New Hampshire, Massachusetts border.

297
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,400
 And he took Brittany with him.

298
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,680
 So you have Armando and Brittany are driving out there and they meet.

299
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:44,000
 Jonathan, he pulls up and Armando ambushes them and beats them up and then shoots him

300
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,320
 to death in Jonathan's own car.

301
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,720
 So Jonathan is sitting now in his passenger seat dead.

302
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:58,000
 He forces his wife, Brittany, to then drive Jonathan's car.

303
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,800
 And Armando goes, "I'm going to follow you the whole way.

304
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,280
 We're going to drive out to this remote campsite."

305
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:08,240
 So Brittany is now driving a car and this story is super dark red like the skin-tongue thing.

306
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,360
 It's kind of light-hearted.

307
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,320
 We don't even know if it's true, but this is Brittany's driving the car with this guy,

308
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,160
 this dead body next to her, right?

309
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,040
 At the very least, a friend of hers.

310
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,280
 And she was casually texting him that who knows, there could have been more.

311
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:25,960
 But anyways, she's driving the car, this dead body, this freshly killed body is on the passenger

312
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,240
 seat.

313
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:36,280
 They get to the campsite and Armando makes Brittany chop off Jonathan's head.

314
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,800
 And then he says, "You need to dispose of the body."

315
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,520
 It's your job to dispose of the body and he gets in his car and drives away.

316
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,440
 So Brittany is left in the middle of nowhere.

317
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,520
 She's like 220 miles away from their home at this remote campsite.

318
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,800
 She has now decapitated her friend.

319
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,320
 She has to dispose of the body.

320
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,960
 And the way that we know about this is some fish and game officers were walking around

321
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,960
 the camping area.

322
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,160
 She stayed out there for a couple of days.

323
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,800
 She took his car and like covered it up with a tarp.

324
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,840
 But I mean, that's her only ride, right?

325
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,320
 There's a bunch of blood everywhere.

326
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,640
 There's still a body in it.

327
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,800
 She's not very good at disposing of bodies.

328
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,960
 You know, traditionally you bury them.

329
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:18,040
 And she's up at this campsite and the car is covered up in this tarp and fish and game

330
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,480
 officers are like talking to her and they're, you know, making sure like she has all of

331
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,360
 her paperwork to be camping and all the permits, stuff like that.

332
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,760
 And they see this big, see this car sized tarp and they go and they look at it and they

333
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,240
 find this decapitated young man.

334
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,640
 Now she actually says that that was the story that she said that I was forced to decapitate

335
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,880
 him.

336
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,680
 And she was, she got it.

337
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:45,720
 She's already, she pled guilty to like dispose all the corpse or it's like there's a certain

338
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:51,360
 crime where you abuse of a corpse, where you don't bury it properly, where you kind of

339
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,880
 mutilate it afterwards.

340
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,840
 She's pled guilty to that and then she testified against Armando.

341
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,320
 She's already out on parole.

342
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,760
 She's already done, but Armando was just found guilty in May of 2022 and he faces life in

343
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,360
 prison without parole.

344
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,840
 His defense is she was an active part of the crime.

345
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,760
 But again, I mean, even if her story isn't 100% accurate, he's the one who pulled the

346
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,760
 trigger.

347
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,680
 So she might have probably have, I don't know actually, because I only know the, her side

348
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,080
 of the story, but creepy.

349
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:25,200
 Again, when I was reading this urban legend, there's no song for the Armando story.

350
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,480
 It's not like you saw some Texan, he got really mad.

351
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,320
 So we got a big knife and made another man sad.

352
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,320
 Like there's no song to that.

353
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,400
 It's true life thing.

354
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,880
 When I was reading the skin Tom thing, I was like, dude, this stuff happens in real life.

355
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,640
 Just like she was forced, Eleanor was forced to watch Tom get skinned alive.

356
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,680
 She was forced to watch this man get shot, her friend get shot, and then she was forced

357
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,360
 to chop the dude's head off.

358
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,440
 Absolutely crazy story.

359
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:58,480
 Even those urban legends that seem horrific, that seem unbelievable.

360
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,480
 They're believable.

361
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,040
 I mean, pulling someone's skin off like a glove.

362
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,280
 Again, I don't know how believable that is, but you have these love triangles that turn.

363
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,360
 I honestly think the Armando story is more brutal, right?

364
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,680
 Because he made her chop his head off.

365
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,400
 Like what a brutal way to end that relationship, right?

366
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,560
 You're chopping off your own friend's head.

367
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,560
 Terrifying.

368
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:26,600
 These urban legends can be creepy, but the real life counterparts are just horrifying.

369
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,480
 The real life counterpart happened and it happened just a couple of years ago.

370
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,480
 So absolutely terrifying.

371
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,400
 Andrew, let's go ahead and call in this carboner copter.

372
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,560
 I wonder if you'll get any stories about hauntings in that campsite, because this was a fairly

373
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,240
 big news story because it was so grim.

374
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,680
 So I wonder if you'll ever hear stories about like a headless corpse at that campsite.

375
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,680
 Who knows?

376
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,680
 Who knows?

377
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,280
 I'm not going to find out.

378
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,600
 That sounds absolutely terrifying.

379
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
 That story is really creepy.

380
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,160
 Andrew, go ahead and call in that carboner copter.

381
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,800
 We're leaving behind this campsite.

382
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:08,640
 You're headed all the way out to Jonesboro, Arkansas.

383
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,360
 In Jonesboro, Arkansas, there's a high school called Nettleton High School.

384
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,000
 And specifically, we're not necessarily going to be walking around the whole school.

385
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,440
 All of the events we're going to be talking about are around one building.

386
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,440
 Raider Gym.

387
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,440
 Raider Gym.

388
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,760
 That sounds actually like a GI joke figure.

389
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,760
 It's a gym.

390
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,760
 Like a gymnasium.

391
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,760
 Raider Gym.

392
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,760
 Raider Gymnasium.

393
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,160
 It was built in the 1970s.

394
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:40,760
 And this gym already has a ton of stories around it.

395
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,240
 And again, this is one of those stories where we're going to start off looking at the legend

396
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,440
 and then we're going to look at some concrete examples.

397
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,720
 People have come forward and kind of put their reputation on the line to talk about this.

398
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,840
 But let's look at the legend.

399
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:57,520
 This is how I came across it was on this website, one of my favorite websites, theshadowlands.net.

400
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,640
 The story goes like this.

401
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,080
 On October 30th, in an unspecified year.

402
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:10,320
 So sometime between the 1970s and shadowlands.net, it really is from 2015, I think, is when they

403
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,320
 stopped updating it.

404
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,080
 So, 1970s to 2015, we have this story.

405
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:20,640
 The day before Halloween, there was a bunch of members of the band in Raider Gym.

406
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,480
 Now this was, there was no other students there at this time.

407
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,480
 This was early in the morning.

408
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,400
 Another person in the vicinity was the janitor, who currently wasn't in the gym.

409
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,480
 And this gymnasium, it has like the basketball courts and the bleachers.

410
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,800
 And then it has a bunch of rooms built into it.

411
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,440
 I actually really went in depth on this one.

412
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,680
 I watched a bunch of videos about this place.

413
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,840
 We'll get into that in a second.

414
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,320
 But they have like upstairs rooms and rooms underneath the bleachers.

415
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,360
 And they have like a weight room and the boys and girls locker rooms and offices and all

416
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,480
 that stuff.

417
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,040
 And one of these rooms is where band members put their equipment.

418
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,080
 And on this particular morning, you had these band members, they were putting their equipment

419
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,080
 away.

420
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,920
 And while they are in their room underneath the bleachers, putting this equipment away,

421
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:09,000
 they hear a blood-curdling scream come from the gymnasium.

422
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,480
 Now, they're literally a door away.

423
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,560
 This is, they go underneath the bleachers, they go into this room, they're putting their

424
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,560
 stuff away.

425
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:21,240
 So maybe like 20, 30 feet away, they hear this horrifying scream.

426
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,760
 So they all run out to see what it is.

427
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,040
 It's one of those screams that you know someone's in trouble.

428
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,520
 They all run out, the gymnasium is empty.

429
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,840
 Now they realize it's the day before Halloween, someone's probably pulling a prank.

430
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,360
 Ha ha, real funny guys.

431
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,720
 They go back in because they're not done putting their gear away.

432
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,640
 They go back into the band room.

433
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,320
 They hear the screaming again.

434
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,720
 But this time it's not just a nondescript screaming.

435
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,760
 It's clearly someone screaming out, "Stop!

436
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,760
 Stop it!

437
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,760
 Stop it!"

438
00:21:53,760 --> 00:22:03,440
 Like it's actually begging someone or something to stop assaulting them.

439
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,280
 They run back out into the gymnasium.

440
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:12,280
 It's completely empty.

441
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,520
 There's another story of this gymnasium.

442
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,520
 Now we're late at night.

443
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,960
 That first one was early in the morning.

444
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,880
 That's an interesting thing about this phenomenon.

445
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,840
 As we go deeper into it you'll see time does not matter here.

446
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,960
 Late at night these band members were at school.

447
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,640
 They were having some sort of band party.

448
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,000
 I know, I know, probably sound super exciting.

449
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,200
 "Whoa dude, did you bring your trumpet?

450
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,360
 Let's sit around and play on the tuba and stuff."

451
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,240
 I can't imagine anything more boring than a high school band party.

452
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,600
 But anyways, whoa dude we had so much fun.

453
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,200
 We cleaned our reeds and everything.

454
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
 Band party.

455
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,320
 They're having a band party at the school and a couple of the band members said, "Hey,

456
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,320
 let's go to the gym.

457
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,960
 Let's go hang out in the gym."

458
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,160
 And a couple of the band members came into the gym to kind of hang out to goof off.

459
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,680
 And then they split up into two groups.

460
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:05,440
 So you had a specific group of these band party members go into the cheerleading room.

461
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,120
 Again, there's a lot of little rooms in this gymnasium.

462
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:14,400
 There was a room where the cheerleaders hung out or undressed or something like that.

463
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,200
 They would go into there.

464
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,760
 And when they walked in, it was freezing cold in that room.

465
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,800
 Absolutely bone freezing cold.

466
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,800
 It's late at night.

467
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
 It's a school.

468
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,800
 Who knows if the AC has been working?

469
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,800
 Who knows, right?

470
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,000
 Totally explainable.

471
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,880
 This is an interesting part of the phenomenon.

472
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,400
 They're in these rooms all the time.

473
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,680
 I mean the band members aren't in the cheerleading room all the time, right?

474
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,360
 Nerds, get out of here.

475
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,600
 But rooms are rooms.

476
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,920
 Rooms are laid out to be functional.

477
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,400
 They walk into the cheerleading room.

478
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,520
 It's pitch black.

479
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,520
 It's freezing cold.

480
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,200
 It's pitch black.

481
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,640
 And they couldn't find the light switch.

482
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,200
 Now we know where a light switch is on in a room.

483
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,080
 It's always on the wall to your right or to your left when you first walk in.

484
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,080
 It's right by the door.

485
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,000
 Now there are some rooms, yes, that have it on the opposing wall in some place.

486
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,960
 But all these other rooms have a very easy to find light switch.

487
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,920
 The light switch for all intents and purposes did not exist in this room.

488
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,680
 You go, Jason, again, it's super cold.

489
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,240
 Maybe they couldn't find the light switch because it's dark.

490
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,520
 Okay, sure, sure enough.

491
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,000
 But we've also uncovered stuff.

492
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,280
 We talk about on this podcast the black bedroom phenomenon.

493
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,280
 The people go into rooms that aren't just dark.

494
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,280
 They're nothingness.

495
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,640
 Now I'm not saying this cheerleading room is part of the black bedroom phenomenon.

496
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,200
 But again, we have this thing where something that should be there, that they know where

497
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,640
 it's at in every other room in this gymnasium.

498
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,320
 They can't find the switch.

499
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:44,800
 And while they are in there, they hear screaming coming from the gym.

500
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:50,120
 And this screaming isn't just a scream.

501
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:58,560
 This is a scream of such intense violence and in such intense pain.

502
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,560
 That's how they describe it.

503
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,960
 They don't say, "Oh, it just sounded like someone screamed."

504
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:08,120
 You go, this was a--this is the scream of someone who was violently being murdered.

505
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,680
 They rush out into the gym and they don't see the source of the screaming.

506
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:23,720
 When they run out into the gym, what they see is leaves falling from the ceiling.

507
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:30,040
 They said it was if you were standing underneath a tree on an autumn day.

508
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:38,080
 These leaves were materializing out of nowhere, falling onto the gymnasium floor.

509
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,200
 That's a really creepy visual, right?

510
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,600
 That's a really, really creepy visual when you have stuff coming out of nowhere like

511
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,640
 that.

512
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,560
 In ghostly phenomenon, it does track.

513
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:51,800
 In part of the lore, that ghost coins, people will report coins falling.

514
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,080
 We've covered that kind of just in passing on the show.

515
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,680
 It's a pretty popular phenomenon.

516
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,040
 It's not super common, but it's also not super rare.

517
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,360
 The difference is that a coin is an inanimate object.

518
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:06,640
 The idea is that maybe the ghost had taken the coin from somewhere else or maybe it was

519
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,160
 materializing from somewhere else.

520
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:13,200
 A leaf is a living thing or a byproduct of a living thing.

521
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,080
 Where were these leaves coming from?

522
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,440
 Why were they falling here?

523
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,040
 It's a very creepy imagery, right?

524
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,480
 You can discount the freezing cold room.

525
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,880
 You can discount them not finding the light.

526
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,080
 I do think it was part of the paranormal phenomenon.

527
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:32,840
 The leaves though are something that I can't recall something like this in a previous episode,

528
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,840
 right?

529
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,400
 We've had ghost coins, but a byproduct of a living thing appearing.

530
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:44,080
 I can't say that I've never heard of it before, but this is definitely a rare phenomenon.

531
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,280
 What's really interesting, so that right there, I just found absolutely fascinating.

532
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,960
 I would have talked about that stuff anyways.

533
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,440
 I find that a very interesting phenomenon.

534
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,920
 But again, I kept digging into this and I found out, I got to give a shout out to Nettleton

535
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,920
 Television.

536
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,800
 Apparently, this is a official school.

537
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:08,320
 I think it's like a student run television or YouTube channel.

538
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,320
 They do programming, right?

539
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:14,640
 I think it's like an AV club type of thing, but very much more professional than what

540
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,800
 we had when I was in high school.

541
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,920
 You have school newspapers and you have school yearbooks.

542
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,640
 That's what I think in Nettleton Television is.

543
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,920
 I'm probably going to do some more research on that.

544
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,720
 What actually reached out to them, right?

545
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,720
 I saw that they had put a trailer up about the ghost of Raider Jim.

546
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,960
 They put this trailer up and they said, "Yeah, here's the trailer.

547
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,040
 We're going to have a documentary coming out soon."

548
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:40,800
 That trailer was posted in 2013 and I reached out to their Facebook page.

549
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,200
 Nettleton Television responded.

550
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,840
 They said, "Yeah, not only here's the documentary.

551
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,840
 It's about 16 minutes long."

552
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,200
 They said, "Here's a follow-up.

553
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,600
 We did a follow-up years later."

554
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,320
 It is one thing to talk about ghost stories online.

555
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:58,320
 It is one thing to read the stuff anonymously where people are saying, "I saw these ghosts."

556
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,440
 These two short film projects have professional educators.

557
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:12,640
 These people are coaches and principals saying, "This is the paranormal stuff I saw in Raider

558
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,140
 Jim."

559
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:18,800
 It is a big deal to have someone put their face and their real name and to talk about

560
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,800
 this stuff.

561
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,000
 I believe in this stuff.

562
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,800
 For the most part, some of you guys just like the show because it's entertaining.

563
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,760
 I don't have a problem talking about it.

564
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,560
 I believe in this stuff, but you got to understand a lot of people don't.

565
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,800
 A lot of people will straight up laugh in your face if you talk about you believe in ghosts

566
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,480
 or aliens or stuff like that.

567
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,840
 I always give a big tip of the hat to people who are talking about this stuff.

568
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,720
 In this first little documentary, we have an interview with the former principal, Dale

569
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,720
 Case.

570
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,080
 He goes, "Listen, when this all started, I didn't know anything about ghosts."

571
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,720
 Apparently, I watched Casper and stuff like that, but I didn't know that there was any

572
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,320
 story about Raider Jim being haunted.

573
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,520
 It seems like there was a code of silence to keep this stuff under wraps.

574
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,600
 A lot of schools don't want it getting out there that they're haunted.

575
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,280
 One, because it causes chaos.

576
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,840
 The students are constantly going to be trying to break into the gym.

577
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,600
 But two, it's unprofessional.

578
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
 It's unprofessional.

579
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,600
 I don't think so.

580
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,600
 I think it's totally cool.

581
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,600
 I think it's totally awesome.

582
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,360
 I went to Andrew's Pizza the other day, Device and Pizza, and I was talking to my friend

583
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,640
 Abby about, "Is this place haunted?"

584
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,120
 And half the staff said, "Yeah, there's a ghost named Tabitha here.

585
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,960
 I've had this experience and da-da-da-da-da.

586
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,040
 I think that's awesome."

587
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:38,640
 But a lot of times, I don't find out the superintendent wants all this stuff out.

588
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:44,800
 Dale Case, the former principal, says, "When I was working there, I was given a task to

589
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,400
 paint the basketball floor, to like, fix up the paint, all the designs."

590
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:54,400
 He goes, "I was there late one night, and I heard somebody walking through the gym.

591
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,160
 And I was the only one there."

592
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,760
 And he goes, "The walking would start in one corner of their room, and it would actually

593
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,600
 walk very slowly, but it would walk past me.

594
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,600
 Like it would walk diagonally."

595
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,240
 And he goes, "I would hear the footsteps.

596
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,240
 I looked up.

597
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,240
 There's nothing there."

598
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,240
 And he walked past me.

599
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,440
 He goes, "I did not know anything about the place being haunted.

600
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,560
 I thought it was super weird.

601
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,560
 Whatever.

602
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,560
 Like I still got a job to do.

603
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,280
 I still got to paint this stuff."

604
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:25,680
 And then he talks about later on, like, at this point he now knows of the ghost stories.

605
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,160
 He's been there for a while.

606
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,520
 He's painting a room underneath the bleachers.

607
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,400
 He's in this area.

608
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,560
 And it's spooky, right?

609
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,560
 To be in a place all alone, school, talk about liminal spaces.

610
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:40,560
 Schools are very spooky to be in after hours.

611
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:47,240
 There's long hallways and then doors hiding stuff behind each door on both sides of you.

612
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:51,920
 He's painting this room underneath the bleachers and he hears somebody.

613
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:56,640
 He said, first off, he goes, "I left the lights on all over the building and I left the doors

614
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,640
 open."

615
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,680
 And he goes, "The reason why I did that was I didn't want anyone sneaking up on me.

616
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,840
 I was so scared already because I didn't want to be working and then a door unlocked

617
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,840
 and I turned around and freaked out."

618
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,600
 He goes, "I left all the lights on and the doors open so people would know I was there

619
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,640
 and people want to just sneak up behind me or I want to hear some strange noise."

620
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,240
 He goes, "I'm painting this room underneath the bleachers."

621
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,440
 And he hears someone walk up the bleachers.

622
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,440
 And again, he goes, "I was thinking one of the coaches showed up, right?

623
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,640
 This seems to be a busy area.

624
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,720
 You have all these offices.

625
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,520
 You have the weight room over here as well."

626
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,320
 Here's someone walk up the bleachers.

627
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,320
 I go out.

628
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,320
 I hear someone walk up the bleachers.

629
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,320
 I go out.

630
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,040
 There's no one there.

631
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,040
 He's like, "Whatever."

632
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,840
 He goes, "I actually think there could be some explanation for this."

633
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,480
 He keeps hearing about every five minutes someone walking up the bleachers.

634
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,120
 And eventually he's like, "You know what?

635
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,440
 This has to be a reasonable explanation for this.

636
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,920
 It has to be."

637
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:50,080
 So he walks out and he goes, "I stood there for 10 minutes."

638
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,520
 He goes, "I figured if it was a natural thing, it's going on this five minute rhythm.

639
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,960
 If it's an air conditioner starting or something like that, I'm just going to stand out here

640
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,960
 until it does it again.

641
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,760
 And when I'm looking there and there's clearly nothing there, then I will know that it was

642
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,160
 -- and I hear the air conditioner kick on or something like that."

643
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,760
 He said, "I don't know what was causing it."

644
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,840
 And he said, "I stood there for about 10 minutes and nothing.

645
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,160
 There was no noise.

646
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,600
 It did not repeat itself on its five minute interval."

647
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,200
 And then he goes, "I was like, whatever."

648
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:24,880
 And he walks into the room and he starts working again and he all of a sudden he hears, "BAM!

649
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,880
 BAM!

650
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,880
 BAM!

651
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,880
 BAM!"

652
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,760
 And he goes every single time before.

653
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,760
 It sounded like someone was walking up the bleachers.

654
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,400
 He said now.

655
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,400
 It sounded like someone was stomping up the bleachers, was literally stepping on each

656
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,560
 bleacher as hard as they could.

657
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,520
 He goes, "I got the impression I wasn't wanted there.

658
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,120
 I got the impression it was time to leave.

659
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,280
 I left.

660
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,920
 I was done."

661
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,840
 And then we have two of the coaches.

662
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,920
 Two of the coaches, Coach Barry Carlton, talked about they heard weights.

663
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,560
 It sounded like weights were being worked in the weight room.

664
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,160
 And then like dropping to the floor and he went and checked.

665
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,160
 There was nobody there.

666
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,040
 He had stories of sounds like that.

667
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,540
 Coach Vicki Davis.

668
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:06,560
 Same thing she'd hear, weights clanking together.

669
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,560
 You'd look in the room.

670
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,160
 You see, they would be there when there weren't supposed to be students there.

671
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,600
 So, and these were during the day.

672
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,040
 They weren't there super late at night.

673
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,480
 They would be there at different times of the day and they'd hear these noises and

674
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,200
 they'd be like, "Oh, is someone here?"

675
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,200
 They'd look in there.

676
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,600
 There'd be nobody there.

677
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:25,960
 So you would have, and all of these noises seem to be situated around Raider Hall.

678
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,840
 But that's all in the original documentary.

679
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,080
 And it's, these guys did such a fantastic job.

680
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,080
 It's funny.

681
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,080
 Watching it, there was like this, "Woo!"

682
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,300
 There's like this ghostly sound effect or like the sound effect of wind that's laid

683
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,060
 underneath the entire first 16 minute documentary.

684
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,380
 And at first I was like, "Oh."

685
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,860
 But by the end of it, I was actually getting creeped out.

686
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:50,700
 Like that sound effect, just having that constant.

687
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,700
 Actually got to me.

688
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,860
 It was actually, I was like, it's been a long time.

689
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:59,340
 You know, I used to watch a lot of the ghost shows on Netflix like A Haunting and Ghost

690
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:03,080
 Adventurers and stuff, or not Ghost Adventurers so much, but the ones that did the reenactments

691
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,840
 like A Haunting and stuff like that.

692
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,000
 Unsolved Mysteries, they used to really creep me out.

693
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,680
 It's been a long time since I've been creeped out by just watching something like this.

694
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:14,400
 But by the end of it, I was, and they were just talking about sounds and stuff like that.

695
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,240
 Oh, I heard someone in the weight room and something like that.

696
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,120
 Very, very well put together documentary.

697
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:26,080
 But then the one they just released recently is from a former student, or a former student

698
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:30,660
 that's being profiled in this new update to this documentary.

699
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:35,820
 So there's this guy who used to go to Nettleton High School named Jim Moose.

700
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,700
 This is nicknamed Jim Moose Brown.

701
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:43,100
 Apparently he's a very successful musician, singer, songwriter.

702
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,620
 He worked with all of these stuff.

703
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:46,180
 He's usually going on tour.

704
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,340
 Some of you guys may know his name.

705
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,540
 I was unfamiliar with it.

706
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:52,020
 I don't listen to country music, but Jim Moose Brown.

707
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,220
 You're like Jason, that's like the mother of all.

708
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,440
 I know this is the Michael Jackson of country music.

709
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,360
 I'm like so ignorant because I don't know who this guy is.

710
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,440
 But anyway, seems like a nice dude.

711
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,600
 He saw the first documentary.

712
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,760
 Apparently he saw the first documentary and he got in touch with Nettleton High School

713
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,360
 and was like, you guys got to hear my story.

714
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,680
 You guys have to hear this.

715
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,760
 Like this is so insane.

716
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,840
 And again, he goes, when this happened, I had no idea about the reputation that the

717
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,320
 gym was haunted.

718
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,800
 People were not talking about it.

719
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,060
 He goes, this took place back in the year 1980, 1981.

720
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,740
 He said it was between 9, 9.30 and 9.

721
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:35,660
 He goes, me and two of my friends, we broke into the gym at night.

722
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:39,940
 The reason why was because I guess they had these mini trampolines and something they

723
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,220
 would do during school apparently is they would jump on the trampolines and dunk.

724
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,860
 And they said, let's do that.

725
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,300
 There's nothing else to do tonight.

726
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,500
 Let's go to this high school.

727
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,900
 Let's go to our high school.

728
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:54,880
 Let's break into a Raider gym and we will do this.

729
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,880
 I'm not kidding, you would do for like 10 minutes and get bored.

730
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,680
 But apparently there's really nothing to do in Jonesboro, Arkansas.

731
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,200
 They go, they get these mini trampolines, boing, boing.

732
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,720
 And they're dunking the ball.

733
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,680
 And he says, the way we got in, we got him through the back door.

734
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,200
 We actually made it to the door when it locked behind us.

735
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,360
 All the other doors in the building were locked though.

736
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,000
 There was no other staff there or anything.

737
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,240
 And he goes, we left the lights off so we didn't get caught.

738
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,580
 I can't even remember the place was haunted when he was doing this.

739
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,860
 They left the lights off so they wouldn't get caught and they're in there.

740
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:26,220
 They're goofing off, jumping around on these trampolines.

741
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,100
 And he says, I'm sitting there.

742
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:32,020
 I'm kind of separated from the other guys and I'm standing there.

743
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:36,580
 And I see movement out of the corner of my eye.

744
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:43,300
 And he goes and I turn and I look and I see a girl in the gym.

745
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:50,200
 And he goes, she was this very pretty blonde girl walking through the darkness.

746
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,360
 I'm just staring at her.

747
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,720
 He said, she never looked at me.

748
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,240
 She was just walking very slowly.

749
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,360
 She was wearing a long white dress.

750
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:04,160
 He described it as an old fashioned dress.

751
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,360
 Kind of went all the way down to the ground.

752
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:12,280
 And he goes, she's walking through the gymnasium like near the entrance of the gym.

753
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,340
 And then she walks by this concession stand area.

754
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:20,220
 And he kind of loses view of her for a while as she's walking behind this concession stand.

755
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,740
 And then he sees her again, walking.

756
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,260
 Now she's walking down this hallway and she's entering the gym again.

757
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:33,500
 And she just kind of walks and then turns and walks out of sight.

758
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,180
 So she doesn't make like a straight line.

759
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:39,580
 It's like this weird, from what I can understand, like the layout of the place.

760
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,840
 It's kind of like this weird kind of path.

761
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,320
 And he goes, I'm watching her.

762
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,760
 And then once she walks completely out of sight, and I can't see her anymore, I call

763
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,920
 my friends over and I was like, dude, someone's in here.

764
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,280
 Like we're going to get found out.

765
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,080
 There's a girl in here and they're like, there's nobody else in here.

766
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,720
 He goes, no, I clearly saw someone else in here.

767
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,560
 And they went and they actually double checked the doors.

768
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,760
 All the doors were locked except for the one that they came in through and no one else came

769
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,800
 through that door.

770
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,160
 And he goes, I didn't know the place was haunted at all.

771
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,500
 And I thought, you know, we're going to get caught.

772
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,640
 We better leave because we'd get in a lot of trouble for breaking into the gym.

773
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:18,180
 But he said it terrified him as well.

774
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:24,120
 There's something so unsettling about what he saw in his, what he was physically seen

775
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,380
 was a physical female form.

776
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:30,280
 It was this woman, this young girl walking by.

777
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,860
 He wasn't thinking that's a ghost.

778
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:38,100
 But as his reptile brain is processing the information, run, Jim, get out of here.

779
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:44,540
 And he left and he goes, I got home and I started thinking about it and it just disturbed me.

780
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,540
 Was disturbing.

781
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:49,220
 Now again, if you're breaking into a location, you're on the lookout for like security guards

782
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:51,420
 or dogs or stuff like that.

783
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:55,560
 And if you see a security guard and you almost get caught, it's not a deeply disturbing, troubling

784
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,560
 feeling, right?

785
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,560
 You got away with it.

786
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:02,100
 And he started a process and he goes, there's something terrifying about it.

787
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,100
 It wasn't just a girl.

788
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,540
 But again, he didn't know anything about these ghost stories.

789
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:09,620
 And it's possible that he didn't know anything about these ghost stories until he watched

790
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,620
 that documentary that came out in 2013.

791
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,620
 He goes, oh my God.

792
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,420
 Like that place was haunted.

793
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:20,180
 That place where I saw a girl in old clothing walking by late at night when there was no

794
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,180
 one else in.

795
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,180
 That was haunted.

796
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,460
 That must have been a ghost.

797
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,460
 Fascinating story.

798
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:30,180
 Again, we just have like just alone, like the ghost sightings creepy.

799
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,500
 And the fact that people are willing to put their reputations on the line, not moose.

800
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,980
 I mean moose is a successful musician.

801
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,780
 It's not like no one's going to be like, you can't work on our new album.

802
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,780
 You believe in ghosts.

803
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:43,180
 But when you have people who work for the school in the education industry and they're

804
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:46,460
 putting their face out and they actually say in the documentary, there's a lot of people

805
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,500
 who had stories too, but they would not appear on camera.

806
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,500
 And that's pretty normal.

807
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,020
 That's pretty normal, right?

808
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,620
 Because people get laughed at because of this.

809
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,700
 But you have these people, you have these two coaches who might still work there.

810
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,700
 I'm not for sure.

811
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,940
 And you have the former principal who still has to get jobs, right?

812
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,980
 You have people willing to go and put their reputations on the line to talk about this

813
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,980
 phenomenon.

814
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,180
 That in and of itself is interesting.

815
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:10,460
 Then the idea of the tree, of the leaves appearing out of nowhere, falling.

816
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,540
 I find that very, very intriguing.

817
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:18,340
 And what I think is so creepy about this story is the school seems to be covering it up for

818
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,340
 the most part.

819
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:22,660
 Yeah, we have these documentaries, but you have decades of people going here who probably

820
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,420
 knew nothing about this phenomenon.

821
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:30,300
 Is that nobody knows what the origin is?

822
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:36,260
 It was not just the story of a ghost who from placing the pieces together was probably brutally

823
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,420
 murdered, right?

824
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:42,340
 This young girl who's screaming in the darkness was probably murdered here long before the

825
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:45,060
 school was even built.

826
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,740
 And nobody knows who it is.

827
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:51,980
 Her cries went unanswered and she was slaughtered on that spot.

828
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:55,420
 And nobody remembers her name.

829
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:59,940
 So what are the secrets of this gymnasium?

830
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:04,380
 Long before it was built, was there once a tree there?

831
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:09,300
 Were on a warm autumn day a young girl was brutally murdered?

832
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:18,340
 And now her cries for help, her pleads for mercy, echo throughout time?

833
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:22,540
 Does this gymnasium hold a curse?

834
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:29,220
 A dark portal to a world that the living never venture into?

835
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:35,660
 Is the gym infused with dark paranormal energy?

836
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:39,160
 The story of Raider Gym is a tragic one.

837
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:43,140
 Because not only do we have the spirit of a young girl who's trapped between the world

838
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:49,420
 of the living and the dead, not only do we have the spirit of a murder victim trapped

839
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:56,940
 inside this structure, not only do we have the screams of a teenage girl echoing through

840
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:59,140
 the darkness.

841
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:03,140
 We don't even know her name.

842
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:10,780
 The lost soul of a forgotten victim of a brutal crime.

843
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:19,060
 But no one will ever forget the screams they hear coming from the darkness inside Raider

844
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:26,420
 Gym.

845
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:37,940
 DeadRabberRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

846
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,700
 You don't have to listen to it every day, but I'm glad you listened to it today.

847
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,460
 Have a great one guys.

848
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:48,460
 Bye.

849
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:55,460
 Bye.

850
00:42:55,460 --> 00:43:02,460
 Bye.

851
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:09,460
 Bye.

852
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:16,460
 Bye.

853
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:23,460
 Bye.

854
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:26,040
 (upbeat music)

855
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:36,040
