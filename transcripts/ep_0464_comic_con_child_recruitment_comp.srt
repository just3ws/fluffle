00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,800
 Today's the two-year anniversary of Dead Rabbit Radio, and we're gonna take a look at one paranormal story, one conspiracy story, and one true crime story.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:15,000
 First off, the world was supposed to end in 2012, but that's long past, or has it?

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,700
 Then we travel to Australia to look at a true crime case that'll send chills down your...

4
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,300
 ...taste buds?

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:28,900
 And finally, we take a look at a conspiracy theory from the Conspiracy Theory iceberg.

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,400
 It's called Comic-Con Child Recruitment.

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:41,200
 Is the industry of nerds and nerd culture actually aiding and abetting the trafficking of children?

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:54,400
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,600
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,400
 I hope you guys are having a great week. This is the two-year anniversary of Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:08,200
 We started the show on June 13th, June 14th in 2018, and here we are.

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,600
 Here we are. It's amazing, right?

14
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,800
 I'm giving myself a round of applause. I'm hoping you guys are joining in with me.

15
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,000
 Scenes of me, like, saluting you guys, and you guys, it's all raining on you.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,200
 I have an umbrella. I'm totally dry, but it's more dramatic when you guys are soaping wet.

17
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,000
 Or soaking wet, as people normally call it. Your hair is all drippy, and I'm just like...

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 I don't know how I'm clapping and holding an umbrella, but I'm doing it somehow.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,200
 I'm that magnificent Willem Dafoe. He's standing off to the side. He's standing in the wings.

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,400
 He's just not in his head.

21
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,600
 Yeah, yeah. I don't know why. I don't know why I'm here.

22
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,400
 Maybe Willem Dafoe listens to the podcast.

23
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,000
 I turn, I look at Willem Dafoe. I kind of wink, and then he fades away, and I'm like, "That's weird."

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,800
 He was never real all along.

25
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,800
 We got a lot of stuff to cover. Let's go ahead and get started.

26
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,800
 First off, I want to give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Hunter Johnson.

27
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,000
 Hunter? Still clapping?

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,400
 The first person who stops clapping gets shot. Hunter, thank you so much for supporting the show.

29
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,400
 Really, really helps out a lot. Really appreciate it.

30
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,200
 You're going to be our captain, our pilot, possibly our rowboat, or rower.

31
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,600
 I don't know what vehicles we use in this episode.

32
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, though, that's okay, too.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,100
 Just help get the word out about the show. That really helps out a lot.

34
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:22,700
 My first batch of stickers for Patreon people, Patrons, Patron, whatever.

35
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:28,100
 You guys are going out Monday. They're awesome stickers. I'm not revealing the design yet.

36
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,900
 I'll reveal it in the future after I think everyone has their sticker.

37
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,900
 And just to let you guys know, we do have the Minecraft server up, and we're having a lot of fun on the Minecraft server.

38
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,200
 That's free to everyone, and it'll remain free to everyone as long as everyone behaves.

39
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,300
 But I can just ban people if they get too out of my hand, so I think we'll be okay.

40
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,800
 Hunter, let's fire up that carpenter copter.

41
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,100
 Let's start off on the carpenter copter here. We are flying out to the University of Tennessee.

42
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:57,100
 We're flying over. We see a bunch of buildings and stuff, some grass.

43
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,800
 The only combination of those things in Tennessee is University of Tennessee.

44
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,200
 Everything else is either all grass or buildings and no grass.

45
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,700
 We see a combination. Land here, land here.

46
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:12,800
 The reason why we're here is that a Patreon supporter, Tessa, sent me a story.

47
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,300
 Sent me this story, and so we have to investigate it. I really, really appreciate it, Tessa.

48
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,200
 This is a really interesting one. We're walking across the University of Tennessee.

49
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,400
 I think all the classes are not... I think we're the only ones there right now,

50
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,900
 because of the Corona lockdown and summertime, so we're walking. It's kind of cool.

51
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,700
 Like, just playing Frisbee. We're taking our time petting dogs.

52
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,200
 Eventually, we get to the office of Paolo Tagalogan.

53
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,800
 I can almost guarantee I'm mispronouncing that name, but Paolo Tagalogan.

54
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,600
 We walk up to his office, knock on it, and he goes, "Jason, I'm pretty sure he's not here."

55
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,200
 Like, we were the only ones playing Frisbee, and we don't know where all these dogs came from,

56
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,900
 but you made us pet him. I don't think he's here.

57
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,400
 I'm knocking on the door, and I stop, and I look at you, and I go,

58
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,200
 "But that's the point, isn't it?"

59
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,700
 "That's the point."

60
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,200
 This is a weird one. It starts off as a very simple story.

61
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,900
 Doomsday prophecies, they come and they go.

62
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:08,000
 You know prophecies that are based on exact dates are going to fail,

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,400
 because the world's not going to end, and then the first thing they do is move the date forward.

64
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,500
 And so it should shock nobody that this scientist, Paolo Tagalogan,

65
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,300
 what's he going to call him, Paolo?

66
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,200
 I'm sure you guys are already sticking ice picks in your ears.

67
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,400
 Paola, Paola.

68
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,100
 He goes, "Guys, he's working on like a giant chalkboard and stuff.

69
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:39,600
 He's writing stuff down and other nerds are sitting around there like, "What's going on? Why are you still using chalkboard? Why aren't you using a computer like the rest of us?"

70
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,400
 He's like, "I'm calculating this. If we look at this setting of what I've written,

71
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,300
 the Gregorian calendar changed, and then this X plus a triangle equals a starfish and all this stuff."

72
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:56,800
 He's looking down at this stuff, and he goes, "According to my calculation, we lost 11 days a year

73
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:04,700
 when we switched to the Gregorian calendar. And so over the course of 268 years when we started the Gregorian calendar,

74
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:10,300
 that means that if we, if we, if we, he has like a, one of those projectors,

75
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,700
 and he has like two transparencies and he puts them over each other, this is the Mayan calendar,

76
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:20,500
 and then he moves the Gregorian calendar over it, and now it makes one image, and it glows dramatically.

77
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,100
 They're like, "How do you do that?"

78
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:28,900
 It does it anyways, and he goes, "According to my magical calculations, 2012, December 21, 2012,

79
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,800
 was supposed to be the end of the world depicted in the Mayan calendar, but it wasn't. Obviously, we're still around.

80
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:42,300
 But because we switched over the Gregorian calendar, what that means is that it should be June 21, 2020,

81
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,900
 is the end of the world." And everyone goes, "That's stupid! That's the dumbest thing we've ever heard!"

82
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,000
 And he goes, "Yeah, yeah, but the math checks out. This is what I find interesting about this."

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,800
 And again, thank you, Tesla, for sending this over.

84
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,300
 I'm still knocking on the door, because we want to ask him some questions.

85
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,200
 We want to look at the equations ourselves.

86
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,500
 And you're kind of knocking on the door that whole time, and you're like, "Jason, can you not?"

87
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,500
 Obviously, he's not there.

88
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,900
 And I turn and I go, "But that's really the question, isn't it?"

89
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,300
 And you're like, "Quit, quit being vague. Here's the thing. This is what I..."

90
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,300
 And all the articles are read on this.

91
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:20,900
 It said, "Scientists Paolo Tagalogan" said this, and a now-deleted tweet.

92
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:25,900
 And I go, "Fake." It's obviously fake. No one has a screenshot of the tweet.

93
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,300
 There's a chance this guy doesn't even exist, right?

94
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,400
 So I googled his name. Again, nobody has the tweet. No one has a screenshot of him actually saying this.

95
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,700
 I googled his... I looked him up on Twitter. He doesn't have an account.

96
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,200
 Shocker, of course. I go, "This dude's fake." I googled him.

97
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,000
 What's weird is this is where it gets weird. This is why I was knocking on this door.

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,600
 He existed at some point in social media.

99
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,700
 If you go on Twitter and you look for him in the search bar, you won't find anything.

100
00:06:54,700 --> 00:07:00,200
 But if you go to Google and you type in his name, and I'll have the links in the show notes, you can replicate this,

101
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:06,100
 you'll see one of the hits is for a Twitter account @PTagalogan.

102
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,600
 And it says underneath it, the latest tweets from his name,

103
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,200
 "Fullbright Scholar, Biologist, Athlete, Researcher, Knoxville, Tennessee."

104
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,800
 It says that, but when you click on that, it says this account doesn't exist.

105
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,100
 It's the same thing if you'll see on that first page of Google results for his name, a LinkedIn profile.

106
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,700
 Click on that.

107
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,700
 The LinkedIn profile you're looking for is not public or does not exist.

108
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,300
 If you type his name into Instagram, you'll get nothing.

109
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,000
 But on that first page of Google results, you click on the Instagram link.

110
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,100
 It says the link you followed may be broken or the page may have been removed.

111
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,200
 So if you go to these individual sites and look for it, you won't find it,

112
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,500
 but they're still cached in the Google memory.

113
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,400
 This guy existed. I went to the Fullbright program.

114
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,100
 Not myself. I didn't actually attend.

115
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,400
 I'm like, "Hey, what's up, Paolo?"

116
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,700
 He's like, "Dude, you've known me for six years.

117
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,200
 Can you learn to pronounce my name?"

118
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,900
 "No, dude."

119
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,900
 I went to the Fullbright program's website.

120
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,000
 There's a photo of him. He exists.

121
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,600
 He has a master's in biotechnology.

122
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:12,700
 So it matches up when we look at his Twitter profile, Fullbright Scholar, in biology.

123
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,800
 So this guy existed at one point, but now he's been completely scrubbed from the Internet.

124
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,000
 There's two--

125
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,900
 There's traces of him, and there's two theories.

126
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,000
 One is the logical theory, and one's the insane fun theory that we like to talk about.

127
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 The logical theory is this guy made this proclamation.

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,900
 Said-- and he may have not made it recently.

129
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,100
 He may have made it a couple years ago.

130
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,800
 But now it's getting attention because it's coming up.

131
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,600
 He goes, "Well, according to my calculations,

132
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,500
 it should be June 21st, 2020. It should be in a while."

133
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,000
 And he got completely bombarded by every lunatic who came out of the woodwork.

134
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,700
 That's the most likely scenario, right?

135
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:53,600
 That you have this biologist who lives a pretty humble life, poking amoebas with a stick,

136
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:00,400
 and then all of a sudden, every Alex Jones wannabe is knocking on his door at his office.

137
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,400
 But then, well, let's look at the fun conspiracy thing, because that's what we want to look at.

138
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,700
 He exposed the truth, a truth so deep.

139
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:12,100
 The government's like, "Mmm-mm-mm-mm," they're shaking their finger, and they made him take down all of the social stuff.

140
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,900
 That's obviously ludicrous, because people say even weirder things,

141
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:21,100
 and people honestly say even more weird and true things online all the time, and they're still up.

142
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,300
 But I'm-- I'm-- I think this is the thing.

143
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,400
 I think there would be a conspiracy theory about his disappearance

144
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,300
 if people did any due diligence.

145
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:35,800
 I've seen this article get published several times, and nobody that I can tell tried to track him down the way that I'm tracking him down.

146
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,800
 These articles are just saying an "announcelated tweet" and an "announcelated tweet."

147
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,500
 If more people knew that he had disappeared, I think the conspiracy theory would grow immensely,

148
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,300
 because you have a guy who made this claim, and now he can't be found.

149
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:54,800
 This is really the first time this is getting out in the public, that this guy's been scrubbed from the internet.

150
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:01,800
 So maybe in the next six days, this conspiracy theory will grow, or probably five days by the time you're listening to this episode.

151
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,200
 Or six, actually. Yeah, uh, no, five. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

152
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,700
 And when the world doesn't end, then everyone will forget that this even happened.

153
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,500
 And we'll move on to the next calamity.

154
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,300
 But thank you, Tessa, for sending us that story.

155
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,500
 So let's hop in the Carbenter-Copter Hunter.

156
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,700
 We are leaving behind the University of Tennessee.

157
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,300
 We are headed out to Australia.

158
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,300
 [imitates flying]

159
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,600
 And as we're flying over the ocean, we're headed to Australia.

160
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:33,200
 This story-- I got most of this information from a vice article, and it was written by Jelisa Castro-Dale.

161
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,700
 And I want to give her props, because this is basically all the information.

162
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,400
 She did a lot of research for this. She interviewed these people.

163
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,800
 And all the information online is really from this article.

164
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,500
 So hats off to you, Intrepid Researcher.

165
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,600
 It's October 5th, 2003. We're in Sydney, Australia.

166
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,500
 So good day, Governor. We're hanging out there.

167
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,700
 We're with a couple, Stephen and Jessica White.

168
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,300
 So we're walking into, like, this restaurant, and we're going to sit down.

169
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,800
 We're going to order some food.

170
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,200
 And-- but we're not really. I mean, I am, because I'm hungry. You can.

171
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,000
 But we're ordering food, and we're kind of looking over our menu.

172
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,600
 And we see Stephen and Jessica White walk in, and they got three kids.

173
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,600
 We're at the Cougie Bay Hotel.

174
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,200
 And everyone's there. They're kind of dressed up, because they're there to watch the Rugby League Grand Final.

175
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,700
 We're not there to watch them, though. We're there to watch this family.

176
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,800
 So we see them, and they're kind of being-- allegedly, they're kind of being jerks, right?

177
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,300
 They're complaining about a bunch of stuff.

178
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,800
 What? These chairs have four legs. I prefer my chairs to have five legs.

179
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,800
 What? This table has a cloth. I prefer my cloth to have a table.

180
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,600
 And the staff's like, "Oh, come on." They're complaining about a bunch of stuff.

181
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,400
 And eventually, the manager goes, "Hey, guys. Tell you what. Tell you what."

182
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,900
 We will give you a free gelato, this giant thing of gelato.

183
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:57,000
 We're sorry for everything that's gone on. We will immediately replace your table cloth with a cloth table.

184
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,600
 And they're like, "Oh, that's awesome." They bring out this giant thing of gelato.

185
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,000
 And then we have a quote.

186
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,700
 Maybe one of the most important quotes ever spoken in a true crime story. This is Jessica White.

187
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:15,500
 "There were four scoops, including vanilla." You can imagine this as a dramatic reenactment in forensic files.

188
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,700
 It's like the lighting gets all dark and the family's sitting around this gelato.

189
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:26,000
 "There were four scoops, including vanilla, chocolate, and hazelnut."

190
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,700
 So you're like, "That's only three. You don't let me finish."

191
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,700
 Hold on.

192
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,300
 "There were four scoops." That's the mystery scoop.

193
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,000
 "There were four scoops, including vanilla, chocolate, and hazelnut."

194
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,300
 At the bottom, there appeared to be chocolate.

195
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,000
 "Greetily, I went for it ahead of the kids."

196
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,400
 Sticks her spoon in and then the voiceover of forensic files is like,

197
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:54,900
 "As the spoon cut through the first two scoops, little did Jessica know what laid at the bottom."

198
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,400
 And then you see the dramatic reenactment.

199
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,400
 I'll continue the quote here.

200
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:07,500
 "Greetily, I went for it ahead of the kids. Thank heavens I did. The stench, the taste.

201
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,700
 I spat the food into a napkin and immediately I was sick."

202
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:18,600
 The fourth scoop of gelato was human poop.

203
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,400
 Dun dun!

204
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,000
 So that's-- that's--

205
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Okay, so that story is a woman was tricked into eating poop.

206
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,300
 I have to say a couple things.

207
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,000
 One, if I took a bite of poop, I'm not looking for a napkin.

208
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,300
 I'm not worried about being polite.

209
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,300
 I'm not gonna be like, "Gimme napkin. What honey? What--

210
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,400
 Nupkin, nupkin.

211
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,000
 Uh, uh, uh, uh."

212
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 That's going everywhere.

213
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,500
 That's going on my kids, my husband, everywhere.

214
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,700
 Now, you go, "Jason, really? That's your true crime story for your two-year anniversary?"

215
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,100
 This happened back in 2003.

216
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,500
 It went to trial.

217
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,900
 The family said we were complaining so much that someone in the kitchen pooped in our ice cream,

218
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,300
 hid it, hid their poop at the bottom.

219
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:11,000
 Actually, another thing about it, how-- in what universe do you mistake human poop with gelato?

220
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,800
 Right?

221
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,000
 Like, gelato is basically Italian ice cream, so it's kind of the same thing.

222
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,700
 First off, for my-- and I'm not-- I know, guys, I'm not gonna spend too much time on this, but

223
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,900
 we all poop, right? We all take poops.

224
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:26,500
 That's probably one out of every hundred poops where I look at it, 'cause, you know, you look at it, right?

225
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,800
 You have to check it, especially when you get old.

226
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,500
 You're like, "Is there any blood in there?"

227
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,200
 Have fun, kids, because eventually you do have to start doing that.

228
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,100
 The-- you look at the poop, every-- so everyone in a hundred poops should go,

229
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,300
 "Oh, I could probably disguise that as chocolate ice cream."

230
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,800
 But for the most part, right?

231
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,700
 For the most part.

232
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:49,600
 And even if the color matches, the texture's not gonna match, and you-- dude, how did they not smell that coming?

233
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:57,200
 And actually, so, that's an interesting thing, because the family obviously said someone pooped and put the gelato on top of it,

234
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,600
 and brought it to us, and I took a bite. I'm gonna sue you.

235
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,100
 And the store goes, "No, no, no, no, no, no, that never happened."

236
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:08,000
 You must have pooped and hid it in there and taken a bite of it.

237
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,500
 Because, now that we think about it, the flavor-- well, obviously the flavor's off, but the texture's off, the color's off,

238
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,900
 and how did they not smell it coming? I'll have to say this.

239
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:22,400
 Unless this family-- unless their ancestor was snake eyes,

240
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:28,300
 it would be really hard to take a poop, hide it in ice cream, without anyone noticing in the middle of a restaurant.

241
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,300
 Like, that's quite the ninja skill, right?

242
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,800
 To be able to poop in your-- sitting in your seat.

243
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,200
 That's-- that's easy. That's what toilets are designed for, but--

244
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,300
 poop in your seat, scoop the poop, put it in the ice cream. Like, I don't think they could do that.

245
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,500
 But anyways, they got the police involved. They got a food safety group involved.

246
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:49,600
 They're doing lab tests on this poop. They looked into this for 11 years.

247
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,500
 They actually sent the poop to a lab. The only thing they could say conclusively--

248
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,100
 is that it came-- I didn't even know this was possible. I did not know this is where science led us.

249
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,500
 They could tell-- they're like looking at it with little tweezers and stuff like that.

250
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:07,000
 The whole thing reminded me of that episode of "It's Always Sunny," "Who Pooped the Bed," but this one's real.

251
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,600
 They were able to tell the poop came from a woman's butt.

252
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,600
 How would you-- how would you ever know that?

253
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,300
 Apparently, that is now-- that's science fiction, right?

254
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,900
 If you read that in a book, if you read that in a Philip K. Dick book, you would think that's not real.

255
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,800
 But no.

256
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,800
 I keep saying they investigated this for 11 years, 11 years.

257
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,100
 In the end, do you know who pooped in the gelato?

258
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,200
 They went and they looked through all the video cameras of the hotel.

259
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,400
 They interviewed all of the staff. They interviewed the family.

260
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:46,000
 After 11 years to this day, nobody knows who pooped in that gelato.

261
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,900
 That's-- serial killers don't even have that kind of luck, right?

262
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,900
 People have torture dungeons built into their semis

263
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,600
 in troll America looking for fresh meat and they get caught.

264
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:04,900
 But some-- someone was able to poop in a relatively public place, transport said poop into food

265
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,200
 and not only keep their mouth shut, but if anyone saw it--

266
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,800
 I mean, organized-- whoever did this should join an organized crime gang.

267
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,900
 Because, again, people-- Takashi69 was ratting people out

268
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,900
 and they didn't really even commit any crimes.

269
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,600
 This guy, or girl, apparently came out of a woman's butt,

270
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,800
 pooped and kept her mouth shut for 11 years and never broke.

271
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,700
 So what was the name of that gang? Like the East Coast Gangster Blitz or something like that?

272
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,500
 Forget Takashi69.

273
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,400
 Go to Australia, pick up this chick, right?

274
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,200
 You-- she may not be useful in any sort of, like, drive-by shootings or drug trafficking,

275
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,500
 but if you ever need poop put in a prosecutor's gelato,

276
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,000
 you know they're gonna keep their mouth shut.

277
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,100
 So that is a-- that is my true crime mystery.

278
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,000
 What? Two-year anniversary special?

279
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,400
 Let's leave the bay. Let's leave this hotel. We're walking out.

280
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,800
 I'm carrying a doggie bag.

281
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,400
 You're like, "Jason, that's not gelato, is it?"

282
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,800
 And I'm like, "You'll never know. You'll know when you fall asleep and I'm putting it in your mouth."

283
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,700
 But until then, 'cause it is gelato, until then,

284
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:14,300
 we are leaving behind beautiful sunny Australia-- October 5th, that's a day after my birthday.

285
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,200
 That's pretty cool. I just looked at that date.

286
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,000
 We are leaving behind Australia. We're headed to San Diego.

287
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,900
 Although both those stories were kind of lighthearted and fun.

288
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:28,300
 I mean, the first one involved the end of the world and the second one involved a woman eating poop out of another woman's butt.

289
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,200
 But this story's more serious.

290
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,400
 So sometimes I like to tell the funnier stories to lead into this.

291
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,800
 This is one from the Conspiracy Theory iceberg.

292
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,200
 And I got a request to do this a long time ago.

293
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,900
 I think it was via email, but it could have been YouTube.

294
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,500
 From someone named Cypher.

295
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,500
 And he asked to do this story on Comic-Con Child Recruitment.

296
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,100
 It is actually in the Conspiracy Theory iceberg.

297
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,100
 I'm not gonna give you a bunch of statistics about it,

298
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:55,700
 but we're gonna do a brief overview of child trafficking, human trafficking in the United States in particular.

299
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,800
 Just to kind of get a scope of the problem.

300
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,400
 And then we're gonna break down what that probably means, the Comic-Con Child Recruitment.

301
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,400
 I think you guys will probably have an idea of where I'm headed with it,

302
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,900
 but then I want to add another layer onto it as well.

303
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,600
 Child trafficking is a massive problem, obviously, in the United States.

304
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,300
 There's a lot of statistics.

305
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,500
 Worldwide, there's more slaves now than there were during the slave trade.

306
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,000
 We have massive problems with slavery in the Middle East and Africa still.

307
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,100
 We have massive problems with slavery in the United States.

308
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,300
 A lot of the slavery in the United States is domestic.

309
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:33,000
 People being brought over from other countries and being forced to work in homes as maids,

310
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,400
 things like that, nannies.

311
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,400
 They-- you basically-- you bring someone over, you take their passport.

312
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,400
 This isn't a how-to.

313
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,700
 Don't take a note during this.

314
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,900
 You bring someone over to this country, their host country, take their passport,

315
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:49,300
 tell them they have to earn their trip over, and you never do.

316
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,800
 Or it takes 10 years for you to earn it.

317
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:56,000
 We see a lot of this in, like, nail salons have issues with human trafficking.

318
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,300
 Not all of them, not all of them.

319
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:04,400
 But we see it from-- like, in Europe, they have issues with people being trafficked from Eastern Europe.

320
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,900
 People from Eastern Europe being sent west.

321
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,700
 In Asia, you have people being trafficked from Asia to the United States.

322
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,100
 In the Middle East, you have people being trafficked from Africa into the Middle East.

323
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,800
 So no country is immune to this.

324
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,400
 It's a serious problem.

325
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,000
 The world has a slave problem.

326
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,700
 And on top-- I mean, obviously, being a slave is bad enough.

327
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:29,400
 But being sold into sexual slavery is even worse.

328
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,400
 Would be worse on an order of magnitude, right?

329
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,000
 It would suck to have to wash someone's dishes the rest of your life.

330
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,700
 But it could be worse.

331
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,900
 And that's what we're going to be talking about is sex trafficking.

332
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:46,100
 Now, sex trafficking is always aided and abetted by prostitution.

333
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:51,300
 So whether or not-- the highest rate of human trafficking in the United States is Washington, D.C.

334
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,900
 The second highest rate of human trafficking is Nevada.

335
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,800
 It's because the prostitution industry.

336
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:00,000
 Matt-- I mean, by a huge margin, it's Washington, D.C. and then Nevada.

337
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,700
 And then after that, we get like New York City, San Francisco.

338
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,300
 The places you would expect the trafficking to be hired.

339
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,600
 There are port cities.

340
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,400
 People come from all over the world to these cities and you get trapped there.

341
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,200
 We're going to take even another look at human trafficking.

342
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,400
 So we have the global slave trade, which is still in existence and absolutely horrible.

343
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,000
 Then the global slave trade, we have sex trafficking,

344
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,300
 which is out-- human trafficking-- and again, I need to just keep showing you the scope of this.

345
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:30,800
 Outside of drugs and guns, black market guns and drugs,

346
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:35,000
 human trafficking is the third most profitable black market business in the world.

347
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,900
 Brings in billions of dollars a year.

348
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,600
 It's very, very lucrative.

349
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,300
 Some gangs have switched to human trafficking.

350
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,100
 Your supply never runs out.

351
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,000
 There's always more humans being born.

352
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 It's a lot harder to bust.

353
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,300
 Most people who get sold into sex trafficking,

354
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:52,900
 they're in it for three years before law enforcement, they even show up on law enforcement's radar.

355
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,100
 You can't be like, "Hey, Coke, don't talk.

356
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,500
 If the police pull you over, just keep your mouth shut because it's cocaine.

357
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,800
 You can run tests on it."

358
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,300
 It's obviously a drug, but you can tell people, "Keep your mouth shut or I'm going to kill your parents."

359
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,300
 They're going to keep their mouth shut.

360
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,600
 They could get arrested a hundred times and never reveal anything.

361
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,100
 So we have human slave trade across the planet right now.

362
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,000
 And then there's a subset of that is sex trafficking.

363
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,400
 But there's even a subset underneath that and that is sex trafficking within the United States,

364
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,600
 aka recruitment.

365
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,600
 And this isn't where you're bringing people from another country and you're basically trapping them.

366
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,300
 It's arguably worse.

367
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,400
 You could say this one is worse or not.

368
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,100
 I think it's pretty awful.

369
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,500
 This is where you prey on people.

370
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,500
 You generally have it's the young women.

371
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,000
 So that's where you get child recruitment.

372
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,800
 So you see how the conspiracy theories come together.

373
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,900
 But you find a 15-year-old girl, which is the average age in America of these girls getting recruited.

374
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:51,400
 The idea of finding a woman walking down the street and snatching her and pulling her into a van

375
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:56,700
 and then being sold into sex trade is incredibly rare.

376
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:01,300
 It's very, very, very rare statistically in the United States.

377
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,500
 Most of these women are recruited.

378
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,100
 Boyfriends, girlfriends.

379
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,700
 Hey girl, let's go hang out at the mall.

380
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:14,100
 And that girl who they think is a friend is introducing them to their pimp is very, very common.

381
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:20,800
 Most of these girls willingly air quotes willingly join this lifestyle.

382
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,500
 They don't know what they're getting into.

383
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,300
 "Tricked" would be a better word.

384
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,400
 But I can make you a star, baby.

385
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,500
 Oh, you're so beautiful.

386
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,700
 No one's ever told you you're beautiful before they're wrong.

387
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,500
 You're so beautiful.

388
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,500
 Hang out with me.

389
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,500
 And it's this descent.

390
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,800
 You meet someone, they pay attention to you.

391
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,100
 No one's paid attention to you before.

392
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,200
 They got their hooks in you.

393
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,300
 Or people pay too much attention to you.

394
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,700
 You've been abused.

395
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,700
 Your dad's doing stuff to you.

396
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,300
 Your brother's doing stuff to you.

397
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,800
 Every boyfriend's treated you wrong.

398
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,000
 And then this guy shows up and he's treating you right.

399
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,400
 He loves you, baby.

400
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,000
 Gets his hooks into you.

401
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,900
 So it's like a recruitment thing.

402
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,300
 The idea of the young girl travel.

403
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,600
 I don't know if this is the stereotype, but it was when I was a kid.

404
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,300
 You'd have this idea of the young girl from Kansas traveling to LA to make it big.

405
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,300
 And the bus station would be full of perverts.

406
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,500
 I mean all bus stations are full of perverts, but you know what?

407
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:14,500
 There would be people waiting at the bus station at LA to find these young girls.

408
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,900
 I'm sure it still happens.

409
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:21,000
 I don't know if it's still a stereotype, but to find these young girls getting off of the bus or getting off the train.

410
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,100
 Hey, hey, how's it going?

411
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,500
 No, no, I got a bunch of friends and they come off super slick, super charming.

412
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,600
 Predators are good at what they do.

413
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
 Just like a lion is good at what it does.

414
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,700
 It was built to take down gazelles.

415
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:39,200
 Pimps sex traffickers are designed by nature to do what they do.

416
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,900
 They've honed their skills over the year.

417
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:44,000
 Same way, a better example than a lion would be a salesman.

418
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,900
 You can tell a good salesman from bad salesman almost immediately.

419
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,300
 Actually, you can tell a bad salesman almost immediately.

420
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,300
 A good salesman actually seems like he's your friend.

421
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,000
 That's the difference.

422
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,400
 Comic-Con child recruitment.

423
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,600
 And I think that we're going to talk about this conspiracy there.

424
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,400
 I think it relates to all conventions and in a greater way, all of nerd culture.

425
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,000
 But think about this.

426
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,500
 You have a comic book convention and it's full of young people.

427
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,400
 It does attract young people, right?

428
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,400
 And I'm going to make some generalizations here.

429
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:18,600
 I know some of you guys and gals are fans of nerd culture and things like that.

430
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:23,900
 So I'm going to make some stereotypes and just to discuss this thing.

431
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:27,500
 I think a good portion, and you guys may agree or not, but I think a good portion of

432
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:32,400
 nerd culture relates to how I felt when I was into really into nerd culture growing up.

433
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,400
 There were no conventions.

434
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:38,400
 We had conventions, but we had an anime room and they wheeled in a television set with a VCR

435
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,400
 and there was like six of us and we watched Records of Lotus War.

436
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,400
 No one was into anime back in '88 when I was watching it.

437
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,000
 And they had a comic book convention in the next room.

438
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,400
 But now they have these huge mega halls, movie companies come out to preview their products and things like that.

439
00:25:52,400 --> 00:26:00,300
 So you have people who are into nerd culture can tend to be lonely or socially isolated in the real world.

440
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,800
 Online, they may have a lot of friends.

441
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,200
 They may have a gaming guild.

442
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
 They may run their own website.

443
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,200
 But in the real world, they may feel more isolated.

444
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,500
 Not all of them, but again, I'm going to speak in stereotypes.

445
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,900
 So you have someone who's socially isolated.

446
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,400
 You'll have someone who's from out of town.

447
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:20,400
 Of course, people, the locals are going to go to San Diego Comic Con or any Comic Con really.

448
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,200
 So you have all this going on.

449
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:26,200
 And you have this predator watching this and watching these girls come in from out of town.

450
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,900
 He can tell they're shy.

451
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,000
 He can tell they're awkward.

452
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,300
 You just read their body language.

453
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,800
 This is his business and he's good at it.

454
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,800
 If he wasn't good at it, he wouldn't be in business.

455
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,300
 And he finds these women.

456
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,600
 He approaches them.

457
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,200
 I think the easiest selling point in this scenario would be,

458
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,500
 I work for X Company.

459
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,900
 We're looking for extras for our new nerd movie.

460
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,700
 You would be perfect in that.

461
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,600
 You had to stay a couple more days.

462
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,600
 We're doing a shoot.

463
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,400
 Da da da da da.

464
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,000
 And these girls who are coming from BFE out in the middle of nowhere,

465
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,400
 coming to this Comic Con, dressed sexy for the first time.

466
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,200
 They feel sexy for the in their hometown.

467
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,200
 They're a big old nerd.

468
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,500
 But now that they're in this Comic Con, they're wearing that skin type black widow outfit

469
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:12,800
 and guys are stopping to take pictures with them and they feel totally empowered and all this stuff.

470
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,900
 And to have someone come up, an older man come up and say,

471
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,800
 we are going to do this film project.

472
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,300
 We're going to start shooting in a couple of days.

473
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,200
 Can you stay a couple of days?

474
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:20,700
 No, worry.

475
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,900
 You can stay in my buddy's house.

476
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,900
 Yeah, no, we got a total or you have a girl approach them.

477
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,900
 Hey, you know, I'm a recruiter and we're doing this show and we would love to have you on it.

478
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,900
 You're getting all this attention.

479
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,100
 Hey, you can stay in my buddy's house.

480
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,500
 We just going to be a couple more days before we can do the shoot.

481
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:40,300
 Snatch like like a talent like an Eagles talents digging into a trout.

482
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:44,100
 And by the time you realize you're in danger, you're already a hundred feet up in the air

483
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,700
 and you're watching that water get farther and farther away.

484
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,900
 Those talents are deep inside of you.

485
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,200
 But Jason, those girls are dumb.

486
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,400
 I know better.

487
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,500
 I wouldn't do that.

488
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,900
 Predators are like cult leaders.

489
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,900
 These people do what they do for a living.

490
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,800
 They're very, very good at it.

491
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,500
 Very good at it.

492
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,900
 Billion billions of dollars a year.

493
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,900
 This industry rakes in comic con child recruitment.

494
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,000
 I believe is on the conspiracy theory iceberg for two reasons.

495
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,600
 I actually think it's on there for one reason, but then we're going to actually put on our conspiracy cap

496
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,500
 and really go the extra mile with this one.

497
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,500
 You can make the argument that the scenario I just laid out for you happens

498
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:29,700
 and it happens all the time at comic book conventions because I think it is the perfect hunting ground for a predator.

499
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,300
 You're going to get people who are socially awkward.

500
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:37,200
 You're going to get people who are dressed super provocatively and getting attention they never got before.

501
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:43,500
 At their hometown, they're just little Sally who wears a potato sack and hear their witch blade.

502
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,900
 People are stopping them taking their photos.

503
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,800
 They feel like a starlet and then someone comes out and says they can make them a star.

504
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,400
 Someone comes out and says you want to go out to coffee.

505
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,800
 I think the stardom thing works more because they're already getting a ton of attention there,

506
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,700
 but it could be both.

507
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,800
 It could be both 100% get those claws into them.

508
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:05,100
 Now on one hand, you could say it's on the conspiracy iceberg comic con child recruitment because of that,

509
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,300
 because it is a perfect hunting ground for a predator.

510
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:13,500
 You're meeting people who are socially awkward and wearing provocative costumes,

511
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,100
 getting attention for the first time.

512
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:19,200
 Someone pops out of the woodwork and goes, we can make you a star blah blah blah blah.

513
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,400
 That's definitely reasonable, but we're going to take it a step further.

514
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,700
 We're going to put on our conspiracy because that is likely.

515
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,600
 And that would actually happen at any place where you're going to have a sizable group of young women.

516
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,200
 You're going to have traffickers try to set up at YWCA's.

517
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,200
 You're going to have traffickers try to set up at, I don't know, Bed Bath and Beyond, wherever.

518
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,800
 Wherever you can find a group.

519
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:45,900
 I wonder if actually that makes me wonder if, I guess you're probably, I guess you're older women,

520
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:51,600
 but anywhere where you would have younger, I'm now imagining a pimp hiding in the pillow section.

521
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,700
 The anywhere where you would have young women congregate, you're going to try to have child traffickers get in.

522
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,100
 Disneyland has issues with it.

523
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,000
 Don't sue me, Disney.

524
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,700
 Allegedly has issues with it, but we're going to take it a step further because that's what we're going to do.

525
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:12,400
 We're going to put on our conspiracy caps and we've done this in the past with like golf rumors, the ocean at night, ageless travel,

526
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,800
 all these other conspiracy theories on the conspiracy theory iceberg.

527
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,000
 We're going to take it to the next level.

528
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,700
 Now, what I'm about to say, I have no proof for it.

529
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,300
 I don't necessarily even believe it, but we're going to take this to the next level.

530
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:29,100
 Your goal is to, you're a child trafficker.

531
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,100
 Sorry, well, not you.

532
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,400
 We'll make person X is a child trafficker.

533
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,000
 Now X has an issue.

534
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,700
 They need more kids and this is a very, very lucrative business.

535
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:48,100
 So you're looking at a landscape and you go, we can, the Bed Bath and Beyond Initiative didn't really work.

536
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,100
 We need to get more kids.

537
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,600
 I need in particular more young girls.

538
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:58,100
 So you have this child trafficker thinking, how do I get the kids to come to me?

539
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,600
 Because again, I'm not, I'm done.

540
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,200
 I'm so high up in the game.

541
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,200
 I'm not trying to get one kid at a time.

542
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,600
 I want to get hundreds or thousands at a time to fuel the need for my business.

543
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:14,500
 It's absolutely disgusting that there's even an industry dedicated to the sex.

544
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:20,400
 I mean, it's absolutely bizarre that they're even pulling in this much money, right?

545
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,000
 But you know, people are disgusting.

546
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,100
 So he has a product he needs.

547
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,300
 He has an audience.

548
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,100
 He just, just running out of product.

549
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,700
 You can get them to come to him.

550
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:34,800
 Now, you could go, oh, are you saying that, and again, in theory, I'm not saying that I believe this,

551
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:40,600
 but that the comic book conventions were created by child traffickers.

552
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,600
 No, because I, like I said earlier, back in '88 when I was going to comic book conventions,

553
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,900
 there weren't a lot of people going nowhere even close to one of these big conventions now,

554
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,600
 which can have 130,000 people to it.

555
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,100
 And it was all dudes.

556
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,300
 It was all dudes.

557
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:02,600
 There was maybe, there wasn't even token girls there.

558
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,200
 Every so often, you'd go to a comic book shop and someone would have their girlfriend in there.

559
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,300
 There'd be a sister.

560
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:11,400
 But growing up, it was incredibly rare, incredibly rare.

561
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,000
 And I was at a comic book shop all the time.

562
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,300
 I mean, anecdotal, but still, it's super rare.

563
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,400
 So just starting a comic book convention wouldn't change anything,

564
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,900
 but you have a child trafficker who's raking in one of the top guys here.

565
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,700
 He's raking in millions and millions and millions of dollars a year.

566
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:33,100
 Not only that, but he's supplying children to very, very powerful people.

567
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,000
 And he makes a suggestion.

568
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,300
 I want to have conventions.

569
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:43,600
 These comic book conventions you guys already have where all these pasty face nerds show up.

570
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,300
 They're looking through old issues of new mutants and stuff like that.

571
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,000
 It's perfect.

572
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,700
 It's perfect.

573
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,600
 But the problem is, is that there's not enough chicks.

574
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,400
 I'm gonna make some phone calls and start calling up people.

575
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,000
 This is where it gets weird, guys.

576
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,300
 This starts calling up people.

577
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,900
 You need to have more women in your superhero movies.

578
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,700
 What?

579
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,100
 Yes, hear me out.

580
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:08,000
 We need to have more women in video games and superhero movies and comic books.

581
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 We need to make nerd culture accessible to women.

582
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,400
 And the child trafficker goes, "This is my endgame.

583
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,300
 I can get young women to travel from all over the United States,

584
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,300
 from all over the world, really, to some of these big conventions.

585
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,200
 I haven't come to the United States.

586
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,900
 And we'll have our pick of the best of the best.

587
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,800
 We have three days to hunt this girl, that girl.

588
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:36,700
 I can put 10 recruiters into a convention and each one can pull 50 girls.

589
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,400
 And out of those 50, maybe 10 or 20 will stick around.

590
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:45,100
 Over the course of three days, I can get 200 new prospects.

591
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,200
 And then we'll do it in the next comic book convention.

592
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,100
 But see, I need to get these young women to be into nerd culture.

593
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,200
 So let's reboot Doctor Who.

594
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,600
 Let's add that Captain Marvel character.

595
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,600
 Let's do this.

596
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,300
 Let's do that.

597
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,600
 Let's reboot all this stuff and put in a bunch of women.

598
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:05,100
 And see, it's a win-win because you guys will look like you're doing it

599
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,300
 because you're for women's rights.

600
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:12,500
 The movie studio looks like they're doing something to promote women, to promote women.

601
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:17,700
 It doesn't matter that what they're promoting is violent, right?

602
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:22,200
 It doesn't matter what they're promoting is reinforcing gender stereotypes,

603
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,700
 but in a costume that even though now I'm badass and I'm like punching people in the face,

604
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,400
 I still have to have a certain body type.

605
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:35,100
 I'll still get applauded because I've taken a generic male hero

606
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:40,800
 and replaced it with a woman who's very attractive and slim.

607
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,500
 But it's inclusive.

608
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:50,100
 So you get brownie points and I get young women who don't know their place in the world,

609
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,700
 who are socially awkward, dressing up as their favorite hero

610
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:58,600
 and traveling a thousand miles from their hometown.

611
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,700
 Obviously, that's insane.

612
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,400
 There's, there's, that's insane.

613
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,400
 There's no, there's never been even a hint of a connection

614
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,200
 between sex trafficking in Hollywood, right?

615
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,400
 That's never happened.

616
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,200
 Never.

617
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:16,100
 We've never ever heard of some high level Hollywood person being connected with horrible sex crimes

618
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,300
 or trafficking of any kind, drug trafficking, human trafficking.

619
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,800
 It's never happened, right?

620
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,100
 But that's never happened, right?

621
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,900
 None of that's ever happened.

622
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:29,100
 It was crazy to think that a high level trafficker could talk to any major player in Hollywood.

623
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:34,600
 Why would someone who makes millions of dollars a year off the misery of children

624
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,600
 be able to call up this producer?

625
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,800
 It's not like they would ever know each other.

626
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,900
 It's not like they both operate in the city of LA.

627
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,700
 It's not like the rich like to hang out with the powerful and vice versa.

628
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:49,400
 Obviously, that conspiracy theory, I cranked it up to 11, right?

629
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:54,500
 That conspiracy theory is most likely not true.

630
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:59,600
 It's just another trip across the conspiracy theory iceberg to see how insane things can get.

631
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,700
 But it's not insane because it could never happen.

632
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,700
 It's insane because if it was happening,

633
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,300
 if the reason we're seeing the empowerment of women in nerd culture

634
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:14,500
 isn't to actually make young women feel good about their place in the world,

635
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:19,900
 but to get them to become a product of sex trafficking.

636
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,800
 It sounds absolutely bizarre, right?

637
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,000
 It sounds foolish even.

638
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 But it's not insane because it sounds bizarre and because it sounds foolish.

639
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,100
 It sounds insane because it...

640
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,400
 sounds...

641
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,600
 It sounds insane because it sounds plausible.

642
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:44,200
 And while I don't necessarily believe that that is true,

643
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:51,100
 I just can't shake the feeling that there might be some truth to it.
