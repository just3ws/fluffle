1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,700
 Police get a call that a girl is running down the street late at night.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,800
 When one officer is sent to find out what's going on with the youngster,

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,300
 he comes face to face with the paranormal.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,500
 And then we end Sea Serpent Week with a feast.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,300
 For the longest time, these monsters of the ocean have fed on humans.

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,200
 Today, we're gonna take a bite out of them.

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,000
 And yes, it's an interactive adventure today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,700
 [Music]

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,200
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,200
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,500
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,300
 We got so much stuff to get through today.

13
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,400
 So much awesomeness.

14
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,700
 First off, let's take a look at this art.

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,200
 For Fan Art Friday, this was drawn by Mountain Man Jake93.

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,500
 He posted it on the Dead Rabbit Radio subreddit.

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,000
 And guys, let's start hanging out on that.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,200
 I know some of you guys don't like Reddit that much,

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,800
 but we can hang out on this subreddit as well.

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,500
 The YouTube channel is back up too.

21
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,000
 I got one of the community strikes successfully appealed.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,700
 I don't know what I'm gonna do going forward, post new episodes.

23
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,000
 I'm still trying to figure that out.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,100
 But we're back on YouTube.

25
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,400
 We got this subreddit going.

26
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,200
 Mountain Man Jake drew this amazing artwork.

27
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:16,900
 Look at that.

28
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,800
 Unless you're driving.

29
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,200
 Unless you're driving and then keep looking at the road.

30
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,400
 It's artwork based on walking Sam, the tall man,

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,400
 the demon that stalks the Lakota nation

32
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,700
 and tries to get its youth to kill themselves.

33
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,200
 Very, very dark and depressing story.

34
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,000
 I'll put the episode in the show notes if you didn't hear it.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 If you want to ruin your weekend, it's already one of my favorite stories.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,200
 And this artwork's amazing.

37
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,200
 So thank you so much, Mountain Man Jake93 for creating this artwork.

38
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,300
 Really glad we have it.

39
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,500
 Another thing I'm glad that we have is our newest pilots,

40
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,400
 our newest captain of the show.

41
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,200
 Walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now flanked by two fluffy rabbit bodyguards.

42
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,900
 They're human size.

43
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,900
 If they're just normal bunnies, wouldn't be impressive.

44
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,200
 It's Crystal Bath.

45
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,900
 Everyone give a round of applause to Crystal Bath.

46
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,600
 Her little bunny guards are wearing.

47
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,800
 That's great.

48
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,800
 Why didn't I use that before?

49
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,500
 Bunny guards, they got the sunglasses.

50
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,400
 They got the black suits.

51
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,600
 I guess they could have just had black fur, but she's walking in with her bodyguards.

52
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:19,300
 Crystal Bath, aka Crystal Bunny, aka Bunny, is going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

53
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,100
 She's actually the best friend of Beatrice Lava.

54
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,300
 She's a longtime Patreon supporter and our Forest Finn expert.

55
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,900
 So Beatrice, thank you so much for introducing us to Crystal Bath.

56
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,400
 Crystal is going to be in charge.

57
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,600
 You sasser, you backtalker, the bunny guards are going to let you know what's what.

58
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,400
 Crystal Bunny, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

59
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,900
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

60
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,400
 We are headed out to Mentor, Ohio.

61
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,900
 [Metro sound]

62
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,400
 I don't know what those sound if I could.

63
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,600
 [Metro sound]

64
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,700
 I can't do the sound effects.

65
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,400
 I'm recording in the haunted closet again.

66
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,600
 I think this is my new studio.

67
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,900
 I'm trying to figure out this.

68
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,400
 [Metro sound]

69
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,500
 That's a theme song for a television show.

70
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,000
 Anyways, Jason Jalopy and Mix Jalopy noises like the Chitty Chitty Bing Bing car.

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,900
 We're in Mentor, Ohio.

72
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,500
 It's March 10th, 2021.

73
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,800
 The bunny guards get out.

74
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,000
 They're stalking around the area.

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,800
 They're looking for carrots.

76
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,300
 They're supposed to be protecting us.

77
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,000
 They're looking for carrots.

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,400
 It's 10.40 PM.

79
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,800
 The Mentor Police Department have received a phone call.

80
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,400
 A seven-year-old girl was spotted running down the street.

81
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
 And the caller said--

82
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,500
 The caller described the girl and said she was running really, really quickly.

83
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,900
 So I'm worried.

84
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,800
 I mean, I'm not going to get off my couch and see if someone's chasing her.

85
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,400
 But maybe you can send out one of those so-called police officers and have them do it.

86
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,500
 I'm too busy watching Charles in charge because I'm in a time warp in the years 1987.

87
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,700
 So they send out an officer.

88
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,900
 We'll call him Officer Jones.

89
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,100
 And he starts patrolling the area.

90
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:53,200
 And she was spotted running towards Bellflower Elementary School.

91
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,200
 You know, you're thinking it could be a runaway.

92
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,400
 This girl could be in distress.

93
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,200
 She could be lost.

94
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,300
 Who knows?

95
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,700
 The cop's driving down the road and he sees her.

96
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:06,000
 And she matches perfectly the description that was given by the person who called 911.

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,100
 But he notices two things very odd about this seven-year-old.

98
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,200
 First off, she was running incredibly fast.

99
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,700
 Faster than you would think a seven-year-old.

100
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,200
 Probably faster than you would imagine even an adult could run.

101
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,800
 We'll get to that in a second.

102
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,300
 And he said she was running erect.

103
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,300
 So her back was straight up and her legs were moving.

104
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,500
 Almost like a loony-tune character.

105
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,000
 Almost like, uh, I added this detail.

106
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,300
 He didn't say it looked like Wiley Coyote.

107
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,500
 You know how like cartoon characters, their back will be straight and their legs will be like,

108
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,800
 "Woo-boo-boo-boo-boo," making the circles?

109
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,800
 Circle legs were not in the police report.

110
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,300
 He just said that her back was straight as she was running super fast.

111
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,700
 Very odd-looking.

112
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,100
 And he sees her go around this building.

113
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:53,600
 So he has to get out of his car, gets his flashlight, and starts looking in the area.

114
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,500
 He can't find her.

115
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,600
 He's thinking, you know, she's probably scared.

116
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
 She's out this late at night.

117
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,400
 She probably shouldn't be.

118
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,300
 She knows the cops you're looking for.

119
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,400
 Probably has a time back.

120
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,000
 Probably has some cocaine on her.

121
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,800
 But he's looking around the area.

122
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,600
 He can't find her.

123
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,100
 He's looking all over the area now.

124
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:08,600
 He can't find her.

125
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,700
 So he calls in backup and they actually bring out other officers.

126
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,900
 They can't find her.

127
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,000
 You're like, "Are you sure you saw her?

128
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,400
 It's like, yeah, I saw her run by."

129
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,200
 We have this report.

130
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,000
 A 911 call.

131
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,200
 This girl was running by.

132
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,900
 The cops bring out a canine unit.

133
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,900
 Still can't find her.

134
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,000
 They start flying drones in the area.

135
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,300
 They can't find her.

136
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,700
 And Officer Jones goes, "Okay, I don't know what's going on.

137
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,600
 She should be in this area.

138
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,800
 She's fast.

139
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,000
 She's not that fast.

140
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,700
 She's not in another city in Ohio at this point."

141
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,800
 We shouldn't start looking in Toledo.

142
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,900
 But he goes to catch it.

143
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,400
 He's like, "Let's just watch the dash cam because I'll show you what I saw."

144
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,100
 And so they go over and he turns on the dash cam of his car.

145
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,100
 And there's no one running past the car.

146
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,200
 And he goes, "This is the part where I saw her.

147
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,200
 I was looking right at her.

148
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,200
 She ran by.

149
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,400
 It's not on dash cam."

150
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,700
 At that point, we're sure the other cops are making fun of them.

151
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,100
 They're like, "Ghost cop, ghost cop."

152
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:03,900
 They're all making fun of them.

153
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,300
 They start putting like Casper the ghost on his locker.

154
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,500
 I hate when people do that.

155
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,200
 I mean, I'm doing it on my podcast.

156
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:15,100
 But one of the things that sucks is like police officers or really anyone in any sort of professional thing,

157
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,900
 airline pilots get it with UFOs, you see bizarre phenomenon and you don't want to say anything

158
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,200
 because you know you're going to get made fun of.

159
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,500
 Now, if someone makes fun of like you over something dumb like you put your pants on backwards,

160
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,100
 you're just like, "What?

161
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:26,900
 Dude, Chris Cross?

162
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,700
 Chris Cross is coming back."

163
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,200
 But it has to do with your job and things like that.

164
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,300
 And people are--

165
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,800
 But I'm sure people were like, "Hey, man.

166
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,300
 Did you see the ring girl today where you watching television to go all staticky?

167
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,100
 Go away, guys.

168
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,900
 Officer Jones is crying in the corner."

169
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,000
 That could be happening.

170
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,700
 But what's really, really odd about this is you think, "Okay, someone saw a girl running down the street,

171
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:55,300
 made a phone call, described her perfectly so that the police officer could later identify

172
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,100
 that girl running down the street in that same area.

173
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,900
 They had called out all these cops.

174
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,700
 It wasn't on his dash cam.

175
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,300
 There is video footage of this girl."

176
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,300
 This is so creepy, guys.

177
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:16,800
 In the show notes, you're going to see an article that has video footage, just like a ring doorbell footage.

178
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:26,100
 And you see this thing run faster than I could, which isn't a high gate.

179
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,700
 But maybe even faster than you could.

180
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,700
 It's running incredibly fast and it's upright.

181
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,300
 It's complete.

182
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,100
 Its back is completely straight and it runs across.

183
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,300
 It's like on the other side of the street from the ring doorbell camera.

184
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,300
 You see something run super fast down the street.

185
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,400
 So what is going on in this area?

186
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,700
 You have someone see it with their own eyes, call 911.

187
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,900
 To believe it enough, they called it in.

188
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:58,000
 911, you had an officer see the exact same figure bringing out all these cops because he swears to God

189
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,800
 that he saw this thing, didn't pick it up on his camera.

190
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,000
 But then you have a ring doorbell camera describing, showing the same thing.

191
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,300
 The officer was describing, running towards an elementary school.

192
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,900
 That is creepy.

193
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,600
 That is a creepy story.

194
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,300
 Without the video footage at the end, I still think it was a creepy story.

195
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:25,200
 But knowing that there is footage of this thing and then you have other witnesses to it,

196
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:31,100
 there really may be a phantom running through the streets of Mentor, Ohio.

197
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,300
 Creepy story.

198
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,000
 For the first time in my life, I'm glad I'm not a resident of Mentor, Ohio.

199
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,600
 I've always wanted to move there.

200
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,400
 It always seems like an amazing city, but not anymore.

201
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:49,400
 Because there might be a vague possibility that there is a ghost girl there.

202
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,600
 Crystal, Bunny, let's go ahead and hop in the Carbenter copter.

203
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,800
 We are going to say goodbye to Mentor, Ohio.

204
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,700
 As we're taken off, we see Officer Jones.

205
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,600
 He's getting possessed by the ghost girl.

206
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,100
 No, I have a family.

207
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,500
 And then he's running super fast straight down the road.

208
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
 We probably saved him.

209
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,100
 We have all these anti-exorcism tools in the back of the Carbenter copter.

210
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,400
 Bye, Officer Jones.

211
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,700
 He's running around.

212
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,300
 He's destroying humanity.

213
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,800
 Well, the humanity of Mentor, Ohio.

214
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,600
 But bye.

215
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,600
 See you later.

216
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,000
 We're headed out and yelling out to Officer Jones.

217
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,600
 I'm like, Hey, Officer Jones, are you doing anything this weekend?

218
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,400
 He looks up at me as mouth is frothing with demonic foam.

219
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,400
 And I say, new today on digital on demand.

220
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,500
 Joel McCabe yelling it out of the Carbenter copter.

221
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,400
 New today on digital and on demand.

222
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:45,400
 Joel McCale and Carrie Bache lead an all-star cast in the dark, romantic comedy happily.

223
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,100
 The film centers around a couple who, after 14 years of marriage,

224
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:53,400
 discovered their friends are resentful of their constant public displays of affection.

225
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,700
 When a visit from a mysterious stranger leads to a dead body,

226
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,200
 they begin to question the loyalty of their so-called friends.

227
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,400
 Buy or rent happily today on digital and on demand.

228
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,500
 Rated R from Paramount Pictures.

229
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:06,500
 Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-du

230
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:34,700
 [Chorus]

231
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,800
 Crystal Bunny is flying over Iceland, the coast of Iceland.

232
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,200
 The bunny guards are back as well.

233
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,300
 We're definitely going to need them for this story.

234
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,100
 Now, most of the information I got from this story was from a mysterious universe article

235
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,600
 written by Chrissy Elliott.

236
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,100
 So thank you, Chrissy, very much for writing this.

237
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,800
 Very, very interesting story.

238
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,300
 As Crystal is taking us over the coastline of Iceland,

239
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,600
 now I'm basically a tour guide and pointing at stuff and I'm like, see that?

240
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,500
 That's a rock and that's some ice.

241
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,700
 And then I turn to you and I go, okay, tour's over.

242
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,500
 That's all of Iceland.

243
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,400
 But you know, it's funny because Iceland has a lot of stories about sea monsters

244
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,800
 and I'll give them this.

245
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,800
 Out of any place on the planet other than like the deep, deep ocean,

246
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,200
 I could see sea monsters living around Iceland.

247
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,100
 It wasn't, there were no indigenous people on Iceland that we know of.

248
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,400
 It wasn't settled until the 9th century.

249
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,200
 So you can imagine for millions of years,

250
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,700
 well, humans have been around for what, a couple hundred thousand years in like their current form.

251
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:37,400
 No whaling, no mass fishing, nothing.

252
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,000
 You would have had these creatures that had been there for the longest time.

253
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 Billy Joel, Billy Joel standing there singing that song.

254
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,900
 Haunted closet madness is kicking in.

255
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,800
 The jokes, the jokes get weird from here on out, guys.

256
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,500
 You can imagine like the sea monsters, that would be their domain.

257
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,700
 Lots of fish for them to eat.

258
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,900
 No predator above them.

259
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,100
 Humans haven't reached that yet.

260
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,000
 They're not hunting them.

261
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,800
 They're not spearing them.

262
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,600
 They're not trying to eat them.

263
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,100
 Now in Iceland, there's a lot of stories about their sea monsters with a,

264
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,600
 they're like typical sea monsters.

265
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,500
 They're ravenous.

266
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,900
 They'll destroy humanity.

267
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,500
 They eat people.

268
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,000
 But these monsters haven't added bonus to them.

269
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,200
 They're poisonous.

270
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,000
 They're actually toxic for people to eat.

271
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,600
 Now I know what you're thinking.

272
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,900
 I've been thinking it too.

273
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,300
 I totally want to take a bite out of the Loch Ness monster.

274
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,700
 Those humps, those humps, those humps look so delicious.

275
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:38,300
 If someone brought to you like a big chunk, like a three feet in diameter chunk of meat

276
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,700
 and said, "This is the Loch Ness monster.

277
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,900
 We already killed a sea cat.

278
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,200
 You can't complain about that."

279
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,400
 You'd eat it.

280
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,600
 I'd eat the Loch Ness monster.

281
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,200
 I'd argue that even a vegetarian would be like looking from side to side,

282
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,200
 making sure none of their vegan friends were around and then "um, um, um, um, um."

283
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,700
 Eating the Loch Ness monster.

284
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,200
 I probably wouldn't eat bigfoot meat that's a little too close to cannibalism,

285
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,500
 but I chow down on a reptilian.

286
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,800
 I heard it tastes like chicken.

287
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,200
 I heard it tastes like those chicken aliens from Zeta Veticuli.

288
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,800
 I totally eat the Loch Ness monster.

289
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,900
 I'd eat a lot of cryptids, but apparently probably I shouldn't

290
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:18,100
 because we know for a fact, in fact being the legends of Iceland,

291
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,400
 that they are toxic.

292
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,900
 The toxic ones live in Iceland.

293
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,000
 So Crystal Bunny, let's land this carbonicopter.

294
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 We're walking along the beaches now of Iceland and we see...

295
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,600
 [makes noises]

296
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,000
 It's a theme song.

297
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,500
 I don't know what that became.

298
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:40,300
 We see the Skelligus Charismalius.

299
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,700
 It looks to me because that's not how you pronounce my name

300
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,700
 and I said I know.

301
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,100
 It's going to be a very difficult episode,

302
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:50,000
 but the Skelligar Calamias is walking people in Iceland.

303
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,300
 I don't know.

304
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,100
 I don't even know what you're trying to say.

305
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,500
 This is a horse-sized cryptid.

306
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,200
 That walks.

307
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,500
 It has four legs.

308
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:04,700
 It lives in the sea, but at night, it walks up onto the beach.

309
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,200
 It's massive, but it has like little legs.

310
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,500
 It basically looks like a dinosaur.

311
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,300
 It has the tail with the little ball on the end of it.

312
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,900
 And it's completely armored.

313
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,300
 It's just a collection of scales and a little furry face

314
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,800
 and little furry legs carried across the ground.

315
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,100
 It's eyes glow red.

316
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,500
 [imitates red noise]

317
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,000
 Its mouth glows red for some weird reason.

318
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,800
 [imitates red noise]

319
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,200
 And it likes to smash up farms.

320
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,500
 It likes to walk into farms.

321
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,300
 It has its tail.

322
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,100
 It's like knocking sheep over.

323
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,300
 It's jumping over fences.

324
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,300
 It's making sure the sheep can't jump over fences.

325
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,900
 You're like, "I can't sleep.

326
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,800
 I haven't slept in years.

327
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,800
 Damn Skellige marschlia."

328
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,700
 And it likes to break into barns.

329
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,600
 So obviously the farmers have a serious problem with this thing.

330
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,500
 Can you eat it?

331
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,400
 If you picked the number two, you try to eat it.

332
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,500
 You're standing out super late at night.

333
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,700
 You're outside of a barn.

334
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,600
 You see the sheep.

335
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,300
 The sheep are all running and they're hiding.

336
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,700
 [imitates sheep noises]

337
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,400
 You see the Skellige marschlia show up.

338
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,500
 And you have a knife and a fork and a gun.

339
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,200
 You're lucky.

340
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,100
 You're lucky because you know what its weakness is.

341
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,600
 Not a gun.

342
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,100
 Not a gun.

343
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,800
 Everything's weakness is a gun.

344
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,700
 No human weapon can pierce it.

345
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,800
 But if you have a gun that's loaded with silver buttons,

346
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,400
 I was going to say silver bullets.

347
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,800
 You had all the silver bullets prepared.

348
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,900
 No, you need silver buttons.

349
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,700
 You need something called gray willow catkins,

350
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:37,000
 which apparently is like some sort of flower or lamp poop.

351
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,900
 If you turn lamp poop into a bullet and shoot it at this creature,

352
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,000
 [imitates animal noises]

353
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,800
 he dies.

354
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,500
 And as he's dying, you run up and you take a big bite.

355
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,700
 You laugh at fresh.

356
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,900
 You need that fresh Skellige marschlia meat.

357
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,300
 You take a big bite out of it.

358
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,800
 If you picked number two,

359
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,600
 [imitates animal noises]

360
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,700
 we're just standing around looking at all the number two.

361
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,100
 Who's looking at all the number two?

362
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,200
 It's holding her nose.

363
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,500
 If you picked number two,

364
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:09,200
 you found out very quickly that the Skellige marschlia's blood is extremely poisonous.

365
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,200
 Like I said, you like that meat rare.

366
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,900
 You like that meat bloody.

367
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,600
 [imitates animal noises]

368
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,400
 The blood is boiling in your throat.

369
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,600
 Yeah, it's one of those episodes.

370
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,100
 The blood is boiling in your throat.

371
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,200
 [imitates animal noises]

372
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,800
 Your eyes start to bleed.

373
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,100
 Your ears start to bleed.

374
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,100
 Your blood starts to bleed.

375
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,300
 This Skellige marschlia blood is so toxic.

376
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,500
 It'll kill you in agony on the spot.

377
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,000
 And let's say, let's go back in time a bit.

378
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,600
 I'll allow the number two because you guys are the experimental number.

379

 [imitates animal noises]

380
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,600
 We've rewound time.

381
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,800
 You don't take a bite out of it.

382
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,300
 You've just shot it with lamp poop and you walk up to it

383
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,900
 and you start just kicking its corpse.

384
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,500
 Well, if you even get near one of these things,

385
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,100
 as you're kicking its corpse,

386
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,100
 you're like, "That's weird. I can't feel anything in my leg."

387
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,400
 Let me use the other leg.

388
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,400
 I should go to the hospital, but I'll start using the other leg to kick this thing.

389
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,600
 Congratulations, you have leprosy.

390
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,300
 If you pick number two,

391
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,600
 if you even go near these things

392
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,400
 and you engage them in any sort of physical fight,

393
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,000
 you will get leprosy.

394
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,600
 And you're like, "Ah, my legs."

395
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,300
 And then as you're trying to run away on your leprosy legs,

396
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,600
 blood starts chasing you.

397
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,300
 You're running downhill and blood is leaking from the Skellige marschlia.

398
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,100
 And it's going down a hill and you're like, "No, no."

399
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,600
 And you're like, "Are still running, but now you fall."

400
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
 Because your legs are full of leprosy and you roll

401
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,700
 and you're laying on the ground and your mouth is open.

402
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,900
 Ah!

403
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,700
 And you watch the blood trickle down the hill.

404
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,800
 It's still like 30 feet up, but you're kind of tired now.

405
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,600
 You were running for so long, so you're just like, "I'm just going to lay here."

406
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,100
 And the blood goes in your mouth.

407
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,500
 Congratulations, you have leprosy and you are poisoned.

408
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,200
 If you pick number two, that was a bad number.

409
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,300
 That was a bad number to pick.

410
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,400
 Crystal Bunny, take us to our next location.

411
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,100
 Number two is like, "Don't leave us.

412
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,500
 We'll pick you up after the episode.

413
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,000
 You guys will be fine."

414
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,600
 Not really.

415
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,800
 You guys are poisoned and you have leprosy,

416
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,300
 but under the net, you'll be fine.

417
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:11,300
 Crystal, take us out to another part of Iceland,

418
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,800

 [Jason reading]

421
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,600
 Splish splash.

422
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,400
 Splishity splash splash.

423
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,700
 Splish splash.

424
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,500
 And what we're looking at,

425
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,200
 this one really doesn't have that interesting of a description.

426
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,300
 It's basically a trout.

427
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,300
 It's basically a trout.

428
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,700
 But, it's delicious.

429
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,300
 I love trout.

430
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,100
 I'm like, "Hold on. Don't eat it yet. Don't eat it yet."

431
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,200
 What we're looking at is the ofaguggie.

432
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,500
 The ofaguggie splishity splash splash.

433
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,400
 It's a trout.

434
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,200
 It's a brown trout, but you notice something.

435
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,000
 It's swimming backwards.

436
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,200
 Huh?

437
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,000
 And we see the little tail coming towards us.

438
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,300
 And then as it passes us, we see a little mouth going,

439
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,300
 "Num, num, num, num."

440
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,100
 Somehow, it's able to swim backwards and its mouth

441
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,000
 is facing the other direction.

442
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,200
 So, how does it eat?

443
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,500
 Well, it loves to eat people.

444
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,900
 So, it doesn't matter which direction it's going in.

445
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,100
 It basically eats the bodies of drowned sailors.

446
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,300
 So, at that point, it's like it's not a predator.

447
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,200
 It's more of a scavenger.

448
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,000
 The ofaguggie guggy, it's...

449
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 I actually wrote in my notes.

450
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,800
 I wrote it down wrong.

451
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,700
 I said it's so massive, it can swallow a man in one gulp.

452
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,100
 And then it kept talking about how people accidentally eat these things.

453
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,300
 I'm like, "How do you accidentally eat a fish bigger than a man?"

454
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,500
 I was looking at the scale of drawing wrong.

455
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,700
 So, we can't do that.

456
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,400
 But the ofaguggie guggy is just a normal-sized trout.

457
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,600
 So, it can trick you.

458
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,800
 If you're fishing for trout and you see this thing swimming by,

459
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,400
 you're like, "Hey, it's one of those things that Jason can't pronounce,

460
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,100
 like everything else on the planet.

461
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,700
 Can I eat it?"

462
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:14,000
 So, if you picked number one, you go, "Yep, I can eat it."

463
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,800
 Now, what's interesting is the ofaguggie guggy, as far as like a cryptid goes,

464
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,900
 it's just a fish that swims backwards.

465
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,000
 The first one that I don't remember how to pronounce

466
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,600
 because I don't have my notes in front of me.

467
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,000
 I moved on from there.

468
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,800
 It was invulnerable to really all weapons unless you have the right ammo.

469
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
 And it could walk on land.

470
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,900
 It could smash stuff up.

471
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,800
 It was constantly just kind of jacking with dudes.

472
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,400
 It could give you leprosy.

473
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,700
 This was just a fish.

474
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,600
 So, you go, "Sure, I can eat fish."

475
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,000
 So, if you pick number one, you're going to take your ofaguggie guggy.

476
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,900
 You take it home.

477
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,300
 You cook it up.

478
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,200
 You're not like that first weirdo trying to eat it raw.

479
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,600
 You cook it up and you take a bite out of it.

480
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,500
 Mmm.

481
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
 Oh, that was delicious.

482
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,200
 Hmm.

483
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,100
 I'll have another bite.

484
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,400
 I guess maybe I can eat this.

485
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,300
 Maybe number one was the right number.

486
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,000
 Um, wait a second.

487
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,300
 There probably is no right number.

488
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,100
 This is a paranormal podcast.

489
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,600
 Ugh.

490
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,700
 Oh, my stomach.

491
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,200
 What?

492
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,900
 Oh, maybe another bite will cure what ails me.

493
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,200
 Um, nom, nom.

494
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,400
 Ugh.

495
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,600
 You start feeling your stomach hurt a lot.

496
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,300
 You're like, "Oh, my goodness."

497
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,400
 And then you see your stomach kind of move.

498
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,100
 And then it starts to throb.

499
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,400
 Whoa, whoa, whoa.

500
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,600
 You start to inflate.

501
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,700
 Ugh.

502
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,300
 Your stomach starts to expand.

503
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,700
 Crystal Bunny's like, "Damn it.

504
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,200
 Is this really the gross episode I'm on?"

505
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,200
 Sorry, ma'am.

506
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,300
 Ugh.

507
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,800
 Stomach's starting to bloat.

508
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,200
 Oh, my goodness.

509
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,400
 Until finally it explodes.

510
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,000
 Pfft.

511
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,800
 And when someone who's eaten an Ophi-Guggy-Guggy is found,

512
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:53,900
 the wound in their stomach is in the shape of a cross.

513
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,500
 So I don't know if this fish is a devout Christian.

514
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,400
 I don't know if this fish is born again.

515
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,800
 Or if it's the power of Christ that's actually destroying the fish inside of you.

516
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,300
 Your body is simply collateral damage.

517
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:11,600
 Or if it's just a design, it's the most economical way, is that a word?

518
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
 And this context, it's the easy--

519
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,100
 it's the path of less resistance is the cross bursting out of your stomach.

520
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:25,300
 There's actually a famous legend in Iceland of a family all eating an Ophi-Guggy-Guggy for dinner.

521
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,800
 There was a young girl there who was like, "No, father, no mother.

522
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,800
 I am not hungry.

523
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,600
 I'm not hungry.

524
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,100
 I've been listening to Ted Rabin Radio."

525
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:37,100
 And he's telling these disgusting stories about explosions.

526
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,400
 And so the rest of the family eats the Ophi-Guggy-Guggy,

527
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,200
 and then they're sitting around the dinner table, "Oh, my stomach!

528
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:42,200
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

529
00:22:42,200 --> 00:23:12,200
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

530
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:40,100
 Used to be digesting."

531
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:46,800
 Now we see this boat in the water.

532
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,400
 Big boat.

533
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,700
 It's like a galleon, except those are from Spain.

534
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,600
 So it's the Icelandic version of that.

535
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,600
 A big Viking boat.

536
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,300
 Oy, mateys, and the boat's like going.

537
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,200
 The Viking captain has one patch in a peg leg.

538
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,700
 He's a Viking pirate.

539
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:05,600
 And in the water, there's just a whale laying there with its tummy exposed.

540
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,800
 And the Viking ship sees it and they're like, "You know what?

541
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,900
 A whale's a whale, right?

542
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,600
 We're going to eat it.

543
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,200
 We're going to take it home.

544
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,200
 We're going to turn its blubber into oil for lanterns and sell the whale eyes to witches

545
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,200
 and all the stuff you do with whales."

546
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,400
 So they go to Harpoonet, and all of a sudden, as the Harpoonet is headed out this thing,

547
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,000
 it spins around.

548
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,900
 This wasn't any whale.

549
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:32,700
 It was the Rod Kimberger, or the Red Crest.

550
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,700
 Starts splashing.

551
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,500
 This is a creature that's so huge.

552
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,200
 Vikings should have known better than to mess with this way bigger than a whale.

553
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,400
 It's called the Red Crest, and this thing loves to kill.

554
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,200
 It will lay in the water on its belly for weeks at a time.

555
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,500
 Just trying to be the perfect target, so a whaling vessel comes by and goes, "Ah, you know, there's no sport.

556
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,900
 There's no sport in killing whales anyways.

557
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,300
 So let's just kill this dead whale and we'll sell the meat half off."

558
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:04,100
 And then it flips over and it actually destroys boats by...

559
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:10,000
 It's so huge, it'll jump out of the water and land on the ship, completely demolishing it.

560
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,100
 Now the Rad Kimberger has a crew of backup whales.

561
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,600
 This dude rolls deep.

562
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,800
 This dude rolls with a posse.

563
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:23,400
 Wherever he goes, there's a bunch of narwhals and beluga whales who are hanging out with him.

564
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,000
 They all have leather jackets on.

565
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,300
 They all have seal skin jackets on.

566
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,500
 They're smoking underwater cigarettes.

567
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,300
 When he...

568
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,600
 He just loves to kill things.

569
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,400
 So he smashes the boat and then the other whale show up to eat the people.

570
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,700
 He'll eat the occasional person.

571
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,900
 He's not above eating humans.

572
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,100
 But he just loves to destroy stuff.

573
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,200
 The other dudes are getting his leftovers basically.

574
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,200
 He's sloppy seconds.

575
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,000
 Here's the thing though.

576
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,800
 He loves to kill so much.

577
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:53,400
 The way that you kill him is by denying him the right to kill you.

578
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,300
 I've never heard of this before in Krypton.

579
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,500
 That is very, very interesting.

580
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,800
 In Krypton lore, I've never heard of anything like this.

581
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,800
 His main goal is to end humanity.

582
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,200
 So if he kills you, he's totally happy.

583
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,400
 But if you get away...

584
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,900
 If you're on a boat and this creature tries to smash you and the boat is able to get away,

585
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,000
 he'll chase you and chase you and chase you.

586
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,400
 And if you get away, he has until the end of the day to take a human life.

587
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,900
 If he does not, he dies from frustration.

588
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,700
 He dies because he's so disappointed in himself.

589
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,900
 This is one that there's a species of them.

590
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,700
 So this entire species is built around the idea they love to kill.

591
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:35,500
 And there are stories of them like chasing boats all the way from the deep sea into rivers.

592
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,500
 And they're not being able to go into the river and just being like,

593
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,200
 "I'm just gonna sit here and die."

594
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,500
 There is a story of one of these creatures.

595
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:47,300
 It destroyed 18 boats in one day.

596
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,700
 The 19th boat...

597
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,600
 Why were boats still even in this area?

598
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,300
 The 19th boat got away.

599
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,900
 And the reason why it got away is they saw all of this debris.

600
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,600
 It looked like Wolf 359.

601
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,100
 That's a deep cut for you guys.

602
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,800
 And for the two of you who are total trekkies who listen to this podcast,

603
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,600
 the 19th ship sees the Remcome Dinger.

604
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:13,400
 Coming after it, it takes a piece of wood and dresses it up and clothes and throws it overboard.

605
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,500
 And the red crest...

606
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,000
 I'm gonna not try to use that other name again.

607
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,400
 The red crest sees this person and tries to drown it.

608
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,200
 But scientific fact, you can't drown wood.

609
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,100
 And the boat takes off and the creature's trying to drown the person.

610
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,400
 And eventually it looks up, the boat's gone.

611
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,000
 It realizes the person doesn't exist.

612
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,600
 It just rolled over and died.

613
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,400
 It had destroyed 18 fully manned vessels that day.

614
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,000
 But the fact that one got away, that was enough.

615
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,600
 Its weakness is not letting it kill you.

616
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,600
 But can you eat it?

617
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,200
 That's really the question here.

618
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,900
 It's can you eat this thing?

619
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:58,300
 Well, if you pick number three, get ready guys.

620
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,100
 Get ready.

621
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:05,500
 You are able to find a dead red kadami dinger.

622
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,600
 And it's actually dead this time.

623
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,000
 It died of disappointment.

624
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,500
 It died because it didn't get to eat you.

625
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,100
 And it just went, "Ugh."

626
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:17,000
 So then you circle back around and you have a fork and a knife and you're like chopping stuff off.

627
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,500
 You've learned from the first two stories.

628
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,300
 You're not gonna eat...

629
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,800
 I don't know why you brought the fork.

630
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,200
 You're not gonna eat it raw.

631
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,700
 So you cut up a bunch of meat.

632
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,600
 You take it back home and you have like gloves on.

633
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,400
 You throw it in the pot and you're trying to think.

634
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,000
 You're like, "Should I feed it to someone else first?"

635
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,100
 "Should I feed it to someone I don't like?"

636
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,900
 You're looking around the room for people you don't like.

637
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,300
 You're like, "I never really did like my nephew."

638
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,500
 And then you realize that's basically murder.

639
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,800
 So then you're like, "Hmm, do I love that parakeeter?

640
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,100
 Do I just tolerate him?"

641
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,200
 You're looking and see if your pet cricket is still around.

642
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,700
 Is there anything you can feed this to?

643
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,900
 Because if you pick number three, this is serious business.

644
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,400
 This is the most ruthless of all the creatures.

645
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,900
 But it's time.

646
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,600
 Ding!

647
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,400
 Your oven makes a noise.

648
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,900
 You get up, you make the solemn march.

649
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,100
 You side-eye your nephew.

650
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,300
 You're like, "Hey, are you hungry?

651
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,100
 Are you hungry, dude?"

652
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,000
 Nephew's like, "No, he's playing Switch.

653
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,500
 Now I'm good."

654
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,200
 And you're like, "Damn it."

655
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,000
 And you walk and you open up the oven.

656
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,500
 And inside there is a pot.

657
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,600
 I don't know how to cook.

658
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,000
 You don't put pots in ovens, right?

659
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 You go to your...

660
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,800
 Close the oven.

661
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,900
 You don't know why you heated the oven up.

662
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,200
 You go to the pot in your stove.

663
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,900
 You have a fork.

664
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,700
 And you're just ready to just scoop out whatever is in that pot

665
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,500
 right into your mouth.

666
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,300
 It'll be boiling on.

667
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,900
 But you just can't take the tension anymore.

668
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,000
 You take that fork.

669
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,900
 You dig it into the pot.

670
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,900
 Huh?

671
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,500
 There's nothing in the pot.

672
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,400
 There's nothing.

673
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,400
 That's it.

674
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,000
 That's it.

675
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,700
 If you pick number three, you go back.

676
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,500
 You sit in your chair.

677
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,600
 Your nephew's still playing Switch.

678
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,400
 You're like, "Hey, nephew, you should count your blessings.

679
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,900
 I'm with veggie poison today."

680
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,800
 He has his headphones on.

681
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,700
 He can't hear you.

682
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:57,000
 This creature, the rod-com dinger, if you cook...

683
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,600
 No one knows if it's poisonous.

684
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,800
 You can't cook the meat.

685
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,600
 If you take the meat and cook it, it just disappears.

686
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,500
 Nobody knows if it's poisonous or not.

687
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,200
 So if you pick number three, you dodge the bullet.

688
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,000
 You're laughing at all the number ones and twos.

689
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,200
 They're like, "Oh, my stomach.

690
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,700
 Oh, my leprosy."

691
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,400
 And you just didn't get anything to eat.

692
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,000
 And then you just go to Taco Bell and you're totally fine.

693
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,200
 Well, you went to Taco Bell, so you might have some stomach problems later.

694
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,300
 But right now, you're doing just fine.

695
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,200
 So there you go.

696
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,100
 Poisonous creatures of Iceland that probably don't exist,

697
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,100
 but it's still a fun journey to take.

698
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,500
 If you ever do find yourself an Iceland, you should walk.

699
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,200
 Don't do not call someone.

700
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,300
 If you do walk up...

701
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,900
 I don't know why you would do this, but if you do walk around Iceland,

702
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,100
 don't ever call anyone an "Opha Guggy Guggy"

703
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,800
 because that's actually a really bad slur over there.

704
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,800
 But normally, when you go to countries and don't walk up to people in America

705
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,800
 and be like, "What's up, Bigfoot?"

706
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,700
 Like, normally, we don't call people "crypto names."

707
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,900
 But on the off chance that you really love this story

708
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,600
 and you have a shirt that says "Opha Guggy Guggy"

709
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,400
 and you go to it spelled correctly, pronounced correctly,

710
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,400
 and you go to Iceland, you're not going to have a good time.

711
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,100
 It's a slur over there because they actually hate this fish.

712
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,400
 It's been reported to blow people up for centuries.

713
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,700
 So, but if you do decide to go to Iceland and don't use that as a slur

714
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,200
 or have that written anywhere on your body, I think you'll be fine.

715
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,800
 But just be careful what you're eating.

716
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,900
 Just be careful what you're putting in your body.

717
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:23,800
 You may see a delicious, tasty fish treat on the market,

718
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,300
 but be careful. You should ask someone, "Hey, where'd you get that from?"

719
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:31,500
 And if the shop vendor turns around and he's covered in leprosy,

720
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,600
 he's covered in leprosy, you may want to shop somewhere else.

721
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,600
 That's probably good advice for anywhere.

722
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,000
 That's probably good advice whether or not you're in Iceland.

723
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,300
 You may want to shop somewhere else though

724
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:43,200
 because that man may be trying to sell you meat

725
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,600
 that was scoured from the body of a cryptid.

726
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,100
 I want to end the episode off like this as well.

727
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,000
 I think we had a really good time this episode,

728
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:00,100
 but it's time to say goodbye to Crystal Bath, aka Crystal Bunny, aka Bunny.

729
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:04,800
 Beatrice Leyva's best friend, she has actually passed away.

730
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,100
 She actually passed away a couple of weeks ago.

731
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:11,700
 So, we wanted to honor Crystal Bath with her own ride in the Carvener Copture.

732
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:15,300
 And guys, the reason why, that might sound kind of like a downer for the episode,

733
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,900
 but use this weekend to reach out to people.

734
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,800
 Reach out to people.

735
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,900
 Think about the people in your life that you'd miss.

736
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,800
 Now, let them know you would miss them.

737
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,200
 Not in like, I don't know, a weird way.

738
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,500
 Don't send them a text going, "I'm gonna miss you!"

739
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,600
 Or something like that, right?

740
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,200
 But, you know, we take life for granted. It's so short.

741
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,500
 And we wanted to honor Crystal Bath's memory.

742
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,900
 And we wanted to honor Beatrice Leyva as well, long time, like I said,

743
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,600
 long time supporter of the show.

744
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,200
 But she passed away recently.

745
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,500
 And let's just take her memory.

746
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,900
 And she was an I-11 operator.

747
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:55,800
 She dedicated her lives to saving lives, to helping other people at their darkest moment.

748
00:32:55,800 --> 00:33:00,200
 So, that's the type of people that we lose on a daily basis, these heroes.

749
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,700
 So, I want you to just kind of honor her and going forward, you know?

750
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,400
 Just think about the people.

751
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,000
 Just reach out to people and say, "Hey, man, I love you."

752
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,300
 Because you don't know where they're going through.

753
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,500
 That person on the street that you want to yell at, that you want to honk your car out or whatever,

754
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,900
 that person you want to say mean comments online.

755
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,000
 You don't know where they're going through.

756
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,900
 And they may be having a perfect life, but this might be their last day on Earth.

757
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:25,200
 Do you really want to be a negative memory of someone's last day?

758
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,500
 You're yelling something at someone as they're driving home,

759
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,800
 and they're like, "I really ruined their day."

760
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,100
 And then later that night, they have a heart attack or something like that.

761
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:35,200
 So, let's put positivity out into the universe.

762
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,700
 I know I'm not always... I know that I do... I put out negativity as well.

763
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,600
 I'm not above that. I yell at people as well.

764
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,200
 But I always try to learn from my mistakes.

765
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,600
 I don't always do it.

766
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,000
 But let's try to just grow as a people, as a community.

767
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 And let's honor Crystal Bath's memory by being everyday heroes, like she was an everyday hero.

768
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,700

 I'm glad you listened to it today.
