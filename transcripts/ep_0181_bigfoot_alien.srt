1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 A dancing ghost

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,440
 Raise interesting questions about the afterlife and then we touch on Bigfoot one last time this week when we explore the mystery

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,480
 our aliens turning us

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,640
 Into the Bigfoot today on Dead Rabbit Radio

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,240
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,920
 I hope you are having a great day - it's Friday

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,140
 Unless you're listening to this on any other day where it wasn't uploaded and then it's just a great day

8
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,360
 Hopefully in general. This is gonna be our last episode for the week

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,440
 We're really blazing through these things run episode 180. This is awesome guys. I really really appreciate all the support

10
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,560
 You're giving the show been a crazy trip guys

11
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,280
 Thank you for listening if you're a new time listener welcome if you're a longtime listener. Thank you for coming back

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,820
 It's always a pleasure to be telling you these crazy stories now earlier

13
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,680
 And though I didn't get to this because the episode was running a bit long and I had to I edited it out for time

14
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,080
 But we're talking about the Miley Cyrus thing here's I'm not gonna go back into Miley Cyrus in general

15
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,560
 But this is a little conspiracy theory that I've had do you think it's a little thought a little thought game for you guys

16
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:23,080
 Do you think there is a real Hannah Montana out there? Not as in that fictional character

17
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:29,480
 But you know I did that episode on what's the scariest movie ever made the hypothetical movie that that no one's ever seen

18
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,920
 That's out there. That's not been released to the public. I didn't episode on that. This is kind of along those lines

19
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,080
 So we're gonna set up some ground rules. I'm asking is there a possibility

20
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:45,040
 There is a real Hannah Montana-esque person out there and this is the ground rules one an A-list celebrity

21
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,300
 that people in the world know but

22
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,000
 Outside of their immediate family so in their neighborhood or at their school

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,560
 Nobody knows that they are the A-list celebrity. They have to be A-list too. Can't be making some direct-to-DVD movies

24
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,800
 Which is cool as those are I'm not knocking those but it's not like they're making some direct DVD movies for some horror company

25
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,040
 And then no one at work knows that they do that. I'm not talking about that

26
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,760
 They have to be A-list is what I'm looking for because that's you Hannah Montana was she was a

27
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,260
 International pop star everyone knew who she was to no porn

28
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,440
 Because a lot of people in the porn industry do keep that secret

29
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,600
 So that's kind of a given a lot of times you'll have porn stars that are very very well known

30
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,600
 But people close to them don't know it. So those are really the two ground rules one no pornography and two

31
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:37,720
 They'd have to be an A-list star. I'm talking and this is really I came up with this idea a couple years ago

32
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,720
 Let's take a guy like George Clooney

33
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:46,720
 You have him and he's a super recognizable actor, but in his real life his family knows that he's George Clooney

34
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,440
 but he also has a

35
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,600
 Quiet life where he goes shopping and it would have to be consistent

36
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,240
 I'll just putting on a fake mustache to go to the grocery store

37
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,600
 He has an alternate personality that most of the people that know him personally

38
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:07,560
 Do not know that he is George Clooney at all for a period of time that would be two more rules

39
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,160
 I guess it should add it be or another rule for a period of time

40
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,360
 So not just for a weekend like for a couple years. Do you think that is possible?

41
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:24,080
 Do you think that it's possible that you could have somebody who is a Ariana Grande or a Brad Pitt and

42
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,680
 The people of their family knows but the people around them they have a jaw like maybe they are an accountant

43
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,920
 maybe they just walk around town all the time and everyone knows them as

44
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:42,480
 Joey pumpkin or whatever just a totally different person and they've never made the connection that that is really Brad Pitt

45
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,800
 Do you think that's possible?

46
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:49,640
 I think it was possible more possible a couple years ago before the explosion of social media

47
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,720
 But maybe not because I think people would cite them that was always Hannah Montana was always

48
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,840
 Basically a little girls version of a superhero where her superpower was being famous

49
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,840
 It was basically the story of spider-man

50
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:10,280
 She was a teenage girl that got picked on at school and she had a close group of friends who knew her secret and her family knew her secret

51
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,760
 I guess that spider-man didn't have those things will the Avengers are his friends

52
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,960
 But you know what I mean like she would face the trials and tribulations of high school and get picked on and bullied and have to go through all

53
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,360
 This stuff and her superpower was the fact that she was very wealthy and very famous

54
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,440
 It was a really interesting twist on the superhero genre. That's really who Hannah Montana was that was it basically a superhero show

55
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:37,280
 She just solved emotional problems rather than fight crime, but that's the question. Do you think that it's possible?

56
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,520
 I think it's possible. The question is is is anyone doing it? I guess it's the better question

57
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,480
 Do you think right now anyone is doing that feel free to comment shoot me an email?

58
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,200
 We'll have a discussion, but I think it's an interesting story nonetheless

59
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,280
 So let's go ahead and get started with our first story here now. It's funny because our first story

60
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,000
 It's one of those stories that I basically read a version of and thought oh, it's kind of cute

61
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,280
 That's kind of sweet and then I read the more realistic version of it

62
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,640
 I was like and then that made me think of some more

63
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,120
 Interesting ways to look at how it concluded

64
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,120
 So the story I heard was there was a guy named

65
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,440
 Grancer Harrison and Grancer was an old-timey word for grandpa Grancer Grancer

66
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:28,520
 Can I get some candy? Why yes young lad that was a term. It means the grand sire. It's really really old school Grancer Harrison was

67
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:35,960
 From Alabama were in the 1800s like the mid 1800s. He loved throwing parties

68
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,520
 He had this giant dance hall constructed and every Thursday night

69
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,040
 He'd throw on his wooden clogs and his fancy dress suit and he'd hire people to come out and fiddle

70
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,240
 And they'd make music and everyone would just dance all night long

71
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,520
 It was his favorite thing that when he died he said I want to be buried in my dancing outfit with my clogs

72
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:01,640
 I don't want to dance for the rest of time so they did they humored him and they buried him in his beautiful dancing outfit

73
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,700
 It wasn't like a ball gown. It was probably just like you know a dudes a dudes dancing outfit

74
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:11,760
 Probably had lots of sequins, but anyways the dress him on his dancing outfit put him in his clogs buried him and

75
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:18,080
 To this day people say in this area, which I should have said earlier the area is I

76
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,040
 Didn't write it down, but anyways, it's somewhere in Alabama

77
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,800
 That's real specific if you want to go find this ghost, but

78
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,840
 the

79
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,400
 The rumor is that if you go somewhere in Alabama and unnamed location in Alabama

80
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,040
 You can hear fiddle music

81
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:42,680
 Playing late at night in the graveyard and sometimes at his old dance hall, which actually he was buried near

82
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,920
 He's basically buried on his property next to his dance hall

83
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,240
 Sometimes when you're out there and people are like dude Alabama's a really big state

84
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,840
 We're not gonna find this place, but if you sometimes you're just randomly walking through Alabama

85
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,120
 You want your fiddle music and I thought that's a good that's kind of a cute ghost story

86
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,040
 You know the guys like he really loved something. He was passionate about something

87
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,160
 He passed away. He wanted to experience an afterlife and it came true even to this day

88
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,600
 He's dancing somewhere in Alabama

89
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:17,920
 So that was the story that I heard and when I went to go online to get some links to share with you guys and do a little

90
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,800
 More information. I got a little more details and I don't know why some of it

91
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:29,280
 Slipped by me in the beginning. One of the points is super obvious, but it went by me. So let's go back here real quick

92
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,000
 Okay, and I went I looked it up. It's in Kinston, Alabama

93
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,960
 Kinston so if you do want to go find his ghost

94
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,280
 You no longer have to roam the entire state of Alabama

95
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,680
 So here's some of the details that were left out of the charming version

96
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,880
 I heard and again the first one is kind of a no-brainer

97
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,960
 Grants your Harrison was a wealthy businessman wealthy enough to build a music hall for him his own party

98
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,360
 So that was kind of given with the first story. He's a wealthy person

99
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,360
 He lives in Alabama and it's the mid 1800s

100
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,120
 So he had a ton of slaves now again when I first read the story. It didn't connect with me

101
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,680
 That a wealthy man. Oh, oh, not just any wealthy man. He was a wealthy cotton farmer

102
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,840
 I guess I should add that detail in

103
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,960
 That was all left out of the original version, but being wealthy in the 1800s in Alabama you most likely had slaves

104
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:29,600
 But being a cotton farmer you definitely had slaves and not only did he have slaves. He went all out

105
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,880
 He loved the whole slave thing. He had one third

106
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:39,680
 In the county that he was in he owned one third of the slaves. Yeah, I mean he's like pokemon. He's got to catch them all

107
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,160
 That's a ton of slaves

108
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,240
 He owned one third of them

109
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,840
 So he goes I want to build a dance hall

110
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:54,800
 Make the slaves do it. So the dance hall that everyone had parties at was constructed by slave labor

111
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,360
 So that kind of makes the story a little less charming. I don't know if the musicians were slaves

112
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,760
 I don't know if the slaves were forced to dance as well. I'm not for sure on any of that

113
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,840
 But they did construct it. He did hold the dance parties. This is a historical person

114
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,480
 He and there's still ruins out there in kinsten, alabama. See I I remember

115
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,360
 um, they built they built the dance hall

116
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,880
 And the story goes on as normal except now there's slaves everywhere

117
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,480
 So the original charming story now every part where the little kids like grand sir grand sir

118
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,160
 Can I have some candy there's enslaved human beings standing around

119
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:37,680
 There are people who've been pulled from their families and are now slaves in that story. Here you go. Here's some candy

120
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,080
 Terrible. So anyways, he does say I want to be buried

121
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,680
 With my dancing clothes on so I can dance for the rest of time

122
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,080
 I didn't actually say for the rest of time. He just goes I just want to be buried in my dancing clothes

123
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,520
 And he wanted his mausoleum built and he actually wanted to be buried in his bed too

124
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:00,240
 So we're talking it's going to be a big structure slaves make the slaves build it

125
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,280
 So the slaves build this giant structure for him to be buried in

126
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:10,320
 And they do and they take his bed when he dies. They don't do it while he's still alive

127
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,760
 He's like I can still breathe and they're like wheeling it into the vault

128
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,920
 After he dies they put his bed into the mausoleum

129
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,480
 Put him in his nice fancy dancing clothes

130
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,080
 put on his good wooden clogs his dancing shoes seal the door and

131
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,320
 After he died people still kept going to the dancing hall in his memory

132
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,560
 But it without him it wasn't the same the place eventually fell into disrepair and it kind of is

133
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,600
 No more it's ruins now or it might just be a foundation, but his grave is still there his open

134
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,400
 His above-ground grave like a mausoleum

135
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:50,080
 To this day people can still hear music in kinsten alabama fiddle music and the sound

136
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,360
 Of good old grancer harrison dancing in his clogs

137
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:03,520
 Now I after reading about all the slaves and the slaves having to build the dance hall and the slaves having to build the mausoleum

138
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,760
 I have another take on this story

139
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,680
 What is the most uncomfortable activity that you could do for the rest of time?

140
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,480
 in wooden shoes

141
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,480
 it'd be dancing

142
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,880
 While running track or walking up the flight stairs, but you know what I mean like that doesn't sound like something

143
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,160
 That doesn't sound like a pleasurable experience to dance until the heat death of the sun

144
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,960
 And the planet earth is destroyed

145
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,360
 That sounds quite the

146
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,880
 Punishment so here's my theory

147
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,600
 Yes, he didn't want to be dressed in his dancing clothes and his shoes because he loved dancing so much

148
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,000
 But when the slaves were building that structure

149
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 I have no proof for this, but as the slaves were building that structure. What if they put a curse on it?

150
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,120
 What if they basically cursed that structure so grancer would spend the rest of time dancing in his shoes?

151
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,320
 And that fiddle music as jaunty as it may sound even though it's coming from some sort of

152
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,400
 Astral plane and leaking into our dimension the phantom

153
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,760
 Dancing in that field. He's not happy

154
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,040
 Just tears of pain streaming down his face

155
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:20,480
 Now I don't know if any of that's true, but I do have to say that I think if I I think if I had to choose between

156
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,240
 walking into a house and seeing a ghost staring at me from the corner or a ghost walking down the stairs

157
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,920
 or

158
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,960
 A ghost dancing looking at me with wide eyes is dancing a jig

159
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,640
 One of those things is far more terrifying

160
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:42,640
 That would be okay. Forget the ghost thing. Let's say you walked into a mcdonald's

161
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,720
 And you saw someone standing at the counter, but they're staring directly at you

162
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,160
 You looked and you saw someone coming down some stairs

163
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,680
 This mcdonald's is two stories for some reason or then you turn and you see someone staring at you

164
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,000
 Dancing a jig which one would be more terrifying ghost or not?

165
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,680
 I don't think gran sir is having a lot of fun in the afterlife. Oh, and I do have to say they thought it's uh

166
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,240
 Like 100 years later people thought there was gold in his grave and they blew it up dynamite

167
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,120
 So I mean his ghost apparently is still dancing even though his bones got scattered all over the graveyard

168
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,120
 Okay, and oh and I just say there was no gold and they just blew it up

169
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,320
 So

170
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,640
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story now our next story is interesting and I didn't I don't want to do too

171
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:30,560
 much bigfoot stuff this week, but this one I kind of mentioned on my vanishing bigfoot episode where I said

172
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,320
 Talked about bigfoot aliens or something more chilling and I thought this I was going to save this

173
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,600
 I was like no, I'm going to just wrap up the week with this because I already kind of referenced it

174
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,120
 And I think it's a very interesting story if if it's true

175
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,000
 If it's true, which is always the caveat

176
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,720
 This is a recommendation from Bennett again from email. He did the vanishing bigfoot one as well

177
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:58,240
 It was kind of just a bigfoot centric email. We're looking at the theory that bigfoot and aliens are connected

178
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,160
 So you get two cryptids for the price of one you get two creepy things that want to get you for the price of one

179
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:10,400
 And I was reading this article and there was a couple sightings they can piece together with the bigfoot phenomenon

180
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,240
 1888

181
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,840
 It's Humboldt County

182
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:20,080
 It's not full of marijuana or marijuana farms or mysterious disappearances because a lot of people go missing up there

183
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,200
 And most likely it's because they're stumbling across illegal marijuana. Do they still grow marijuana illegally?

184
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,720
 Or can you just grow it in the forest now? I don't know. I don't know

185
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,480
 But anyways, this is in Eureka County in 1888

186
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,480
 This trapper is talking to these native Americans and they go, oh, you want to see something weird

187
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,760
 Which generally you shouldn't if someone says you want to see something weird in your middle of the woods and you don't know them

188
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,760
 It's not a good idea, but he goes

189
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,080
 And the native Americans take him to this cave and there's this huge hunched bear

190
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,080
 Sitting in a cave like cross legged indian style

191
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:59,040
 But the trapper can see that it's not a bear. He sees that it's some sort of

192
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,600
 creature

193
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
 Not necessarily a bear and the natives go

194
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,720
 Three crazy bears were dropped into the woods

195
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,800
 A couple days ago these moons came from the sky and dropped them off

196
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,200
 Dude's like what?

197
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,120
 Now that's the end of that story

198
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,160
 So i'm a little suspicious because you think he probably would have poked it with a stick or shot at it or something

199
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,800
 But according to the story then they all just kind of walked away

200
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,640
 And they described it as being a big humanoid with long black

201
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,480
 shiny hair

202
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,080
 And no neck now this is starting us off and i'm not going to list all of them. There are a lot of encounters

203
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:40,400
 Where we have ufo's and bigfoot in the same area and a term has actually been coined for this

204
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:47,280
 It's called high strangeness. The idea of high strangeness is this nothing exists in a bubble in the paranormal world

205
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,960
 You will see crossovers between things that we didn't think there was any crossover between

206
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:58,080
 i.e aliens and bigfoot you can have areas that may have

207
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,640
 ufo activity

208
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:06,000
 And ghosts that's not quite unlikely. We don't hear a lot of reports of that. I think it's because

209
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,480
 Yeah, why don't we actually have reports of those two things happening in the same spot?

210
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,520
 Because high strangeness is the idea that these things all have some sort of connection that we don't know about yet

211
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:22,240
 But why is there not a place that has a bunch of ufo sightings and ghost running around?

212
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,200
 It's interesting

213
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:30,640
 That's interesting to me at least but i never really thought of that before but we do have a lot of connections between aliens and bigfoot

214
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,040
 We have a lot of connections between

215
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,120
 There's the theory that demons are actually aliens. There's

216
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,320
 Places where you have alien activity and then we'll have like portals and all sorts of stuff

217
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,920
 Like the pyramids would be a good idea of a high strangeness area

218
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,640
 there's a lot of there's like curses

219
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,080
 and

220
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:56,880
 Free energy and all sorts of weird stuff like you can put a bunch of theories into the pyramids who built them

221
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,280
 It's a conspiracy all that stuff kind of high strangeness

222
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,400
 We know who built them, but i mean okay how we built them but all of that stuff so

223
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,880
 But yeah, go i wonder why there's not ghosts and ufo sightings like there's anyways, okay, so

224
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,920
 There's a lot of ufo sightings though that involve bigfoot

225
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:16,240
 people seeing objects in the sky and then a bigfoot being found in the area

226
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,640
 objects flying near the ground like people this mother and this kid

227
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,280
 saw a like

228
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,720
 Or but flying by and then like a bigfoot jumped out

229
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,840
 So i mean like what's going on, but

230
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,040
 There's a lot of reports of that

231
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,360
 There's a lot of reports of that type of stuff what i want to look at specifically is

232
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:46,320
 One report in general now this one's interesting because i think it may have another answer to what bigfoot is

233
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,520
 But you're gonna have to go on a journey with me a journey

234
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,760
 To fight it pay it pay it county, pennsylvania

235
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,840
 The year

236
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,120
 Is 1973 three years before i was born

237
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,280
 i'm still

238
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:07,360
 On the tree of life just a fruit ready to be picked and dropped into this mortal plane, but at this time i don't exist

239
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,720
 But these people do there's these people have all been born already in this story. It's nighttime

240
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,560
 There's a group of 15 people in Fayette county, pennsylvania. I don't know what they're doing

241
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,080
 Just hanging out 15 people at night. I don't know

242
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,000
 Probably not up to no good or maybe hunters because they also had guns

243
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,440
 So they're out in this area and they see a large illuminated orb

244
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,160
 Floating above a pasture

245
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:42,800
 These two seven to eight feet tall figures begin walking

246
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,120
 around the orb

247
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,600
 Now there is a quite a distance between there's a couple hundred yards

248
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:56,080
 I believe between the group of humans and then there's a fence and then about 25 yards behind that

249
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,240
 Is the orb and they're seeing these people

250
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,280
 So I think it was like 200 yards to the fence and so on but they see it's so bright

251
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,880
 They see these giant tall figures walking around it. So these guys with guns open fire

252
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,640
 Because what else are you gonna do when you see some sort of bizarre event and giants walking around you're gonna open fire

253
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,240
 None of the bullets hit them

254
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,520
 But they did find out later that their bullets were hitting at least one or two bullets hit the fence in front of them

255
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,080
 So they were at least aiming in the right direction

256
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,960
 One of the creatures one of the giant seven to eight feet tall monster men

257
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,440
 Touches the other one on the shoulder

258
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,840
 The light disappears

259
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:40,240
 And the two creatures begin to walk away into the forest and they're still getting shot at by these dudes

260
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,440
 Don't even care they just walk away very slowly

261
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,560
 One of the group runs to a house to call the cops because they don't have cell phones back then cops show up

262
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:57,920
 And the first thing they realized other than the fact that there's four now 14 guys out there with guns just had completely

263
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,640
 Just open fire. They could hear the gunfire people are like and what in tarnation is going on out there

264
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,640
 Why is everyone shooting their guns?

265
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,960
 They get there and the area at night where that orb was and where the people are is completely lit up

266
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,880
 Somehow one of the cops said I could read and I could have read a newspaper out there

267
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,800
 That's how bright it was even though now the orb was completely gone

268
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,400
 Somehow that light was still lingering in that area

269
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,760
 The group then decides with the cops involved. We need to get to the bottom of this and find out what those things were

270
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,920
 Could be the russians

271
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,360
 So they start moving around and they start to notice some weird things one

272
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,840
 There's a barn farther down on the property and as they're getting closer to it

273
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:46,000
 Just lights up for a brief second as bright as the sun they said not as hot because then the barn and the planet earth would be destroyed

274
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,600
 But as bright as the sun in the barn they could see all the light just appear in the barn and then once again

275
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,680
 The barn was pitch black

276
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:58,640
 They noticed there was a bull. This was an odd detail. There was a bull and a dog in the field

277
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,560
 And the bull and the dog weren't paying attention to the humans. They were in instead staring at the forest

278
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:10,960
 It's like I don't know. I don't know how bulls normally react at night. So that detail really didn't do anything for me, but

279
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:17,120
 What happens then is that somehow and this is where the story gets a little suspicious to me

280
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,280
 But let's just keep going on with it right now

281
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:27,120
 The person also called some paranormal investigators some paranormal investigators also showed up at the scene that night which

282
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,320
 That's a little weird. I mean, I don't know if they're just driving around and they're weirdo wagon

283
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,720
 looking for like

284
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:40,560
 Bizarre stuff or have a police scanner and they're like we just cornered freddy kruger get to the corner of eighth and ninth street and

285
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:47,360
 Which would be a very odd design city if there's a corner of eighth and ninth, but you know what? I mean like somehow they get to the site

286
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,400
 Sounds a little convenient for me. It makes me think that it could be fake

287
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,000
 That's all made up. But anyway, so these paranormal

288
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,080
 Investigators and their weirdo wagon show up and they start interviewing one of the guys

289
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:09,280
 As all this stuff is still going on. They're like, what did you see in the beam of the light where they sex squatch or where they bigfoot?

290
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,440
 Was it a yeti? Like I was like, I don't know was a giant monster in front of a giant light

291
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,000
 Anyways, this is the interesting part

292
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,360
 They're interviewing and you know what now that I think about it

293
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,000
 Story is probably made up like it's one of those things like all right notes

294
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,160
 I think people think I have a script for this show and I think I need to put a quash on that right now

295
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,320
 None of this stuff is scripted all right notes

296
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,840
 I'll read about it all right notes and then a couple days later. I'll do an episode and sometimes when I'm reading the story

297
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,840
 I'm like that is fascinating

298
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,120
 And then once I start reading it. I realize that it's there's

299
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,640
 Some serious problems with this. But anyways, let's just keep going

300
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,920
 Let's just keep going with this. So anyways, the weirdo wagon shows up these paranormal investigators are like

301
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:56,000
 Tell us what you saw tell us what you saw when the bright light appeared and this guy starts going

302
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,200
 And starts like growling like an animal

303
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,640
 So I mean come on anyways, he's growling like an animal

304
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,760
 And the paranormal investigators and his buddies are like dude, what's wrong? What's wrong?

305
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:21,760
 They're kind of freaking out the dude's own dog

306
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:27,120
 The dude's own dog actually gets so scared of what the this guy's like

307
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,160
 Freaking out his own dog tries to attack him and then he goes

308
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:39,120
 The dog runs away scares the dog. So the paranormal investigators are like, whoa, this is a little out of our league

309
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,480
 He starts running off into the the crazy guy now runs off into the field screaming

310
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,840
 And everyone else is like what the hell is going on and the dude just collapses

311
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:56,000
 So the group goes over there and they help him up and they immediately smell the rotten eggs

312
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:03,200
 Okay, they immediately smell rotten eggs and then he gets up and he goes what what happened, man

313
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,800
 And they're like, you don't remember you were just making a bunch of animal noises and ran away and and uh,

314
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,520
 Scared the dog fell down. He's like

315
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,520
 All I remember is seeing visions of a horrible future

316
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,560
 Mankind is doomed

317
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,720
 The world is going to end

318
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,920
 And that's kind of the end of the article

319
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:29,840
 Of because so when I told you the paranormal investigators showed up just out of the blue

320
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,160
 This article is from I should have put two and two together guys. I'm sorry

321
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:40,960
 This article is from their website and to get and then it says there's even more craziness and then you have to buy their book

322
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,880
 so I

323
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,760
 I'm sorry for not telling my due diligence on this one. I was so

324
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,680
 Entranced this was okay. Even when I started this episode what 30 minutes ago the intro

325
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,240
 My idea was that what if

326
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:03,680
 Aliens are turning humans into bigfoot people and this is how he was in this and this is how I was thinking

327
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,480
 He was in that area and he got like all like

328
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,840
 Like starting to turn into a monster and what's the first thing he wanted to do was to run away

329
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,120
 Why did he want to run away because he was in a state of panic?

330
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,880
 He was having these visions of mankind destroying itself. Here was my theory

331
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,000
 That bigfoot are actually people who have been genetically engineered by aliens

332
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,200
 and driven mad to avoid humans

333
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,920
 And they get all

334
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,920
 And get all furry but the crazy beastal nature of this guy

335
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:39,280
 I was thinking like whoa, what if bigfoot are actually like

336
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,160
 bioengineered humans

337
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,680
 by aliens

338
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,000
 And that's what I believed 30 minutes ago

339
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,200
 But as I was going back over the story in my head. I'm thinking

340
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,720
 It doesn't make sense that they showed up so quickly and again. I should have

341
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,720
 I should

342
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,760
 So I should have I should have figured that out. But I mean here. This is my other thing

343
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,720
 It's super easy to fake being insane

344
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,080
 I can have let's say that I do a live stream of this show

345
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,320
 I can easily go

346
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,000
 Okay, are you out there? Are you out there ghost in my claw? Oh?

347
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,600
 And then just freeze the camera and and then come back and be like, I don't know what happened guys

348
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,400
 I don't know what happened. I have a little more moral

349
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:28,160
 I have a little more morals than to do that and it would totally ruin my brand to pull something like that off

350
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:35,520
 But it's very easy to do and it's even easier to just make up and just to write it somewhere on a website

351
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,600
 And say buy my book if you want to learn more stuff

352
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,640
 But all that aside all that aside i'm gonna salvage this episode as best as I can

353
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:49,200
 I do think that that could be I think I could think that is a possible theory that the bigfoot is actually

354
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,640
 Humans turned into these creatures

355
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,920
 By aliens or some sort of force

356
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:01,680
 And what this guy went through would kind of mirror that reverting to a beastal nature

357
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:08,000
 Trying to run away and being told having visions in your head that the world is going to end due to mankind

358
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,280
 You would want to eschew everything mankind

359
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:17,040
 And it explains two things it explains one it would explain one why there's not a lot of big feet

360
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,680
 Why they're so hard to find

361
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,360
 Why they can hide berry bodies and stuff like that because they don't they're actively trying not to be found

362
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,680
 And it explains stuff like

363
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,040
 People going missing in the middle of the woods and never being found

364
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,920
 They are the bigfoot

365
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,000
 The person who goes missing in the woods

366
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,520
 They send out all the search parties looking for them and they're huddling in some cave and they're starving

367
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,240
 They don't know what to do next

368
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,120
 And then a white light appears in front of them

369
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,760
 And fills their heads

370
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,080
 With apocalyptic visions

371
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,600
 The rescuers may never have found that missing person

372
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,480
 But that missing person in a new body

373
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,120
 Is watching them

374
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,040
 And hiding

375
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,040
