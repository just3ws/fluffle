1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Is the magical staff of Moses still out there somewhere?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 And then we take a look at the bizarre conspiracy known as "Don't Get On The Ships"

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Is simply having an EBT card or shopping at Walmart

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 Opening you up for alien abduction today on Dead Rabbit Radio

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 *Message from the video*

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 I hope you're having a great day too

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 The snow has brought the war to me

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Yesterday another snowstorm hit Hood River

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 It actually killed the power, shut the power off

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 I prefer the term "killed the power"

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 That's what snow does, it kills things

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 So that sucked, I had no heater

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 I had to go to work and when I came home the electricity was back on

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 But the hot water is not, and I have to take a shower

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 So we'll figure that out, we'll figure that out

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 But that's my problem, not yours

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 But I appreciate your sympathy

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 We're gonna go ahead and move on to our first story though

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Now our first story, quite a few episodes back

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 I don't remember exactly which one

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 I was talking about the staff of Moses

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 And I go "I wonder what ever happened to that thing?"

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 And YouTube user AlexF reached out to me and says

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 "Oh, it's actually kinda well known where it's at"

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Let's take a quick look here

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Now what the staff of Moses is, I had to do a bunch of research on this

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 It may actually be two staffs

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 It's kinda weird, not even rabbinical scholars can really agree on this

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Cause I guess there were two staffs

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 I always thought it was Moses who threw his staff down and it turned into a snake

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 It was actually his brother Aaron who threw his staff down

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 So for those of you who aren't familiar with it

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 There's a story in the book of Exodus where the pharaoh is like

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 "Hey, your god sucks, I'm the king of magic

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 I got all these magicians over here, they have all sorts of powers"

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 And he commanded his magicians to sorcerers

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 To throw their staffs down and they turned into snakes

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 And then Aaron goes "Pfft, whatever dude"

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Throws his staff down, turns into a larger snake, eats the other snakes

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Turns back into a staff

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 And I was like "What?"

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 So magic is real

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Magic actually exists and people are like "No, no, no, no, no, no"

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Only that part was magic, everything else is not magic

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 So I was like "What?"

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Like obviously those guys' staffs turned to snakes

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 So they knew magic of some sort

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Anyways, so that was Aaron's rod now

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Of course scholars think that it was just one staff that the brothers were passing back and forth

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 But this was the same, and we'll accept that for an answer

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 That there was one staff that for some reason he loans to his brother every once in a while to turn into a snake

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 And he's like "Hey Aaron, you got my staff and Aaron's like "Uh"

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 And there's like a giant snake slither around the house

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 He's like "Yeah, yeah, give me five minutes, I'll get it ready for you"

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 This is the same staff that Moses hit a rock with and a bunch of water shot out of it when the Israelites were thirsty

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 They were in the middle of nowhere, it's not like they were just simply parched

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 There was like a Gatorade stand, 200 yards down the road, but they're like "Nah, I'm thirsty now"

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Like they were in the middle of the desert

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 And it was the same staff he hit the ground with and parted the Red Sea

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 One of the weird things was that once the staff blossomed almonds

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 That's pretty mild compared to bringing about the plagues of Egypt and turning into a snake

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 And it's interesting because then there's like this retcon to it

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 None of this stuff is in the Bible, but there's been this retcon to it that the staff was actually created on the sixth day of creation

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 It wasn't mentioned, but God created this staff when he was creating the world, that's how powerful it is

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 He went out of his way to form this staff and at one point the staff was stuck into the ground

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 And only someone worthy to lead the Israelites would be able to remove the staff from the ground

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 I.e. the sword and the stone

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 So it's interesting how all these legends just continue to spread

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 I'm sure at some point in world history something was stuck somewhere

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 And they go "Ah, whoever strong enough to do that can lead"

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 And there is a very common corollary to that

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 If you can open a tight jar in a house, you are officially the man of the house, even if you're a woman

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 If you're strong enough to open a jar of pickles and nobody else can, that puts you in charge

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 It is your everyday sword and the stone

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 Now of course some people say that the staff was just a normal staff

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 And other people say that the staff itself was magical

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 The people who say it was normal said it's just a normal staff, God gave it power

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 And other people say no, the staff itself has some sort of mystical quality to it

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 But what's interesting is we don't really know what happened to the staff after that

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 There's one of the, one of the, basically the story ends where when the first temple is destroyed in Israel

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 The staff was lost under the rubble of the temple

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 So we're, we're, that's way, way back in time

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Other people say that it was locked in the Ark of the Covenant

86
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 And the Ark of the Covenant is another holy relic from the Bible

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 It's actually like a super weapon

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 You open it up and all your bad guys die, kind of like Raiders of the Lost Ark

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Apparently that is rumored to be in Ethiopia right now

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 It got smuggled out of Israel all the way to Ethiopia where it's at

91
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 St. Mary of Zion Cathedral, off in this little island

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 But other people say, and this is kind of where it's registered at

93
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 Is there is a museum, and this is what Alex F. said

94
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 There's a museum in Turkey called Topokapi Palace

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 And they say that they have the staff of Moses

96
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 They say, you can visit, you can go look at it, they don't let you handle it

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Because they're afraid it's going to slither away, but they do, you can look at the staff

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Supposed to staff of Moses

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 They also have the sword of King David, that'd be pretty dope

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 I'd, I'd, I'd wield that, I'd be chasing security guards around with that

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 They have the Pot of Abraham, which I'm assuming is a metal pot and not some dank weed

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 And then they have a footprint of Muhammad and his tooth

103
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 That he lost in a battle, all at Topokapi Palace

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Now here's the thing, the tooth and the footprint and the pot and the sword

105
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Are probably there

106
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 But stuff like the Ark of the Covenant and the staff of Moses

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 If these things have any power whatsoever, because also the staff of Moses

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 I forgot to mention earlier, there was this massive battle going on

109
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 If Moses was holding the staff high, the Israelites would win the battle

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 And he says, oh, my arm's kind of cramping up and he'd start to lower it

111
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 The tides would turn, they'd start losing the battle

112
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 So eventually a bunch of his homies had to like help hold his arm up

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 The whole battle, so the Israelites would win

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 So it's had some combat power, combat based modifiers as well

115
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 If these artifacts are still around, they're not in Turkey or Ethiopia

116
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 I could almost guarantee that, there may be copies of them in those places

117
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 But any government worth their salt, if these things actually had any sort of power whatsoever

118
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Even if it was just symbolic power, any government worth their salt would have those in their possession

119
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 And especially something that was created on the sixth day of creation

120
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 That can do everything from blossom almonds to turn the tide of battle

121
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 That's in a US warehouse somewhere

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 Wouldn't that be interesting if it turned out, here's my conspiracy theory that I just made up

123
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Every US general in World War II carried a little sliver of the staff in his pocket

124
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 He put a splinter in his finger and they're like, okay, General MacArthur

125
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Once you go do this military battle, just hold your hand up

126
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 Everyone will think you're just waving at the troops, but you're holding up a splinter of the staff of Moses in your finger

127
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 And then they'll die of snake, internal snake bites, they're like, oh, I should have thought about that other part of the story

128
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 If these objects are real, I think the US government has them locked away somewhere

129
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 And there's facsimiles in these other locations

130
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 And if they are super weapons, as has been purported, we definitely have them

131
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 And they're probably not locked away somewhere, they've probably been used

132
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 There's a little conspiracy theory for you, that would be interesting to find battles that morack

133
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 I've always thought, like, there's always these weird coincidences when you read about old-timey battles

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 And you're like, hmm, if it hadn't been for this factor or because it was raining that day or something like that

135
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 The US won that battle, maybe they're using some divine super weapon or some divine tool

136
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Who knows, or maybe it's just fate and luck and good strategic planning

137
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 So thanks, Alex, for reaching out and letting me know where that artifact supposedly is

138
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 But I doubt it's there

139
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Okay, so let's go ahead and move on to our next story

140
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Now our next story is a fascinating look at a website that gives us a very clear command

141
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 A very, very clear command

142
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Do not get on the ships

143
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Now, this website is written by a couple, this man and this woman

144
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 And they talk about, they've been researching this for years and years and years and years

145
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 So I want you to imagine two people in a cluttered apartment, not far from mine, but minus cluttered with happy things

146
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 Like movies and clothes and toys that I've got collected over the years, not like a big toy collector

147
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 But you know, just like little Nicknack, I think I have a Ninja Turtle from each line, just one

148
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 You know, it's a happy clutter

149
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 This is a coming, this website's coming from a clutter of cigarette butts

150
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 And discarded mountain dew cans everywhere, detritus surrounding the place

151
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 When you come to visit these people's houses, this is actually probably bordering on slanders

152
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 So I'll stop talking about how trashy their apartment is

153
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 But madness, an apartment surrounded in madness

154
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 Do not get on the UFOs

155
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 All of their information comes from three different sources

156
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 One, something they call a biofeedback machine or biofeedback meter

157
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 I'm assuming it's something that tests the electromagnetic, electromagneticity or whatever

158
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 Some made up thing in the human body, probably close to an oddity machine that the Scientologists use

159
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 So they get it from that, they do these readings on people and they're like, "Oh, that's interesting

160
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Your pulse is in Morse code for do not get on the ships"

161
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 So they use the biofeedback meter, they use people's dreams, the number one authority of all things true in the world

162
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 What people dream, that's a huge source of information for them

163
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 But both of those, the made up technology and the sparks in our brain while we're unconscious

164
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Are far more credible than the other source of information they use

165
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 They constantly refer to the movie, Jupiter Ascending

166
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 The movie that nobody saw but them, I'm sure half the ticket sales for that movie came from these people watching them over and over again

167
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 They're still petitioning for the director's cut of Jupiter Ascending

168
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Jupiter's ascending, I didn't see it, Star Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis

169
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 It turns out that Earth is a factory farm and aliens have created factory farms all over the galaxy

170
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 And once the population is ripe, they come there and they throw everyone in a meat grinder and eat them or drink them

171
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Or they live longer because they're drinking our juices or something

172
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 Here's the little thing, this is the thing, I get it, science fiction is a view into our future or the horrible implications of technology on mad or both

173
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 But these people could have easily walked into Transformers 5 and created a conspiracy theory that yes, Merlin did discover Transformers on Earth

174
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Because that's really how ridiculous this is and they use the argument of predictive programming

175
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 So there's this stupid rule out there, stupid thing that somebody came up with that before evil people can do something, they have to tell us they're going to do it

176
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 But anyways, they say Jupiter Ascending is part of that, now I will give the Illuminati credit

177
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 If you're going to hide messages for what is in store for the future, you should put it in a movie you know no one's going to watch, i.e. Jupiter Ascending

178
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 You should put it in Jupiter Ascending, you should have put it in Han Solo, you put a lot of predictive programming in that because nobody saw that movie either

179
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 So anyways, they went to see this movie, Jupiter Ascending, they finally crawled out of the garbage of their apartment

180
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 They swam through it, all the credible newspapers, they swam through all that, get out to the movie theater and watch Jupiter Ascending and they're like "Oh my God, this is what is going to happen to us"

181
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Those are the three sources, they also use V, the television show V which I absolutely love, but they use that as well, but most of the stuff they keep referring back to, they're like just like in Jupiter Ascending

182
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 This part of our story is just like the movie Jupiter Ascending, and again, if they said the future is going to be a bunch of racetracks, i.e. speed racer, people would know that they are just full of nonsense

183
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 But nobody saw Jupiter Ascending so they can't really debate whether or not these guys are accurate

184
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 So this is their idea, there are good aliens and there are bad aliens, that's pretty normal in UFO lore

185
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 The bad aliens are going to show up in their spaceships and they're going to say "Do you want to come on our ship?"

186
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 And if you say yes, they eat you

187
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 The good aliens will not ask you, and this is what they say the difference is

188
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 The evil aliens, part of their law, part of their rules, again they have rules for some reason, they have to ask you, they have to trick you into coming onto their ship

189
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 And then at that time, you're basically filled with fear, you finally see the horrible things that are going to happen to you

190
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 The torture, they let you know they're going to eat you, they're going to eat you slowly

191
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 That makes you produce this chemical called Adrenochrome in your blood, which apparently makes your blood not only incredibly tasty

192
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 But also helps the aliens live longer, they got that from Jupiter Ascending, the live longer part, they stay young longer

193
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 The good aliens won't do that, they won't ask you, they won't trick you, they'll simply take you

194
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 This is a quote they keep using, yes there are good extraterrestrials out there, but if they decide to rescue you

195
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 They do not need your permission to do so, which on earth we call kidnapping, but good extraterrestrials will transport you aboard as quickly as a ship's crew would rescue a drowning man

196
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 What's bizarre is that last sentence about the drowning man, they use over and over and over and over in this article, it's kind of weird

197
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 It's almost like some sort of, to me I was like this article sounds like a conspiracy, that sounds like a trigger word

198
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Because they kept using that same phrase over and over again, they will rescue you like a ship will rescue a drowning man

199
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 In the sense that if you're drowning, a ship doesn't come up alongside you and go "Do you want help? Do you want us to help you?"

200
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 They just rescue you, they throw you out a life preserver, they throw you out a life saver, climb on it

201
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 They don't ask and get your permission, they just help you

202
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 So that's how they differentiate the two, the evil aliens will show up and say "Would you like to come on our ship?"

203
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 And you're like "Yeah, I've always wanted to meet an alien"

204
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 You get on the little walkway, door shuts behind you, it's darker than you thought it would be

205
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 The lights are dim, you start to see aliens crawl out of the corner

206
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 Oh no!

207
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 So that's how they differentiate the two, interesting, interesting idea

208
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 They tell you that if aliens show up, the best place to be is your house

209
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 You should have four weeks of food, which isn't a bad idea anyways, but you should have four weeks of food, four weeks of water

210
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Which would be very heavy, but that's their idea

211
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 And the reason why, the reason why you should stay in your house when the aliens show up is very very simple

212
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Don't know why I didn't think of this during a zombie invasion or anything, the aliens show up

213
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 A man's home is his castle, bam, that's all you need to know

214
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 Trump's all technology, Trump's transported technology, laser beams, conventional firearms

215
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 A man's home is his castle, that's a universal law

216
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 They can't get you in your house, apparently

217
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 They also recommend you to put signs up on your front lawn that say "Do not get on the ships"

218
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 To help spread the message for other people to not get on the ships

219
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 Now those signs will probably not be really popular in a navy town

220
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 But, I don't think it'd be popular in any town, and if you have a homeowners association, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble

221
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Because if you were walking by a house in your neighborhood, and you saw a sign that said "Do not get on the ships"

222
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 You're gonna think the people who live there are crazy

223
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 And as you, every time you pass their house, you hear Jupiter ascending playing at top volume

224
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Now again, the people who believe in this stuff don't really care if people think they're crazy, it's part and parcel of their belief

225
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 They think that being thought of being crazy is persecution

226
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 So they're totally fine with it

227
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 But again, I don't recommend that, I guess I should have said this in the beginning, but again, it probably don't have to say it

228
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Don't do any of this

229
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Don't put a sign out on your front lawn saying "Do not get on the ships"

230
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 They also recommend, and they took a while for them to clarify this

231
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Early on in the article, they said "Wrap your cell phone in metal"

232
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 And I'm thinking, who wrote this, Superman?

233
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Like who has the ability to wrap metal?

234
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 Tin? Maybe, with pliers?

235
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 But am I supposed to use iron? Am I supposed to use steel?

236
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 About, I don't know, 20 minutes reading in the article, they specify aluminum foil

237
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Which I guess is a metal

238
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 But you might want to have said that earlier before people went out to Home Depot and got a giant metal crunching machine

239
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 To wrap their cell phone in, it would actually be easier than wrapping your cell phone in metal to just throw your cell phone away

240
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 But they say wrap your cell phone in aluminum foil and then about, I don't know, 5-10 minutes after reading that, they started calling it metal again

241
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 So guys, come on, you gotta be specific, our lives are at stake

242
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 They say that, this was probably my favorite part, this was a revelation to me

243
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 I don't know if you knew this, but this was a heading, this was like a specific part of their article

244
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 And trust me dude, it took me like an hour to read this whole thing, it's massive, but

245
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 This was a specific part of their article

246
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Headlined, aliens use carpet and wooden desks just like judges do

247
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 So forget all the idea of the stainless steel spaceship

248
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Forget the idea of hover chairs or giant vials of water that they float around in

249
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 Nope, they use carpet and wooden desks just like you can go and buy at any retail store, they use them

250
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 This comes from a whistleblower named Bill Shonoblin

251
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 Comes from this guy, credible name

252
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 In the 1970s, he was all of this at the same time

253
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 They were very specific, Bill was all of these things at the same time

254
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 He was a high ranking freemason, okay

255
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 A witch, a satanic priest, that's kind of doubling up, that's like when you split your classes on D&D and you want to go as like a rogue and a bard

256
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 You're never great at any one of them, but you're kind of good at both of them

257
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 I don't know why he would be both a satanic priest and a witch, you gotta specify your class if you really want to rank up in your levels and get to the good stuff

258
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 High ranking freemason, a witch, a satanic priest, and a Catholic priest all at the same time

259
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 I have three jobs and do the podcast and I'm busy and I don't deal with aliens or witchcraft, so I can't imagine how busy this guy was

260
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 But all at the same time he was all four of those

261
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 And so Bill ends up getting abducted by four aliens

262
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 Four aliens

263
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 He's abducted by a gra-- this was in the 1970s, by the way

264
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 So he was abducted and when he goes to their spaceship, he sees four aliens in a carpeted room behind a desk

265
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 Now, I'm gonna assume that he was quote unquote "abducted" on Halloween and he was just taken to the freemason lodge

266
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 But apparently he was abducted into a spaceship that has carpeting, I'm assuming shag, it was the 70s, and a wooden desk

267
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 And here who was sitting behind the desk, a gray alien

268
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 A Nordic, which are the tall, blonde hair, blue-eyed, white aliens, which these guys say are evil

269
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 Generally they're considered good aliens that fight the grays, but in this world they're evil

270
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 A gray, a Nordic, a thing with a squid face, which is the first thing I thought of was Plocoon from Attack of the Clones

271
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 The Jedi with the squid face, or you could really say any species of-- not the Mon Calamari, who were the other ones

272
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 They were actually squid-faced ones, but anyway, so he's saying, "This guy might be George Lucas," but--

273
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 And we're definitely gonna get to that, 'cause he sees a gray, a Nordic, a squid face thing

274
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 And then, this--here's a quote, "One of the aliens in the center was all in black, tall and masked

275
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 He looked vaguely like Darth Vader, oddly enough." Not really, exactly. This happened before Star Wars came out

276
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 So, either Darth Vader is a real alien--according to this, that there is a real alien out there who looks like Darth Vader

277
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 And we're supposed to wrap our cell phones in metal because of this, because of this guy's testimony

278
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 But anyway, so these alien--Darth Vader, Plocoon, a gray and a Nordic abduct him

279
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 He's like, "Oh, you got a nice carpeting," and they're like, "Silence!"

280
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 This is the reason why they abducted him, he's not a good enough mason. They said, "You need to go down and be a better mason."

281
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 They put him back on Earth. That was the end of that story. It had nothing to do with getting abducted on ships

282
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 It had nothing to do with the cell phones being wrapped in metal, nothing. They just threw that in there

283
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 I don't--and I guess they threw it in there as proof? That's--that's--come on, that's ridiculous

284
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 Carpet and desks and Darth Vader all telling someone to be a better mason and then dropping them off, that's ridiculous

285
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 That is a total waste of technology. If their bosses ever found out they used that beam-up technology for something that stupid

286
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 I guarantee they're getting fired. Then they have the heading, "Yeah, but you didn't know this."

287
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 We also find out that aliens act like lawyers, not robots. They don't act like they're aliens. They don't act like Darth Vader

288
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 So apparently at Roswell--I love this quote. Before they tell this story, this is the quote the website says

289
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 "The other story is harder to verify, but we find no reason to not believe it."

290
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 At Roswell, when the ship crashed--okay--there's some aliens who showed up to be like, "Hey man, sorry, our ship crashed, but we need our stuff back."

291
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 One of the aliens who walked in, Gray Alien, had a suitcase handcuffed to his wrist. A briefcase. A briefcase that a normal human would carry around

292
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Now you know how thin a Gray's wrist are? It would have to be baby handcuffs. It would have to be tiny little baby handcuffs

293
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 It would be the size of a bagelbite handcuff. After that nugget that the alien walks in with a briefcase handcuffed to his wrist

294
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Quote, "That is, he was acting as a regular lawyer. When is the last--when's the first time you've seen a lawyer with a briefcase handcuffed to him?"

295
00:22:51,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Outside of Jupiter ascending, outside of a movie where a guy's carrying around nuclear codes, I've never seen a lawyer, even in television, having a briefcase handcuffed to him

296
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 But apparently that's how regular lawyers work in this world. Did you know, did you know, that you are being programmed to trust aliens?

297
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Here's some examples of friendly aliens on television. Tell me which ones don't belong here. Teletubbies? No explanation given. There's just a picture of teletubbies. That's it.

298
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 My little ponies, we do have explanations for the next two. My little ponies. Did you know they're aliens? Quote, "These almond-shaped creatures do not look anything like ponies, but they make some very colorful aliens."

299
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 I think they left a key word out there. Now I'm not sitting here, I just don't want to crap all over these guys because they can't copy edit their manifesto that's supposedly supposed to save your life and your soul from eternal torment, but

300
00:23:50,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 These almond-eyed shaped creatures, they don't look anything like almonds. They don't look--they look more like ponies than they look like almonds, but anyways, they're aliens. They're getting people to believe in aliens.

301
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Dora the Explorer is an alien. Did you know that? Dora. Little Dora. Because her giant eyes and almost non-existent nose and, quote, "a monkey friend who was about the right size for a grey alien."

302
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Great aliens are like three or four feet tall. Dora is three or four feet tall. I don't get--we're bordering on Han's territory because they're just looking at pictures of stuff. And what's weird is they then choose--this is the last example of aliens that are friendly to us--Barnie the Reptilian.

303
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 No, there's just a picture of them and it says "Barnie the Reptilian." No, telling me why--and no one watches that show anymore either. It's so funny, nobody watches that show. But let's get into the real stuff.

304
00:24:50,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 Now they believe that simply by ha--so the aliens have to ask you to board on their ship. You have all this predictive programming on. Jupiter-Seni was the number one film, 12 months in a row, everyone in America, everyone in the world saw it at least five times.

305
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Everyone watches My Little Pony's Friendship is Magic. Everyone's a huge Dora the Explorer fan. We can't get away. We love this stuff so much. All of our lawyers have handcuffs attached to their briefcases. It is a truly wonderful world that the alien overlords have created for us.

306
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 So they do have to ask for our permission to come on the ship. Now, they do. There's a caveat to that. If you have an EBT card, which is a food card, which is basically food stamps in America. If you have an EBT card, you've actually signed away your rights to say "No, I don't want to get on the ship."

307
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 If you have an EBT card, it's too late. You get food stamps from the government, actually in the fine print, you are now selling your soul to the aliens. Maybe. Because even these guys say, "We don't know if that's true." Like, it might be true. Then why are you even saying it?

308
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 Why are you even throwing it out there saying, "Ah, it might be in the fine print." I don't know. A lot of stuff might be in a lot of fine print.

309
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 I may go to get my car serviced at Jiffy Lube and I don't look at the little alien claws at the bottom saying, "By authorizing us to do these repairs, you will get on the ship." So I'm like, "What's this about?" And they're like, "Ah, just sign it." "You have EBT?" "Yeah, well, you already signed it. It's fine."

310
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 I mean, like, you should know. This is life or death, guys. You should know whether or not me having food stamps will make me get abducted by aliens.

311
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 But now we get into the dreams. And this is an interesting place to end this at, because I gotta humdinger for you. If you guys are just like, "Hey, he's reading off a crazy website. This is kind of wacky."

312
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 This story gets weird in the end. It's really weird.

313
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 There's dreams of people going to Wal- A lot of dreams about Walmart, Audelina. Dreams about people going to Walmart and not coming out.

314
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 These are dreams that people have submitted to them. Dreams of people going into Walmart and never coming out. Long lines outside of Walmart. There's troops surrounding it.

315
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 You're in, like, a huge queue. Not like the letter "Q" but a line. And you go in to get your rations for the day and you don't come out.

316
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Another person had a dream that people would go into Walmart. This guy was dreaming. He was standing outside of Walmart.

317
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 And every time someone went into Walmart, two guys as big as sumo wrestlers grabbed him and carried him away. I think this is just your average day at Walmart, honestly.

318
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 But apparently that means something. But they have a lot of dreams about military control of these places. Of these Walmarts. They're big stations, basically.

319
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 Dreams of a fake rapture, which is the Christian theory that before the end times comes, the believers, the followers of Christ, are going to be raptured. They're going to be lifted up into the sky and escape all the hell that's going to happen to everybody else.

320
00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 So there's been a lot of dreams of these ailing ships coming down and saying, "We are here on behalf of God. We're going to take you off of the planet before the Tribulation.

321
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 And you'll be safe and people getting on the ships and then being eaten." That's been a dream that's been shared with these people.

322
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 So what have we learned? Don't watch Jupiter sending because it's going to drive you insane or just waste two hours of your life.

323
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 Wrap your cell phone in metal, preferably steel or iron, but if you can't get that aluminum foil works as well.

324
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 Put a sign out on your front yard saying, "Do not get on the ships." Most importantly, do not get on the ships at all. Don't take a tour of them. Don't be tricked into them.

325
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 Don't follow apples like you're really hungry one day and you see a bunch of apples leading out your front door all the way into a waiting UFO. Don't do that either.

326
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 Do not get on the ships and after a while the ships will leave because again they have to trick you and then you'll be left on a planet that has all the idiots. They're all gone because they got fooled by the ships.

327
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 So Jason, you found a crazy website. A lot of craziness in the world and you found one. So why did you profile this one other than you just wanted to take the piss out of these guys and talk about how dirty their apartment was?

328
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 Probably about five years ago now. I remember one day I was in Hood River. My mom came up to live with me for a while and I was sitting in the living room and my mom comes out of her bedroom and she goes,

329
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 "I had the weirdest, creepiest dream last night." So I'm gonna preface this by saying my mom doesn't believe in any conspiracy stuff. She doesn't believe in any paranormal stuff. No aliens, no Bigfoot, nothing. She's super, super skeptical.

330
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 But she's a devout Christian and not like a Bible thumping Christian. She understands you gotta question things and stuff like that. She's a devout Christian. She's constantly reading books. She listens to Christian radio and stuff like that and Christian speakers and stuff like that.

331
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 But she doesn't believe in anything paranormal, conspiracy, none of that stuff. She doesn't even do true crime. She doesn't listen to podcasts at all.

332
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 She comes down the stairs. I'm sitting in the living room and she goes, "I had the scariest, creepiest dream last night." It was super weird. And I go, "What was it about?" And she goes, "I wake up one morning and the moon has a symbol on it."

333
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 Like you could see the symbol carved into the moon. And I go, "Do you remember what it looked like?" She goes, "I do." She goes, "I don't think I could draw it." But it was just an odd symbol on the moon.

334
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 And then these alien ships approached Earth and the aliens were very friendly. Very friendly aliens. And they told us that the rapture was coming and that they were here to save us before the tribulation started.

335
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 So we packed up all of our things. We got on the ship. She goes, "I remember when we walked onto the ship, around the ship, like it was a traditional UFO, so it was a circle.

336
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 And inside the ship were all of these steel beds placed against the wall, so they were upright. So you would lean back against them and they would strap you down for the flight."

337
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 They didn't have seats. They just had these metal slabs all along. And she goes, "I started to get nervous, but the aliens were... And they were typical gray aliens."

338
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 She described it as that. I don't think she knew the term gray aliens, but I think she was talking about the aliens from the X-Files. She's like, "They were from the X-Files type aliens."

339
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 She goes, "They were very polite and were getting on the ship, and I remember getting on the ship and getting really nervous, and everyone else was super happy to be there."

340
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 And she goes, "I saw a couple of the metal slabs that people were leaning against and getting strapped onto for the flight. Some of them were covered in plastic, like kind of covered in like a dark, thick plastic so you couldn't see what was under them."

341
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 And she goes, "And I noticed one or two of them had some blood on them. And I started to get really nervous and I wanted to get off the ship."

342
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 And the aliens were like, "No, no, no, everything's fine. Just go ahead and stand against this wall. You'll be totally fine. Don't worry about it."

343
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 And they strapped her in. And she goes, "Then I knew that this wasn't the Rapture. Then I knew that I was tricked to get on this ship."

344
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 Don't get on the ships.
