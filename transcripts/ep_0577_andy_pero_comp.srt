1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,080
 There is a man in the world right now who has the power to save us all

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,300
 All he needs to do is see some rhino balls first

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,120
 And then we take a look at a bizarre story that's a crossroad between outer space and

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,300
 Inner souls is it possible that aliens?

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,540
 cause ghost sightings today on Dead Rabbit Radio

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:31,240
 *music*

7
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,320
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,220
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too

9
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,460
 I've actually developed Insomnia over the past two weeks

10
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:46,460
 I'm recording this episode way late at night and recording this episode about one in the morning

11
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,620
 I have a bottle of Nyquil that I'm going to take a shot from the second I'm done

12
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:57,740
 Actually, I'm taking it halfway through the podcast because that way you know I'm ready to sleep and ready to like curl up like a little

13
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,380
 Baby to sleep right when it's over. We'll see if I start to slur my words

14
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,140
 You know that I've hit the Nyquil. We actually got a lot of stuff to talk about today. First off

15
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:13,020
 Let's take a look at this artwork we have for Fan Art Friday. This was drawn by Church Going Mules

16
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:19,700
 I love this. This is awesome. Thank you very very much for sending me this artwork and letting me use it as well

17
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,860
 Then we have a very special patreon supporter today because it's a Christmas present

18
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,700
 So in comes we're clapping already in comes this giant package

19
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:36,020
 So I'll wrapped up and stuff like a normal Christmas present and out of the Christmas present hops Anthony

20
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:42,260
 Detorfino we're clapping he's still in the box. He's like I'm not popping out until you pronounce my name correctly

21
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:48,580
 Anthony go and pop out of that box jumping out. This is a Christmas present from your brother Nicholas

22
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,540
 Now we'll give Nicholas a chance because that's pretty awesome to do this Christmas present

23
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,420
 We'll give him a chance to fly the carbonicopter in a later episode, but this is all Anthony's episode

24
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:04,020
 He's gonna be our captain our pilot this episode if you get to buy the patreon totally understand just helps for the word about the show

25
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,020
 That really really helps out a lot dress yourself up as a giant present and then stand outside and go boo

26
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:15,020
 Listen to dead rabbitio. That is a I read that I read that on how to win friends and influence people

27
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:20,740
 It's a good marketing technique Anthony. Let's go ahead and put you inside of the dead rabbit dirgeable

28
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:28,440
 We're gonna take a little flight. We are headed out to a secret military base some of you know as Mon talk

29
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:37,220
 Dirgeable is flying over the United States. We're headed out to Long Island a lot of people have requested

30
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,520
 I talk about Mon talk over the years. I'm gonna go through a list real quick

31
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:46,640
 We have Tim Porrell, Stefan, Grey of PTA, John Karras, Calvin Walmer, Jeff D. Padra

32
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,480
 They've been wanting me to cover this stuff

33
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,220
 Really since the beginning of the show and I got to give a special tip of the hat to Alex F on YouTube

34
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,960
 Because again like maybe a year and a half ago

35
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:03,040
 He said you got to do an episode on the Mon talk guys. They actually apparently I wasn't able to find any proof

36
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:10,000
 But Alex F said that they were trying to sue the makers of stranger things because stranger things was based on their real life

37
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,440
 So I was intrigued and I started looking into it and I go at

38
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:20,080
 I don't know if I talk about a homeless man throwing his poop around McDonald's and he just kind of fell to the wayside

39
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,700
 It was a lot of stuff where it's just basically some guys wrote a book and

40
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,320
 It's a bunch of nonsense a bunch of nonsense in this book, but what's interesting

41
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,960
 So thank you Alex for doing that. Sorry you got preempted by a hobo throwing poop story

42
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:40,400
 But recently episode 543 I did here on Dead Rabbit Radio madness murder and UFO disclosure

43
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,700
 It was about a guy named John Ford

44
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,600
 Who really believed that UFOs are flying around Long Island and he ended up threatening to

45
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:53,140
 Irradiate a couple of Republic local Republicans and he's still in prison to this day

46
00:03:53,140 --> 00:04:00,720
 That story happened back in like 2001 or something like that that story I got from an article written by a journalist named Michael Colton

47
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,800
 He's also a writer on the penguins of Madagascar, so that's pretty

48
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:09,240
 That's no for that's no for than anything he'd wrote in the newspaper. I love that show Michael Colton

49
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:14,560
 I quoted him in this episode because I was talking about how it used to be

50
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,640
 How the media portrayed people who had UFO or paranormal events and he had this great passage

51
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,460
 About this guy named Preston Nichols who was

52
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:30,280
 Contemporary of John Ford hung out with the dude and Preston Nichols is described as portly and absent-minded

53
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,240
 They're talking about how cluttered and small his house is he doesn't live in a cluttered big house

54
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:43,800
 He lives in a cluttered small house my favorite line in the article quote in his living room while his fat dog snores

55
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,000
 Nichols cues up a video. I just love I was like dude you're even insulting this guy's dog

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,080
 The dog's not researching UFOs. I actually reached out to Michael Colton and I said hey, I'm doing this podcast

57
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,800
 I don't know why I reach out to him because usually I don't I said hey

58
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,160
 I'm doing this whole podcast basically on this one article. He wrote I had a follow-up question

59
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,120
 I think I had a follow-up question

60
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,120
 We started talking about Preston Nichols

61
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,920
 He goes yeah, I wonder what Preston Nichols is up to nowadays and I go

62
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,640
 I don't know but I will look into it and I did and

63
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:18,240
 He is the guy who's a big part of the Montauk project

64
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,960
 So that was kind of an interesting way to snake back around so hobo throwing poop stories. They're on hold for today

65
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,680
 They're on hold for today because we got this nice little windy road to go down

66
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:35,480
 So Anthony after that nice little preamble you are gonna drive us up to Montauk Air Force Base on Long Island

67
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,560
 And I you see those guards standing there

68
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:44,120
 You see those military guards with like their barrier and stuff those two little things that come down run it and things like what I'm

69
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,120
 Like just run run right through it

70
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,940
 Smashes through the gate the guards are opening fire on us. It's okay. I trust Anthony to dodge the bullets in the car

71
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,780
 We eventually are hiding he didn't do a good job the car got shot to pieces

72
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:00,320
 So now we're hiding in a dumpster waiting for the red alert to go down

73
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:06,700
 The reason why we're here is because according to Preston Nichols, this is where all of the like psychic testing goes

74
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,660
 You ever hear of a super soldier? Well, they exist

75
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,400
 If you haven't they totally exist. I don't know why it falls like that. They totally exist

76
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,040
 They're trained at Montauk Air Force Base. So we're find our way into the actual base

77
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,100
 We see a bunch of people sitting in like chairs and there's these things on their head

78
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,440
 I know super descriptive right theater of the mind. They're like

79
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,380
 Unlike pink electricity shooting out and stuff like that scientists are taking notes

80
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:35,260
 They're like this for my daughter sweet 16. It's adorable

81
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:41,380
 Pink sparkles everywhere what they do here is they basically have three big things

82
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:45,140
 Three big tourist attractions to Montauk Air Force Base one

83
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,560
 Psychic testing and they do that by kidnapping children and hobos

84
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,880
 Taking them to the facility and running all these tests on them. That's a weird combination

85
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,280
 People hate to be in the cell. You're like, oh man, what did I have to be with all the hobos?

86
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,520
 You see all the kids in the other cell they're having a dance party. You're like, oh man

87
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:10,440
 All I get to do is eat beans. But anyways, you have the hobo people you have the hobos

88
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,720
 I haven't drank in the night cool yet

89
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,740
 You have the hobos and you have these kids all in cells and their psychic powers are being unleashed

90
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,700
 Can you think of a worse person to give psychic powers to than a homeless man?

91
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,180
 That's the worst person. They're already so downtrodden

92
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,640
 Don't train hobos to have psychic powers, but they do I guess they know more than I do

93
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,540
 They also they probably know that the hobos aren't gonna go crazy

94
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:39,220
 Because that's only one thing to do the other thing they do is they can view time

95
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,400
 I mean you can view time too. You're you're viewing time right now as you exist

96
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,520
 But they can look forward and backward in time

97
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:54,200
 They built like this time tunnel that they can just look through I totally wish we could like save those guys and on normandy

98
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:59,440
 They're all and they're just watching it like this is this is directors got to save Brian Ryan. This is awesome

99
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,920
 They realize they can view time back and forth, but that's

100
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,920
 History book basically right? I mean you get to see in the future

101
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:13,900
 But who cares if you can view the past big whoop so then the other thing they're known for is they've actually built

102
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,500
 interdimensional time travel

103
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,940
 Portals so Anthony's leading the way pushing him in front of the group. He's like oh man come on

104
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:27,740
 I want to make it till Christmas or like keep going keep going. He takes us into this massive facility and we see this device

105
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:34,600
 And it is actually a time machine an interdimensional time machine

106
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,900
 So a lot of times you might not have known this guys

107
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,560
 I know you guys are pretty up on your history because you guys are always correcting me when I make mistakes

108
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:49,060
 But did you know that originally Hitler won the war the World War two Hitler wanted?

109
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:55,120
 But here's what happened the Montauk people built a time machine and they began delivering

110
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,980
 Supplies into the past which allowed the allies to win. Did you know that?

111
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,040
 Well because according to these guys it happened also

112
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,780
 They went back Montauk personnel went back and met Jesus Christ

113
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:15,900
 They didn't they didn't save him. They they they they famously did not save him and let me say this

114
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:21,740
 They're making all this stuff. I mean they they are presenting this as what's known as soft facts

115
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,840
 There's a book called the Montauk project

116
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,620
 Experiments in time and in the book apparently I haven't read the book, but I was reading reviews on it

117
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,420
 I'm sure people go how can you talk trash about a book you haven't read well

118
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:40,080
 Do it anyways you can't talk trash about my podcast until you've listened to every episode as that all 576 of them

119
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,540
 You have soft facts so it's based and even like when I was doing some research on this

120
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,180
 They say they never really come out and say that the story is true

121
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,600
 But they never come out and say that the story is false again

122
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,720
 I'm taking other sources for that information

123
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:59,440
 So it's really easy to cloud a bunch of minds with that and speaking of someone who does believe in that story Anthony

124
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:06,100
 Let's hop in the Jason Jalopy. We cut Anthony. Let's hop in the wait. What what vehicle did we take first?

125
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,100
 Oh my god, I'm losing my mind

126
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:15,380
 Did we take the dead rabbit dirgeable and then he just was driving a car have I do the episode

127
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:19,060
 I'm sorry. I've not taken the night wheel yet. I'm just really really tired Anthony

128
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:24,020
 We are going to give you the keys to the carpenter copter right now

129
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,340
 We're doing it early or you have any keys to the carpenter copter

130
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:31,640
 You are going to fly us out out of this military base. The red alert has been resounded again

131
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,860
 We are going to the home of one Andy

132
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,400
 Perot

133
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:43,080
 Carbenter copter is flying away from this base. We're actually going to come back to this space

134
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,560
 But first off we're gonna meet a young man named Andy Perot

135
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:53,680
 Now I got most of this information from an interview that Andy did with Eve Lorgan writing for unknown magazine

136
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,660
 Now Andy did not have a simple life. He was very early

137
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:05,240
 Considered to be a prime candidate for the super secret totally real real real

138
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:11,220
 Soldier program we see Andy. He's just like outside. He's like riding his bicycle and stuff like that

139
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:16,940
 There's a stark fan coming up alongside of him and he sees like their logo. It's just like it's just a guy pointing at Andy

140
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,620
 That's the logo and they designed it and they're they have a time machine

141
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,180
 So they knew exactly how to design the logo to point at him as he's riding down the street

142
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:29,020
 They grab him they grab Andy and they begin this psychological psychic torture

143
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:35,980
 And part of the thing is this is really common in MK ultra theory which MK ultra is real but as MK ultra

144
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:43,540
 Conspiracy theory grew you start to get this stuff kind of be cemented in what you do is you take someone and you deliver so much

145
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:52,540
 Logical and physical trauma it causes the brain to split into multiple personalities and then the handler the government handler

146
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,700
 I'm revealing too much. I'm revealing too much

147
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:59,660
 The government handler will then choose one of those alternate personalities to encode

148
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:04,840
 Information into and then they put your brain back together because that works

149
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,280
 I mean why not and then you go about life

150
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,540
 You don't know you are a super soldier or a sex kitten

151
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:18,980
 Basically, you're one of the two you're either super soldier. Those are usually men sex kittens are usually women none of this stuff is true

152
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,600
 I'm just stating how the conspiracy theory set up. That's why you'll see

153
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:28,440
 Britney Spears and Taylor Swift and Lady Gaga and Katy Perry every so often they'll dress up as a cat

154
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,320
 They don't every so often they'll wear

155
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,080
 Here's but they don't always wet dress them and cats but a lot of times if you see them in any leopard print

156
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,140
 Oh, that's the sex kitten programming. You see that all the time

157
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:47,340
 But anyways, that's just in a nutshell. That's years of research that I've done on this stuff MK ultra mind control

158
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:53,780
 This was happening to Andy. He said that they were doing all sorts of psychological kung fu on his brain

159
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,580
 They're also sticking needles in his genitals

160
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:02,140
 That's a little that's a little overboard government, right? You can split my mind

161
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:07,860
 Just keep the keep the needles away from my crotch. He said, you know, one of the other things they did

162
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,960
 You know, casually. He's like, hey, yeah, he's talking to you as much a needle sticking out of his crotch

163
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,640
 You're like, whoa Andy, can you take care of that? He's like, oh, yeah, he puts on a bathrobe

164
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,640
 another thing they did was they would put him in a

165
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:24,760
 drum of water like a big old box of water and seal it shut and he would drown and

166
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,700
 Then he would create a psychic bubble around him and then come back to life

167
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,080
 You know, you know like you learned like you learned when you were in high school

168
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:37,400
 They would drown him and then he would come back to life and they did it quite a few times

169
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,400
 You might want to try healing

170
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:45,620
 Healing those needles out of his genitals first before he does the drowning thing

171
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:51,420
 But anyways, they also had this this is where his training really begins that everyone goes through that. It's like basic

172
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,900
 Then the military goes, you know, this guy'd make a perfect super soldier

173
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,140
 So what we're gonna do with him is we are going to have him

174
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,180
 Jump

175
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:07,180
 Training all those needles goes to give him the power to jump and he said what they do was they put a blindfold on him

176
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,160
 They go climb up this tiny step ladder and then jump off the step ladder

177
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,080
 So he'd climb up the step ladder and go we I don't know if he said we I would say we

178
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,720
 But he goes I kept doing this and then eventually I jumped off this ladder

179
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,400
 And then I turned around and it took my blindfold off because apparently I can do that at this point

180
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,640
 Apparently I can do this. I've gained enough trust though. It was a super tall ladder

181
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,160
 But he thought he was just jumping a foot down a step ladder

182
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,200
 So they're doing this training forever and he said he gave him the ability

183
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,460
 All this training all this manpower all of these pins and genitals

184
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:44,020
 Gave him the ability to jump out of a plane and land without a parachute

185
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:48,860
 Which is cool, but it's not a superpower, but he can do it

186
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,340
 He can jump out of a plane forget wind resistance

187
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:55,400
 Forget how they trained that we're like here you're gonna climb up on this ladder

188
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,980
 You're like what I can't hear you the jet engine super ladder like you're on a tiny ladder

189
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:05,440
 The winds super blown in his face is like well, there's a lot of bugs up here getting caught in my teeth jumping off a ladder

190
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:11,000
 That is his superpower. He also you know, that's pretty lame, but he also says he can curl

191
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,880
 545 pounds. That's impressive. I don't know if they're tiny ladders

192
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,240
 Because every day they gave me a little step stool and I just moved it up and down and then eventually I realized I was holding

193
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,640
 545 pounds maybe maybe they trained him doing that maybe it's steroids

194
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:32,060
 We don't know he does say that in this particular program at Montauk that people are trained time

195
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:36,500
 He says usually the women are trained to be sex kittens, but the men could be trained as couriers

196
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,900
 assassins

197
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,540
 Super soldiers or psychic killers

198
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,300
 I

199
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,300
 Read that and I go I

200
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:51,740
 Would be so disappointed if someone stuck needles in my groin and I just became a courier

201
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:58,000
 They're like you you go ahead go deliver this stuff. You see a bunch of other people like floating around using psychic powers

202
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,760
 Assassinating shadows. They're so silent and you're like on your post mates by

203
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,640
 Needles and you're crotch are like all this hurts everyone's laughing at you

204
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,120
 The psychic's projecting his laughter right into your brain

205
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,040
 He is one of the guys who actually stopped Hitler's

206
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,640
 Conquest of Earth you I don't know why I'm making fun of Andy

207
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:24,260
 We actually owe this man a debt of gratitude because back in time Andy was dressed up as a soldier

208
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:33,100
 Delivering future technology to the allies now you wonder why we didn't see any like drones during World War two or any

209
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,780
 Advanced weapons platform what they had to do is very very ingenious. I wish I had made this up

210
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:41,820
 I wish I had made this detail up. They had to take modern technology

211
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:50,600
 But build it as if it was built to the 1940s using material from the 1940s and then taking that stuff back in time

212
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,160
 So you're not disrupting the timeline. You're totally altering the outcome of a war sure, but you're not

213
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,900
 Disrupting the timeline. They're not walking around iPhones. There's a bridge too far to do that

214
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:07,920
 So he after all of his training is a courier. He's not even the psychic assassin. He can jump out of planes and go ta-da

215
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:13,520
 Here's your package mr. Roosevelt. How do I get back in the plane? I don't know but so he's a courier

216
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,620
 He got all those needles for nothing. He also met aliens

217
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:22,980
 He's been on alien ships and he says the aliens plan is to take our women and children use them for experimentation

218
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:28,340
 Hybrids they want to create alien hybrids on earth this super soldier Andy actually has an experience

219
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:35,060
 He was in an alien facility and he says this he's walking through the facility couple grays on each side

220
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:41,120
 He's like hey, I heard you guys have a UFO. You think I could jump out of it and they're like we wish you would we totally wish you would

221
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,000
 He's walking through this facility

222
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,040
 And he says that he sees women and children behind chicken wire sobbing begging him for help

223
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:56,020
 He doesn't do anything. He doesn't not do anything to save these people at all

224
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:00,280
 He's just like what you must be talking to the other super soldier in this room not me

225
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,500
 What type of hero is crafting his story and I was like hey biographer

226
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,940
 Don't miss out the time when I left all those women and children captive in an alien facility

227
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:14,660
 The biographer is like what so how does he know all this stuff? He had all these memories suppressed

228
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:20,060
 He didn't know he was able to fall long distances in a single bound. He wasn't aware of this stuff until

229
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:25,900
 1996 he's in Atlanta, Georgia. We've been in Georgia a lot this week. He's in Atlanta, Georgia

230
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,700
 We walk into this cool bowling alley. It's 1996

231
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:35,300
 The game is called the game of the year. It's a game of the year. It's a game of the year

232
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:35,300
 It's a game of the year. It's a game of the year. It's a game of the year. It's a game of the year. It's a game of the year. It's a game of the year. It's a game of the year. It's a game of the year. It's a game of the year. It's a game of the year. It's a game of the year. It's a game of the year. It's a game of the year. It's a game of the year. It's a game of the year. It's a game of the year. It's a game of the year. It's a game of the year. It's a game of the year. It's a game of the year. It's a game of the year. It's a game of the year. It's a game of the year. It's a game of the year.

233
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:47,260
 And standing next to us is Andy Perrow and his roommate and they're bowling as well and Andy Perrow starts the bowl and he kind of freezes and super dangerous the ball almost falls on his feet and he just freezes and he goes

234
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,540
 Oh my god

235
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:55,280
 roommates like what there's a billboard that says

236
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:02,120
 Look at this up. See it's actually real. It's a billboard that says bowl with rhino balls

237
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:07,860
 And he's like have no he's having a flashback. He's gonna need a second to scratch

238
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,600
 Oh, I wish I didn't have that part of the flashback. He's remembering given supplies to to

239
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,620
 Whoever that guy was over there. What was that old man who helped to win World War two?

240
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:20,540
 You have the big nose. What was his name?

241
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:26,040
 What's Winston Churchill Winston Churchill? He's given supplies to Winston Churchill tip of the hat

242
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:31,140
 He's going through all the stuff. He's showing off ladders. He's wondering why he always had that ladder fetish at home Depot

243
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:35,020
 He remembers when he sees bowl with rhino balls

244
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:40,860
 He has a flashback that when he was doing this military training his nickname was rhino

245
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:46,720
 Who wouldn't want a nickname like rhino? His name was rhino in the military and he turns to his roommate. He goes

246
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,180
 I'm rhino

247
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,680
 They called me rhino and

248
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:58,220
 The roommate according to Andy goes what no no one ever called you rhino. Why would you say rhino?

249
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:03,060
 Why would you say rhino and Andy realized that this wasn't his roommate?

250
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:09,500
 What was his room? He does pay after rent, but he was also a handler for this organization

251
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,940
 Like they had kept an eye on him over the years. I'm gonna tell you right now

252
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:18,020
 We're not gonna have time for the ghosts the do aliens cause ghost sightings

253
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:22,080
 We're gonna have to say that to next week because I just looked over at my notes and I realized something

254
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,980
 It gave me a little flashback

255
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,420
 He says in a story he said it early on but I kind of spaced on it

256
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,780
 He kept saying we talked about this on a recent episode

257
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,620
 That's why I want to give it a little bit of time to breathe

258
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:38,740
 We talked about this conspiracy theory that the Nazis this guy was leaving yellow notes all over New York

259
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,740
 Basically saying the same theory that the Nazi

260
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,380
 command and control

261
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:49,340
 operation when they when World War two ended they didn't just you know go

262
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,900
 I'm gonna go back to start making pretzels and stuff like that

263
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:57,420
 You did have project paperclip where we were bringing over Nazi scientists to work on a rocket program

264
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,780
 but this theory is that the Nazis actually

265
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,700
 infiltrated every part of

266
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:09,500
 US government and really world government the Nazis now run the world is this conspiracy theory and I was just looking over at

267
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:14,220
 My notes here and it said I'd written it down explicitly this time that his Nazi

268
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,500
 Handlers were still keeping track on him through his roommates

269
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:24,140
 So in his story Nazis have conquered the planet, but they're doing it in a very hail Hydra kind of way

270
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:29,260
 Why would the Nazis go back in time to help the Allies win World War two?

271
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:33,300
 It's a really interesting. I I'm

272
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,140
 I read an article on this I took notes on this

273
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,940
 I read a couple other articles on it and I haven't looked at it until I'm reading it to you

274
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:46,100
 So a very casual viewer to this narrative, but if you're crafting this over the years

275
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:51,100
 I don't get how you can miss such an integral part of the mythology now

276
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:57,580
 I'm sure there may be an answer that oh well the Nazis really wanted to lose World War two so they could do this but if they had

277
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:03,300
 The technology to just time travel they could have just done everything right in the first place

278
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,620
 So it doesn't make sense if you're crafting your own

279
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:12,540
 Story if you're making it up, which I do believe he's making it up. How could you make such a fatal flaw?

280
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:17,760
 Again, there may be some book that he's selling. I find it odd that it wasn't in this main interview

281
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,780
 He may it will actually is selling a book. We'll get to that in a second

282
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,940
 We'll get into that in a second

283
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:28,300
 But he says that his Nazi handlers helped him win World War two for the Allies weird and

284
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:35,500
 Equally weird equally weird they erased his memory gave him a roommate who knew his memory knew his name was Rhino

285
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,820
 And now this roommate's job was to make sure that

286
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:44,620
 Nobody called him Rhino again. You can't watch Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles can't watch Animal Planet

287
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,820
 There's only two places. I know rhinos are at so he has to start, you know kind of like

288
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:53,780
 Maneuvering around his roommate is very very tense next couple months until the lease was up

289
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,860
 His roommates just standing silently over him while he's sleeping

290
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:02,460
 Roo mate has his finger to his ear going no boss no movement. He's still just sleeping

291
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:09,340
 He doesn't suspect a thing Rhino is down and Andy's laying there. He's like oh man. This is gonna suck

292
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:13,860
 He does say that over time he starts remembering more and more of his past

293
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,800
 So he starts to put this narrative together about what happened

294
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,580
 But his roommate was actively working against the worst roommate in the world, right?

295
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:25,980
 He would write notes to remind himself because he kept forgetting this stuff

296
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:32,220
 He kept forgetting his his made of stuff. He's like oh, where was I at? He starts to forget his head cannon

297
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:36,620
 So he starts writing notes. He's like oh dude remember the ladders remember the ladders

298
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:40,700
 That's not puzzling at all and he'd hide the note and then he would get brainwashed again

299
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,460
 His roommate apparently was dr.

300
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:45,980
 Mindbender could brainwash him and then he'd wake up and be like oh what a beautiful day

301
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,540
 He'd be walking around he sees a rhino walking on the street doesn't even think about it

302
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,540
 He's a ladder

303
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:55,820
 Which is less exciting than a rhino walking down the street, but he still doesn't acknowledge it

304
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:59,900
 But then he finds a slip of paper in his sock drawer and it says remember the ladders

305
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:04,900
 It starts freaking again every time he reads a note he gets the needles in his crotch again

306
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:09,140
 He's like no need to see he leaves a note. This is stop reading notes. He looks at it. He's like

307
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:17,380
 Anyways, he gets out from his lease. He gets out from underneath the thumb of his roommate and in 1998

308
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,860
 He goes public with his story and that's how he's being interviewed by this woman

309
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,460
 He was introduced by Preston Nichols

310
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:31,700
 At this big convention weird con in 98 come on down with your craziest conspiracies guys

311
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,060
 It's organized by the CIA. You know have so much fun

312
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:42,260
 Preston Nichols brings Andy Perrow on because Andy's basically telling the same story. He was being trained at Montauk

313
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:49,460
 You have this guy Andy Perrow coming publicly and saying yeah, all this stuff happened all this stuff happened the whole time

314
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,820
 Preston Nichols is just counting money in the corner. He's like keep it coming kid

315
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,700
 He's a sucker boy in every minute people are just throwing cash in him

316
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:01,780
 Andy Perrow tells this story and a book has been written about him. He hasn't written it himself

317
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:08,100
 Because he kept losing it. He kept getting brainwashed after through the sentence. He's like, uh, this book is called Illuminati

318
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,580
 Aliens and the Nazis

319
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:17,300
 the true and untold story of Illuminati mind control survivor Andy Perrow

320
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,940
 This book though in some sort of cosmic joke

321
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,940
 I don't know if this is a pseudonym

322
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:29,460
 Or if this is an author's actual name if it is get a pseudonym because when I saw it I chuckled

323
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:34,180
 I'm not gonna say a laugh out loud. It's building up. I had a slight chuckle and then I read the reviews and quite a few

324
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:37,940
 Reviewers were like, what's up with this guy's name? His name is kin

325
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:40,660
 hardly read

326
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,500
 That has to be a joke

327
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,900
 Because obviously you think can't hardly read

328
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,540
 kin hardly read kin hardly read

329
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:54,820
 As two books are written two books one a totally true story of a man whose roommate was a nazi

330
00:25:55,060 --> 00:26:00,660
 Who went back in time and delivered future technology disguises old timey junk to Winston Churchill

331
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:07,860
 Got a bunch of needles in his crotch, but haven't we all this book this true book was written by kin hardly read and kin hardly's other book

332
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:12,420
 Is a three minute book. I didn't know books had time

333
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:18,020
 So you have to finish it before then your ipad's heating up. It is a three minute guide

334
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:21,220
 called free bitcoin earning

335
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,420
 Earn unlimited bitcoin for free

336
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:32,580
 I do not recommend reading that. I just think by purchasing that book your computer becomes infested with dark web viruses

337
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:40,900
 Unlimited bitcoin for free if you are interested if you have three minutes to spare you can check out kin hardly reads book

338
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:46,660
 Um whatever advice he gives it's like step number one rip off the russian mafia

339
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:53,700
 If you happen to live in Moscow kicking a random dude's door most likely has some sort of bitcoin mining operation illegally

340
00:26:53,940 --> 00:27:00,260
 Whatever the advice is in the book. I recommend not not doing it because there is no free unlimited bitcoin

341
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:05,460
 However, I guess if you're already tied into the Illuminati nazi mind control paradigm

342
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:10,020
 Maybe they've figured out a way to get bitcoin for free

343
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:14,660
 Originally, this was just supposed to be like a 15 minute story, but I really got carried away

344
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:19,780
 I love how this mythology is not only growing in the real world

345
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,940
 But it's growing on the show like we've had this arc

346
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,780
 It was neat to see this little evolution of a story over the course for a year and a half

347
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,340
 So I really appreciate everyone who recommended Montectomy

348
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,820
 Obviously michael colton for writing that article

349
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:36,740
 Also led me down this path as well find all that stuff very fascinating

350
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:41,700
 I think this is a great story to end friday on even though I had planned to do another story

351
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:46,500
 I think this is a great story to end friday on because let's go back to how it started

352
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:52,260
 John Ford believed all this stuff as well in the story that michael colton wrote

353
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:56,820
 John Ford is the main subject matter and Preston Nichols is just some shlubby dude

354
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:01,540
 He's kind of walking to the background going hey boss, would you hear about all that time travel?

355
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:04,980
 And then john ford lets his delusions get the best of him

356
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,540
 And ends up committing a crime

357
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:12,740
 Attempted murder and he's in prison for the rest of his life. He's like has no competency hearings

358
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,580
 It's really fascinating episode. I recommend checking it out or you can read michael colton's article

359
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:20,020
 But he believed it so much that he

360
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,500
 Went too far

361
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,500
 And ended up ruining his life

362
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:30,420
 And then you have Preston Nichols and I think this is the more savvy way to do it is he was the

363
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:34,020
 secondary character in that article but watching that happen to john ford

364
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:38,340
 I think a lightbulb popped up a sci-fi lightbulb popped up in Preston Nichols head

365
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,020
 I can have the best of both worlds

366
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:46,500
 I can have this belief system and have these ideas of time travel and things like that and at the same time

367
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,980
 Make a lot of money

368
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:52,980
 And not being not being prison. That's just the third thing. That's the third thing

369
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:59,940
 And I think he saw what happened to his friend and he goes he larked too hard. He believed the bs

370
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,900
 He believed the bs too much

371
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,300
 So the point that he thought the government was out to get him

372
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,740
 Preston Nichols is writing books and going and they might be true

373
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,980
 And he's telling these crazy stories of time travel one of the stories he mentioned

374
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:16,820
 I forgot to say this is that I should I mean this should have been the headline for the episode

375
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:21,300
 One of the stories Preston Nichols says is during one of these time travel interdimensional experiments

376
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:29,060
 A monster hopped out of the vortex and began eating scientists until he was finally shot to death by us troops

377
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:33,060
 That's how crazy this episode's been that I forgot that

378
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,780
 And I think that's where the whole strange of things

379
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:41,620
 Allegations come from if those are true again, alex f i'm not saying alex f is a liar, but I just couldn't back it up

380
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:46,820
 I don't want Preston Nichols to sense some interdimensional creature after me being like I never said that there is no lesson

381
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,060
 I don't believe Preston Nichols

382
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:54,180
 Believes the story of Montauk. I think he probably picked and choose. There's probably he probably does believe in aliens

383
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:58,660
 The theory of time travel. He does say that he saw a videocassette of himself

384
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:02,660
 Time traveling so I definitely know he believes in time travel

385
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:07,220
 But as he's weaved this story together, I think there's a lot of fiction thrown in there

386
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:13,860
 It makes it more spicy and he's inspiring these other people Andy Perot may know what he's saying is false

387
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,100
 Or he may know what he's saying is true

388
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:22,420
 And obviously my opinion on it has just been put forth in the past 30 minutes or however long this episode is going to be

389
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:27,940
 But you can do the story wrong you can play out your role too much as the paranoid

390
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:31,540
 investigator and end up acting out

391
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:34,420
 being thrown in prison or

392
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,620
 You could be the person who steps back and goes listen. I know there's some truth here

393
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:42,020
 But I'm gonna make up a bunch of fake stuff people love to hear fake stuff disguises real stuff

394
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:45,060
 I'm make a bunch of money. I'm gonna get a big social profile

395
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:51,300
 I may even have people follow in my footsteps someday and that's Preston Nichols route. There are two routes

396
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,260
 But they both lead to the same destination

397
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:57,140
 silencing an investigator

398
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:02,820
 John Ford is no longer looking into the stuff that he believed in whether or not it was true. He believed it was true

399
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,060
 Preston Nichols

400
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:10,820
 Is now known as the Montauk project guy. So if he does start to make other revelations going forward

401
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:16,340
 Most people especially skeptical community go well, he did write that book that had a bunch of soft facts in it

402
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:21,140
 Why should we believe this at the end of the day two investigators got taken off the game board?

403
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,020
 one through criminal charges and the other one through

404
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,260
 financial gain

405
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:31,140
 Preston Nichols may have status and money and fame

406
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,700
 But is he still just another prisoner of a system?

407
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,820
 That is constantly trying to keep the truth

408
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:42,260
 From reaching the masses

409
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:47,220
