1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,280
 An otherwise normal cemetery has a bloody secret, and then we take a look at an odd subculture

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:18,160
 on the eBay market. People who are selling haunted dolls that are possessed with the spirits

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,160
 of dead prostitutes today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:33,840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,520
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. Hope you guys had a great

6
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:44,160
 weekend. I have a special guest in the studio today. It is Veronica. Veronica the haunted doll.

7
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,160
 I purchased the long time ago. She's here. She's actually always here, but normally she's in the

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,640
 corner. Today she's sitting on my desk, so if you hear any weird, it's her. It's a little Veronica.

9
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,120
 I've had her for a couple months now, and I haven't had any unique ghost stories to tell with her,

10
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,360
 but she's been my haunted doll. I bought her on eBay, and she's going to guest host today,

11
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:09,280
 because we have a story coming up about, not about her, not about her. She is not a sex worker,

12
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,120
 doll. But anyways, we'll get to that in a second. First off, let's give a shout out to our newest

13
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:20,320
 Patreon's Donnie and Sarah. Donnie and Sarah, thank you so much for supporting the show.

14
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,520
 They are engaged. Isn't that cute? Little engaged couple sitting around listening to

15
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,640
 the little Dead Rabbit Radio drinking hot chocolate. I don't know. Or maybe just, maybe just water.

16
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,320
 Maybe just sit around with a lukewarm glass of water and look at each other and go,

17
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,040
 "Oh, this is a good episode." I don't know. Whatever your beverage of choice is, I hope you're

18
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,320
 drinking it while you're listening to this, and you will be our pilots. This episode, our captains,

19
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,240
 whatever vehicle we take, you will be in charge. If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

20
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,720
 Just help get the word out about the show. That really, really helps out a lot.

21
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,120
 We're going to toss Donnie the keys to the Jason Jalopy. Donnie, you ready? He's nodding.

22
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:05,360
 We are leaving behind Oregon. We are headed out to Peeridge, Arkansas. We're driving.

23
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,360
 We go to Peeridge, Arkansas. It's July 2020. So very, very recent story. We all get out. We're at

24
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,480
 a cemetery, and we see a bunch of detectives standing around a gravestone. They're like,

25
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,400
 "We should have solved this case before the man died, but we're not that good of a detective."

26
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,840
 But they're standing around this gravestone, and they're taking pictures of it and stuff,

27
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,080
 dusting for fingerprints. Also, there is Shannon Nobles. Now, that's her grandpa's grave.

28
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,960
 What happened was her grandpa, Fred Allen McKinney, died in May 2020, so just a month beforehand.

29
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,920
 The reason why they're there is there's a dead animal laying on the gravestone. It's like just

30
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,880
 a squirrel, just totally out. We're thinking, "Why are the cops here for a dead squirrel?"

31
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,800
 That's pretty common, right? Squirrels are always dying.

32
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:57,120
 Shannon goes, "No, no, no, no. This isn't just a dead squirrel. This is the 10th dead squirrel

33
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,720
 we found on this grave." And we're like, "Hmm, now that is a mystery."

34
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,160
 What was happening was Shannon would come out to visit her grandpa's grave, and there'd be a

35
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,560
 dead animal on it. And at first she's thinking, "Oh, I wonder if it's eating something. I wonder

36
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,240
 if it's eating the fake flowers?" And it wasn't just squirrels either, right? Because then you just

37
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,920
 figure maybe squirrels were just found in a place very comfortable, but it was all sorts of animals.

38
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,960
 This is an elephant, a panda. It was all sorts of animals found dead on her grandpa's tombstone.

39
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:26,480
 She puts up a trail cam, and there's that animal a couple days later on the gravestone. And she's

40
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,840
 like, "Oh, let's review the footage." So they see, at this point, 16 animals in total have been found

41
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,800
 dead on this gravestone. Not all at once. That'd be like a little pyramid. There's a live squirrel

42
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,080
 sitting on the top of the pyramid. 16 animals at all. They see with this trail cam, they see a dodge

43
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,280
 journey pull-up. So they see this gray car pull-up. They see this elderly man get out,

44
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,840
 and he's wearing like overalls. So he looks like a farmer, right? He totally looks like a stereotypical

45
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:59,600
 farmer. But he also is wearing a woman's wig and a woman's windbreaker. This must be a really

46
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,920
 high-definition camera that they could pull all this stuff out. It says "Lane Bryant" on the jacket.

47
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:10,720
 And he's wearing sunglasses. So it's obviously this farmer dude in a bib and overalls,

48
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,200
 but he's wearing a woman's wig, and he runs and he's dropping a dead animal on the gravestone. So

49
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,640
 they go, "That's him." They show it to the cops, and the cops go, "It's obviously somebody who's

50
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:27,440
 trying to disguise their identity. Maybe he really likes wearing a wig." But it's most likely a really

51
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,560
 poorly thought-out disguise guy. So the cops go, "Okay, that's weird, but we don't know who that is."

52
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,480
 And Shannon didn't recognize him either. But one day, she sees that same car pulling away from

53
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,040
 the cemetery. She spends a lot of time in the cemetery, but she sees the dodge journey pull-out,

54
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:50,400
 so she begins following it. And when she follows it, she follows it to a store, and out hops,

55
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,320
 Joseph A. Stroud, a 78-year-old man who was Fred's neighbor. They didn't get along. They

56
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,920
 actually ended up in a lawsuit against each other. So Shannon's like, "Hmm, that makes sense. Now I

57
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,240
 know who it is. I think I know who it is, right? It wasn't a woman's windbreaker this time, but the

58
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,800
 weather was quite good." So that would explain that. She goes to the cops and says, "Hey, I'm pretty

59
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,240
 sure it's this dude. Doesn't like my grandpa and is just throwing dead animals on his gravestone."

60
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,200
 The cops are like, "Yeah, we need a little more than that." Then she's out running, and her running

61
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:27,760
 path takes her by the cemetery. Now, at a certain point, you just kind of cut your losses, right?

62
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,880
 At a certain point, you got to go, "There's a lot of places to run in P. Ridge, Arkansas. I'm assuming.

63
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,640
 I'm assuming it's just not a one street town, and at the end of the street is a cemetery." But

64
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,440
 at a certain point, you're like, "Maybe I shouldn't run by the cemetery where all the dead animals are."

65
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,280
 But she's running, and she sees Stroud driving away from the cemetery. She's like, "I bet you

66
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,080
 anything. I bet you anything." So she runs, and she gets-- she might have walked. She might have

67
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,880
 just walked at this point. She's not a Wonder Woman. She might have just walked. She goes to her grandpa's

68
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:03,360
 grave. This is what I find so bizarre about the story, other than the fact that this old farmer

69
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,120
 man decides to disguise himself as a woman, but still wears his overalls and bib, like the most

70
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,320
 stereotypical old man farmer clothes. That's the weird-- that's weird part one. He wears a wig and

71
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,360
 a windbreaker, and then doesn't change any of his other clothes. That's weird. You're like, "Jason,

72
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,880
 the dead animal is far more weird than that." Sure, but then this is the weirdest part. When she gets

73
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:32,480
 there, she sees a dead possum on the grave, and then to top it off, as if you couldn't get anywhere

74
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,760
 to net, there's like a vase built into like the gravestone where you like would put flowers and

75
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:46,320
 stuff. It was full of live baby possums. They're just like crawling all over each other. They're

76
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:54,080
 all pink and fleshing and stuff like that. "What happened there, man? Like, what-- what-- there's

77
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:00,480
 so much stuff to unpack there, because one-- I don't even know if I want to unpack this one.

78
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:06,080
 Did he kill the mom possum, and then the babies follow him, and he's like, "Oh." So he threw him

79
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,800
 in the vase so they'd be safe. Did he throw him into the vase assuming that they would have to

80
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,560
 like-- no one would discover him for a while, and then they would have to fight like the hunger

81
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,560
 games amongst each other, till eventually one baby possum ate the other seven, and then grew

82
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,280
 strong enough to break through the vase, and then he'd put that dead one on there, or did he kill

83
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,800
 the possum, and then much of babies pop out, which like, I don't want to go into it. My point is,

84
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,800
 is that why did you do that? Why did you do that? It's bad enough that you're killing these animals,

85
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:43,520
 but then what are you like, "Oh, I just put these in a vase." Like, what was that logic? So anyways,

86
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,800
 at this point, she was able to say, "Listen, I saw him leave in the scene, and then there was this

87
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,760
 dead possum, and then I have these baby possums that now-- they've bonded to me. Now I'm their mother,

88
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,200
 and they're like crawling all over her. They're fault crawling along the police station,

89
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,680
 walking on the ink. They're like, "Dude, that's evidence! The possums are all like playing with

90
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,880
 cocaine. They're like, 'Oh, that's gonna botch so many trials.'" They arrest him. They end up arresting

91
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:12,160
 him, and his crime, apparently it's legal to throw dead animals around. That wasn't the crime. This

92
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,480
 was, again, was super bizarre about this case. What he got in trouble for was, at one point,

93
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:23,280
 he cut an animal open, and Tommy and Sarah are like, "Dude, seriously? This, this is my fiance's

94
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,880
 in the car. She's like crying in the back. I'm sorry, guys, but, but here's something to wipe your

95
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:36,000
 eyes. It's a belt." Apparently, what his crime actually was, wasn't that. Wasn't kidnapping baby

96
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,640
 possums or stuff like that. It was the fact that he took a dead animal and draped it over the tombstone,

97
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:49,040
 and blood got on the tombstone, and you can't wash it out, because apparently this tombstone

98
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,400
 is made of white cloth or something like that. Like, the blood is stained into it,

99
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:58,720
 so he has to buy him a new tombstone, basically. He got charged with a class B felony, $2,500 in

100
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,720
 damages due to blood stains on a tombstone. I don't think that's what they charged him with. I

101
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,160
 don't think the cops are like, "It's a 207 dead animal on a tombstone." Let's put your hands behind

102
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:15,280
 your back, but he, it was a basically like a high-level vandalism charge, $2,500 vandalism charge.

103
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:21,680
 So, that is the story of Joseph A Stroud, master of disguise. He should have rented a car. I mean,

104
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,280
 that's how they identified him was his car. He could have done a lot of things differently.

105
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,520
 First off, by not throwing dead animals on someone's grave, but if he hadn't draped on over the

106
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,240
 tombstone, he'd be walking out of jail right now. He's like, "Ha ha ha, the law can't hold me."

107
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,800
 He's walking away, and then on the rooftop, there's eight little silhouettes standing there.

108
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,400
 They're little baby possums, little naked, hairless baby possums, and they're looking down at him.

109
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:50,160
 And then he goes home, and he's like, cooking, um, he eats them. Yeah, what are they going to do

110
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,920
 against them? They're not ninja turtles. Then he gets home, and they come there in his house,

111
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,600
 and they're like, "We're gonna get back at you," and he just scoops, he just scoops them up,

112
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,640
 and eats them like chitlins. I don't know where I was going with that, even if they were, even if

113
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,920
 they were ninja turtles. Or like, they're still tiny. He's like eating them like a shrimp. That's

114
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,040
 a dismal story. Sorry about, sorry, Donnie and Sarah. I was hoping the little baby possums could

115
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:20,720
 beat him up, but I gotta, I gotta be at least a little realistic. Speaking of baby possums,

116
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,160
 I have no way to segue from that. I have no way to really segue from that to our next story. So

117
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,640
 Sarah, we are going to toss you the keys to the carpenter copter. You're going to take us for

118
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,600
 this first jump of this flight. We're flying up on that carpenter copter. As we're flying away

119
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,840
 in the carpenter copter, I turn, I put my arm around your shoulder. I pull you close. And I go,

120
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,960
 hey, come here, come here, come here. Let me tell you about a little movie called The Vanished. So

121
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,360
 I actually have been working with a marketing team. I have four digital copies. I originally was

122
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,920
 five. I had five digital copies, but I took one to watch and I watched it and I actually enjoyed

123
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,080
 it. I'd love to talk to you guys about it. But first, new today on digital. It just came out on

124
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:06,560
 digital. Ann Haitian Thomas Jane, star in this gripping psychological thriller called The Vanished.

125
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,400
 Structed by Peter Facinelli, we'll talk about him in a second too,

126
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:16,080
 a family vacation takes a terrifying turn when two parents discover that their young daughter has

127
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:22,560
 vanished without a trace. Stopping at nothing to find her. The search for the truth leads to a

128
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:29,360
 shocking revelation where nothing is what it seems in this intense thriller. Own or rent the vanished

129
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,760
 on digital today and watch it at home tonight. Rated R from Paramount Pictures. So I watched it

130
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,840
 and I do have four digital copies again previously five. It's weird. I can't legally hold a contest.

131
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,440
 There's all these sorts of rules. I'm trying to figure out a way to get four of those copies out to

132
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:52,080
 you guys. So if you guys are interested in the movie, I can't say it's super weird. I don't even

133
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,560
 know how I'm going to get these four digital copies out. But even if you don't get a digital copy,

134
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,840
 I recommend checking it out. There's a lot of weird stuff going on. Peter Facinelli was the

135
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:07,920
 lead vampire in the Twilight movies. He was Edward Collins adopted dad. And he directs this movie.

136
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,920
 This is only a second movie he's directed. And there's also everyone in the movie is a big old

137
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,960
 weirdo. It's a really interesting movie. It's just a bunch of weirdos in like a

138
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:24,240
 hundred yard location. Everyone just has this weird secret. No spoilers, but one of the characters

139
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,840
 isn't even bigger, bigger weirdo. And when they go to his house, when they go to his location,

140
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:37,200
 he has a copy of the Twilight book on his, I think it was actually Eclipse was the actual book.

141
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:44,720
 And I'm thinking did the director choose, choose to make the creepiest guy in the movie a fan of

142
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,360
 Twilight that he's reading this book? Or did the set designer throw it in his joke in the director?

143
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,720
 I don't know. I don't know. There's a lot of weird stuff in the movie. Check it out. It is

144
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,840
 available today, rent or own today from Paramount Pictures. Let's go ahead. We're leaving behind

145
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:03,280
 Peerage Arkansas. We're leaving behind Paramount Pictures Mountain. Sarah and Donnie are both

146
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,080
 flying the Carbentercopter at the same time because see they love each other. So they're in sync.

147
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:13,120
 We hope, we hope, right? We hope they don't have a fight. They're spilling each other's lukewarm

148
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:21,040
 water. We hope that they can think as one couple as they fly us safely out to a toy factory. And

149
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,280
 there's like all these dolls being created. There's like little mechanical arms putting them in the

150
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,480
 sockets and stuff like that. And these dolls are just kind of moving out a conveyor belt. And the

151
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,360
 reason why we're here is because this is what a doll is supposed to look like. And you're like,

152
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,240
 Jason, I know what a doll is supposed to look like. You buffoon. You took us all the way to a

153
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,640
 doll factory just so you could do this intro. But see, while we're at the doll factory, you're

154
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,560
 right. It's probably not the best place to be. It's super noisy. There's dolls everywhere, just

155
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:52,400
 huge machines. I pull up my laptop because this is really all we needed to do. Sit down. We're

156
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,840
 like, Hey, we asked the boss, can we use your office for the rest of the segment? He's like,

157
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:00,640
 Yeah, sure. Go ahead. You go upstairs. We're on the internet. I the other day I was like, Okay,

158
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,560
 so I have Veronica. She's a haunted doll. I bought her a long time ago. She's pretty cool.

159
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,480
 I was like, I wonder if should I buy another haunted doll with the ghosts and get along?

160
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,720
 Would there be like fighting each other and stuff like that, which admittedly would be kind of cool.

161
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:19,760
 But so I was looking for haunted dolls. But then I found a new layer. This is a whole subculture

162
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,120
 of doll. These are dolls. These are normal dolls that would be found being made at a factory.

163
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:31,920
 But these dolls are possessed, not what just run of the mill ghosts, but possessed with sexual ghosts,

164
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:38,080
 which is which is like eight levels of gross, right? I mean, killing animals to run them on a

165
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,480
 grave would be like seven layers of gross. But let's look, these are actual descriptions. Let's

166
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,920
 take a look at some of these descriptions for $200. You could buy this haunted doll. Now I'm going

167
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:55,040
 to be fair. I'm almost for sure that this I almost think that this doll was mislisted, because in

168
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:01,200
 the description, they keep referring to it as a ring. Here's part of this description. All your

169
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:07,920
 dark little secrets of sexual lust and fantasy will rise. This amazing talisman ring will

170
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,240
 bring new submissive friends into your life who will become part of your erotic adventures.

171
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,880
 The last thing I want is a bunch of toadies running around, right? Like when I think of

172
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,720
 submissive friends, sure, you could be like trying to be this whole Christian gray thing

173
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,400
 where some chick shows up and she's like, I'll do whatever you want. But I also

174
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:33,440
 an Igor, right? I'm like, I have this doll and or ring and either wear the ring or I carry the

175
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,440
 doll around or wear the doll and then a bunch of like Igor show up and they're like, oh yes,

176
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,800
 master, whatever you want us to do, sexual or otherwise, they're winking their one eye. I'm

177
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,840
 like, gross, bro. I don't know. Go do the dishes or something. Do you want me to do them naked? No.

178
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:54,960
 So anyway, but I guess the term submissive in this context, but they keep referring it to it as a ring.

179
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:00,480
 But it's listed as, this is what it's listed, all the links are in the show notes, so you can

180
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:07,920
 purchase this doll, $200, by the way, it's porcelain doll. It's listed as haunted sex attraction

181
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:17,200
 magic doll, XXX, adult only live the life of a porn super. Didn't finish it. It's not a porn superstar.

182
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:22,160
 It's just a porn super. You're a porn super. And then it gets, this is where I start to think

183
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:28,640
 whoever wrote this knows who they, they have this very, very specific group of people that they're

184
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:34,080
 either marketing to, i.e. creeps, or the person who's writing this is like, someday I'll have you.

185
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,400
 You can have any submissive person, you're going to attract submissive people from all over,

186
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:46,480
 but specifically, look at this passage, this will bring you a sexy barista, the hot guy in the gym,

187
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:53,120
 the bartender, your friend or acquaintance, your colleague, whoever you wish, he will be filled,

188
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,680
 oh, and that's a key thing that I should say right on the bat. I'm pretty sure these

189
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:03,520
 dolls are all marketed, I hope these dolls are marketed towards women, right? Again, I hope,

190
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,880
 really, really hope so. Most supernatural stuff is marketed towards women. Even though the ghost

191
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,440
 shows are all men, it's mostly women who are into paranormal. We've talked about that a lot of times

192
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:18,400
 on this show, but this one definitely is so you can get your sexy barista, which I don't think

193
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:24,560
 I've ever seen a male sexy barista, right? Is that a thing? Is that like a woman's fantasy now?

194
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,320
 Because they smell like coffee beans and stuff like that? Because they can get you discounts?

195
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:33,680
 Or I'll punch your card twice, honey, click, click. Like, what is that? But anyway, so you get this

196
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:39,920
 ring and/or doll and you can take control of that sexy barista or the hot guy in the gym.

197
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:46,400
 So, guys, if you ever feel yourself falling in love with someone and wanting to quit your job

198
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,560
 and become a barista, check her doll collection. She might end her bank account because if she has

199
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,800
 no money, she's blowing it all on these stupid dolls. But that's not it. That's not it. Because

200
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,040
 just one doll, right? That would be a one-off thing. I saw that one and I thought, that was the first

201
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:06,400
 one I saw and I go, "That's insane." And then I thought, "There must be more of these out there.

202
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,800
 There has to be more of these out here. This is not an outlying thing."

203
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:17,520
 We are now going to meet Elizabeth for $24. This is a very cheap one. If you don't have

204
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,160
 $200 to spend and you don't want a bunch of e-gores running around, 24 bucks, you can get Elizabeth.

205
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,680
 I'm going to read you this first part, verbate. This is 100% what was written in the listing.

206
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:33,840
 "Elizabeth found dead in river." Okay, wait. I can't start laughing yet.

207
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:39,840
 You're like, "Jason, that's gruesome. Hold on. It starts off. This is the posting, okay? Elizabeth

208
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:46,080
 found dead in river." Next sentence. "So excited. I found another box from this set of dolls that

209
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,600
 are inhabited by sex worker women who were supposedly murdered by Jack the Ripper."

210
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,840
 This is what I don't understand. Are you excited that she drowned in the river? Are you excited?

211
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:02,160
 You found dolls that are possessed with dead prostitutes. Are you excited that they're from...

212
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,600
 First off, I'm pretty sure Jack the Ripper, his name wasn't Jack the Drowner. So I don't know how

213
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,880
 this woman died in the river, or is she implying the doll died in the river? You should never say,

214
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,800
 "Elizabeth found dead in the river," and then your next two words be so excited. There's a whole

215
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:22,800
 lot of stuff going on here, but she weaves this crazy tale. This selling was basically at its own

216
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:29,360
 short story attached. There was a girl whose mom was a sex worker who died, so then she was an orphan

217
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,960
 and she went to live with her aunt, and then she became a sex worker and then got abused by a pimp,

218
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,720
 and then left the pimp. None of this has to do with the dolls. This is modern times. This isn't

219
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,200
 as nothing to do with the doll. This is just in the description. The woman leaves the pimp

220
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:51,120
 and then gets rescued by a madam, so her and a bunch of other girls worked in a brothel,

221
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,480
 and the madam was very kind to these young women that she was using to pimp. She's still a pimp,

222
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:02,960
 right? Just a different name for it. And the madam goes, "Well, you young ladies, I am going to put

223
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,560
 a doll in each of your rooms. This doll will watch over you, and not only will it watch over you,

224
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:19,840
 it'll make the sex even..." The old lady, the old madam goes, "This doll will make the sex even

225
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:25,360
 better if you keep this doll in your room, make the sex even better." And then the madam dies,

226
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:31,200
 and then the prostitute gets the doll, has like three or four of these dolls, and then has given

227
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,520
 them to this eBay seller to sell. Now, the madam explained all of that, all of that stuff with the

228
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,880
 girl like going, being a sex worker, her mom being a sex worker, all gets to the point that these

229
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:49,520
 dolls are all possessed with the victims of Jack the Ripper's ghosts. So the madam had these dolls

230
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:55,040
 that I don't know were passed along through pimp history from one pimp to another. This doll that

231
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,840
 was possessed with the dead prostitute, the spirit of dead prostitute, if you put it in your room,

232
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:08,080
 it makes the sex better. Now, let's assume that... let's just assume that lunacy is true for just

233
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:14,320
 a few minutes. One, $24 is completely underselling a hundred-year-old ghost, right? I would be awfully

234
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:20,640
 offended if I was murdered in one of the most famous, if not the most famous serial killer case.

235
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:27,440
 24 bucks? Come on, man. Let's say it's true. You have the ghost of a woman who was a sex worker,

236
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,760
 who was brutally murdered, is trapped in a doll, and then you make her watch other sex workers

237
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:42,240
 have sex for probably a hundred years. If this is true, that's absolutely horrible. If it's not

238
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,480
 true, it's just a doll sitting in the corner while you're banging dudes and whatever. It's just kind

239
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,760
 of creepy. I mean, you imagine the Johns come in the room and they're like, "Hey, hey, what's up with

240
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:57,760
 that doll?" And, "Oh, no, no, no, no. It makes the sex better." What? What are you talking about?

241
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,760
 And she has to tell this whole story. Maybe that was part of it. Maybe the story would take so long

242
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:09,040
 to be like, "You're Irish up, buddy. Time to go." But anyways, that's disgusting, right? Let's say that

243
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:17,360
 it's true. Let's say that it's true. You're basically using a murdered woman's ghost as your sex slave

244
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:24,960
 in a doll that's forced to watch. The eyes are always open, right? And now for just 24 bucks,

245
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:31,360
 you can buy this and put it in your room to make your sex better. But that isn't even the weirdest

246
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:40,240
 one I found, because then we go to haunted doll, miracle spirit vessel, sexual aggressive. The

247
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,080
 grammar, guys. The grammar is really bad, but I guess I'm not going to nitpick that. This one's

248
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:51,360
 only $10.50, so if you didn't have those 24 bucks to spend, but this one gets a little more complicated,

249
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:58,480
 because this one is actually from West Virginia. Let me read you this description here. "The spirit

250
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:05,440
 is to believe that of an 18-year-old girl named Miracle. Though it was never proven, many believe

251
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:12,320
 Miracle was strangled and killed by her stepfather to keep his horrible secret of sexual abuse hidden,

252
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,840
 not laughing at that. I'm laughing at whoever thought that was a good marketing gimmick.

253
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:24,080
 Who goes, "Hmm, I have this doll. I want to sell it." But who's going to pay $10.50 for this doll?

254
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:30,880
 I know. Total lunatics. Like, why? You're making it up. You're making it up, and you even admit in

255
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,560
 the beginning, "I don't know if this story's true or not. I don't know. You don't have to. Come on.

256
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:41,440
 That's gross." The Jack the River victims are just shaking their heads right now.

257
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:47,920
 That's what you make up. That's seriously what you make up to sell your doll for $10.50. You make

258
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:53,920
 up this horrible story. Anyways, so then we go on. It turns out that she's murdered by her stepfather

259
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,680
 in this house. Her body is put in the crawl space. None of this is true, by the way. I mean, this is

260
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:03,360
 just what she's saying. Don't try looking up West Virginia news. But anyways, so apparently according

261
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,640
 to this story, she's murdered by her stepfather. Her body is hidden in the crawl space up in the

262
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:14,320
 attic or something like that. And then a fraternity moves in and then they find the body. They're like

263
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:20,240
 "Toga! Toga!" No, actually, I think the body is found earlier. I think that's found before the

264
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,840
 fraternity shows up. But the body's found. The fraternity shows up and they find the doll.

265
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:31,120
 They find this doll and they say that it's super weird because of this fraternity.

266
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,320
 Now, the fraternity reports, again, this made up, but the eBay says the fraternity members would

267
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,840
 wake up. They'd have scratches all over them in the middle of the night. Sometimes they'd wake up

268
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,480
 and there'd be a strange woman sitting on top of them. That's not paranormal activity. That's

269
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,160
 just what happens with a bunch of drunk dudes, right? They're like jumping into bushes. They're

270
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:53,040
 wrestling with each other, biting each other's butts. And then they wake up and they're like "What?

271
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:57,440
 I don't remember any of that stuff. This is being drunk. This is being an alcoholic 20-year-old,

272
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,360
 right? What? Oh, how did I get all these abrasions on my body?" They're like "Dude, you attacked that

273
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,920
 comp last night. Oh yeah, totally. There's a doll sitting in the corner. Can't blame it on the doll."

274
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:13,360
 They said that with the fraternity. They thought the basement was haunted so they never wanted to

275
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:19,200
 do their laundry. "Show me a dude who loves to do laundry." That's my new excuse for any chore I

276
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,520
 don't want to do. Uh, that's haunted. I don't even know what it is, but I don't want to do it.

277
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,360
 It's super haunted over there. There's like a bunch of ghosts standing there. I'm not doing it.

278
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,800
 So anyways, you can buy this doll that was previously in a frat house that was possessed by

279
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:37,840
 this horrible crime and apparently caused the fraternity people to get all scratched up. You

280
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,560
 want- you want to wake up with scratches all over your body? You can buy this doll. It's only $10.50.

281
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:48,480
 You don't want to ever do the laundry again. You can buy it for $10.50. We got one more doll to look

282
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,840
 at because you go "Okay, Jason. Okay." None of those dolls are interested to me. None of those

283
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,880
 dolls are interesting to me. I want a doll who's capable of committing a felony. Well, here you go.

284
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:06,160
 Here you go, guys. You can- for $32, you can buy Mandy. Mandy the doll. The haunted doll.

285
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:10,960
 Here's this one. This one is referred to as a street girl and that's how she's actually referred

286
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,480
 to, but she's a sex worker. She's murdered in the apartment. A couple moves in. The guy will wake

287
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,560
 up at night when his wife's out of town. He'll feel like someone laying next to him. He'll get a

288
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:25,520
 little back massage. He'll feel like hands on his legs and stuff like that. He's getting a little

289
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,560
 bit of attention. That's kind of cool, right? She's not totally nuts. She's not scratching you. She's

290
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:35,600
 not biting you. She's just hanging out, giving you a back rub. The perfect girlfriend, some might say.

291
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,760
 You don't have to listen to her. You don't have to listen to anything she says. She just kind of

292
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,440
 floats there and then when you go to bed, she appears and then when you wake up in the morning,

293
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:49,680
 she's just gone for the rest of the day. "That's a me. I'm going to buy this one." But, sorry Veronica,

294
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:54,640
 but here's the trick. The woman will show back up, right? And the guy's like "Dang it." The guy's

295
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,360
 like "Oh man, that ghost gives such good back rub." The woman would show back up and she would feel

296
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,600
 uncomfortable. She would feel like she wasn't welcoming her own home to the point that one day

297
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,480
 she was walking down the stairs and she tumbles down the stairs. She falls down the stairs.

298
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,480
 She feels herself get pushed. Now, whether it was a little doll hands pushing her,

299
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,960
 which really wouldn't do much, right? Or if it was the forceful push of a ghost, we don't know,

300
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,000
 probably the second one, because she actually did tumble down the stairs. She thinks that the ghost

301
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,720
 is haunted with a malevolent spirit and eBay also, not eBay, eBay knows this is all phony, but

302
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:32,800
 the seller of this says "Oh no, no, no, this one, this is the actual quote. We do not believe this

303
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:39,680
 spirit is friendly to females. I'm going to be very jealous of them." So, if you want to arrange an

304
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:47,440
 accident for somebody for $32, talk about an efficient hitman, right? There'd be no evidence.

305
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,200
 I'm not condoning this. Again, it's made up. So, you could buy 100 of these dolls. It's not going

306
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,600
 to do anything. It's not going to do anything, but let's say it actually did work. What they're

307
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,760
 basically selling is a loaded gun that can never be traced. I wonder if actually now that I think

308
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,200
 about that, I wonder if you could sneak one of these onto an airplane. Like, you can't bring

309
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,560
 box cutters. You can't bring any sort of knives and stuff like that, but if you brought a haunted doll

310
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:13,440
 onto an airplane, could they stop you? Now, they're going to assume it's a regular doll. They're also

311
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,480
 going to assume you're a big old weirdo because you're an adult and you're carrying a doll around,

312
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,400
 but I wonder if you could bring a haunted doll onto an airplane and just like

313
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:27,360
 set it, you buy it by a seat, right? And then it just sits there and then like it's like running

314
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,320
 around. I guess they would know something was up when the doll was running up the aisles. I think

315
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,480
 at that point the air marshall would just shoot it. Like, I don't think the air marshall, I think

316
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,000
 at that point security's going to go, "I want to start checking dolls. We might want to start

317
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,800
 having them. Little dolls go through a scanner for ectoplasm. Little x-ray, little cartoon ghost

318
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:52,560
 and doll." Don't do that actually by the way. Do not try sneaking a doll onto a plane. To be fair,

319
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:57,120
 let's put on our conspiracy caps to wrap up this episode. What makes these things spooky

320
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,760
 is really how mundane they are. They're just normal looking dolls, right? You could have,

321
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,320
 you could have tons of these sitting at Goodwill's. You could go to your aunt's house and on her shelf

322
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:11,200
 she has this collection of dolls that she's bought and sold over eBay and these are dolls.

323
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,080
 These dolls were identified as being haunted because they have providence. Again, none of this

324
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:22,240
 is true, but just for the sake of wrapping up this episode, let's put on our conspiracy cap.

325
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,280
 These dolls have a story connected to them. You can't verify it, but they have a story

326
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:33,440
 connected to them. But how many dolls out there were in the clutches of a woman as she was being

327
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,800
 brutally murdered by Jack the Ripper or any other serial killer or just regular killer?

328
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,440
 I can't believe I can't believe I'm wrapping the episode up with this, but we got into it somehow

329
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,320
 and I just have no idea where they ended. It's so brutal. So anyways, these dolls though,

330
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:53,280
 after the body is processed and taken out of the crime scene, everything that this woman owned is

331
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:58,720
 just there in an empty apartment for a day and a night and a day and a night and the sun rises

332
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:05,280
 and sets and that doll is just leaning there against the wall. Nobody else knows it's infused

333
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:09,040
 with her energy. No one else knows that that was the doll she grew up with. It was something she

334
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:17,360
 always held on to to remind her of a more peaceful, stable life. But as her life did descend into

335
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:23,760
 bitterness and hopelessness, that doll was still that beacon of light. So when she was brutally

336
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:31,200
 murdered in her one bedroom apartment, that's where her soul reached out to. But see, that doll

337
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,480
 wasn't given a providence. That doll doesn't have any sort of story connecting it. It was just

338
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:42,160
 picked up by the landlord and dropped off at Goodwill. So that doll goes through Goodwill,

339
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:47,600
 gets purchased, gets played with, gets sold to someone else, and it just kind of moves throughout

340
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:53,680
 the region. Now maybe you buy it, maybe you see this doll on eBay that just is like, oh, I remember

341
00:30:53,680 --> 00:31:01,040
 growing up with a doll like that. Maybe your aunt buys it at a swap meet. It's a normal looking doll,

342
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:11,360
 but behind its dead eyes is a life. The life of a woman who never had a chance at happiness.

343
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:22,960
 Her soul sits behind those wide open eyes that porcelain head attached to a cloth body,

344
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:29,120
 and it just sits there and looks, looks out of the display case into the empty room in front of her.

345
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:36,800
 She wants so badly to live again. That energy just builds more and more and more.

346
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:42,880
 Some people might see that as sexual energy, but what is sexual energy other than life energy?

347
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,800
 It's one of the main reasons why we're here is to procreate. While these dolls may be creating

348
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:56,480
 some sort of intense sexual energy, what it's actually doing is creating so much sexual intensity

349
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:05,120
 that it's able to drain it off. You think it's a supernova, but it's really a black hole.

350
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:13,280
 So while this doll is sitting in this display case, it infuses the room with sexual energy.

351
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:19,520
 You may key onto the fact, you may not, if it's at your aunt's house, you probably won't

352
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,720
 put two and two together unless you're having sex at your aunt's house, but you understand what

353
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,520
 I'm saying. Maybe your aunt has having a lot of sex. My point is, is that this wouldn't exist in a

354
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:33,440
 vacuum. Something that could give off and create intense sexual energy would be doing it for its

355
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:40,480
 own benefit. And if you had this doll long enough and it kept draining and draining and draining,

356
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:46,880
 it's building up its own reservoir. And then one day you wake up completely refreshed. You've never

357
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,640
 had such a great sleep in your night. It's almost like you've slept for decades. And you get up

358
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:59,680
 you go in the mirror, check yourself out, go off into the world, or at least your body does.

359
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:08,160
 Because you are now behind those dead eyes. The spirit of the young woman finally gathered

360
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:14,160
 enough energy from you that she could pull itself from the false body into your body of flesh and

361
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:21,200
 blood. You are now the doll. You are now trapped. If these things are real, they are nothing to

362
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:28,160
 mess around with. If these things are actually real, it is the last thing you would want to have in

363
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:36,480
 your house. Because whatever energy it could give, it could take back. Until eventually, it takes

364
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:44,240
 everything from you. DeadRabberRadio@gmail.com is going to be your email address. You can also
