1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
 So I've actually decided to break this episode into two parts.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,720
 So we are doing my health issues first.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,900
 And then for those of you who just really don't care about that

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,960
 or new listeners of the show, they're like,

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,120
 "I don't care if this guy's sick or not."

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,480
 You can go ahead and skip that and jump right to part two.

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,480
 This is part one of episode 333, Halfway to Hell episode.

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,120
 And we're gonna be talking about some crazy ghost stories

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,360
 that have come across, but we're breaking it up into two parts.

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,360
 So part one's gonna be me talking about

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,000
 what happened yesterday with my health.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,960
 Part two is where we talk about a bunch of ghosts.

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,660
 So if you just wanna get to the ghost stuff,

14
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,440
 jump to part two and the episode starts now.

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,020
 (upbeat music)

16
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:49,080
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of

17
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,160
 Dead Rabbit Radio.

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,360
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,560
 I'm having a great day.

20
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,040
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

21
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,800
 My voice is a little hoarse, so I apologize for that.

22
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,680
 And if you're a new listener,

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,600
 the next five minutes will probably be kind of boring.

24
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,720
 But for the existing listeners,

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,440
 let me guys tell you what happened.

26
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,640
 'Cause there's been a lot of questions

27
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,040
 about what happened to me yesterday, a lot of theories.

28
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,020
 I was shopping, my heart rate was super high,

29
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,360
 not because of the great deals at Walmart,

30
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,560
 but because of something else.

31
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,520
 I could feel my chest was flip-flopping.

32
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,200
 Now, I've talked about before I have anxiety attacks,

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,960
 and most of the time my anxiety attacks

34
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,680
 present themselves as heart attacks.

35
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,280
 So I tried calming down, but something really fell off.

36
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,240
 Like I could physically feel, I put my hand in my chest,

37
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,280
 I could physically feel my heart starting and stopping.

38
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,680
 So I go to the pharmacist, and this is a tip too.

39
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,680
 If you guys are ever sick with something,

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,960
 you can go to the pharmacist at like a Walmart

41
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,660
 or a Rite Aid or something like that,

42
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,240
 and they'll be more than willing to dispense advice to you.

43
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,440
 They can't necessarily give you a lot of medical advice,

44
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,480
 but they, she was able to feel my pulse and she goes,

45
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,680
 it does feel irregular.

46
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,960
 So I use their little blood pressure machine they have there.

47
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,120
 I had a pulse of 120, so I was like,

48
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,480
 okay, I'm gonna go to the hospital.

49
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,640
 So one of my friends takes me to the hospital from Walmart,

50
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,520
 and I go up there and I get down on the bed,

51
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,920
 the little bed thing, and I'm like, yeah,

52
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,760
 my heart feels weird, and they're like checking my pulse,

53
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,760
 and they're like, yeah, okay, so let's get you into the room.

54
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,920
 And they start hooking me up to machine,

55
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,080
 and I look over at it, and I go, that's not,

56
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,160
 my pulse really is in 170, right?

57
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,440
 And the nurse looks over, she's like,

58
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,720
 oh no, no, no, that's your pulse.

59
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,960
 And right when she said that,

60
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,160
 my pulse jumped up to 200, 'cause I was like, uh-oh.

61
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,040
 And I go, guys, should I be concerned

62
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,240
 about what's going on right now?

63
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,520
 And they said, listen, we're not in a hurry.

64
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,680
 This is a pretty common thing.

65
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,320
 We think you're an AFib, which is like,

66
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,640
 AFibulation, they could pronounce it, I can't.

67
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,480
 But we think you're an AFib,

68
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,120
 this is something that happens to people.

69
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,720
 We gotta find out why.

70
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,680
 It normally happens in older people.

71
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,760
 So anyways, long story short,

72
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,880
 they did all this blood work,

73
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,880
 they took X-rays, I watched World's Funniest Weather Videos.

74
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,760
 It's an actual show on the Weather Channel

75
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,440
 where it's bloopers of newscasters.

76
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,560
 That's a show you would only watch

77
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,960
 while you're trapped in a hospital.

78
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,200
 At no other point in time would you watch

79
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,280
 World's Funniest Weather Videos.

80
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,680
 So I watched that, I've watched the whole thing,

81
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,080
 and then I was flipping through the channel,

82
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,520
 and I watched probably the fur,

83
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,240
 I was there for five and a half hours at the hospital.

84
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,040
 I watched maybe the first hour of the fate of the furious,

85
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,440
 and I was laughing out loud.

86
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,480
 Mind you, I'm in an emergency room.

87
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,720
 People, they're like grieving families nearby.

88
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,600
 There's woman moaning to the laugh,

89
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,760
 she's like, "Ugh!"

90
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,440
 And I'm like, "Ha ha ha, laughing so hard."

91
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,520
 Every time something ridiculous happened,

92
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,240
 I had never seen fate of the furious before.

93
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,780
 Watch the first hour of that.

94
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,040
 This is what you guys been waiting for.

95
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,800
 This is what you guys been waiting for.

96
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,480
 The diagnosis.

97
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,840
 So when I go in, I said, "Listen,

98
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,160
 here's the things that I've done recently to mess up.

99
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,640
 I've been doing keto."

100
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,920
 Now I don't consider that a mess up,

101
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,080
 but I know there could be some health risks to that.

102
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,400
 I'm doing keto and the doctor's like, "Okay."

103
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,100
 And I go, I was, previously to this,

104
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,120
 I was testing out weights at Walmart.

105
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,640
 I was picking up weights and throwing punches with them,

106
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,920
 so I might have pulled something

107
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,240
 and put some pressure on the heart.

108
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,600
 She's like, "Uh, okay, Rocky, don't do that."

109
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,440
 And I was like, "Yeah, I know, it's bad form."

110
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,960
 'Cause recently, as I've been walking,

111
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,080
 I've had these little hand weights

112
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,320
 and I'll be throwing punches on them, walking through town.

113
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,800
 And I wanted to see about getting some heavier weights.

114
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,440
 She's like, "Okay, yeah, but don't do that anymore."

115
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,240
 And I was like, "Yeah, done and done."

116
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,520
 And I said, "I did have a lot of caffeine lately."

117
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,480
 And she goes, "How much?"

118
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,920
 And I go, "Well, in the past 24 hours,

119
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,160
 I had like a large coffee from Dog River.

120
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,600
 That's where I do all my research."

121
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,160
 I said, "I've probably had about four or five diet pepsis."

122
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,240
 And she's like, "Mmm."

123
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,520
 And then I said,

124
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,940
 and I think I've told you guys about this before.

125
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,240
 I said, "You know, recently I gave up,

126
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,240
 I was chewing tobacco for 15 years.

127
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,160
 I switched that out with the Lawsonge,

128
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,680
 but I think the Lawsonge had too much sugar in it

129
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,760
 for my keto, so I dropped the Lawsonge.

130
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,020
 And then I switched to a chewing tobacco alternative.

131
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,640
 There are little pouches full of coffee."

132
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,640
 And she's like, "What?"

133
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,080
 Wait, she goes, "Really, that's a thing?"

134
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,520
 And I was like, "Yeah, a little pouch of coffee."

135
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,040
 But each pouch only has one third of a cup of coffee in it.

136
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,120
 So I figured it's not too bad, right?

137
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,920
 And she goes, "How many have you had

138
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,840
 in the past 24 hours?"

139
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,160
 I was like, I don't know, maybe like 12 or something like that?

140
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,920
 And she goes, "Do you have them on you now?"

141
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,760
 And she's like, "Yeah."

142
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,840
 I was like, "Yeah, yeah."

143
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,840
 And she's looking at them and she goes, "Here's the thing.

144
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,240
 These might only have one third of a cup of coffee in them,

145
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,200
 but you're putting them directly into your bloodstream.

146
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,580
 You're not digesting it as coffee."

147
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,920
 So she goes, "Listen, we did your blood work.

148
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,040
 I asked, I go, could the keto have caused this?"

149
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,080
 And she said, "Most likely not."

150
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,360
 She goes, "We did your blood work

151
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,160
 and came back totally fine.

152
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,560
 So I don't have any cholesterol issues."

153
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,320
 She goes, "Your blood pressure is fine."

154
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,920
 She goes, "This whole event caused no stress

155
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,400
 on your heart or your lungs.

156
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,920
 You had no major complications from this."

157
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,080
 The doctor says, and she put it in the paperwork,

158
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,600
 "I'm almost for sure this was caused

159
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,760
 by a caffeine incident, i.e. overdoses, my word."

160
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,320
 She didn't use the term caffeine overdose,

161
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,240
 but she says, "This most likely was caused by the caffeine.

162
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,160
 If you stay away from caffeine."

163
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,840
 And she goes, "Don't take the pouches anymore."

164
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,640
 And I was like, "Yep, done."

165
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,880
 So she goes, "That's probably what caused it."

166
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,280
 So a lot of people have, these were the,

167
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,320
 sorry this is going so long for new listeners,

168
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,000
 but I wanted to clear the air,

169
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,760
 so there's nothing going on.

170
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,920
 A lot of people thought it was the turmeric,

171
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,160
 which is funny because just two days

172
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,840
 or three days before, I thought,

173
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,840
 I'm gonna stop messing around with the turmeric

174
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,840
 because it's obviously having some sort of bad reaction.

175
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,960
 That's not what should happen when you take turmeric.

176
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,160
 So I actually had stopped that, like on Thursday.

177
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,960
 I was like, "I'm not gonna mess with it anymore."

178
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,320
 Some people, and that's a rational thing.

179
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,560
 Jason, you're taking a pill,

180
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,240
 you're taking a pill in the form it's not created for

181
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,280
 and you're telling people, making you sleepy.

182
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,160
 Wasn't that though, I'd stop doing that.

183
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,280
 They, some people thought it was Veronica the haunted doll.

184
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,320
 It was not the Veronica the haunted doll,

185
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,640
 I can assure you of that.

186
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,960
 Right, Veronica?

187
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,200
 Yeah, no, she's just been chilling over there

188
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:15,200
 with my pig, stuffed pig and puppy dolls.

189
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,400
 She's totally fine, it wasn't Veronica.

190
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,520
 And then what was the other,

191
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,960
 oh, other people thought it was because I was dieting

192
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,200
 or it was the keto itself.

193
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,920
 So it wasn't any of those things.

194
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,920
 Well, Veronica put a little asterisk maybe,

195
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,160
 but most likely not.

196
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,480
 It's most likely the caffeine.

197
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,800
 So they said, "No more chewing,

198
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,360
 "no more putting coffee in your mouth for hours on end."

199
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,960
 'Cause I would take one out, put another one in,

200
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,320
 just like I used to do chewing in a becca.

201
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,880
 And they said you can maybe have one to two caffeinated,

202
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,520
 for right now don't have any caffeinated beverages

203
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,360
 if you can help it.

204
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,800
 And I haven't had any sense.

205
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,280
 And they said, "In the future,

206
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,680
 "limit yourself to one to two caffeinated beverages a day."

207
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,600
 Also don't drink.

208
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,920
 And I don't drink anyways,

209
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,880
 but they said if you drink,

210
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,960
 they could cause it again.

211
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,280
 They said this is very common.

212
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,840
 And they said it's super treatable.

213
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,680
 Doesn't really cause,

214
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,320
 it can cause health problems down the road.

215
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,600
 So I don't want you guys,

216
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,160
 I first off, I'm in the hospital cracking up

217
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,400
 but all the comments people are leaving me.

218
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,760
 So I really appreciate all the comments,

219
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,000
 all the support, all the love I've gotten from you guys.

220
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,400
 I really, really appreciate that.

221
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,040
 Secondly, don't worry about me

222
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,200
 because this was a one-off, most likely,

223
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,120
 I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow

224
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,200
 and I'll probably have to see a cardiologist after that.

225
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,760
 But this was most likely a one-off event brought

226
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,760
 by a rolling 24 hour period of massive caffeine use.

227
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,400
 So don't worry about me.

228
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,840
 But I really appreciate the support

229
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,040
 and I really appreciate that you guys let me rant on

230
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,160
 about that for eight minutes.

231
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,760
 Now, that being said,

232
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,840
 I did say that I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow

233
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,640
 and I'm on a medicine right,

234
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,160
 I apologize for taking so long,

235
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,400
 but this now I'm,

236
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,960
 this is saying what's going forward.

237
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,360
 I'm on a medication,

238
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,840
 they did put me on beta blockers,

239
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,480
 which actually limits how fast my heart can beat

240
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,040
 because when I left the hospital, I was still in AFIP.

241
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,360
 I was still having,

242
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,160
 you know what, I might actually break this

243
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,520
 up into two episodes.

244
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,320
 I might have this episode just be the health episode

245
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,480
 and then I'll release a ghost episode after that,

246
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,320
 but we're gonna split it,

247
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,400
 so we'll figure that.

248
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,680
 So you don't have to listen to all this stuff

249
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,680
 if you just wanna hear about ghosts.

250
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,120
 The, so, but where was I going with that?

251
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,760
 Oh yeah, yeah, so when I left the hospital,

252
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,760
 my heart was still out of rhythm.

253
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,080
 So as far as I,

254
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,120
 it doesn't feel like it's out of rhythm right now,

255
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,720
 but as far as I know, it's still out of rhythm.

256
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,440
 So this, we're gonna do,

257
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,840
 I'm gonna do this episode today.

258
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,720
 I will not have an episode come out

259
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,960
 I feel really bad about this,

260
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,000
 but I will not have an episode come out tomorrow

261
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,400
 because I gotta go to the doctor

262
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,120
 and I'm feeling really, really tired.

263
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,160
 So that's where we're at right now.

264
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,920
 So we have today's episode,

265
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,240
 we won't have an episode tomorrow,

266
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,640
 we should have an episode for the next two days of the week.

267
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,680
 So I apologize for that,

268
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,600
 but I have to take these beta blockers in the morning

269
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,800
 and at night and I'm gonna take one two nights

270
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,760
 and then I'm gonna just go to sleep

271
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,880
 all the way to the morning,

272
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,520
 which is what humans normally do.

273
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,400
 And then, oh, wake up, that's the next step.

274
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,880
 Wake up and then do, go to the doctor's appointment.

275
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,120
 I'm not gonna worry about busting an episode out

276
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,680
 quickly in the morning and all that stuff.

277
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,960
 So I apologize for that,

278
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,760
 but I'm healthy, everything going for,

279
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,120
 supposedly healthy, most likely caffeine,

280
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,040
 everything else going forward, we're gonna be good.

281
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,120
 Let's go ahead and actually get started

282
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,440
 with the episode though.

283
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,880
 Let's go ahead and get started with the episode.

284
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,680
 So thank you for your patience.

285
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,200
 I'm sure a lot of you skipped past that,

286
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,000
 but I don't care, that's totally fine.

287
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,560
 Give me the ghost is what you're saying, give me the ghost.

288
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,400
 So.
