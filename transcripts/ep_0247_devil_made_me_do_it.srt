1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 What happens when you mix teenagers, millions of dollars, and a loaded handgun?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 And then we take a look at the story of a man who stabbed another man.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Now, the victim was drunk, the victim was harassing a 9 year old girl, and the victim was acting by all accounts extremely agitated.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Normally it would be a clear cut case of self-defense.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 But when Ed and Lorraine Warren find out about the crime, all bets are off.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 [Music]

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. Hope you guys are having a great weekend.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Or had a great weekend.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Although I guess if you live in a tight different time zone the weekend may still be going on, I don't know.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Or maybe it's already over.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Anyways, the point is, whatever you're in, whatever time or place or space you're in, dimension, whatever, hope you guys are having a great time.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 I'm gonna start this episode off. I haven't done a Dead Rabbit Recommend in a long time.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 This is gonna be really, really short. I just watched this movie last night.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 I don't know what year it came out. I think it's fairly recent. It's called Head Count.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 And for people who like creepy pasta, for people who like creepy short stories online, there's been a particular flood of a time.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 There's been a flood of a particular creature called a skinwalker.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 I know it has different types of names, but it's known to be a shape-shifting creature who like slowly learns.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Like let's say you go to a party with eight people and it can kind of affect your brain.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 So eventually there's nine people there and no one can ever remember who the ninth person is.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Like they go, "No, no, no. That ninth person left the house. We came all the way up here with nine people."

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 And the person will always be like, "No, I know there's only eight. The movie headcount is that.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 The movie headcount is this creature is summoned to this area.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 And it's done a little bit differently where there's ten people at the party and the monster isn't fully human.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 So it doesn't act human. Basically like it can assume human shape and it will stand in the corner of the room

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 or do something weird with its hand as it's like learning how to interact with humans.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 In the background you see the actual human like playing beer pong,

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 but we're in the living room with this group of people and this creatures like playing a card game.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 And it's, originally I wasn't going to recommend it because the ending was kind of cheesy,

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 but actually it's been about 24 hours since I've seen it and it stuck with me.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 And I actually watched a movie after it and headcount had me so wound up

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 that I was watching this documentary called Kid Icarus, which is another good movie.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 It's about a young filmmaker making his first short film. That's a really good movie too.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 But as I was watching this documentary, I was looking in the background at other people.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 So headcount is a really intense movie. I really recommend it.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 If you're a fan of the skinwalker mythos, I would check it out.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 If you're a fan of good contained horror movies, I would check it out.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 It has some great visuals. It's creepy. It's not super scary, but it's a good flick.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 I would definitely recommend checking out headcount.

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 So that's my beginning. That's my did or ever recommend.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Let's go ahead and get started here with this episode.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 So this story actually just happened. This story happened on June 6th.

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 We're in Anchorage, Alaska. And let me say this is all alleged.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 This is 100% alleged because it's such a recent thing.

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Actually have written in my notes, "All alleged" in all caps.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 So I don't keep saying, "That person sure is guilty.

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Hey, better go to the electric chair."

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 So we're in Anchorage, Alaska. There's six teenagers in total.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 We have Denali. We have Cynthia. We have Caden, Caleb, and then two other juveniles

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 who are too young to be named by the law.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Denali and Cynthia are really good friends and they'd say, "Let's all go hike.

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Let's all go on a hike together."

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Everyone's like, "Yay, let's go on this hike through Anchorage, Alaska."

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 I don't think they wanted to walk the Pacific mile or whatever.

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 They weren't going on this grand hike. They were just going up into the wilderness for a day.

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Probably not even the wilderness, probably just the outskirts of town.

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 So they're on this hike and they're just walking along.

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Now there's six people on this trip, but one of them doesn't know the real purpose of the trip.

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 At a certain point along the way, Denali pulls out a handgun.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 And she orders the other four to tie up Cynthia.

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Cynthia Hoffman was 19 years old. See where this is going.

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 And after Cynthia Hoffman is completely bound up,

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Denali, who's only 18, pulls out a video camera and then shoots Cynthia in the back of the head.

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Allegedly, allegedly. This is all alleged.

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Dump her body into the river.

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Now, it's really hard to get away with a crime of somebody you know.

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 It's really, really hard to kill somebody that you know.

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 If you're going to do it, don't do it, but if you do it randomly, it's a lot harder for them to catch you.

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 But if, you know, six people go on a hike and five come back, it doesn't take much to go,

72
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 "Hey, where's Cynthia?" And they're like, "Oh, we don't know who? Who are you talking about?

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 I don't know who you're talking about. That obviously won't fly."

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 And it didn't fly for them.

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 The cops begin looking for Cynthia because she's reported missing.

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 They find her in the river where they dumped her body, just floating around.

77
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 And they very, very quickly started arresting these teenagers.

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 So the first question you're going to ask is, "Why would you kill your friend?"

79
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 And Denali, allegedly, allegedly, this is what's come out.

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Denali met a man online named Tyler.

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 This gets creepy.

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Denali met a man online named Tyler, who's a millionaire.

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 And he began talking to Denali and he goes, "I'm a millionaire and I will pay you for some footage."

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 And Denali's like, "Okay, well, what footage do you want?" And he goes, "I want some child porn."

85
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 So first off, this guy online is asking her to start producing some child porn for him.

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 And she does that.

87
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 She produces two videos where she's molesting younger people.

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 And then he goes, "Oh, that's all well and good. But what I really want is I want to see a video of you killing somebody.

89
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 I'll pay you $9 million for that footage."

90
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 So at this point, allegedly, Denali's eyes popped out with little dollar signs on them.

91
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 And her tongue's like, "You know, like, I'm trying to make this part as light-hearted as possible."

92
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 It's involving some pretty heavy subjects anyway.

93
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 So Denali turns into a cartoon character and her eyes are like, "Ching!"

94
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 And she hatches this plan and she tells these four other kids, "If you help me kill Cynthia, I will give you part of my $9 million."

95
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Now, obviously, I think you know where this is going.

96
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 So she gets caught, her friends get caught, they go, she starts telling them about Tyler.

97
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 They look on the computer, they find the child porn she made.

98
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 The police find Tyler. And his name's not Tyler.

99
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 His name is Darren Schillmiller. Darren Schillmiller. Only 21.

100
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 So here we have this range of people from 21 to probably about, we don't know how young the youngest people are involved,

101
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 but we have Denali's 18, Caden and Caleb are probably around the same age, and then two other juveniles.

102
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 So we're going to say probably like 15, because I think they can start naming them around 16 or something like that.

103
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 But, and Darren's 21. And they're all in jail now. Darren's getting ready to be extradited to Alaska for this trial.

104
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 They're both facing life for not only, Denali's facing life for the murder and the production,

105
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 I think 20 years for the production of child pornography.

106
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 And I don't know what Darren's being charged with, but he'll definitely be charged with the child porn charges,

107
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 and they may charge him as an accessory before the fact of a murder or whatever.

108
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 But I remember reading that article on the thing, and what a bizarre, like, it's almost just a comedy of errors.

109
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 The internet has allowed us to access people all over the globe, but it's also allowed idiots to access other idiots,

110
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 and cause like a foolish tsunami. Like Darren in his own hometown wouldn't have been able to convince somebody to do this.

111
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 And Denali wouldn't have been tricked by anyone in her hometown either, that they would pay her $9 million to murder somebody.

112
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 Obviously both these people are extremely broken in some way.

113
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 One, to want to watch that video footage and entice, and willingly lead someone down the path, entice them to murder.

114
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 And the other person, it probably didn't, allegedly, take much for her.

115
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Like if someone came up to me and says, "I'll give you $9 million if you show video of you killing someone,"

116
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 I'll be like, "No. That trade-off's not good enough for me."

117
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 But, you know, these people are facing life in prison, and there's video footage, and there's evidence, and all these other people.

118
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 It's just a weird story, and it's just one, again, another one of those ways that the internet seems more like a cursed object every single day.

119
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Allows me to do a podcast, but I don't know if that, actually, I don't think that trade-off's not worth it,

120
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 if it's going to allow effects like this to happen to affect people then, you know.

121
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Well, that's the end of that story. That was a great segue, Jason.

122
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 That's why you're such a genius podcaster, because you come up with those brilliant segues.

123
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story here.

124
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 Now, the next story is really interesting, and it's one of those stories that's interesting on a few different levels.

125
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 One, let me just go ahead and get into it. Okay.

126
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 The year is 1981, and we're in the town of Brookfield, Connecticut.

127
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 Brookfield, Connecticut, tiny little town, I don't know, it might be a normal size or a big town,

128
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 but it's a town in Connecticut, February 16, 1981, two days after Valentine's Day.

129
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 A lot of people had a lot of fun on Valentine's Day, but now their hearts are broken, and they're...

130
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 You know what, here's a tip. Here's a tip for you guys.

131
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Never buy the girl the giant teddy bear. Girls hate the giant teddy bear.

132
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Girls loathe the giant teddy bear.

133
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 The only people who ever buy girls giant teddy bear, and I'm talking like human-sized teddy bears,

134
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 teddy bears that you could cut the stuffing out of and wear as a super Halloween, those giant...

135
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 Women hate those. I think at some point every guy has purchased a girl a giant teddy bear,

136
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 because we see it in movies, but don't do it, because now they have...

137
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 Generally, the only people who do buy it are people that guy...

138
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 They usually get them from guys that they don't like.

139
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 And I'll admit, I made that mistake. I bought a giant teddy bear for a girl who was an enemy,

140
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 and now they have actually... Now let me say it again, that's actually a perfect gift to buy someone you don't like,

141
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 because what you're doing is you're gifting them 200 pounds of foam and fur that they don't know what to do with.

142
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 They don't want to throw it away because that seems rude, but they can't...

143
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 There's no place they can put it.

144
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 So if you don't like a girl, if you want to get back at a girl, buy her a giant teddy bear.

145
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 But don't, guys, do not buy girls giant teddy bears.

146
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 I actually don't buy girls anything. I very, very, very rarely buy flowers.

147
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 I don't even buy chocolates, none of that stuff.

148
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 I'll buy candies for friends. If I'm dating you, that's your gift.

149
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 That's a gift that keeps on giving.

150
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 If you can get away with it, don't buy them anything, but if you do have to buy them something, don't buy them a giant teddy bear.

151
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 That... That rant had nothing to do with anything else. It's just a rant.

152
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 February 16, 1981. We're introduced to Debbie.

153
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Debbie's sister, Wanda.

154
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Debbie's nine-year-old cousin, Mary, and Arne.

155
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 So we'll get into Arne.

156
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Well, okay, so Arne's a complicated fellow, but Debbie, Wanda, Mary, and Arne are all hanging out together on this day.

157
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Debbie works at a grooming clinic. They all go to her job.

158
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 Now Debbie's boss is named Alan, and Alan says,

159
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 "Hey, you know what? Let's go out to... Let's go out to a bar. Let's go get drinks."

160
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Now remember, this party includes a nine-year-old girl. There's so many weird details in the story.

161
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 100% true, though. At least this part is 100% true.

162
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 Alan goes, "Let's go out to a bar."

163
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 So after they all get sloshed and the nine-year-old girl's like, "Give me another milk."

164
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 And the bartender's like, "I'm done. You're calling it. You're 86."

165
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 And she's like, "Oh, she's fighting the bouncers."

166
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 And the nine-year-old girl, they go back to the grooming shop.

167
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 And while they're at the grooming shop, the girls say, "Let's go get pizza."

168
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 And I'm thinking, "Weren't they just at a bar?"

169
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Now if I was reading this on any other website than the websites I read it on,

170
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 which was like Wikipedia and then a website specifically about this criminal case,

171
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 I would think, "Are they just making stuff up?"

172
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 But no. This was all revealed in court.

173
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 So they go out to a bar, they get hammered, then they come back to the grooming shop,

174
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 and then the girls say, "Let's go get some pizza," which maybe it's the soak up the alcohol,

175
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 but still, like, why don't you just order stuff at the bar?

176
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Anyways, the girls go to get pizza.

177
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 And while they're there, they leave Arn with Alan.

178
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 And Debbie starts thinking, "You know what? That probably wasn't a good idea.

179
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Let's hurry up and eat this pizza."

180
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 And they get our drinks refilled and have a salad bar.

181
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 And maybe we'll order some Sundays.

182
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 But anyways, after a certain point, they do decide to leave the pizza parlor.

183
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 They got like 100 tickets. They're like looking for stuff to get.

184
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Debbie's like, "Oh, wait, I forgot. A horrible tragedy is coming up."

185
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 They leave the pizza parlor. They go back to the grooming shop.

186
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 And Alan is totally drunk. Six sheets to the wind. He's a louse.

187
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 "Bleh, I love you, man. I love you, Arn. I love you."

188
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 And he starts acting weird.

189
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Now, Arn is already a little agitated himself.

190
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 But when Alan grabs Mary, because the girls have come back now,

191
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 they're bringing a giant teddy bear that they won at the pizza parlor.

192
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 The little girl is walking around. Mary's walking around.

193
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Alan grabs the little girl and won't let her go.

194
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 He's totally drunk. He's now assaulting a little girl.

195
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Not violently, but still. I mean, you're grabbing someone.

196
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 They want to leave and you're not letting them go.

197
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 And Arn starts being like, "Let the girl go, man. Let the girl go."

198
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 And Alan's like, "Never, never let her go."

199
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 But eventually, Alan does let her go because he's like, "Ah, whatever. I'll just let her go."

200
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 At that point, they're still saying that Alan is very agitated,

201
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 but Arn starts growling and then barking like a dog,

202
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 pulls out a 5-centimeter blade, little pocket knife,

203
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 and begins stabbing Arn violently, eventually killing him.

204
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 Arn flees the scene of the crime. He's arrested by the police.

205
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 Now, you can imagine Arn sitting in a jail cell and telling that story to a defense lawyer.

206
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 And the defense lawyer goes, "Oh, this is going to be open and shut." It's self-defense.

207
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 I mean, you have a little girl who was being assaulted.

208
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 You had a guy who was drunk and being belligerent.

209
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 You had one of his employees, Debbie,

210
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 thought there was such a problem that she left the pizza parlor "early" to come back

211
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 because she thought it would be a problem.

212
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 We have him grabbing a 9-year-old girl and not letting her go until you guys beg for him to let him go,

213
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 and then he's just acting agitated.

214
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 And you have the knife in your pocket. It's not like you had to go home or go to home depot to buy one.

215
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Like, it was an instinctual act.

216
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 You acted in the defense of yourself and others around you.

217
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Who knows what he would have done if he hadn't done that.

218
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Open and shut case, self-defense were totally fine.

219
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 And then, just as Arn is about to agree that that's a great case, that's a great way,

220
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Ed and Lorraine Warren bust through the door and go, "The devil made him do it."

221
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Now, Ed and Lorraine Warren, quick overview if you don't know,

222
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 they're the ones that are featured in the Conjuring movies.

223
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 They are world-renowned psychic investigators.

224
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 They are world-famous for this type of stuff.

225
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 I think they investigated Amityville Horror.

226
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 She's the psychic investigator. She sees visions and she communicates with ghosts and she talked to Bigfoot.

227
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 We talked about that in an earlier episode.

228
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Ed Warren is basically the guy who drives her around.

229
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 He's basically like, she has all the mystical powers.

230
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 He's the dude who's basically like, "Ah, just get in the car, honey."

231
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 I like to think that Ed Warren was a total skeptic and didn't believe any of this stuff,

232
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 but his wife was hot and really good in bed, so he just humored her.

233
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Like, all good husbands do.

234
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 It's like when a woman's like, "Oh, I want to do scrapbooking."

235
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 And the husband's like, "That sounds like a great hobby, honey."

236
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 "You know it's a waste of time and money, but you're not going to tell her that."

237
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 And if she can make money scrapbooking, all the better.

238
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 So if your wife's like, "I can see ghosts. I can see the demons walking through the yard."

239
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 You'd just be like, "Oh yeah, honey, sure. It's perfect.

240
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 At least you're not scrapbooking."

241
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 So that is my version of the Warrens.

242
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Probably not that accurate, but he probably believed in all this malarkey as well.

243
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 But anyways, so how did they get involved in this case?

244
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 So in 1980, we're going to meet Debbie's son, David.

245
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 David and Debbie move into this house.

246
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 They're rented this new place.

247
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 And I got really confused about how Arne knew these people

248
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 because he just kind of seemed to pop in and out of the story, almost like an oracle character.

249
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 He just kind of showed up halfway through, but apparently he's her fiance, Debbie's fiance.

250
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 So David's stepdad. Whatever, soon to be stepdad.

251
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 So Debbie, Arne, and David get this rental property.

252
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 And this is so funny.

253
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 So David's there. He's kind of cleaning stuff up and he's like, "I don't want to clean up."

254
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 And then this old man approaches him, right?

255
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 This old man appears out of nowhere and begins like pushing David and like knocking him down.

256
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 David's like trying to stand up and this old man's like putting him down and be like,

257
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 "You gotta leave, kid. You gotta leave. Go away. Go away."

258
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 And David's like, "Oh man, get off of me, dude."

259
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 And he's pushing. Nobody sees this happen.

260
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 But David runs to his mom and says, "I don't want to live here.

261
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 I was just working cleaning up my room and an old man came into my room and started beating me up."

262
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 And Debbie and Arne's response is, "Quit making up stories.

263
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 We know you don't want to clean stuff up. Quit being lazy.

264
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Go back in that room where you may or may not have been assaulted by an old man and finished cleaning up."

265
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 Like they assume that he's just being lazy when the kid's like,

266
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 "Some stranger just came in and assaulted me."

267
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 So they totally don't pay attention to this kid, which I found absolute.

268
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 Talk about a soul crushing experience.

269
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 You're like, "Yeah, you don't want to do it, but you're like cleaning up your bedroom

270
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 and an old man climbs through the window and just totally just like beats you up."

271
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 And then you crawl out and you're like, "Mom, I got beat up."

272
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 And they're like, "Go to your room." That's so bizarre. They just totally brushed that off.

273
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 But they moved into the house and they started hearing creepy noises in the attic.

274
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 And David's like, "It's the old man. It's the old man in the attic. He wants us to leave."

275
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 And they're like, "Listen, we know you hate the place, but you don't have to be a jerk about it.

276
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 There's no old man." They're finding like, an oval teen all around the house.

277
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 They're finding dentures and he's like, "No, look at this is old man stuff."

278
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 So David starts having nightmares, which is a given.

279
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 He's being assaulted by a man no one else can see.

280
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 He starts acting weird. He starts barking.

281
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 And then after all of that stuff, finally what clues Debbie and Arne that something's going on,

282
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 he's appearing with scratch and bruises.

283
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 After all that other paranormal stuff, finally he comes home with a scratch.

284
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 And they're like, "It's a ghost!"

285
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 So they end up calling some priest to come and do an exorcism on the home.

286
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 And they also call up the Warrens.

287
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 Now the Warrens, I've talked a little bit about them earlier, but I want to take another note out.

288
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 They've been criticized for being like, looking for cash cows.

289
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 They've been criticized for looking for people with whom or from whom to make money.

290
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 I find it very suspicious that first you call up the priest in your area,

291
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 and then your second phone call is to the most famous psychic investigator and her husband at the time.

292
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 So there could have been some sort of financial thing in there. We'll get to that in a bit, but they call up the exorcists.

293
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 They call up Warren.

294
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 This has been only 12 days since the old man first appeared to David and started her like,

295
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 "rassling him in his bedroom."

296
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 Lorraine shows up and she goes, "Oh my God, I see something.

297
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 I see a black mist standing behind your son."

298
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 It's just kind of rolling his eyes. He's like, "Oh, again with the black mist."

299
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Nothing's ever original with you, Lorraine.

300
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 So she says there's an evil entity following the boy around.

301
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 And she said, this is again one of the stories that she's watching in her psychic mind,

302
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 i.e. her imagination.

303
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 She's seeing David get beaten up and then David's like, "Oh!"

304
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 And he takes his shirt off and he's covered in bruises.

305
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 And Lorraine's like, "That's weird. That's what I just imagined in my head, was you getting punched?"

306
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Then a bruise showing up.

307
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 So they basically are like, "Okay, we've got to do an exorcism on this kid."

308
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 For some reason they come to the conclusion he's possessed with 43 demons, 43 demons in this little boy.

309
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 And they're saying he's growling and he's hissing and he's reciting Bible verses.

310
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 And then passages from Paradise Lost.

311
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 I mean, there's no verification of any of that.

312
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 But anyway, so I was reading this one article and they go,

313
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 "How would an 11-year-old boy know about..."

314
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Did I say how old he was earlier?

315
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 "How would an 11-year-old boy know passages from Paradise Lost?"

316
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 And I thought, how would an adult know passages from Paradise Lost?

317
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Like, if someone could come up to me and start quoting Paradise Lost and I'd be like,

318
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 "What? What are you talking about?"

319
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 If someone could come up to me and go, "Truly, this was a Paradise Lost."

320
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 I'd be like, "What is that?"

321
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 Is that from an episode of Transformers? I don't get the reference.

322
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 Yes, an 11-year-old kid may not know a quote from Paradise Lost, but most humans wouldn't.

323
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 So I think it's a made-up detail.

324
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 I think that detail is just made up to make it more scary.

325
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 So Ed and Lorraine Warren and the local priests end up exercising the boy of these demons.

326
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 And then on their way out of town, basically, Lorraine calls up the police,

327
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 the local police, and say, "This might end badly."

328
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 So keep an eye on that family.

329
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 And the reason why she had her suspicions was,

330
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 "Tell me if this isn't the biggest bone-headed move ever."

331
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 Let's say that you believe-- I believe in demons and I believe in demonic possession and stuff.

332
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 Like, maybe this kid was possessed. I don't know.

333
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 He may have been possessed and some of the details are made up.

334
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Well, actually, we'll get to that at the end, because this story has a real interesting twist to the ending.

335
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 No, it's not that it was all a dream.

336
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 So she called it-- this is the dumbest thing possible.

337
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 So you're standing in a room where your stepson, your soon-to-be stepson, is possessed by demons.

338
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 43 of them. And he's like, "Aah! Paradise Lost Quote! Paradise Lost Quote! Blah!"

339
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 And Arne starts challenging the demons to a fight, being like, "Hey, knuckleheads, why don't you come and take on a real man?

340
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 You're tired of-- you can't fight someone your own size? Why don't you come over here? I'll give you a 1-2."

341
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 And Lorraine Warren's like looking at him like, "What are you-- this kid's floating five feet off the bed.

342
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 There's five priests here throwing holy water at him, and you're sitting there maldun off."

343
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 But he did. Arne was like, "Yeah, man, come on. Why don't you go? Let's go, bro. Let's go."

344
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 And he basically-- Lorraine Warren, she called up the police and said,

345
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 "Something bad might happen to this family, because we're doing this extra-system.

346
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 Arne was maldun off to the demons, and one of them may have left the boy and gone into Arne."

347
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Any-- I can just imagine the cop getting that phone call and just being like,

348
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 "Okay, ma'am, you have a nice day too." Click.

349
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 You'd be like, "Woo, woo, woo, what-- what world do you live in where you get phone calls like?"

350
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 I guess police probably do get crazy phone calls like that.

351
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 But he ends up saying, "Yes, I got possessed by a demon," and it was kind of in control of me,

352
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 but apparently there was a haunted well-- they ended up moving out of the rental property after all that,

353
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 but apparently there was also on this spooky, spooky rental property there was a spooky, spooky haunted well.

354
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 And he says he walked to the well one night all by himself after this extra-system,

355
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 and a demon rose out of the well and they looked eye to eye, and he goes,

356
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 "After that, I really don't remember much. Like, I was fully possessed after that point."

357
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 Which is a good way to get out of credit card debt, because then you could be like,

358
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 "Hey, I didn't buy all that stuff. I was demonically possessed."

359
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 And you think that's-- you think that's a stupid joke?

360
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 That's basically what happened, because after he kills Alan, the Warrens come back and they go,

361
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 devil made him do it. He was possessed by a demon, and he-- they go to the family.

362
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 They go to Debbie and this family, and they go, "Listen, we are going to prove in a court of law

363
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 that he is possessed by a demon. We're going to get these exorcists from Europe.

364
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 We're going to get all these hy-- We're going to subpoena the priest who were at the original exorcism

365
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 to say that he was doing this stuff. We're going to get all these experts from around the globe

366
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 to prove that the reason why he went out of control and stabbed that guy to death was he was possessed by a demon.

367
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 And you can imagine the family saying, "It would be much easier self-defense."

368
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 And Warren's like, "No, no, no, no. You're only looking at half the picture here."

369
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 Because when we prove that he was demonically possessed, not only will he be innocent,

370
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 not only will he not go to prison, book deals, movie deals, we'll have writers come out here.

371
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 I know this is not as big as the book deals and movie deals. I just ran out of stuff to list.

372
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 We will have cash coming in. This can be the next Amityville.

373
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 And Debbie goes, "You mean the next big hoax?" And the Warrens are like, "Wogah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,

374
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 We know that it was irrelative and unscientific, but you could not ever prove someone was possessed.

375
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Therefore, you can't use it as an argument in a court of law.

376
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 So then the defense lawyer goes, "Okay, self-defense. They have the trial, and there's a 15-hour deliberation.

377
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 He's found guilty." First degree manslaughter, he's sentenced to 10 to 20 years in prison,

378
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 but ends up only serving five in his back out. They did have a movie come out.

379
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 Tell me if this doesn't sound amazing. I need to find this movie. It's called The Demon Murder Case.

380
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 That's a pretty generic title, but it stars Kevin Bacon and Andy Griffith.

381
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 That's the original Conjuring. That's like the prequel to the Conjuring universe.

382
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 That sounds absolutely amazing. A book came out called The Devil in Connecticut.

383
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Big hit. Not like a super big hit, but you know, it was relatively big.

384
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 Family didn't get a ton of money for it, but they got some, and the Warrens got some money,

385
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 so it definitely was a money-making venture. A man lost his life, but that was almost,

386
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 that wasn't part of the plan. But what's an interesting twist to the end of the story?

387
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 In 2006, they reprinted the book The Devil in Connecticut, which makes sense,

388
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 because now all the Warren stuff is getting big again. I think that's around when the Amityville horror came out,

389
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 or the haunting of Connecticut and all that stuff is getting, horror movies are getting big again.

390
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 They reprinted the book The Devil in Connecticut. David, the boy who was originally possessed

391
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 by the 43 demons, and his brother came forward and said, "None of it was true. It's totally fake.

392
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 That book actually is libelous, and it's an infringement on our privacy."

393
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Because they were kids when this book was written, so they couldn't sign any contracts.

394
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 But now jump ahead, in 2006, their adults, they're working their professional lives,

395
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 and all of a sudden their buddies are like, "Hey, bro, heard you had 43 demons in you.

396
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 Like, they're sitting at the water cooler, and now they're being reminded of this made-up event that happened

397
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 20, 30 years earlier." So they sue. Now the family breaks in half, because Aaron is out of prison,

398
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 and he does interviews. He was on a Discovery Channel show talking about this particular case.

399
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 So he's out there talking about it. The boys, though, the young kids are like, "No, it was all fake."

400
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 The older people are like, "They just want their cut of the money, and they're not getting part of the hoax money."

401
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 I mean, the ghost money is what I meant to say. And eventually in 2016, it was settled out of court,

402
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 so we don't know how. They probably just gave the kids some money to shut them up.

403
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 So half the family says, "Totally fake. Never happened. It was a total cash cow.

404
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 We got ripped off by the Warrens. We were sold to bill of goods, and we went down this path, this legal path,

405
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 and it didn't work out." And the other half of the family, so you have David, the original possessee,

406
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 saying it was totally fake. And then you have Aaron, the guy who was challenging the demon of fight

407
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 and lost, saying it's real. Bizarre story. Totally bizarre story. Now you could say that the kid was too young

408
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 to really know what was going on, or that he was possessed. Maybe there's one more demon in him,

409
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 the demon of doubt and skepticism floating around in him. He turns to the camera and his eyes are like,

410
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 "Ahh." Not his eyes are laughing, but they like gleam. He's like, "Ehh, gotcha."

411
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 But it's most likely that it was a hoax, and even an 11-year-old boy realized that people were lying around him.

412
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 And you know, he probably was just like, "I'm just--maybe he made up--maybe he didn't want to clean up.

413
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 He made up the story about the old man, and then he just kept digging the hole deeper and deeper,

414
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 and then eventually he realized that his lies had already created a monster.

415
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 A monster of an old man that ended up resulting in the death of another man.

416
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 You--it's such a--I think the story's so interesting, because it's one of the stories that really blends the paranormal with the real world.

417
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 Was there really a demon of an old man running around this house, pushing kids, keeping them from doing their chores?

418
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 Which that sounds like a great Disney Channel movie. But was that really happening?

419
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 Did the kid make it up because he didn't want to do his chores, and then the story just got out of hand?

420
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 And right when he's here, they're like, "Hey, remember that whole thing with that demon jumping out of your body?"

421
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 And David's like playing Nintendo. He's like, "Oh yeah, that was a hilarious joke."

422
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 And they're like, "Yeah, I guess he went in an arn and he just stabbed a man to death, and then he just dropped the controller."

423
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 [imitates a demon]

424
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 If it was a hoax that got out--if it was a hoax that got out of hand and ended up with a man getting murdered,

425
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 because an other man thought he was possessed by a demon that came out of a haunted well,

426
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 if there was no old man ghost, no haunted well, no demons, just a little kid who told a story that just got out of control,

427
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 and then another dude just kind of bumbles into that story, and is like, "Yo, yo dude, ghost, fight me, fight me, demon, fight me."

428
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 And David's laying on the bed pretending he's possessed, and he's thinking, "Aren't you idiot? There's nothing here."

429
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 And then that guy, that arn guy, ends up murdering another guy while he's growling, being like, "I'm possessed by the devil, I'm possessed by the devil."

430
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 There's very few--if that is what happened, which is kind of my read on the situation.

431
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 Allegedly, I don't know, I don't--don't sue me, guys, but if that is what happened, the kid just made the story up, and it spiraled out of control,

432
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 this might be the worst example of the boy who cried wolf.

433
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 Is that--would that be it? The boy saying there's a demon, there's a demon, and no, I guess it would be the opposite of it.

434
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 This might be the worst example of someone telling a lie, and keep going along with the joke until it's not funny anymore,

435
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 until someone's bleeding out in their place of business.

436
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 And, if Arn honestly believed that a demon was inside of him, he may have been more prone to act out like that.

437
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 He may have thought, "This guy's making me really angry, and he's doing something that I don't like."

438
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 And normally, as a normal adult, I would leave the scene with this nine-year-old girl and my girlfriend--and my girlfriend's sister--

439
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 and call the police and let them handle this.

440
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 Because the situation was diffused, Alan let go of the girl, everyone can just leave.

441
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 But, if I believe there was a demon inside of me--

442
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 [Alan laughing]

443
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 If I believe the beast was inside of me, anything's possible.

444
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 [Alan snarls]

445
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 Sometimes the lies we tell ourselves to excuse our decisions can take control of us more than any demon can.

446
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 To this day, Arn still believes that he was possessed by a demon.

447
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 That it wasn't self-defense, it wasn't some sort of mental breakdown, it wasn't a child's trick gone wrong, that a demon actually entered his body.

448
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 So, in his mind, he never killed Alan. Something else did.

449
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 Which begs the question, if Alan is right, where's the demon now?

450
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,000
