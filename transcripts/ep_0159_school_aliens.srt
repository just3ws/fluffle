1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 A skier goes missing and is found 3,000 miles away.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Is this a case of alien abduction or something a little more bizarre?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Now we take a look at the story of a school full of young children in Africa

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 who not only saw UFO, but it landed in their playground today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 [music]

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 I hope you're having a great day too. This is the week I'm actually going on a trip.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 But I took the week before off, so there may be a day where I don't have an episode this week,

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 but I'm trying to record as many episodes as I can before I go,

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 because it's a family gathering, I can't really be sitting, pulling out my microphone,

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 and actually I used my travel microphone on my last vacation, and it's okay,

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 but I'd rather record a couple episodes before I leave to get that audio quality that I really want.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Okay, so let's go ahead and get started with our first story here.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Now our first story actually took place fairly recently,

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 and it's funny because it's one of those stories that the news initially ran with one angle to it,

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 and if they had waited a couple months, which that's not what the news does,

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 but a couple months later we found the full story.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 So this happened in February of 2018.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 There was a skier named Danny Philop-

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Danny Philopetus.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Danny Philopetus, we'll just call him Danny anyways.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 He's at the Whiteface Mountains, a racist, kind of a racist name.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 He's at Whiteface Mountain in New York, and he's out there with a couple of his other buddies.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 They're all firefighters.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 I actually knew a girl who dated a firefighter once, and I said,

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 "I bet he's not a firefighter, I bet he's just a volunteer firefighter," and she got so mad.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 And I never found out. She wasn't dating him, she was just sleeping with him.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 And yes, volunteer firefighters are actual firefighters, I was just messing with her,

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 because she really wanted to date a fireman, but anyways, that was her problem, not mine, I was just messing with her.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 So if you are a volunteer firefighter, no disrespect, but blame her.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Blame her.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 So anyways, he's with a group of firefighters, and they're in the mountains.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Now at one point he said, "Hey, I gotta go back to my car. I left my cell phone there."

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 And they're like, "Okay, we'll just meet up with you at the lodge."

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 They were already done skiing, so he skis down the mountain.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 They get to the lodge, he's not there.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 And they're like, "Oh, where's Danny?"

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Now he's 49 years old, this wasn't some young kid.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 This guy's 49 years old, he's married two kids, not married two children, but married with two children.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 And he ends up just vanishing.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Now firefighters call up the cops, the cops come out and investigate it.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 They found his ID in his lodge, and his car was still in the parking lot.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Cell phone was still in the car, so he is missing, and there's a massive search party for him.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 They don't find him at all.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 He got all these rescue teams up in the mountains looking for him, they can't find him.

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Six days later, there is a phone call from an airport in Sacramento, where I'm from, where I was from,

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 and where I'm going actually, he places a phone call from Sacramento International Airport to,

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 which I'll be flying into, I'll take a picture of myself in front of the pay phone that he probably used.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 I guess he probably used the Eric Clerk's phone.

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 What do they call? Not Stewardesses, but the ticket, not the ticket takers, just the people.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Anyways, I'm getting off topic.

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 A call comes from Sacramento International Airport to his wife back home, and she's like, "Oh my God,

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 you've been missing for six days," and he's like, "Yeah, I kind of figured that. I saw the news."

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 And she calls the police and has says, "You need to go to the hospital."

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Obviously, something's really wrong with you. He goes to the hospital, he gets checked out.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Now, when he walks into the airport at Sacramento International, he's still wearing like his ski goggles.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 I imagine he's still wearing all of his ski clothes, but the initial story was,

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 when you look at the early stories of this, the headline for one of them from the Express,

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 which is a British newspaper, headline is, "Alien Abduction?"

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Missing Ski are found 3,000 miles away in California, still wearing goggles.

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 So, of course, I'm looking into this story. I kind of stumbled across it.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 I'm looking into the story and I'm thinking, "Oh, that's kind of weird, but this happened in February of 2018.

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 There has to have been a follow-up by now."

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 So I keep kind of clicking through links, and most of them are still kind of going with the angle,

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 like how could a person... Now, it is possible to move 3,000 miles in six days.

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 That's definitely reasonable. But they couldn't figure out how he got there and he was still wearing his ski clothes.

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 So, the go-to answer was, "Alien Abduction."

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 But in August, I found an article in August 2018. It tells the whole story.

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 So what happened was, Danny, they don't know how the story started.

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 There weren't aliens involved, but the answer actually is much more odd,

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 because it could really happen to anybody. This is the theory, because even he doesn't remember how this started.

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 But talking to doctors and investigators, he starts skiing back to his car to get a cell phone,

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 and he actually takes a wrong turn. And at some point, coming down the mountain, going the wrong way,

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 he must have hit his head. Enough that he got... I mean, got the sense knocked out of him.

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Like, he didn't have amnesia, really. But I guess he did.

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 He basically got hit on the head, like a loony-tune character.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 He's skiing, and Wiley Coyote is skiing behind him with a big thing of dynamite, and he's like, "Yawinks!"

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 And he hits a tree or something, hits a rock.

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 And then when he starts to... he kind of realizes... that's why it's not like full amnesia.

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 He gets up and goes, "Okay, I don't know where I'm at. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm just going to keep coming down this hill."

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 And then he goes to another lodge that was for, like, a children's camp or something like that,

83
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 that was not being used at the time, so there was no staff. It was completely abandoned.

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 But in his days, he thinks that's the right lodge.

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 So he's kind of like looking around. He doesn't recognize anything.

86
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 And this is where it gets really weird. He has... this is where his memory slowly starts to come back.

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 So all of that stuff is supposition. All of that stuff is what investigators think happened.

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 But then what he remembers is a truck, like a semi, apparently, coming by.

89
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 And you know a semi? The reason why they call it a semi is because it's half a truck.

90
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 I don't know if that's true. I should look that up, but...

91
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 A truck pulls up and some guy goes... he doesn't know who this guy is. He can't describe him.

92
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 He has no idea about this dude. Some guy shows up in a truck and says, "Hey, you need help?

93
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Look, I noticed there's blood coming out of your ears and you look quite dazed."

94
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 And I saw that coyote sneaking away from you.

95
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 So Danny gets into the truck and he said he's sitting in the cab and it's warm.

96
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 And in his words, he's in and out of consciousness.

97
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 And then it's something... he's throwing... it leans out every once in a while, throw up.

98
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 And I think it's weird the truck driver never once... as far as we know, like, asked him,

99
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 "Hey, why are you throwing up so much and why are you having a hard time remembering your name?"

100
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 Danny's in and out of consciousness until he realizes he's in Utah.

101
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 And he starts to think, "That's not right. Like, I shouldn't be in Utah."

102
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 The only quote we have from the truck driver, because nobody knows who this guy is,

103
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 the only quote that Danny says that he said was when they got to Sacramento,

104
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 the truck driver said, "It's the end of the line."

105
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 And basically booted Danny out of the truck.

106
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 Now, Danny still did have all on his ski gear and his goggles,

107
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 because it was the only clothes he had, so for six days, he was just driving across.

108
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 And, I mean, here's the thing, like, the truck driver, I'm sure he stopped at a McDonald's or something.

109
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 And it's funny, because this story could have ended up a lot worse,

110
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 like, if the truck driver happened to be a serial killer or something like that.

111
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 But he ends up in Sacramento now.

112
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Didn't have his ID, didn't have his wallet, didn't have his cell phone,

113
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 but he had his credit card in his suit to pay for the ski lift.

114
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 And he's sitting, basically, he comes out of this truck 3,000 miles away and six days later,

115
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 with just a credit card.

116
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 And this is where I was like, "I wish."

117
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 He has this credit card, and his first instinct is, "I need to call somebody, but I don't know who."

118
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 So he walks into an iPhone store, and what do they call it, Apple Store?

119
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 And buys an iPhone, well, maybe not an Apple Store, but anyways, he ends up buying an iPhone.

120
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 And he's looking at it, and he goes, "I know I should be calling someone, but I don't know who."

121
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Now, I would have to save up quite a lot of money to just be able to have that type of iPhone money.

122
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 So if I got unconscious, knocked unconscious, and was driving around, I'd be like,

123
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 "Is there any straight talk phones around? Do you have anything under $29.99?"

124
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 And then I have to buy the $35 card, and I'm like, "Ugh!"

125
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 But anyways, he's able to buy an iPhone.

126
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 He can't figure out who to call.

127
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 He ends up going on the internet to try to figure some stuff out, and that's when he realizes he's missing.

128
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Because he puts his name in, his name's on the credit card, puts his name in,

129
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 and finds out that he's listed as a missing person.

130
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 At that point, he goes to the airport, and while he's thinking, "Well, I have to get back to New York,

131
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 because I don't belong here," he goes to the airport, and then all of a sudden he's like,

132
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 "I remember my wife's number. I remember I have a wife!"

133
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Aw, man, and then he goes to leave the airport, and I'm just joking.

134
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 So he's in the airport, and he ends up remembering his wife's number, calls him up,

135
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 and she's like, "You need to go to the hospital."

136
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 So while that story is not as exotic as being abducted by aliens, this story could actually happen to anyone.

137
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 You could basically be like, slip in the shower, bonk your head, wake up, and then just get in a truck.

138
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 There's a truck in your living room, and he's like, "Get on. We're driving to the end of the line."

139
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 It's funny because that story could have ended really badly, like I said, if he was a serial killer,

140
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 or some sort of human trafficker, or something like that, which obviously is incredibly rare in America, at least.

141
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 But, um, yeah, crazy.

142
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 It's funny because part of me thinks, like, this might be the "touched by an angel" thing,

143
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 but I'm like, what if that was like a gardening angel?

144
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 Like, yes, the gardening angel probably would have driven him back to the real launch,

145
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 but if that truck hadn't stopped, he would have just died in the cold.

146
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Most likely. He was completely lost, he was dazed, and he was freezing cold because there was snow everywhere.

147
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Oh, and I just realized this is another reason why snow sucks.

148
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 There was no snow. He wouldn't have gone skiing. If he hadn't gone skiing, he wouldn't have been chased by the coyote.

149
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 And if he wasn't chased by the coyote, he wouldn't have had to buy an iPhone.

150
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Weird story, though. Weird story. Watch your heads. I think everyone should be issued helmets.

151
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 I think they should build a helmet that's made out of organic material.

152
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 You never mind. I guess that's just called a skull. Okay, let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

153
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 Our next story is going to be an interesting one, and it actually was also a request.

154
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 It was a request from a YouTube user named NezzyOrk.

155
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 I'm sure that means something to somebody.

156
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 NezzyOrk is your D&D character.

157
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 The year is 1994. The date? September 14th.

158
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 There is a stellar event. People are up at night, and they see what is described as a pyrotechnic display of some magnificence.

159
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 The sky was clear. All these meteorites start coming down.

160
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Now, there was a report of in this meteor shower, you saw a fireball-like object flanked by two smaller fireballs.

161
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Now, technically, those are just called meteors, but for whatever reason, they stood out more.

162
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 I actually have a conspiracy theory, and it's funny because I thought about doing this as an actual episode, but I don't know if there's any meat to it.

163
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 So I'll just spit it out here, and I'll see what I can pull up.

164
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 What if the War of the Worlds broadcasts, the famous Orson Welles broadcast that people thought was a real alien landing?

165
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 What if that was real? It really happened.

166
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 And the media is just covering it up by saying, "Oh, it was just a big event."

167
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 What if people were actually fighting aliens in the Pine Barons of New York, or wherever the radio broadcasts took place?

168
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 I guess I should learn where that took place before I make a conspiracy theory up.

169
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 And then afterwards, they're like, "Yeah, we fought those aliens last night."

170
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 And they're like, "No, you didn't. It never happened."

171
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 What if that was the first Min and Black event, the first time that it was actually a radio broadcast saying, "Watch out, there's aliens coming."

172
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 And then the Orson Welles version was recorded after the fact to cover up the real radio broadcasts, and the original radio broadcast was scrubbed.

173
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 And that's why people were like, "Oh, there was this mass panic."

174
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 And other people were like, "No, there wasn't. There was no mass panic that actually took place there."

175
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 And then no one was listening to the show. There was another show going on.

176
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 Hmm? Hmm?

177
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Okay, but anyways, you have this fireball display, meteor display on September 14th.

178
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 And then shortly after that, a mother and her child were driving down the road.

179
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 Now, the article doesn't specifically say which one is driving the car.

180
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 However, I will assume it was the child, of course.

181
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 They're driving on the road, and they see a UFO.

182
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 [Mimics car noises]

183
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 Go by, and they're like, "A trucker? Maybe the same trucker from the Missing Skiers story."

184
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 He's everywhere.

185
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 He's driving through the back roads of Africa, and he sees what he describes as weird beings by the side of the road while he's driving at night.

186
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 So you're starting to get these little sightings being reported in the area.

187
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 But both of those kind of pale in comparison to what happens next.

188
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 On September 16th, in Roua Zimbabwe, there was a school known as Ariel School.

189
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 It was a--not Ariel like planes, but Ariel as in the Little Mermaid is how it's built.

190
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 It was a very expensive private school in the area, and it had a bunch of different nationalities there.

191
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 You had rich people, like local rich people, had their kids there.

192
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 You had diplomats who had their kids there, things like that.

193
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 It's expensive school.

194
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 These kids are out in the playground.

195
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 Yay, wee! Kicking the ball on--what are--swinges and tetherball, not at the same time,

196
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 because that would be quite dangerous, but that would actually be cool sport.

197
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 They're all having fun and they look up.

198
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Now, I think it's very telling that there are no adults watching them outside in the playground,

199
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 as far as what's happening now.

200
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 So you just have 62 kids out in the playground, but anyways...

201
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 The spaceship lands right by their playground, kind of behind some bushes.

202
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 And the kids are just completely shocked.

203
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 And the UFO opens, [imitates explosion]

204
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 [imitates explosion]

205
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Steam, emeticently pours out, and two silhouettes begin to descend the staircase.

206
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 I don't know if there was a staircase or steam or anything like that,

207
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 but the point is that two aliens get out of the UFO.

208
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Now, it's weird because the kids all had different reactions to what they're seeing,

209
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 and a lot of it has to do with their nationalities.

210
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 So these two aliens get out, and what is noticed is that they have kind of long faces,

211
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 but they look fairly human.

212
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 They're wearing black, shiny suits, so like head to toe, like neck to feet, or neck to hands,

213
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 or whatever, tendrils, no.

214
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 They have black suits that cover pretty much their whole body, but their face--

215
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 and they have long, black hair.

216
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Long, black hair.

217
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Almost a little slicked back.

218
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 Very mod aliens.

219
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 And so this is a quote from the article where there is a researcher named Hind--

220
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 that's not his full name, but I didn't write down the first name--

221
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 there's a researcher named Hind who is talking to these kids during--

222
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 not during the event, but shortly after the event and nowadays,

223
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 because this happened back, you know, like '94.

224
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 So here's the quote.

225
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 "Hind believed their cultural differences gave rise to differing interpretations of the event,

226
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 and that the differences in interpretation made the details that were common to all accounts very compelling indeed."

227
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 One of the white students, for example, thought at first that the little man in black might have been Mrs. Stevens Gardiner,

228
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 but then saw that the figure had long, straight black hair, not really like a black person's hair,

229
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 so he realized he made a mistake.

230
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 Now, first off, racist. Beyonce doesn't have an afro.

231
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 Secondly, it is interesting.

232
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 I had a friend who grew up in South Africa.

233
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 His dad was a diplomat, or he was an attaché to a diplomat, and he was white, but he grew up in South Africa.

234
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 He's from America, born in America, went to South Africa as a little kid.

235
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 He said that at the time apartheid was going on, and when every black person who was a worker had to wear a jumpsuit

236
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 that signified their job, so I don't remember the exact colors, but you could say a Gardiner wore an orange jumpsuit,

237
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 and an electrician would wear a green jumpsuit, and so on and so forth.

238
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Now, that wasn't the case across the country as far as I know, but in certain areas, that's how it was.

239
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 And he said, even as a little kid, he knew there was something wrong about that.

240
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 It seemed very systematic. It's not the same thing as wearing a uniform to your job.

241
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 It was almost like a mark.

242
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 Like, a uniform is something you can be proud of, but he just said it was weird.

243
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 He was just a weird feeling, even as a little kid, he thought it wasn't like they were wearing a uniform.

244
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 It was almost like they were wearing some sort of designation. It was bizarre.

245
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 And I might not be saying it correctly, because I know army people wear uniforms and stuff like that,

246
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 but he said it almost made them look like they were lower people, because you would just see a bunch of orange suited people,

247
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 a bunch of green suited people. I don't know. I might not be describing it correctly, but it was a weird experience for him.

248
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 I think that's why she probably thought it was the gardener, because he was wearing some sort of jumpsuit.

249
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 And then she's like, "Oh, he has straight hair, and black people don't have straight hair."

250
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 Racist.

251
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Some of the black children thought that the short little beings were Vicwambo, or Tokoloshes,

252
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 the evil goblins of Shona and Nedébleke Folklore, and burst into tears fearing they would be eaten.

253
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 So the kids who grew up in that area, whose family was from that area,

254
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 they had heard these stories of these goblins that had like all black...

255
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 I don't know if they were wearing black suits and long hair, but it was something about them that made them think it was a mystical thing.

256
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 The white kid goes, "Oh, that must just be the gardener."

257
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 Uh, no, that's not the gardener.

258
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 And then the young black kids who were there were like, "Oh, no, it's the goblins."

259
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 And I think that is fairly common if a guy in Ireland sees some sort of paranormal event,

260
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 he may go, "It's the FaZe! It's the FaZe coming!"

261
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 And then a guy in New York may see a paranormal event and be like, "Oh, it's a UFO."

262
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 So I mean, it's just based on that experience.

263
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 And then this is one of the best quotes we have determining the description.

264
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 This is the last quote I'll read here.

265
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 It's from a witness.

266
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 "I could see the little man about a meter tall was dressed in a black shiny suit,

267
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 that he had long black hair in his eyes which seemed lower on the cheek than our eyes,

268
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 were long and elongated, sorry, were large and elongated.

269
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 The mouth was just a slit and the ears were heartily discernible."

270
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 So you had 62 kids see these things.

271
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 And they'll still talk about it today.

272
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 There's actually a big documentary that's being made right now.

273
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 And I don't know if Dan Ackroyd is producing it,

274
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 but he's definitely in all the promo videos for it.

275
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 And they're talking to these kids now as adults.

276
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 But while this was going on, there was a teacher's meeting in the school.

277
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 And I was watching the promo for the documentary.

278
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 One of the teachers said it was really weird because they're sitting in the meeting.

279
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 And she goes, "It was like on cue."

280
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 She goes, "We could not have practiced this to be as on point as it happened."

281
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 She goes, "We're sitting there in the room."

282
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 And she goes, "On cue, 62 kids scream and begin running into the school."

283
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Like they all had the same reaction at the same time.

284
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 They run into the school. They're totally freaking out.

285
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 They go to the teacher's. There's aliens out there. There's aliens out there.

286
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 At this point, some of the teachers do look out the window and see something out there.

287
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 But they can't be for sure what they're looking at.

288
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 The teachers tell the kids, "Settle down. It's just your imagination. You really see UFO.

289
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 No one, none of the adults got a clear look at it.

290
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 Everyone just go back to class. It's totally fine.

291
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 They're basically the men in black, but teachers."

292
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 But the kids, obviously, when they go home, they're still freaked out.

293
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 They're having nightmares. They tell their parents, "We saw aliens today."

294
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 At that point, the parents the next day are calling the school to find out what the hell happened to my kid at school.

295
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 And the answer from the school is, "We don't know."

296
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 The kids are talking about aliens and UFOs and stuff like that, but we didn't see anything.

297
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 A couple of the teachers said they thought they saw something in the bushes.

298
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 And the parents are like, "There's someone in the bushes?"

299
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 And he didn't tell me, "Oh, no. Calm down. Calm down. Nothing happened."

300
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Think it was a gardener. Oh, okay.

301
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 So that story is still being investigated today,

302
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 because now the adults have a better command of the language,

303
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 and they can better describe what they saw as opposed to a bunch of schoolchildren.

304
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 And even today, the adults are like, "Oh, no, no. I know what I saw, man.

305
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 There's some aliens. Like, that was the stray UFO that landed. And what's interesting is that is not the only...

306
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 That was a request from Neseor, but that's not the actual only time that a UFO has been sighted or landed at a school.

307
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 So in 1977, a UFO landed in Broadhaven in Wales, and it was also at a school.

308
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 It was seen by 14 kids at Lance aliens get out of the vehicle. Weird.

309
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 In 1666, there was a UFO sighting in Melbourne, and this one did involve a teacher.

310
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 There was 300 children and some staff saw a UFO flying around the school.

311
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 One of the kids goes in and tells the science teacher, "Teacher, teacher, there's a UFO outside!"

312
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 And the science teacher's like, "Damn it!"

313
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 No, there's not. UFOs aren't real. I'm a science teacher. I don't believe in any of the nonsense.

314
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 And the kid was like, "No, no, no. You've got to come right now. You've got to come right now."

315
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 The science teacher finally goes, "Fine. I'll go check it out."

316
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 Because he's quoted in this article. He walks out of the classroom and sees a UFO flying there.

317
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 The science teacher goes on to explain that five jets came to intercept the object over their school.

318
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 And whatever it was, the object kept staying ahead of the jets, but in the general vicinity of the school.

319
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 The jets couldn't get close enough to it, and then it just took off, disappeared, and the jets flew away, apparently.

320
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Basically, the airplanes could never get close to this UFO.

321
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 So, is there a rational explanation for this?

322
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 Now, obviously with UFOs, it just comes down to somebody seeing something and maybe being mistaken about it,

323
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 or it actually being a UFO.

324
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Like, well, it's a UFO, either way, but you know what I mean? Like, actually an object of unknown origin.

325
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 I guess that's the same thing as UFO. You know what I mean? Alien spacecraft.

326
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 So, is there a rational explanation for this?

327
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 Well, kids are going to be fooled easier than adults.

328
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 But, a mass group of children.

329
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 Like, I can understand if three or four of them were seeing this UFO and they went and reported it and being completely dismissed.

330
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 But we're talking about dozens of kids in some of these instances.

331
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 And these are the only three that I found in the amount of time I was researching it.

332
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 I'm wondering if there's a lot more stories of UFOs landing at schools or being cited by schools.

333
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Now, obviously as I'm reading this, two things pop in my head.

334
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 One, I think not that it's fake. I think that the kids probably saw something they didn't understand.

335
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 The first thing that popped in my head was I thought it's some sort of military drill.

336
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 It's some sort of vehicle that the military is using and for whatever reason.

337
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 But I was like, yeah, but I don't know.

338
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 The second thing I thought, though, is there's one thing that I would say 90% of schools have in common, other than kids and teachers.

339
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 They tend to have very large play areas. Now, I know all of them don't.

340
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 But when we're talking about Africa and Wales and Australia, maybe not Wales, but Africa and Australia are very well known for their massive amounts of land.

341
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 So their playgrounds probably are quite bigger than, say, you know, a tiny elementary school.

342
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 But a- it's a perfect place- what I'm getting at is it's the perfect place to land an air vehicle is at a school.

343
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 Because most playgrounds are quite spacious.

344
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 If it was an alien spacecraft, and there's always that idea that two aliens, we would be the way ants are to us.

345
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 They wouldn't have any- they don't really think of us as an sentient species.

346
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 They're so much more advanced because ants are very intelligent, but we still crush them.

347
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 We still spray them with poison.

348
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 And we especially, if we are moving into a house and they go, "Hey, just let you know there's some ants here."

349
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 You're not going to be like, "Pfft, deal's off."

350
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 You're going to be like, "Okay, I don't really don't care." You know, get rid of them or whatever, and then you just move into the house.

351
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Or if you're driving your car and you see a little ant hill on the road, you're not going to like slam on your brakes and be like, "No way, I'm not crushing those ants."

352
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 Huge pile up behind you, you're like, "Keep it real, ants. Keep it real."

353
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 You just run over them.

354
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 If that theory is true that we're so far behind aliens, both mentally and technologically, that we're nothing to them,

355
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 they could just be seeing a large expanse of land to land at, and they really don't care who sees them, or what type of impact they have.

356
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 Because you don't care if an ant sees you when you walk by. You have no problem shrolling by a bunch of ants,

357
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 unless they're hot fire ants and you don't have shoes on, but you don't care.

358
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 It never even occurs to you that an ant or a spider or a billy goat may see you walking by because they don't affect you.

359
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 Is that why these aliens are just like, "There's a big space here. Let's just land here. Let's do some repairs."

360
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 A bunch of kids are seeing them freaking out. Aliens are looking over and they're like, "What the?"

361
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 Don't worry about them, dude. They're just ants. You're just ants. Here, give me the space spanner.

362
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 Beep, beep, beep. They're working on their stuff.

363
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 It's an interesting theory. It's an interesting theory.

364
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 I think if the theory was true, you would see UFOs landing in sports stadiums,

365
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 but it could also be that you had a wide area that was flattened, because playgrounds are...

366
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 I mean, they could have landed in the bush of Africa, but there's stuff everywhere.

367
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 You land on top of an elephant. You land on top of a Grootsling. You're going to get your shit blown up.

368
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Playgrounds are very well manicured. They're flat.

369
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 To any other species, it would look like it was a landing pad.

370
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 It would look like it was perfectly stable to drop your ship in the middle of, do a couple repairs,

371
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 take a couple pictures, and take off.

372
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 Are there more... And it's funny because the reaction to both the science teacher and the original school staff

373
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 makes you wonder, are there more sightings of UFOs landing at schools,

374
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 and they're just being covered up or disbelieved?

375
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 Is it possible that there are many more stories that are a close encounter of the third grade kind?
