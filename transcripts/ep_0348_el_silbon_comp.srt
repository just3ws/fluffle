1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Can you be tricked into doing porn?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,660
 Has the monkey uprising finally begun?

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:19,080
 Then we travel to Venezuela to meet a cryptid, a spirit of vengeance that stands 19 feet

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,480
 tall.

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,680
 He carries on his back a bag of his father's bloody bones and his target is you.

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,160
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:39,720
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,720
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,720
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,160
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,680
 Let's travel first off.

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,800
 We're going to San Diego.

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,800
 So in San Diego, there is a porn company called Girls Do Porn and it was run by a guy

14
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,800
 named Michael Pratt.

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,400
 And this was the whole setup.

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,000
 He posts a modeling request on Craigslist or something like that.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,480
 And the women would respond and then he'd be like, "Let's do nude photos."

18
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,640
 And she'd be like, "No, I kind of don't want to do nude photos.

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,640
 Here, I'll pay you more money.

20
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,560
 Okay, I'll do nude photos."

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,560
 And this goes on and then eventually he's able to talk them into shooting porn, shooting

22
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,920
 actual pornography.

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,160
 And this was his pitch.

24
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,320
 Now listen, dude, here's the thing.

25
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,400
 This is a stupid pitch and a lot of people fell for it.

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,320
 This is a really stupid pitch.

27
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,160
 But he said, "Listen, no one's going to see it like...

28
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,840
 Well, obviously, someone's going to see it.

29
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:36,040
 We're shooting porn, but we're only going to sell it via DVD to like people in Australia,

30
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,720
 high-profile businessmen in Japan, deep sea fishermen.

31
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,720
 People who don't have access to the internet will get copies of your DVDs."

32
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,720
 So these women agreed to this, thinking that no one would see their porn except for a

33
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,920
 highly specialized group of people.

34
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,800
 And then, of course, it got on to the line, because it wasn't actually a DVD setup.

35
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,800
 He was actually...

36
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,720
 The girls do porn, the whole setup was this.

37
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,280
 This is the one and only time these women will ever do porn.

38
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,280
 So it was about...

39
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,600
 I watched these videos.

40
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,680
 I'm not a fan of porn.

41
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,680
 We've talked about this before.

42
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,400
 I think it's damaging to the people who watch it.

43
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,520
 I think it's damaging to the performers.

44
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,120
 But because of this story, I did watch some of it.

45
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,520
 There was like each video...

46
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,520
 I couldn't watch all of it.

47
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,080
 The each video was like 55 minutes, an hour long.

48
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,000
 And the first 10 or 15 minutes was just her being interviewed, like, "Tell us about your

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,560
 first sexual experience.

50
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,560
 What turns you on?"

51
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,560
 Something like that.

52
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,760
 Really kind of just...

53
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,080
 Why would you put that in a porn?

54
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,920
 I guess it's some sort of fetish thing, because you want to get to know the girl better or

55
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,920
 something like that.

56
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,640
 But anyways, and then you skip through it, and then it's just normal porn stuff.

57
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,080
 And that's the whole series.

58
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,880
 And so the idea that this is the first time these girls do porn, and this will be the

59
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,240
 last time they do porn, was pretty on the nose, because that was how he recruited these

60
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,240
 women.

61
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,960
 Oh, don't worry, no one will ever find out about this.

62
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,120
 He also had a woman.

63
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,840
 He had like a model accomplice.

64
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,160
 And this was absolutely disgusting, too.

65
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,040
 Talk about women sticking together.

66
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,920
 If he would say, "Hey, listen, you got to call this girl.

67
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,800
 She's worked with me before.

68
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,240
 She'll give you the straight dope."

69
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:12,520
 So the mark, the target, the girl would then call up the model and say, "Who's like it?"

70
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,840
 Who was like an Instagram model or something like that?

71
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,720
 And they go, "Hey, you've worked with this guy before?"

72
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,720
 She'd be like, "Oh yeah, totally.

73
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,200
 I've done lots of shoots with this guy, and he's totally on the up and up.

74
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,200
 None of my Instagram fans know about it.

75
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,480
 None of these photos or videos have ever leaked.

76
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,480
 You're good to go."

77
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,040
 None of them leaked, because she had never done any porn with this guy, as far as I could

78
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,040
 tell.

79
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,200
 She was just a contact.

80
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,560
 She was just like a...

81
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,960
 She was basically like a collaborator of an enemy state, is how this woman was.

82
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,560
 So the girl would go, "Well, okay, this other woman's vouching for him.

83
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,880
 She says she's done multiple shoots."

84
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,880
 When you would type...

85
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,880
 Shoot, he would give them names like best models and corporators or something like that.

86
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,000
 You would type that in, nothing would ever pop up online.

87
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,120
 You'd go, "Oh, she didn't...

88
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,080
 He never said, 'Oh, I'm with girls do porn,' because that's all over the place."

89
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:07,320
 So these girls would then do a porn shoot with him, and then it would be released online,

90
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,880
 and their lives would be ruined.

91
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,760
 I actually had a discussion with this girl not too long ago.

92
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,000
 We were talking about sex work.

93
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,360
 We were talking about pornography, and I said, "There's a stigma attached to it."

94
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:24,080
 And she goes, "Society needs to change its ways so a girl can go out and do porn and

95
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,920
 not have it affect her employment."

96
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,840
 And I go, "Yeah, in a perfect world.

97
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,800
 So the point is you can change your behavior much quicker than you can change society's

98
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
 behavior.

99
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,400
 You can choose not to do porn today and not to have those ramifications."

100
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,920
 So I mean...

101
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:44,280
 Anyways, these women are actually suing him for being tricked into doing the porn, which

102
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,800
 seems...

103
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,680
 When I was reading those headlines, I was like, "No.

104
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,920
 Can you be tricked into doing porn?

105
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,920
 No."

106
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,600
 Unless it was like hitting camera or something like that.

107
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,480
 But these women are seemingly successfully arguing that they agreed to have sex on camera,

108
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,200
 but for it not to be disseminated?

109
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,200
 I don't know.

110
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,200
 The whole thing's weird.

111
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,680
 He ended up leaving the country.

112
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,680
 He's gone.

113
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,120
 He's like in the middle of the trial, he's like, "Oh, I left some paperwork in my car."

114
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,120
 Drives away.

115
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,040
 They haven't found him since.

116
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,120
 His main actor, he was the one producing it.

117
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,120
 He might have been directing it.

118
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,800
 His main actor is being charged with sexual assault because he wouldn't stop.

119
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
 Like they'd be like, "Stop."

120
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,080
 And actually, no, it's more than that.

121
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,460
 I was reading about it.

122
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,560
 He would say, "Hey, why don't you hang out with me after the shoot?"

123
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,440
 And then he would sexually, allegedly sexually assault them or they would make arrangements

124
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,720
 at a hotel and be like, "Oops, your hotel room got canceled.

125
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,720
 You have to stay with me."

126
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,720
 And stuff like that.

127
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,760
 So it seems to be a pretty scummy operation all around.

128
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,280
 The woman collaborator that's disgusting.

129
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,000
 If these allegations are true, they're disgusting.

130
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,040
 The actor's disgusting and the director producer's disgusting.

131
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,440
 What's interesting is that's actually a plot point for the movie "Cuck."

132
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,320
 I know I've talked about that almost every day now.

133
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,840
 Because he gets the same thing.

134
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,240
 They say, "Hey, we're just shooting these movies for us."

135
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,920
 So come and do these "Cuck" videos.

136
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,400
 And he's like, "Oh, okay."

137
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,600
 And then they get online.

138
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,120
 And at that point, he's a popular YouTuber.

139
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,160
 It's a fairly interesting movie.

140
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,560
 But anyways, anyways, enough about "Cuck," enough about porn.

141
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,360
 But still, an interesting question nonetheless.

142
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,600
 How does the porn industry is basically just a meat grinder?

143
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,320
 And it's a terrible, terrible thing.

144
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,880
 And the best thing you can do, stop watching porn.

145
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,040
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story here.

146
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,440
 You know what?

147
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,560
 Here's a question for you.

148
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,520
 I wonder if you read a book you imagine this wonderful world in the book.

149
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,200
 You're like, "Oh, Bella, if only you would find out

150
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,160
 that Edward was the right-- Edward was actually a terrible mate for Bella.

151
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,400
 They're a horrible couple.

152
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,120
 I wonder what they'd be like in their fifties.

153
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,040
 Like, their vampires, fifties is like nothing to them.

154
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,880
 I think he's already like 200.

155
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,200
 But I wonder what they'd be like married for, you know, a couple hundred years.

156
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,720
 Because they were terrible for each other.

157
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,360
 Anyway, so you read books and it helps your imagination.

158
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,960
 Or you-- I guess it's like a muscle in your using it.

159
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:10,200
 When you watch television, you can then go, "Hmm, I wonder if Rachel and Ross

160
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,320
 are ever going to get together."

161
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,320
 Or, "What is really behind the number sequence and lost?"

162
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,240
 You can tell, obviously, I'm a boomer.

163
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,760
 So you have that stuff, right?

164
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,680
 But with porn, because we see these effects on the brain,

165
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,640
 we're always hearing these studies about effects on the brain,

166
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:31,080
 that definitely affects men's sexual-- not drive, but they can't keep it up.

167
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,560
 They might be able to get it up just as quickly as normal,

168
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,160
 but they can't keep it up.

169
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,160
 Because their brain has been taking them the stimulus of these images,

170
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,160
 these multiple images.

171
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,520
 And the compilation videos are even worse,

172
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,800
 because you're just getting totally different images each, you know,

173
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,760
 every 30 seconds, if that.

174
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,120
 But when you're watching a movie, you're seeing the visual information

175
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,800
 presented in front of you, and then you can go, "Hmm, I wonder if, you know,

176
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,240
 Gandalf is going to get out of this one."

177
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,840
 And you're watching porn, I don't even think any part of your imagination is engaged.

178
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,480
 Maybe you're imagining yourself in the scene, but I don't even think that.

179
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,560
 And I'm wondering if pornography might actually be the most deadening,

180
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,080
 quote unquote, "entertainment" that is out there.

181
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,920
 Because no one's ever like, "Hmm, I wonder if Jenna Jamison will get together."

182
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,840
 I am old, by the way.

183
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,840
 I am old.

184
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,440
 I don't even know who the new stars are.

185
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,200
 I guess Mia Khalifa is the newest one I know.

186
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,680
 She's retired at this point.

187
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,880
 I wonder if Jenna Jamison's going to get together with Rock Studley.

188
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,520
 Maybe I'll write fan fiction about that.

189
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,120
 I don't think it engages the brain on a creative level at all.

190
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,000
 You're truly a passive observer.

191
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,440
 Even with video games, you're constantly trying to figure out if I do this,

192
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,880
 I'll win, if I do that, I'll lose.

193
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,880
 Mega Man 2, Metroid.

194
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,400
 So I just threw in some old game references as well,

195
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,280
 just to do the complete package there.

196
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,680
 So interesting.

197
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,480
 Let's go ahead, though, and leave behind those interesting questions.

198
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,680
 Let's head off to a little place in Africa, Uganda.

199
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,160
 Everyone's favorite African country.

200
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,160
 I don't even know where it's at.

201
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,640
 I couldn't point it out on the map, except the fact that it's in Africa.

202
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,000
 We're in Uganda.

203
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,480
 Now, what's happening over here is we are basically having a human chimp war.

204
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,120
 Now, listen, man, in America, you could walk out of your house one day,

205
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,800
 you have a one in a billion chance that a mountain lion's going to attack you.

206
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,800
 And it's actually pretty low rates in California, at least it was.

207
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,880
 I think it's been 10 people in 100 years.

208
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,920
 And if you go around, you're poking around in the woods with a shotgun,

209
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,560
 stuff like that, there's a chance a bear is going to eat you.

210
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,920
 When you're in the cities, it's less likely, or in towns,

211
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,760
 it's less likely that a mountain lion's going to get you.

212
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,080
 I remember when I was in California, there was this horrifying story.

213
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,920
 This woman, she lived kind of in the mountains, but not super remote.

214
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,120
 She wasn't like Ruby Ridge-level living in the mountains.

215
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,840
 She came out of her house and she had like a patio.

216
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,560
 She walks out of her house, she walks down the stairs of her patio.

217
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,920
 There was a mountain lion sleeping underneath the patio,

218
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,560
 and it heard her walking and woke it up and it ate her.

219
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,120
 She devoured her at 6 a.m.

220
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,400
 That was terrifying.

221
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,840
 Everyone in California, given that news article hit the papers,

222
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,600
 were like, "Ugh, people could be in the middle of LA.

223
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,520
 Some homeless guys like, "Uh-oh, I'm glad I'm homeless,

224
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,840
 so I don't have a patio, so a mountain lion can't hang out underneath it."

225
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,360
 When you live in a place with chimpanzees and gorillas,

226
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,640
 which is not like most people don't,

227
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,240
 even places where chimpanzees and gorillas live,

228
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,760
 they tend to be farther up,

229
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,360
 but there's a chance you're going to get killed by a chimp,

230
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,240
 which is they are brutal attackers.

231
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,240
 If you have a choice between being thrown into a cage with a bear

232
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,080
 or thrown into a cage with a chimp, take the bear,

233
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,440
 because the chimp is going straight for your genitals.

234
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,880
 Like, the bear is going to slap you and it's going to disfigure you,

235
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,440
 and then it's going to bite down and kill you.

236
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,840
 A chimp is going to rip off your hands and your feet,

237
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,360
 and it's going to start with your genitals, by the way,

238
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,000
 and then it's going to rip off your hands and your feet,

239
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,280
 and then it may kill you if you're lucky,

240
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,440
 or you just die of blood loss.

241
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,680
 Very, very grim.

242
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,880
 Chimp wins the fight, goes on to fight against Shao Kahn in Mortal Kombat.

243
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,280
 But we're having these problems in Uganda

244
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,000
 because humans tend to spread out, like all species.

245
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,600
 Like all species, they will spread out until they can't go anywhere else.

246
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,520
 They'll spread out as far as their environment will allow them.

247
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,600
 But humans are masters of the environment, so they can go anywhere.

248
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,000
 Grasshoppers get to a point where it gets a little cold,

249
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,080
 and they're like, "Now I'm good. I'm going to stay in this area."

250
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,000
 Humans will be like, "Pfft, cold,"

251
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,440
 and they'll colonize the most frigid environments on the planet,

252
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,360
 call them "organ," and make me live there in the year 2019.

253
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,000
 We're having these problems with these villages

254
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,600
 in Uganda, butting up against chimpanzee habitats.

255
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:51,400
 Not like Jane Goodall, she's like, they're being observed, like wild chimps.

256
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,280
 2014 is when these have started, they've really ramped up.

257
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,840
 This woman, these are going to get kind of gross, by the way.

258
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,600
 And not in a pornography as a social ill-gross,

259
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,920
 these are actually like human chimp attack, gross.

260
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,480
 This mom, right there, that should let you know where this is going,

261
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,600
 this mom is hanging out with her kids in her yard,

262
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,320
 a little house in the middle of Uganda.

263
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,400
 And the kids are like, "Can we get some water, mama?

264
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
 Can we get some water?

265
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
 Oh, that's dark.

266
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,320
 Don't make children voices, Jason."

267
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,720
 She goes to get water and she hears screaming,

268
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,640
 she comes back around the house,

269
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,480
 and a chimpanzee just ran out of the jungle,

270
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,600
 grabbed her two kids, and started dragging them off.

271
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,480
 And now she's chasing and the chimpanzee drops one of the kids,

272
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,400
 but takes her two-year-old son and runs into the jungle.

273
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,400
 When they find the kid later, he's dead.

274
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,400
 I'm going to spare you the gruesome details,

275
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,400
 but I've pretty much gone over what chimpanzees do to human body.

276
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,400
 Now, obviously, everyone was super panicked about that,

277
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,400
 what are we going to do?

278
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,400
 We have to go out and kill these chimps, things like that.

279
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,400
 But, I mean, there's hundreds of these guys.

280
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,400
 It's not like if there was just King Kong walking around New York City,

281
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,400
 like whenever an alligator eats someone,

282
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,400
 they tend to kill the alligator, but it's a chimp.

283
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,400
 There's a bunch of them.

284
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,400
 You know they're endangered, but they're endangered like worldwide.

285
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,400
 In this area, there's a ton of them.

286
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,400
 You can't go kill--

287
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,400
 and you can't go kill every chimp,

288
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,400
 because then you'll have environmentalists all over you,

289
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,400
 saying these guys are endangered.

290
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,400
 And they've just have--

291
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,400
 they've been having all of these attacks going on like this.

292
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,400
 In 2017, there was another incident that was notable,

293
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,400
 other than just a monkey coming out of the woods and stealing somebody.

294
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,400
 This monkey takes a baby, takes off into the jungle,

295
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,400
 and you're like, "Jason, please don't tell me stories about monkeys killing babies."

296
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,400
 Monkey takes a baby, as Jason just continues,

297
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,400
 monkey takes a baby, takes off into the woods,

298
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,400
 mother chases it.

299
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,400
 When she gets into the woods, she gets surrounded by chimps herself,

300
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,400
 or a semi-circle, or probably even more ap.

301
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,400
 And she backed off.

302
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,400
 And the monkeys ate the baby.

303
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,400
 It's bizarre, and you read that and you're like,

304
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,400
 "What would you do?"

305
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,400
 I think that's-- I left that one in as gruesome as it is.

306
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,400
 I left that one in because I think it's very chilling.

307
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,400
 Because as a parent-- I'm not a parent, thankfully,

308
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,400
 but if I was a parent,

309
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,400
 you want to think if a chimpanzee stole your kid,

310
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,400
 you would fight to the death to get it back.

311
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,400
 But, I mean, at a point where-- maybe,

312
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,400
 but at the point where there's 10 chimpanzees

313
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
 and you have other kids at home,

314
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,400
 what would you do in that situation?

315
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,400
 You're like, "Jason, this is not a fun podcast.

316
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:39,400
 You're talking about moral questions about how it won baby versus 10 babies?"

317
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,400
 Speaking of 10 babies, there was a chimpanzee

318
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,400
 that was so vicious they nicknamed them "Sidam."

319
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,400
 They nicknamed this chimpanzee Sidam.

320
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:56,400
 Him alone--Sidam alone--eight, seven babies.

321
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,400
 And then they finally shot him.

322
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,400
 So, there's not-- they're not having a good time in Uganda.

323
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,400
 And, I thought this was interesting.

324
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,400
 The little chimpanzee facts to kind of lighten the mood.

325
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,400
 You're like, "Jason, how many babies are going to be eating in this episode?"

326
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,400
 I think that's the end of it.

327
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,400
 Oh, wait. Those are the only babies that are going to be eating this episode.

328
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,400
 Okay? But anyway, so some eight facts.

329
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,400
 Here's some-- or chimpanzee facts.

330
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,400
 I think the first fact is they're not called apes.

331
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,400
 They're called chimpanzees.

332
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,400
 Monkey, I think, is the generic term, right?

333
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,400
 Like, all of them are monkeys.

334
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,400
 And then a chimp is a sp--speticular.

335
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,400
 Chimps are a particular breed.

336
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,400
 And then apes are the big--are the middle dudes.

337
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,400
 And then gorillas are the giant guys.

338
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,400
 I should do a--I should do a natural science podcast.

339
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,400
 Apes are the giant guys of the world.

340
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,400
 Wait, no, I didn't say that gorillas are the giant guys of the world.

341
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,400
 Anyway, it doesn't matter. So we're mostly related to the chimpanzee.

342
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,400
 As humans were evolving, we had a choice.

343
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,400
 We could either have immense strength.

344
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,400
 Chimpanzees are about two times as strong as humans.

345
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,400
 Some people say five times as strong, but modern science doesn't really think that.

346
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,400
 They're at least two times as strong as humans are.

347
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,400
 Humans had a choice. We could either remain as strong as we were,

348
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,400
 or we could develop fine motor skills.

349
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:19,400
 They said that the fact that we can--we can both pick up a grape

350
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,400
 and like wheeled a sledgehammer is fine motor control.

351
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,400
 Use scissors, things like that. We can be very gentle.

352
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:31,400
 Scissors--chopping stuff up or just--that's something a chimp can't do.

353
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,400
 They're all strength.

354
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,400
 So, yeah, I don't know. That was an interesting chimpanzee fact.

355
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,400
 And you go, "Okay, Jason, you've told us about monkeys,

356
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:46,400
 killing people, eating babies, disgusting topic for a podcast in Uganda.

357
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,400
 It's been going on now for five or six years."

358
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,400
 That's terrible.

359
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,400
 But you mentioned a monkey uprising, and I will say this.

360
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,400
 The monkeys are rising up in 2007.

361
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,400
 So, in India, they also have trouble with monkeys.

362
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,400
 Little tiny monkeys, though. These are like the little monkeys from Aladdin.

363
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,400
 They're 2D. They're animated. Just throw some dip on them, get rid of it.

364
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,400
 I don't know why they have such a problem.

365
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
 These little monkeys are running around India.

366
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,400
 There's like this diplomat's house, and people have quit working for the diplomat

367
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,400
 because monkeys are constantly breaking into the house, pulling their hair and stuff like that.

368
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,400
 And you're like, "Jason, that's not comparable to chimpanzees eating babies.

369
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
 You didn't let me finish. You didn't let me finish."

370
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,400
 In 2007--I love this sentence. In 2007.

371
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,400
 So, I love the--I got this from an article here.

372
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:40,400
 In 2007, a group of monkeys pushed then-deputy mayor of Delhi, SS Bajwa,

373
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,400
 off a terrace where he fell to his death.

374
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,400
 They're basically political assassins at this point.

375
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,400
 You have like some shady guy like paying them in bananas.

376
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,400
 Here you go. Ten bananas now.

377
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,400
 Ten bananas after the job's done. The monkeys are like, "Yes."

378
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,400
 And they're like sneaking through the house. They push him off his terrace.

379
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
 He falls to his death.

380
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,400
 My question is, where was Lady Gaga in 2007?

381
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,400
 That's a deep cut. That's a deep cut.

382
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,400
 Don't get that joke. Listen, episode 6 of Dead Rabbit Radio.

383
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,400
 I don't do in-jokes often, but I couldn't pass that one up.

384
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,400
 The most obscure in-joke ever.

385
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
 Sorry, new listeners.

386
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,400
 Okay, so let's go ahead and move on to our last topic of the night.

387
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,400
 This one was actually a request from Ustavo Hernandez.

388
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,400
 And he requested this during, I think, my first livestream.

389
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,400
 I think it was my Halloween livestream.

390
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,400
 Let's hop on the carbonar copter. We're leaving behind the army of monkeys.

391
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
 They're dressed like little ninjas.

392
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,400
 We're going to Venezuela.

393
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,400
 We're headed back in time to the 19th century.

394
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,400
 So we're going to hear the story of El Saban.

395
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,400
 Sit back, relax as much as you can, for the content of the rest of this episode.

396
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,400
 You're like, "I can't relax at all. I've already set the podcast off.

397
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,400
 I'll wait for tomorrow's episode."

398
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:03,400
 [singing]

399
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,400
 There's a guy playing a mandolin in Venezuela.

400
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,400
 We're walking down the dusty streets.

401
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,400
 That was some racist.

402
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:18,400
 I'm sure their streets are just as clean as everyone else's streets in the 19th century.

403
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,400
 Anyways, we're walking through Venezuela.

404
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,400
 Everyone's looking at us suspiciously now.

405
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,400
 They're like, "Did he just assume that Venezuelan streets are dusty?"

406
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
 "Who is this guy?"

407
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,400
 So anyways, we're in Venezuela and we're going to meet a dude.

408
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,400
 Now his real name's not El Sabon.

409
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,400
 El means "the".

410
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,400
 So I don't think when he was born, they're like, "I will name thee 'the'."

411
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,400
 "The Silbon."

412
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,400
 Or "Mr. Silbon."

413
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
 Silbon probably stands for something.

414
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
 I probably should have checked it out.

415
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,400
 Let me find out exactly what Silbon means.

416
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,400
 One second here.

417
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,400
 Oh, the Whistler.

418
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,400
 Silbon means "whistler", I believe.

419
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,400
 Which makes sense, because he does whistle.

420
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,400
 So anyways, that's not his given name.

421
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,400
 He wasn't from the Whistler family.

422
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,400
 His first name isn't "the".

423
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,400
 Anyways, there's this story in town.

424
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,400
 The guy's playing the mandolin.

425
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,400
 You guys want to hear a story?

426
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,400
 And we're like, "Yes."

427
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,400
 And he's like, "Sit down on our immaculate, perfectly paved streets."

428
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,400
 We're like, "Oh, these are quite clean."

429
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,400
 He's like, "Yes, you can eat off them."

430
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
 "Don't be racist, Jason."

431
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,400
 So there was a young man named Whistler.

432
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,400
 And he had a beautiful wife.

433
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,400
 And he lived at home with his mom and his dad.

434
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:39,400
 And one day he was walking and he heard odd sounds coming from his house.

435
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,400
 Jason almost said, "Hut!"

436
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,400
 But it caught himself.

437
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,400
 "Oh, I love you, my husband's father."

438
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,400
 "I guess I could have just called you my father-in-law."

439
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,400
 "Yes, I love you too, daughter-in-law."

440
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,400
 That sounds absolutely disgusting.

441
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,400
 Can I call you something else?

442
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,400
 "Why yes, you can call me."

443
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,400
 And then Whistler kicks in the door and goes, "Dad, are you bone in my wife?"

444
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,400
 And the father is like, "Yes, I am bone in your wife. What are you going to do about it?"

445
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,400
 He's feeling froggy.

446
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,400
 And the Whistler was feeling froggy.

447
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,400
 He stabbed his father. Death killed him right on the spot.

448
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:18,400
 Now, the grandfather, so his dad's dad, if you needed any more exposition on that one,

449
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:24,400
 thinks this is disgusting and it takes the Whistler out, ties him to a tree, whips him.

450
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,400
 [whips]

451
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,400
 That's pretty bad.

452
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,400
 Cutting your skin open with a whip.

453
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,400
 Every time you get hit, it just puts a big slice in your skin.

454
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,400
 But grandfather's not done. He then goes, grabs a bunch of chili peppers.

455
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,400
 Just rubs them all over his back.

456
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,400
 "Ah, this is somehow worse than getting my skin ripped open."

457
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,400
 Ah, ah.

458
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,400
 Then, he gives his-

459
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:53,400
 Then the grandfather gives Whistler a bag of his father's bones, which seems a little insane.

460
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,400
 Like, you're like, "No, my son was murdered by my grandson.

461
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,400
 Okay, you hold on. I'm gonna go chop up your dad and skin him and then give you a bag of his bones."

462
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,400
 Like, I don't know why this was so ready to go.

463
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:11,400
 Grandfather gives him a sack of his father's bones and says, "Run."

464
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,400
 Whistler was like, "Ah, he untied him too before he said that."

465
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,400
 He didn't just keep him tied up and say, "Right."

466
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,400
 So you have a guy with his back all whipped up, a bunch of hot chilies rubbed into the wounds,

467
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,400
 carrying a bag of his father's bones, and now he's being commanded to run.

468
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,400
 And then the grandfather unleashes a pack of dogs on-

469
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,400
 How did the grandfather have all this stuff just laying around?

470
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,400
 First, he had a sack big enough to hold human remains.

471
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,400
 Two, he had human remains.

472
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,400
 Three, he had a pack of dogs just hanging out.

473
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,400
 Anyways, the dogs chase Whistler down.

474
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,400
 Chasing the bones, really, I think is kind of what that's supposed to be.

475
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,400
 And then they catch him and they eat him and they kill him.

476
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,400
 [imitates dog's dog]

477
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,400
 And the narrator, his mandolin, goes, "That's one version."

478
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,400
 And we're like, "Oh, okay."

479
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,400
 So there's another version of the story. He's like, "Yes."

480
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,400
 [imitates dog's dog]

481
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,400
 Whistler was a naughty child.

482
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,400
 Whistler was a young man who wanted what he wanted.

483
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,400
 And when he goes, "I want venison."

484
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,400
 And his father goes, "You know what, son? I love you so much.

485
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
 I will go out and get you some venison."

486
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,400
 And he was always like a spoiled brat.

487
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,400
 The father went out to go get him some venison.

488
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,400
 He goes hunting, "Couldn't find any deer."

489
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
 So he comes back and he's like, "Well, I know my son's a spoiled brat,

490
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
 but I'm sure he'll understand."

491
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,400
 So he comes and he goes, "Son, you couldn't find any deer."

492
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,400
 And the son's like, "Okay, so here's the thing. Listen, I really wanted some venison.

493
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
 That's what I said, right, dad?"

494
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
 And dad's like, "Yeah."

495
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,400
 And then Whistler goes, "So...

496
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,400
 you know what else is a tender, tender meat?"

497
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,400
 [imitates dog's dog]

498
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,400
 Slits his father open. "Mmm, delicious, dad.

499
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,400
 Mmm, mmm, mmm, yummy, yummy, yummy. I love eating my forefathers."

500
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,400
 He takes the stuff, he takes the organs to his mom and says,

00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,400
 "Hey, dad caught this venison. Can you cook this up?

502
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
 I can't wait to eat."

503
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,400
 And the mom's like, "Oh, yeah, sure. When's your dad coming home?"

504
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,400
 And he's like, "Ah, he'll be in a bit."

505
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,400
 And then the mom's like holding it.

506
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,400
 She's like, "That's weird. This feels like...

507
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,400
 this feels like my husband's liver.

508
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,400
 Hmm, these intestines, I recognize these.

509
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,400
 These look like they come from my husband."

510
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,400
 And she realizes what happened.

511
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,400
 She lets the grandfather know the grandfather shows up,

512
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,400
 whips Whistler, throws, puts her hot chili peppers on his back,

513
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,400
 bag of his father's bones again, just ready to go,

514
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,400
 like a snack pack, and then the dogs chase after him.

515
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:39,400
 Burner, we're like, "That is real." So basically one version, the son is kind of wronged.

516
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,400
 He's getting vengeance for his dad banging his wife.

517
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
 The second version, he's just a spoiled kid.

518
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,400
 The narrator goes, "Yeah, but there's another version."

519
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,400
 We're like, "Oh, okay. Is it wildly different than either version we've ever heard?"

520
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,400
 And the narrator goes, "Quite. It's quite odd. It's a quite different variation of those."

521
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,400
 The Whistler is an awful kid.

522
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,400
 But that has something in common with that.

523
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,400
 So awful that he basically sex, drugs, rock, and roll.

524
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,400
 Like, he's just out of control.

525
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,400
 He ends up going to prison for a crime that's not really detailed.

526
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,400
 And in prison, he tries to figure stuff out and goes,

527
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,400
 "You know, maybe I should be a better son. Maybe I should be a better person."

528
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,400
 He ends up getting out of prison, goes home.

529
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,400
 And one day he's walking with his father down by the river.

530
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,400
 And he goes, "Hey, Dad, you see that tree there?

531
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,400
 See that tree there? It's all crooked and bent.

532
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,400
 Could you straighten that tree out?"

533
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,400
 And the father goes, "Well..."

534
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,400
 You know, when it was a young tree, I probably could have straightened it out.

535
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,400
 Like, we could have done things to correct it, so it would grow strong and tall.

536
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
 But at this point, now it's crooked.

537
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,400
 And the son goes, "That's what I thought."

538
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,400
 You see, when I was a kid, you could have straightened me out.

539
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:56,400
 You could have done things to make me strong and tall.

540
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,400
 But now I'm just too crooked and bent.

541
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,400
 And that's your fault.

542
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,400
 Slits his guts open.

543
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,400
 His father falls to his knees, guts pouring out.

544
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,400
 Whistler standing over him.

545
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,400
 He didn't laugh. That's not in the legend.

546
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
 But that ver--

547
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,400
 And then the grandfather finds out whipping chili peppers, dogs, and the bag of bones.

548
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,400
 So that version--they're all radically different, really.

549
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,400
 One of them, the kid, is truly wronged.

550
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,400
 There wasn't even a fourth version where the father killed--was banging his wife and then killed his wife.

551
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,400
 And so the interesting thing about the story is that it's half spirit--

552
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,400
 Some versions, he's a spirit of vengeance, and some versions, he's a spoiled brat.

553
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:45,400
 And so that's where things get complicated, because a lot of times these cryptids represent some sort of, like, moral lesson.

554
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:53,400
 And El Saban, his origin story is so wildly different that it's hard to say what the moral lesson is.

555
00:26:53,400 --> 00:27:00,400
 And even his targets. So this creature is now a 19-foot-tall apparition.

556
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,400
 And who will kill you? And this is his target list.

557
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,400
 And it's funny, at the beginning of the podcast I said his target is you.

558
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,400
 I don't know why I said that, 'cause I--well, you might be.

559
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,400
 So let me read this. These are his main victims.

560
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,400
 Men cheating on their wives.

561
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,400
 Which is really weird, victim class.

562
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,400
 We've ran into a bunch of cryptids that do that, but I'm always a little surprised.

563
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:27,400
 And I get it, probably the people who are mostly telling these cryptid stories, these folktales over the years,

564
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,400
 are most likely housewives, so they're like, "Yes."

565
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:36,400
 And then the guy cheated on his wife, and his stomach was ripped out, and the kids are like, "Oh, I'm never cheating on my wife."

566
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:41,400
 But, I mean, it's still--it's an interesting victim class, nonetheless.

567
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,400
 Drunkards. He has a special penalty for drunkards.

568
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,400
 If you are an alcoholic--I don't even know if you have to be an alcoholic.

569
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,400
 I just think you might have tied one too many on.

570
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,400
 You're walking home. You pass out in the middle of the road.

571
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:56,400
 Hopefully not in the middle of the road. You pass out in the bushes or something like that.

572
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:02,400
 Elsebun will walk up to you, put his mouth to your belly button, and suck the alcohol out.

573
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,400
 Which, to me, is doing me a favor.

574
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:11,400
 If I'm so drunk, I pass out at the side of the road, and then I wake up, and there's another man sucking the alcohol out of my belly button.

575
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:16,400
 I'm gonna be a little weirded out, but, you know, we might be able to make this work.

576
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,400
 We might be able to make this cryptid work.

577
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,400
 He also attacks--this is where it gets weird--pregnant women.

578
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:29,400
 He's sucking belly button alcohol out of the hobos, but when I say attack, he's killing people who cheat on their wives.

579
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,400
 He's killing pregnant women. He's also killing just random people, innocent people.

580
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,400
 So if you're not a drunkard, if you're a drunkard, you're getting off pretty good.

581
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:43,400
 So I guess the moral of the story is if you live in Venezuela, be a hardcore alcoholic, otherwise this guy's going to kill you.

582
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:48,400
 Now, he's called the whistler because he whistles.

583
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,400
 Now, he has this little do-do-do-do-do.

584
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,400
 And it's a trick.

585
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,400
 He loves whistling. That's not a trick. It's a real hobby of his.

586
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:03,400
 But if you hear the whistle far away, that means he's right behind you.

587
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,400
 But if you hear it super close to you, that means he's far away.

588
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,400
 Which is kind of a stupid trick.

589
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:14,400
 It should be if you hear it close to you, he's right behind you, and if you hear it far away, he's right behind you.

590
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:20,400
 I don't understand the point of him being right next to you whistling in your ear and you being safe.

591
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,400
 He also says this weird thing where he comes to your house late at night.

592
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:28,400
 He lays down his bag of bones outside your door, and he'll count them.

593
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,400
 And you're like, "Well, Jason, it's his dad's bones."

594
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:37,400
 You think he would already know--I forgot to tell you this--when he kills you, he strips the meat off your bones and throws your bones in the bag.

595
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,400
 So it actually gets harder and harder for him to count.

596
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:45,400
 As time goes on, he throws the bag of bones by your front door, and he counts the bones one by one.

597
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:52,400
 If you wake up, if you hear the noise and you wake up and you go, "Hey, what's going on?"

598
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,400
 You get good luck. Because he leaves--well, that's the first part of good luck.

599
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,400
 There's no longer a 19-foot-tall monster outside your door.

600
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,400
 He leaves. He bounces out.

601
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,400
 But if he counts every single bone and no one wakes up, someone in the house is going to die.

602
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:10,400
 That's stupid. Because I can tell you right now there's like, what, 103 bones in the human body or something like that?

603
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,400
 You're telling me this dude's counting toe bones and stuff like that?

604
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:18,400
 How many bones are just in the tail? Tail bone of a human is stupid.

605
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,400
 Plus, every time you kill someone, he's adding more bones. It doesn't make sense.

606
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,400
 Other--he'd be like 10,000 in one, 10,000.

607
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,400
 You're obviously going to wake up to that because eight days have gone by.

608
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,400
 At some point, you're going to get up to go get the newspaper.

609
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,400
 There's a 19-foot-tall monster counting bones on your driveway.

610
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,400
 You're like, "Hey, man, what's up?" Because I got good luck.

611
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,400
 And he's like, "I guess you do." Walks off, heads off to the nearest bar.

612
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,400
 The parking lot of the nearest bar.

613
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,400
 Then we get to his weaknesses, which I love weaknesses.

614
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,400
 His weaknesses are sounds.

615
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,400
 This might be one of the easiest cryptids to defeat.

616
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,400
 He'll run away if he hears any of these two sounds.

617
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,400
 The sound of a whip.

618
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,400
 [whipping]

619
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,400
 So just have a copy of Indiana Jones wherever you're at.

620
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,400
 Just have a little portable DVD player. Ready to go.

621
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,400
 The sound of a dog barking? Seriously, dude?

622
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,400
 So basically, you can't go into any neighborhood. Ever.

623
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,400
 There's dogs everywhere. He hates sounds of dog barking.

624
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,400
 Also, he hates chili peppers.

625
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,400
 I'm going to have to say that this guy needs to leave the South America.

626
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,400
 I mean, there's not a lot of whips down there, but there's a lot of dogs,

627
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,400
 and there's definitely a lot of chili peppers.

628
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,400
 So this guy--and thanks for the recommendation, too, Gustavo.

629
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,400
 I don't think I said that earlier.

630
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,400
 Generally, with these stories, they're moral lessons.

631
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,400
 And the moral lessons tend to start in the beginning.

632
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,400
 You had a woman who was vain. She becomes a monster.

633
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,400
 You had a woman who was sleeping with a priest. She becomes a horse with no head.

634
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,400
 This one, there's no definitive answer to who this guy is.

635
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:55,400
 The only thing we know, the only thing that's similar in all these stories is how he died.

636
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:00,400
 I think some people want to make him out as an avenging angel who kills men

637
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,400
 who cheat on their wives and attacks drunkards.

638
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:09,400
 And other people have turned them into this bent figure that will attack anyone on site.

639
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,400
 So who knows where this story came from?

640
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:21,400
 The fact that they all have the same ending makes me think that they are from some sort of central source,

641
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:26,400
 which can sometimes mean that the original legend itself is true,

642
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:31,400
 i.e. a man was killed by his grandfather with whips, chili peppers,

643
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,400
 and then forced to carry a bag of bones while being attacked by dogs.

644
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:39,400
 That may have happened at some--I'm sure that's happened at some point in human history,

645
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,400
 but that may have happened in Venezuela.

646
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:46,400
 This legend is also spread to Colombia at this point as well, but it's a Venezuelan legend to start off with.

647
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,400
 But what is the moral lesson behind this cryptid?

648
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:55,400
 Is it truly a creature that stalks the night just attacking people randomly?

649
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:06,400
 Or is it trying to correct the wrongs that his own father did by cheating on his mother with the whistler's own wife?

650
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:15,400
 The only way you'll know which story is true is if you hear that whistle one night.

651
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,400
 And if you do, just remember.

652
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,400
 If you hear it close, you're safe.

653
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,400
 If you hear it far away, it's right behind you.

654
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:32,400
 But that's if that part of the legend is true as well.
