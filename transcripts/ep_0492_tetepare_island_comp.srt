1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
 A woman finds out that nothing in life is truly free, but she didn't expect it to be that expensive.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:14,320
 And then we travel to the Solomon Islands, where a massive island sits uninhabited to this day.

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:21,600
 Stories of villagers being chased off by a spirit is one thing, but why did an entire company shut

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,720
 down? Where they also afraid of the monsters of Titi Pear Island today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:40,640
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter,

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,480
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. We got a lot of stuff to cover,

7
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,640
 so we're gonna slide right into this like it's a big old slip and slide. First off, I want to give

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:55,040
 a shout out to one of our legacy Patreons, Ash Knotts. Not astronauts, although that would be cool.

9
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,720
 If they supported the show, Ash Knotts, actually a good friend of mine and a patron of the show,

10
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,240
 really, really appreciate it. You're gonna be our captain, our pilot, you're gonna do all sorts of

11
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,160
 cool stuff today. You can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. Just help get the word out about

12
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,680
 the show. That really, really helps out a lot. So Ash, let's go ahead and get suited up here.

13
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,960
 First off, I don't know why we're wearing suits, you can wear your normal clothes, you don't need to

14
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,600
 get suited up. First off, let's hop inside the Jason Jalopy. We are leaving behind Oregon,

15
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,240
 and we're just taking a little drive up north. We're headed to Spanaway, Washington.

16
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:36,880
 That's the sound the car makes. We're in Beverly Hill, Billy's car. Oddly enough, that's the theme song

17
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,880
 for Green Acres, but it doesn't matter, because most of you have never seen either of those shows.

18
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,160
 We're driving up to Spanaway, Washington. This story's pretty recent. This story happened on

19
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:53,040
 February 5th, 2020. We're gonna park outside this house, this little house. Looks like a normal house,

20
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,160
 as opposed to those floating houses in other cities, the orbs. This is a normal house in

21
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:04,800
 Spanaway, Washington, and inside we hear a little mommy going, "Hush little baby, don't say a word.

22
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:11,360
 Mom is gonna buy you a more given." And we're like, "Oh, that's kind of sweet." We're gonna knock on the

23
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,360
 door and see what was up, but we're just like mesmerized by this mama song. She has a little baby.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,560
 She has a newborn baby, and she's like, "Man, this baby's so awesome. If only I could get photos of

25
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,440
 this baby, but I don't have a way to take pictures. It's not like I don't have a cell phone or access

26
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:32,080
 to webcams or anything like that. No. I want to invite a stranger into my house to take photos

27
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:39,200
 of my newborn baby." So little mommy's holding her baby. She's like, "Okay, hit this button to send

28
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,840
 strangers to my house now." So Juliet Parker, she's 38 years old. She'd been posting ads on

29
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,640
 Facebook saying, "I will take free photos of your baby. I'm trying to build up my portfolio."

30
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,280
 Then when you read her comment, there's a little emoticon of eyes shifting from side to side.

31
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,040
 She shows up to this woman's house and she rings her 16-year-old daughter along as well.

32
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,320
 So we're gonna sneak in the house as well, so we're kind of sitting in the back watching this

33
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,400
 stuff. So Juliet Parker comes over and she's like, "Hey, new mom. Yeah, I'm the person who's

34
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,200
 gonna take free photos of your baby and not only am I doing it for free, I brought you a present.

35
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,360
 Here is a glass of wine and a cupcake." Now that should be suspicious right off the bat,

36
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,360
 because not only is she doing it for free, now she's in the tank. Like now she's basically like

37
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,440
 out money doing this thing. But the mom's not thinking it. She puts her baby down.

38
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,360
 Woman's taking a bunch of pictures of the baby and every so often, allegedly, this is all allegedly,

39
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,280
 every so often Juliet allegedly looks over at the mom. She sees the glass of wine, she's the cupcake.

40
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,880
 "Hey, are you gonna drink that and eat that? That's how consumables normally work." And the

41
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,800
 mom's like, "Yeah, yeah, sorry, I forgot." She goes to take a drink of the wine. "Oh, maybe you should

42
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,400
 take a picture of the baby like this." And Juliet's like, "Just drink the wine." Click, click, taking

43
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,400
 pictures of the baby. Eventually, she does start drinking the wine. The mom's like, "Mm-mm-mm-mm."

44
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,200
 "Oh, yummy. Oh, I got this cupcake too. You gave me this, right?" And Juliet's like, "Yeah, yeah."

45
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,760
 So the mom starts eating the cupcake. They're taking baby pictures. Everything seems relatively

46
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,320
 normal other than the fact that a stranger is in her house taking photos of her baby. But she

47
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,240
 starts to notice something. Whenever Juliet touches something, she's like, "Oh, here, let me move this

48
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,720
 for this shot." And she'd move something on the coffee table. She'd then wipe down where she

49
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:27,520
 previously touched. This is before coronavirus, okay? This would not be abnormal now. Actually,

50
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,040
 bringing a stranger in her home would be the worst part of the story. This is before coronavirus

51
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,480
 really took off. February 5th. She would touch stuff and she's like, "Oh, look at this. You,

52
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,080
 look at this award you won for tennis." And then she'd set it down and she'd wipe it off.

53
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:48,000
 At this point, the mom's getting a little drowsy. Oh, what? What's going on? She starts getting a

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,920
 little drowsy, starting to get a little weak. She throws up where she throws up while they're

55
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,200
 taking a picture of the baby. The baby's like, "What? The mom is throwing up in the background."

56
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:03,840
 I don't feel good. And Juliet's like, "Oh, no, no, no, no. You look great, honey. You're just losing

57
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,800
 weight." You have that new mom glow. This is what all new moms go through. She's continuing taking

58
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,320
 pictures of this baby. And as the mom's throwing up, she's realizing something else through the haze

59
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:22,240
 of misery that Juliet is taking now selfies with her holding the baby. You don't get a photographer

60
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,440
 to come over to photo bomb the photos you're in. She's taking photos of herself holding the baby.

61
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,800
 At that point, she kicks her out. She's like, "Okay, listen, something's wrong. I drink your wine.

62
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:40,640
 I ate your cupcake. I'm throwing up. That's not what cupcakes normally do. Now you're taking a picture

63
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,240
 of my baby and you're wiping it on your fingerprints. Get out. Get out. Get out." She rushes them out.

64
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,920
 And then she's like, "Well, that was an afternoon. I invited strangers over to my house and who would

65
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:56,080
 have thought they would act like total weirdos and drug me?" She realizes her house keys are missing.

66
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:03,440
 So she calls the cops. And the cops come out and they start investigating Juliet Parker.

67
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:10,400
 It turns out that she had contacted other women with newborns saying, "Hey, I'd like to take pictures

68
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,400
 of your babies." Now, that's not super suspicious because she was saying she's trying to build

69
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,960
 portfolio and all that stuff. But all the photos she took were of babies five weeks or younger.

70
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,680
 And she was talking to her ex-boyfriend once and she's like, "Hey, so how things go? And you

71
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,760
 know, you moved on, stuff like that. So, hey, do you know how I can get some GHB? What? What? Yeah,

72
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:37,200
 yeah, you know, the old date rape drug. Do you know how I can get some? You know, used to be my

73
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:43,760
 boyfriend. So I kind of know you're into some crazy stuff." Ex is like, "Okay." And she would say

74
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:49,520
 the ex would say, "Yeah, that was a red flag, right?" She's always talking about how I can get

75
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,400
 her GHB. But then I remember one time we were hanging out and she's like, "Honey, you know what would

76
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:01,120
 be great? You know what would be awesome? If we found a homeless person, a homeless person who had a

77
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,400
 little homeless baby, and we took that baby from that homeless person and we raised that little

78
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:13,280
 homeless baby, that little homeless baby in a home, wouldn't that be awesome?" Boyfriend, I imagine was

79
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,240
 basically fliming through the stations and halfway through her speech kind of paused.

80
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,040
 And my first thought was, how many homeless babies are there? Now, don't get me wrong, they exist.

81
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:31,280
 But I imagine they would be relatively hard to find. Like a five-week-old homeless baby. Maybe,

82
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,920
 hopefully, I'm right on that. Hopefully, it's very, very hard to find a homeless baby. Hopefully,

83
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:44,560
 it's hard to find, right? And I'm trying really hard to avoid making jokes about a baby carrying a

84
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,040
 spindle, but it has a diaper on the end of the stick. Because that would be a bad taste if I made a

85
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:55,440
 joke about a baby being homeless. But I know like they would most likely end up in foster care and

86
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,040
 stuff like that. It would probably be pretty hard. It's not like, you know, homeless people are sitting

87
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,600
 out there with their dog, spare change, or they're sitting out there and they have a box. There's

88
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:09,840
 like three or four infants walking around in the box. Is that joke? I'm sorry if that joke was tasteless.

89
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,640
 But anyways, I don't imagine, I think most of the time, I think most of the time they just end

90
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:19,520
 up in the foster care system, right? I can imagine when the cop has came to talk to the ex-boyfriend,

91
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,720
 he's like, let me guess, baby stuff. And the cops are like, what? Let me guess, my ex-girlfriend was

92
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,760
 doing something weird trying to take a baby because here's all the stuff she told me that was baby

93
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:35,840
 related during the course of her investigation. So she is under arrest now. She's currently facing

94
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:41,840
 charges for trying to steal that baby. She's basically charged with kidnapping. What they figured

95
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:48,000
 was she was going to get the mom to pass out and take the baby or with the house keys, let herself

96
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,920
 back in. Moral of the story. Don't trust anyone on Facebook. It's bad enough when people are posting

97
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,120
 stupid stuff on Facebook and I have to just mute people all day long. I stop even going to Facebook.

98
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,560
 So Facebook is not only a place for political discussions or for people to

99
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:11,520
 air their views on society in a very civil way. No, it's also a cesspool of baby kidnappers.

100
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,120
 So if you have a baby out there, you're like, oh my goodness, I do when you look over and there's

101
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,200
 a baby sitting right next to you. I forgot I had you. Hey, what's up, Jimmy? If you have a baby out

102
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,520
 there, be on the lookout for anyone giving you wine and cupcakes unless it's your birthday and

103
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,880
 you're an alcoholic and they are your friend and they hate babies, then it is allowed. That's the

104
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,800
 only time that you're allowed to have that. Ash, let's go in and fire up that fabled carpenter

105
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,840
 copter. We're leaving behind Washington. We're waving goodbye to little baby. Little baby's waving.

106
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,480
 We're waving goodbye to the mom. Ash is flying the copter. I see her drinking wine and eating a

107
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,120
 cupcake. Where'd you get that at? She's like, what? No, I'm hungry. She's flying away. The helicopter

108
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,600
 is starting to dip. Luckily, we get her stomach pumped. We land in a local hospital. We get her

109
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,840
 stomach pumped. She's ready to actually fly the carpenter copter. Now, check her. Make sure she

110
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,040
 doesn't have any more cupcakes or wine. We are headed out to an island I'm almost for sure I'm

111
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,640
 mispronouncing, but it's a daily podcast and I don't have time to check. We are headed out

112
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:19,520
 to TT Pear. The helicopter is flying over the Pacific Ocean. This is in the Solomon Islands.

113
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:24,320
 Technically, Solomon Islands is then a geographical location called Oceana,

114
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,480
 which I thought honestly was just made up for 1984, but apparently it's a real place. It's like a

115
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,880
 nation, not even a nation. It's just like a continent of water, maybe would be a good way to put it.

116
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:42,560
 We're flying over there. I found out about this island from a Reddit user named Murderber.

117
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,840
 Murderber. It was very, very fascinating. Murderber actually has some stories from this island

118
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,560
 themselves. So we're going to fly over to this island now. This island is near, just to give you

119
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,800
 a geographical area. This island is near Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands include Guadalcanal.

120
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:05,520
 So if you've played Battlefield 1942, it's that map. That map is real and it's here. So we're flying

121
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:12,560
 over Guadalcanal. It looks like PS2 era graphics, but it's still a fun game. Battlefield 2 was amazing.

122
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,200
 Flying over that, I'm looking and longing. I wish we could land there. No, we're going to TT Pear.

123
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,960
 So Ash, let's land on the beach here. Now there's a lodge here that people will use because there's

124
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:28,480
 a lot of research teams come and check this place out. This island has what they call biodiversity.

125
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,720
 There's just tons of different species. There's animals that have seemingly gone extinct in other

126
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,800
 places around this island. It's full of boars and pigs and all sorts of stuff. Reptiles and all

127
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,800
 sorts of animals you can think of. You have this little lodge there that people will stay at.

128
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,960
 And it's beautiful. It's beautiful. Lush green jungle, sandy beaches, fresh water. The soil is

129
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:53,680
 perfect for planting crops. But no people are on this island. It was abandoned almost a hundred

130
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,800
 years ago. So we started walking around the island. Parrot lands on our shoulders, feeding it little

131
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,960
 crackers, feeding it cupcakes. They're like, "We'll eat that parrot later." We're walking through this

132
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,520
 island. It's interesting because the Solomon Islands have, the Solomon Islands in total,

133
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:15,120
 have long had stories of giants. And we've talked about giants a lot on this show. Apparently there's

134
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,840
 giants on the island. To the point that the native population, it's kind of like, yeah,

135
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,520
 yeah, there's giants. Like whenever ected researchers go over there, they're like, "Oh,

136
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,280
 yeah, yeah, I know there's giants." There was one researcher who married into the culture and he

137
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,160
 goes, "How come you guys are just kind of like sitting on this giant information? It would be

138
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:38,240
 big news to the rest of the world." And we just kind of look at him and they're like, "Well, it's

139
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,720
 he said he goes, it's weird because to them, the giant stories are so normal that over the years

140
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,120
 as whalers were stopping by and other cultures were stopping by, they never really talked about it.

141
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,200
 It would be the equivalent of someone came and visited you in your hometown and you're like,

142
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,000
 dude, let me tell you about squirrels. You wouldn't even think about it. I mean,

143
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,400
 unless that was your weird fetish. But you wouldn't even think about it. To them, it was just this

144
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,840
 thing that, "Oh, yeah, look out for that guy. He's 20 feet tall." But other than that, they have a story

145
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:14,560
 of one of their own, one of the islanders goes missing for 25 years. Everyone just assumes she's

146
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,800
 dead, which I think he would. I mean, after 25 days, you're kind of like, "Oh, this probably isn't

147
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,880
 going to end well." 25 years later, this woman comes running through the jungle and a bunch of

148
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,960
 villagers like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down." And she does because she falls to the ground and they

149
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:34,000
 notice she's slimy. She's super slick. Go to pick her up. They're trying to carry it. She's

150
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,320
 squippin' out of their arms. It's not a word, but you understand what's going on.

151
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,560
 She's like, "You're trying to grab a banana and your hands are covered in Vaseline."

152
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,320
 So eventually, the villagers are like, "Okay, this is getting annoying." So they make a bed out of

153
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,080
 giant leaves and they carry the leaves and carry her back into the village. Now, they notice something.

154
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,480
 One, she's completely incoherent. She's babbling. They can't figure out what it was. They don't

155
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:05,120
 really ever say what the slime is. Secondly, she's pregnant. And she does give birth. I forgot the

156
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:11,440
 shoe baby stories in this one. She gives birth to this little baby. Now, she's again incoherent,

157
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,840
 but they decide to name the baby Mango. Maybe she cried out the name Mango in the middle of her

158
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:24,480
 incoherent ramblings. And he's super furry. And they're like, "Uh, yes, one of them giants, one of

159
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:31,120
 them giant babies." Luckily, she survived childbirth. She gives birth to Mango. He's a hairy baby monster

160
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,520
 boy. And eventually, by the time the kid reached age five, the villagers just killed him. They're

161
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:44,880
 just like, "Nope, this is creepy." And we know that at best, this kid's going to be like eight feet

162
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,880
 tall. Like, even if he's just half human, half giant, he's going to be a big old kid. Okay,

163
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,840
 that is not, I'm not, Ted Rabbit Radio is not endorsing. Well, if your kid's a giant, oh, it's

164
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:02,080
 okay. I'm not obviously endorsing that. That was them. Do not, do not say, "Well, you know, I heard

165
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:07,520
 Jason say the other day on his show that if the kid's big, you better dig a big grave." I didn't

166
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,520
 say that. So, it was just well known that there was giants wandering around in the jungle, but

167
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:16,560
 we're not here for the giants. We're not here for the giants. Also, you had a ship visit the Solomon

168
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,960
 Islands. Well, you had a bunch of ships, but one ship in particular visited the Solomon Islands in

169
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:27,520
 1593. And there was a guy who was doing an almanac. He was making maps. He'd have the normal thing.

170
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,400
 Here's a real duck. Here's a real bird. It's said underneath it, real bird. No, he was doing all the

171
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:39,200
 stuff, but one of the creatures he profiled was a dragon. What's known locally as the Solomon Island

172
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:45,760
 Dragon Snake. And from 1593 and before to today, there's still sightings of this beast that flies

173
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:51,680
 above the jungle. And it has a unique ability. It shoots out fireballs. It's not like a stream of

174
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:58,640
 fire, which you could kind of imagine maybe they're pushing out methane and their tongue is like flint.

175
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,400
 I saw that on some show when I was a kid, but they're lighting methane in their bellies,

176
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,680
 dragging the rope. So, it shoots out fireballs and you'd have villagers be like,

177
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,840
 "You won't believe the day I just had. Yeah, I was at the supermarket. I was behind stuff. And

178
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:15,360
 what do you know? A dragon snake's flying around and that's why I'm late." So, you'd still have

179
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,720
 sightings like that, but we're not even here for the dragon snakes. We're here because specifically

180
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:27,760
 at Tete Par Island, it's empty. So, let's take a look at this island. Back in the 19th century,

181
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:34,240
 you had people slowly start filtering off the island, which again, the island is an untouched

182
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,880
 jewel. It wasn't because of lack of food. It wasn't because of lack of water. It was because people

183
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,120
 started to feel uneasy on the island. People started to leave the island, go into neighboring

184
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,280
 islands in the area. Scientists, historians look back and go, "We think dysentery hit. There was a

185
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:56,320
 disease that started killing people off. We think it may have come from some of the wailing ships in

186
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,080
 the area. We don't know presumably, but it could have been something else, but these natives were

187
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:06,560
 getting dysentery. So, people were leaving the island. Then you started to have wars. Now,

188
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,880
 all the islands were constantly attacking each other, sometimes it was almost done as sport,

189
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,480
 but you started to see different tribes or inter-tribal warfare even. Tribes split in half,

190
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,280
 going to war with each other. That was weird in and of itself, even though you would have

191
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,080
 people fighting. It was generally island versus island. To have people fight on the same island

192
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:33,920
 was odd in and of itself. Rendova is the closest island to Tete Par, and that is where our source

193
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:39,920
 murder bur is from. This was the story that he had heard. He goes, "The official story is

194
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,560
 people started getting sick. There was conflict on the island, and over time people started spreading

195
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:51,040
 out." But he goes, "In our culture, there's another answer for this." Rendova at one point said,

196
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,800
 "You know what? It would be fun. It's Saturday, right? You guys want to do something cool?" And

197
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:00,480
 then he was like, "Yeah, let's go over to Tete Par and just mess them up. Sick them with a couple

198
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,440
 spears, give them a couple noogies. It'll be a fun afternoon." So they get a war party together.

199
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:12,480
 They take their canoes across to Tete Par, and right when they get to shore, something feels off.

200
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:21,200
 All the large canoes are gone. That's weird. They start thinking, "Did they have the same idea?

201
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,280
 They got bored on a Saturday? There's a war party in our part of the land?" They're walking around,

202
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:33,200
 they get to a village, and it's just dead people. Unburied dead people. This is back in the 19th

203
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,480
 century, so it's not like they could just pick up a phone and be like, "Hey, so is anything suspicious

204
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,000
 happening back home because it's pretty scary here?" A bunch of unburied dead people, which was

205
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,600
 totally not acceptable in that culture. In most cultures, it's not acceptable. They continue to

206
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,880
 look around the island. There's no one alive in the portion where they're at. So they just

207
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:01,760
 pack up, get on their canoes, and head back home. That was the start of the legend of what was going

208
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,840
 on on the island. The people who had left the island before, they had no idea what happened,

209
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,840
 but they were getting a weird vibe. You've had researchers today go there, like I said,

210
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,720
 there's a lodge that people go to and from, but it is an abandoned island. It is a desert island.

211
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,960
 I didn't know this, but I always thought it was a deserted island. A desert island means

212
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,240
 an island with no people on it. You said it doesn't actually have to be a sandy island. It's just an

213
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,600
 island with no humans. People go there, researchers go there, hunters will go there, a great hunting.

214
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,880
 People will come from Rendova to that island to hunt, but you have to be careful where you go

215
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,000
 because people get lost. Like anywhere, right? You can get lost in Manhattan. You can get lost

216
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,160
 in Idaho, but you usually find your way back. The problem is that it seems to not happen to people

217
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:54,960
 who go too far into the jungle. They just disappear. And since the locals don't really like the island,

218
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,560
 they will go there to hunt and to fish. They don't like being in the jungle after nightfall. And

219
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:06,000
 what's interesting is if you have to get from point A to point B on the island, let's say you

220
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,880
 want to go to another part of the island, you don't cut right through it. You will take the

221
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,320
 long way. You will go back to the beach and walk along the coastline to get where you're going.

222
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:22,640
 You do not cut through the middle of the island. Murtuber has a story that when they were a little

223
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:28,880
 kid, they spoke relatively good English and there was a researcher who wanted to see some

224
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,160
 things on the island. So Murtuber goes, "Yeah, I'll do it." They're walking around the island.

225
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:42,560
 It starts to get dark. And Murtuber is like, "I don't want to do this anymore. Like this is super

226
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:47,200
 spooky. It's dark and we definitely don't want to be in the jungle after night." Researchers

227
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,720
 researcher. They're not thinking about spirits or evil legends or things like that. But whatever,

228
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,440
 their guide, their 10-year-old kid wants to go back, whatever. We can always reconfine tomorrow.

229
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,000
 So the researcher has some sort of navigational device. Murtuber goes, "I don't even know what

230
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,880
 it was. I was 10, but it was some sort of device that would show directions, most like a GPS device."

231
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,560
 And so researchers looking at it and being like, "Okay, so we want to get to the coastline. We go

232
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:21,280
 this way." So they start walking and Murtuber goes, "No, no, no, no, no. No. Do the coast. I mean,

233
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:27,040
 it's an island, so the coast is in any direction, but the coast that part we want to go to is this way."

234
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,960
 The researcher's like, "No, no, no. According to this GPS, we go this way."

235
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:37,040
 He starts walking again and the kid's like, "No, no, no. I'm glad your fancy device tells

236
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:42,000
 you to go that way, but I'm going to tell you right now. The way it's pointing is away from

237
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,240
 or supposed to go, and not only is it away from it's supposed to go, it's pointing us to the

238
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,960
 densest part of the jungle. I'm not going that way. And I'm especially not going that way

239
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,480
 with the sunsetting." And they actually got an argument. They were arguing back and forth,

240
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,960
 and eventually, I think it comes down to this, the researcher goes, again, assuming this story is

241
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,920
 true. All of this historical stuff is true. This story is a first-person account. The researcher

242
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:11,040
 at a certain point has to go, "Okay, here's my choice. I can either follow my device, which I know

243
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:17,440
 works, or I can ab- because the murder ber wasn't going that way." It's like, "Okay, I can- if I've

244
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,920
 trust the kid and we're wrong, then we're wrong, but if I- if the kid doesn't go with me, I can't

245
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:27,200
 abandon a 10-year-old. What do you think? I am some sort of woman in Washington who's trying to drug

246
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,560
 moms and take their babies, allegedly?" "No, I'm a better human than that." So eventually, the researcher

247
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,000
 goes, "Fine, we'll go the direction you want to go on, but it's probably going to lead us in the

248
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,320
 wrong way. We'll end up spending the night in the jungle anyways, but your funeral." He didn't

249
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:46,000
 actually say that, but fine, we'll go your way. They end up- the kid was right. Takes them right

250
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,480
 to the coastline. The GPS unit was directing them to go deeper into the jungle, and at that point,

251
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,120
 the researcher, when they see the coast, the researcher's puzzled. "Hmm, I must research this.

252
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,920
 Someone's doing my job." And begins fiddling with the machine, and the machine now, when it says,

253
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,920
 "Where's the coast?" or where their direction is, it's right where they're headed, because you can

254
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,960
 see it now. But when they're in the middle of the jungle, couldn't see anything, and it was telling

255
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:17,680
 them to go deeper, deeper in where people go missing. All of these things are superstitious

256
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:25,440
 stories, right? Tales of disappearing tribes in the 1900s, giants, dragons flying around. All of this

257
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,280
 stuff can be chalked up to superstition. There's an interesting footnote to the story, and actually

258
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,280
 what made me want to cover it. I mean, I think the island itself is pretty fascinating, because it

259
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:42,400
 still stands today. It's completely uninhabited. There's one thing you can easily spook off a person.

260
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:50,400
 You can even spook off a town or a city. You can spook people out of living in places, but the hardest

261
00:23:50,400 --> 00:24:01,040
 thing to scare is money, is human greed. A lot of times, people will do insane things, scary

262
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:08,560
 things for money. There was a coconut farm that was operating on Titi Par in the 19- I think they

263
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:18,160
 opened in the 1930s. Extremely successful coconut farm. They were moving 250 to 330 tons of coconuts

264
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:24,240
 a year. It was the largest exporter of coconuts in this region. Not just on that island, but in

265
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:33,280
 that archipelago or oceanic. 250 to 330 tons of coconuts a year. Then World War II started.

266
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:40,640
 Guadalcanal was a major battle point between the allies and the Axis powers. They abandoned the

267
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:46,240
 factory during World War II, which is what you would want to do. There's a difference between

268
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,120
 being like, "I'm not afraid of a ghost and be a businessman as ghosts are possessing all your

269
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,880
 employees." It's another thing to have bombs dropping around you. Honestly, they probably

270
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,960
 stayed in operation a little bit longer than they were supposed to, but they did abandon it during

271
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,280
 the war because there were a lot of violent battles over there. Because I played a lot of

272
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:09,920
 Battlefield 1942. I know those Japanese spawn points are very hard to take. After World War II,

273
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:15,280
 though, they opened the farm back up. They're pushing out those coconuts 250 to 330 tons of

274
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:21,760
 coconuts and they're hollow, dude. Do you know how many coconuts that must be? It's gone. The factory's

275
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:30,080
 gone. The factory is closed. It's abandoned. They just shut down. That's odd. That would be like an

276
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,960
 oil... Think about how many stories we hear about haunted mines. And a lot of times they're like,

277
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,360
 "People refuse to work in there." And then eventually, 10 years later, they shut it down.

278
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:45,520
 Because this doesn't exist anymore. It's just decaying buildings. The official reason is labor

279
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:51,760
 unrest. Labor unrest. But you can import it. If it's just the labor and we've seen it in so many

280
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,560
 other countries. If people want to unionize, they just shut down the union. If it gets really bad,

281
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:02,000
 we've seen it in other countries. They start violently putting down labor. You can. I mean,

282
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,880
 those coconuts are just ready for... If you own a coconut farm and you're looking to expand,

283
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,080
 here's... You sponsor this podcast and also go to Titi Pear Island. All of the stuff is still there

284
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,840
 to do it. They left. What type of labor unrest could there be where you couldn't import more labor

285
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:24,400
 and build cheap camps for them to stay in? Like every other migrant factory and farm in the world.

286
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:30,320
 Something must be really bad there if someone's looking at that brown gold, which is what the

287
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:36,480
 coconuts are known as. But you didn't know that. That brown gold. And saying, "No, I don't want that."

288
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,200
 Thing about every episode of Scooby-Doo is some sort of businessman or some sort of like swindler

289
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:47,120
 pretending to be a ghost to scare people out. This island is so spooky, people don't want to operate

290
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:53,520
 a business on that island. Not a hotel. Not a coconut farm. Not a fishing village. Nothing.

291
00:26:53,520 --> 00:27:04,400
 Pristine, untouched land. Just sitting there. A place has to be exceptionally terrifying to turn away

292
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:11,760
 a human's motivation for money. And when it's as simple as plucking a coconut off of a tree

293
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:17,200
 and shipping it off in a box, it must be really bad when it gets dark at that place.

294
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:26,640
 How scary does a place have to be for even a business to say, "Nope, I'm good." I never thought

295
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:33,120
 anything could be so scary that could actually cancel out a human's motivation to make money.

296
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:40,000
 Something could be so mysterious in that jungle that I would rather not sell coconuts.

297
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,520
 I'd rather go somewhere else and leave all those coconuts untouched than to open my business

298
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:51,520
 back on that island. I didn't know anything could be that scary. But I've never spent the night

299
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,080
 on Ttpar Island.
