1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,260
 If you saw a loved one being kidnapped by aliens, what would you do?

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:12,400
 And then in my never ending quest to get this podcast taken off of YouTube, we take a look

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,640
 at the conspiracy.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:20,180
 Is COVID-19 actually an alien virus from another world?

5
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,480
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:32,360
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,360
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,360
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,840
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,400
 Hope you guys have some fun plans coming up this weekend.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,760
 We got a ton of stuff to cover so we're gonna get started right away.

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,120
 First off, take a look at this beautiful fan art submission from Goose Motion on our Patreon

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,280
 Discord.

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,720
 This is some graffiti.

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,120
 This is some graffiti that he didn't work.

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,080
 And it's awesome he said he painted it and other people started listening to the podcast.

17
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,680
 He probably thought he was some sort of weirdo.

18
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,680
 St. George's worth something.

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,600
 He's writing these weird glyphs on the wall.

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,440
 That's amazing Goose Motion.

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,440
 Thank you so much and for everyone at your workplace.

22
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,960
 Bow down to the new symbol.

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,160
 I don't know where he works, but this should become their corporate logo.

24
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,840
 Really, really appreciate it.

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,400
 Really appreciate taking over your workspace.

26
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,240
 And let's give a shout out to today's Patreon supporter coming into Dead Rabbit Command,

27
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,240
 walking on all fours, making little oinky noises.

28
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,240
 It's Piggy.

29
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,040
 I wasn't insulting the guy.

30
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,040
 Piggy is his name.

31
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,360
 Piggy, thank you so much for supporting the show.

32
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,920
 You're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

33
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,000
 You guys can't support the Patreon.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,280
 I totally understand.

35
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,120
 Just help spread the word about the show.

36
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,480
 Graffiti, paint your workplace in the logo.

37
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,000
 Help spread the word about the show.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,280
 Really, really, really helps out a lot.

39
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,160
 Really appreciate it.

40
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,680
 Now Piggy said, "I don't want to be in any disgusting episodes."

41
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
 Which is good.

42
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,800
 If you don't want to be in a disgusting episode, it's good to note that.

43
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,000
 So he's not on Monday's episode.

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,120
 Monday's episode is gonna be super gross.

45
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,400
 But for today's episode, Piggy, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead

46
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,400
 Rabbit Durgible.

47
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,000
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,360
 We're flying all the way out to Trenton, New Jersey.

49
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,960
 Piggy's like, "I said nothing disgusting, man.

50
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,960
 Nothing disgusting."

51
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:25,320
 As we see the sewage heap known as the state of New Jersey in the distance.

52
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,040
 The only thing I really know about New Jersey is Jersey Shore and the Sopranos.

53
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,040
 It's like super polluted, right?

54
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,040
 I don't know if that's still true.

55
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,640
 I don't know if it was ever true.

56
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,600
 That was a big stereotype in the '80s when I was growing up.

57
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,320
 That New Jersey is where New York dumped all their trash.

58
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,120
 So whether or not that's true, whether or not that holds any variant in truth, I heard

59
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,040
 it so many times in sitcoms and stand-up routines.

60
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,200
 I assume the state is just a giant pile of black plastic bags.

61
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,040
 But we're headed out there.

62
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,040
 It's July.

63
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,440
 I lost every listener in New Jersey.

64
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,680
 It's July 19th, 1948.

65
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,320
 We're in Trenton, New Jersey.

66
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,200
 It's 3.30 a.m.

67
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,600
 Very, very early in the morning.

68
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,320
 This little boy wakes up in his bed.

69
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,200
 We're gonna call him Sam.

70
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,200
 Sam wakes up.

71
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,120
 Sam wakes up in the middle of the night.

72
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,560
 We don't know how old he is.

73
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,920
 Maybe he's like 10, 11 years old.

74
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,240
 He wakes up in the middle of the night and something must alert him to kind of start

75
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:30,320
 skulking through the house because he ends up viewing, he ends up coming out and seeing

76
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,480
 five little men walking through his house.

77
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,480
 Now that was odd.

78
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,480
 He's like, "What?

79
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,200
 There shouldn't be any little men here.

80
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,760
 I'm the little man."

81
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,920
 But not only are they walking through the house, these five little dudes are carrying

82
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,040
 his mom down the stairs.

83
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,040
 That's a shocker.

84
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,400
 That's a total shocker.

85
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
 So he goes to interfere.

86
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,840
 He has this natural, "I gotta save my mommy."

87
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,400
 And so he goes to do that and all the bravery goes away when one of the little guys looks

88
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,160
 at him and says, "If you interfere, you will die."

89
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:10,240
 So Sam just starts to slowly back up as his mom is being carried down the stairs by these

90
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,760
 five little people.

91
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,440
 And he shuts the bedroom door.

92
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,800
 I'm assuming they don't give that detail, but I don't think he would leave it open.

93
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,400
 And he sees a bright light outside his bedroom window and he runs to the window and he throws

94
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,360
 back the drapes and looks.

95
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:35,720
 And now he sees his mom walking with the five men into a blinding white light.

96
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,680
 All six of them walking to the light.

97
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,680
 And then Sam says he doesn't remember falling asleep.

98
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,200
 He has no recollection of falling asleep.

99
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,920
 It's like, "Oh, well, that was exciting.

100
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,920
 See you later, mom.

101
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,920
 I'm gonna take a nap."

102
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,800
 Sam has no recollection of falling asleep, though.

103
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,880
 The next thing he remembers is, "Honey, honey, wake up."

104
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,560
 And his mom's like pushing his shoulder.

105
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,200
 You know how parents wake up, kids?

106
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,400
 "Wake up, wake up, honey."

107
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,680
 And Sam's like, "Uh, he's coming too."

108
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,480
 And it's his mom sitting there.

109
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,520
 "Oh, Sam, I'm so glad you're awake."

110
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,720
 And he notices his mom has this really sad look on her face.

111
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,680
 She looks at Sam and goes, "I have some bad news.

112
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,840
 I have some bad news.

113
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,400
 This morning I woke up and you know that dog you love so much.

114
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,760
 Rusty, rusty, your loyal pup.

115
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,280
 Oh, been there through thick and thin.

116
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,600
 Always been your best friend till the end."

117
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:38,360
 Well, Sam, the end came last night.

118
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,440
 The mom says that when she woke up, she was walking around the house and she saw that

119
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,600
 Rusty had killed himself accidentally.

120
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
 Accidentally.

121
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,240
 I don't know if there's like a bottle of pills next to him.

122
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,960
 She says, "I don't know what happened last night, Sam, but it looks like Rusty tried

123
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:02,400
 jumping out of the window and his collar got caught and he hung himself right outside

124
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,400
 the house."

125
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,400
 Right there.

126
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,480
 I left a body there for you to see.

127
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:13,720
 He must have seen an intruder and got so scared or so brave or both, he jumped out the window

128
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,440
 and he died.

129
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,200
 He's hanging or hung or hanged, whatever it is.

130
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,240
 And the mom pulls up a dictionary to figure out what the right word is.

131
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,280
 Anyway, your dog is dead.

132
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,320
 That story came from a set of UFO reports called Mysterious Reality.

133
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,960
 I got it from Albert Rosales, humanoid report, a great resource for this type of thing.

134
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,960
 Fascinating story.

135
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,600
 You could write off the first part as a dream, right?

136
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,200
 He was dreaming that he saw his mom.

137
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:50,560
 But the way that this event, if it's true, is set up is that the boy, Sam, did what the

138
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,160
 aliens said, or elves or gnomes or whatever they were, but tiny little people did what

139
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,640
 they said and went back where the dog didn't.

140
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,200
 That's what I got from when I read this story.

141
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,640
 I imagine they continue walking down the stairs and the dogs are...

142
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,040
 And the aliens go, "If you interfere, you will die."

143
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,840
 And the dog jumped like...

144
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,560
 I think that as she was walking in the light, the dog's like, "I'll rescue your mom."

145
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,800
 And he jumped out the window.

146
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,200
 And there's actually a couple different ways you can read this.

147
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,680
 One, I'm gonna go into a lot of ways a dog can die right now.

148
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,880
 So you might want to skip ahead 30 minutes.

149
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,960
 The dog jumps out the window and its collar gets caught and it hangs to death.

150
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,960
 That's possible.

151
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,120
 It's horrible, but it does happen.

152
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,840
 Or that the dog jumped out and the aliens hung him.

153
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,960
 They caught him in air and then they hung him.

154
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,200
 There's no part of the story that actually says that, but that would be chilling too.

155
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,460
 I mean, it would be horrible if the dog accidentally killed itself.

156
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:54,800
 But also if the dog interfered and the dog hung itself, it's also possible that this

157
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,000
 was a message to the boy as well.

158
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,280
 To show their power, they said, "If you interfere, we'll kill you."

159
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,840
 And he doesn't interfere, but the aliens go, "You know what, better send a message to

160
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,840
 this kid."

161
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,080
 One thing that's interesting, and I know if you're a victim of alien abductions, you're

162
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,280
 not gonna want to hear this, but one thing is interesting with alien abductions versus

163
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,320
 other paranormal activity.

164
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,000
 People who see ghosts, you know, you have like mediums and you have like psychics and stuff

165
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 like that.

166
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 I'm not talking about that.

167
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,400
 I've seen ghosts.

168
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,840
 And there are often long periods of time, like we're talking decades where I don't see another

169
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,840
 ghost.

170
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,840
 You may not see ghosts.

171
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,720
 It seems to be location-specific.

172
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,880
 And you may see a ghost in your childhood and never ever see another ghost.

173
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,080
 People who have alien encounters, they tend to have multiple alien encounters over the

174
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,080
 years.

175
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,480
 Whether or not they remember them is another thing, but it's when people talk about getting

176
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,800
 alien abducted by aliens, like they're walking through an alley and they get abducted by

177
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,680
 aliens, that is not always the end for that.

178
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,440
 It's like you're marked.

179
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,520
 So it's possible that they would, this might not have been the first time these aliens came

180
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,520
 to the house.

181
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,320
 It probably wasn't the last.

182
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,060
 This was the one time that Sam woke up to see it.

183
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,440
 And since he saw it and since he was going to remember that, maybe the aliens wanted

184
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,440
 to send the clear message.

185
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,440
 We're being serious.

186
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,600
 If you do see us again, do not interfere.

187
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,240
 We killed your dog last time.

188
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,240
 Next time we'll kill you.

189
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,640
 And they give him a little box with a dog collar with a little Sam name on it.

190
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,840
 Terrifying story, and there is a real difference between ghost hunters and even UFO hunters.

191
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,280
 They look up at the lights and be like, oh, look what's up in the sky.

192
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,800
 And alien abductees.

193
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:35,280
 There's a alien abductees I think falls more in the realm of people who are like possessed

194
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,280
 by demons.

195
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,800
 It's far more serious than me breaking into a haunted house, me being a ghost hunter,

196
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,600
 seeing ghosts interacting with ghosts.

197
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,240
 Once you start getting abducted by aliens, it's a little more serious.

198
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,240
 Once they're breaking into your house.

199
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,120
 So yeah, interesting story.

200
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,400
 We do see aliens kill people from time to time, not even including cattle medallions.

201
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,520
 Personally I believe cattle medallions are probably humans.

202
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,560
 I believe they happen.

203
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,600
 But I think it's the work of humans.

204
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,480
 For whatever reason, I still don't know.

205
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,640
 But we do see aliens kill people from time to time.

206
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,120
 We do still see them kill animals from time to time.

207
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,800
 And they may be responsible for some of the cattle medallions, sure.

208
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,920
 But yeah, just a creepy story.

209
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,960
 Even that, that's the same thing if you're living in a mafia controlled area or you're

210
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,840
 living in New Jersey.

211
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,160
 And you see something the mob doesn't want you to see so they kill a loved one.

212
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,560
 They kill little Rusty.

213
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,360
 Creepy creepy story.

214
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,040
 The moral of the story is if you ever see your mom in danger, just let her be.

215
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,200
 Just close your eyes and pretend she's not there.

216
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,360
 Nah, just joking.

217
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,040
 You should have jumped out of the window too, bro.

218
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,840
 You should have tried to rescue your mom.

219
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,920
 Then I guess you probably would have died, so don't do that.

220
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,200
 So basically the moral of the story is do not take advice from a man who hosts a paranormal

221
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,480
 podcast from within a haunted closet.

222
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,280
 Piggy, let's go ahead and touch the keys to the carbonicopter.

223
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,360
 We're leaving behind Trenton, New Jersey.

224
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,360
 We're gonna fly all the way out to...

225
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,440
 Again, again, I don't know why I'm tempting fate.

226
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,000
 Wuhan, China.

227
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:15,480
 As we're flying out there on my break, I saw some of the best movies I've seen in a long

228
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,480
 time.

229
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,000
 There was like a 48 hour period where I saw like 5 or 6 great movies in all these different

230
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,920
 genres and I wanted to share them with you.

231
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,800
 Nah, I'm not gonna do them all at once, but you guys know I do my Dead Rabbit Recommends

232
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,520
 and I can't wait to tell you about this first Dead Rabbit Recommends.

233
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,760
 I came across this movie, I'm gonna tell you this right now.

234
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,640
 The title, Super Generic, the movie poster, Super Generic.

235
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,880
 I saw the movie poster a couple years ago when it came out and I go, "What is this?

236
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:46,080
 Like Saw meets Tales from the Crypt meets some sort of horror anthology?"

237
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,360
 But I just happened to watch it the other day, dude.

238
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,880
 It is so dope.

239
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,280
 It's called Poker Night.

240
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,880
 And it's directed by Greg Francis and I looked him up.

241
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:01,680
 Greg Francis does a lot of true crime shows on Discovery Channel and investigation channels

242
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,960
 and stuff like that, you know, true TV, whatever.

243
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:09,440
 He does all of these true crime shows but nestled into his filmography is this, I don't

244
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,440
 even know how to classify it, horror movie, crime thriller movie called Poker Night?

245
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,320
 To me it is the best crime thriller since 7.

246
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,720
 Because that's a hard genre to really just stand out above.

247
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:29,040
 And it's basically two plots interwoven perfectly.

248
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,640
 One of the plots is a bunch of police officers are having Poker Night and they're trading

249
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:39,760
 their best, most memorable stories with this new rookie on the force.

250
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,400
 And then the other part of the story is that rookie is being held captive by a serial killer

251
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,040
 in a basement.

252
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:53,160
 And it's so, knowing he does a lot of true crime stuff actually makes me wonder how

253
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,480
 many of those police stories are true.

254
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,400
 But it is so masterfully done.

255
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,160
 It does have the limitations of the budget, you see that.

256
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,520
 But it has a killer cast, no pun intended.

257
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,960
 You have Ron Perlman in it, you have the dude, the chicken man from Breaking Bad, he was in

258
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,640
 the new Far Cry game as well.

259
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,760
 He's in it so good.

260
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,040
 It's so good.

261
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,960
 And it's one of those movies that I don't really even want to give you anymore of the

262
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:23,520
 plot because it's twist after twist after twist and they earn each of the twists.

263
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,760
 Like you're watching it and you're like, "Wait, what?

264
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,080
 Oh, okay, okay, we're going in this direction."

265
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,320
 And then you're watching it for another 20 minutes and something else happens and you're

266
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,320
 like, "Wait, what?

267
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,440
 Oh dude, no way, I'm getting goosebumps just talking about it."

268
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,200
 It's so dope to the point when the movie ended and I was just staring at the ending credits

269
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,520
 with my mouth open going, "Uh, like what in the world?

270
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,480
 Such a masterful gym."

271
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,480
 Completely slept on.

272
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,000
 Completely slept on.

273
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,520
 Check out Poker Night.

274
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,120
 I think it's available on Netflix.

275
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,720
 Where is it available actually?

276
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,040
 You can find it on streaming.

277
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,000
 It's a really, just a really, really well put together.

278
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,560
 Crime, thriller, horror movie.

279
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,240
 It's just really, it's great.

280
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,480
 Dead Rabbit recommends Poker Night.

281
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,120
 Piggy, the reason why we're headed out to Wuhan, China is I recently got, this is actually

282
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,120
 right before the break.

283
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:19,120
 I got an email from a listener named ChromaSoFour.

284
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,400
 ChromaSoFour sent me this.

285
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,560
 Fascinating.

286
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,320
 Fascinating story.

287
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,480
 This is the type of stuff that I love being sent and covering with this stuff is these

288
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,480
 weird fringe beliefs that this one has a lot of real world implications, right?

289
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:42,000
 Because we're going to be talking about the coronavirus, COVID-19 and all that stuff.

290
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,920
 October 11th, 2019 in Northeast China.

291
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,280
 Over the city of Songyang, a bright fireball appears.

292
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:59,600
 People look at it, you can see it.

293
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,920
 They go, "Oh, that must be a meteor coming down from the heavens and everyone's just

294
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,160
 kind of waving at it or just ignoring it going about their business."

295
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,200
 But is it just another meteor?

296
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,560
 Or did it change the way the world worked?

297
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:23,640
 Back in 1979, there was a scientist named Inchandra Wickramasing.

298
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,600
 And another scientist, he was working with this other scientist named Fred Hoyle.

299
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,800
 And they wrote a book, it was published back in 1979, called Diseases from Space.

300
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,160
 And the theory that is outlined in this book is that a lot of common diseases that humanity

301
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,400
 suffers like influenza, the common cold, whooping cough came from outer space.

302
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,760
 This was their premise of this book.

303
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,000
 And they studied this for 20 years.

304
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,920
 And what, for context here, Fred Hoyle was the guy who coined the term the Big Bang.

305
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,920
 So these aren't just like people who were doing some research on the internet, which

306
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,640
 didn't exist back then, and then calling themselves scientists.

307
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:04,040
 These were respected people in their related fields.

308
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,640
 They started looking at it and they go, "We think when we look at cosmic dust, there's

309
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:13,560
 a chance that within the cosmic dust, there might be the right components for life."

310
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:18,680
 And some of their, this is what's so interesting about science, right?

311
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,600
 That is possible.

312
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,160
 They've actually been able to confirm that yes, some of the cosmic dust that's floating

313
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,280
 through space does contain the building blocks for life.

314
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,160
 It's like carbon and nitrogen.

315
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,320
 So scientists go, "Yeah, they were actually able to confirm that."

316
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:41,320
 But then they go to the leap of panspermia, which is the idea that life begins on planets

317
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,600
 because of this.

318
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,080
 Or like life on Earth, I think we've talked about it on the show before as well, that

319
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:54,400
 life on Earth was basically meteorites crashing into the super water of primordial planet Earth.

320
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:54,400
 And it had like a bunch of microbes in it and they popped out and they're like, "Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

321
00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:13,880
 And

322
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,160
 you would have planets that are nothing but, some planets are just dead, but some planets

323
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,200
 that have the right temperature and the right water and the right soil and everything like

324
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,840
 that, when these meteorites strike, when the planet passes through these clouds of cosmic

325
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:32,200
 dust, all of these building blocks of life are coming down to a lifeless planet and over

326
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,520
 billions of years are evolving.

327
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:40,080
 Scientists, the mainstream scientific community does not believe in panspermia.

328
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,640
 It's considered kind of, it's not considered like a lunatic theory, but it's not generally

329
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,640
 accepted.

330
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:51,440
 So they came out with this book in 1979 and people read it and the scientific community

331
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,360
 kind of was like, "Yeah, we don't think that's what happened."

332
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,800
 But they continue to push this idea.

333
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,300
 And over the years, just because the mainstream scientific community doesn't believe it, doesn't

334
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,000
 mean that all scientists don't believe it.

335
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,040
 Over the years, they've actually gotten other people to go, "Well, it's possible.

336
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,240
 This is where life comes from.

337
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,240
 It's from outer space."

338
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:15,600
 And if that is true, it's possible that diseases we get plagued from also come from outer space.

339
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:22,000
 In 2013, off the coast of Chile, scientists discovered the Pandora virus.

340
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,720
 Don't name your viruses after bad people in or bad events in mythology, the Pandora virus.

341
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,920
 It's found off the coast of Chile and oddly enough, in a pond in Australia.

342
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,440
 It's the second biggest virus on earth.

343
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,480
 And so this was when a foil had passed away at this point, but this is when Chandra goes,

344
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,680
 "I think this is proof again that some of these..."

345
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:51,160
 Because nothing on earth has evolved to be this big that we can tell.

346
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,600
 It's the second biggest virus on earth.

347
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:02,920
 And just for comparison, the influenza A virus has seven genes to build it up.

348
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,440
 HIV has nine genes as part of its building blocks.

349
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,320
 The Pandora virus has 2,500 genes.

350
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,200
 It can also move on its own.

351
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,080
 It's the only virus that is self-propelled.

352
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,360
 And the reason why the scientific community is not freaking out about it is because it's

353
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,080
 mostly found in aquatic environments.

354
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,040
 It infects amoebas, but we don't think it's any harmful to humans.

355
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,280
 You'd have to be swimming off the coast of Chile or being in this Australian pond, this

356
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,680
 unnamed pond.

357
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,480
 So they're not really concerned about it affecting humans.

358
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,160
 However, a couple years ago, there was this woman who was having some eye issues, and

359
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,720
 in her contact lens was an amoeba.

360
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,440
 And in that amoeba was the Pandora virus.

361
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,440
 So this possible alien virus was rubbing up against this girl's eye.

362
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,360
 But you go, Jason, so it's the second largest virus on earth.

363
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,560
 So that means there must have been...

364
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,640
 Even if it did come from outer space, something else must have evolved if it's the second

365
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,640
 virus.

366
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:07,920
 The largest virus on earth was discovered in 2014.

367
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,920
 It was frozen...

368
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,160
 I think we all read about this in the news.

369
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,640
 It's from Siberia.

370
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:23,320
 It had been frozen a hundred feet down in the permafrost for 34,000 years.

371
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:29,720
 So they also look at that one and go, "People who believe in the theory of Panspermia, that

372
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,360
 one was not a natural evolution too."

373
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,480
 That's just too huge, right?

374
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,240
 The Pandora virus is the second largest.

375
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,000
 This other one found in Siberia was even bigger, but...

376
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,680
 And then you have this massive leap down in scale to like nine genes and seven genes and

377
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:51,280
 things like that.

378
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,040
 We talked about...

379
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,520
 We covered this a little bit on episode 649.

380
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,600
 We went to Chile because we were looking at the black carpet conspiracy.

381
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,240
 It's this theory that off the coast of Chile there was this giant undulating black mass

382
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,680
 that just kind of moved around.

383
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,480
 And the story was that swimmers were getting caught in it and I think it attacked a submarine

384
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,480
 or something like that.

385
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,480
 I don't remember the details of the episode, but when I was reading this I thought, "This

386
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,720
 sounds awfully familiar."

387
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,280
 So it's interesting that the sighting of this massive black algae, this like possibly sentient

388
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,400
 algae, I think it turned out to be creepypasta or something.

389
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,920
 I don't remember, but it was just interesting that we have that location is also the real

390
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,960
 life location of this Pandora virus.

391
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,320
 So I mean, I guess the creepypasta could be based on it, but I just wanted to make that

392
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,320
 connection as well.

393
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,320
 And that's a fun episode.

394
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,120
 Go back and listen to that one and tell me whether or not it's creepypasta.

395
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,960
 I don't remember, but it was a fun episode to talk about.

396
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,640
 So you have all this stuff going on.

397
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,440
 Like I said, other scientists are on board with this as well.

398
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:54,880
 Dr. Jean-Michael Clavier of the Eix-Marcellia, whatever it is, some university in France.

399
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,760
 Some university in France, dude.

400
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:08,240
 Dr. Jean-Michael said that he believes that this Pandora virus has no ancestral cellular

401
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,480
 connection to anything on earth, or at least anything existing anymore.

402
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,880
 He goes, "Listen, if it had an ancestor on earth it's not around."

403
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,200
 Like this Pandora virus is so different than anything else we have.

404
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,360
 It has no relatives.

405
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:27,760
 So he's not specifically saying panspermia, but he's kind of like nudging the scientists

406
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
 next to him.

407
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,760
 He's like, "I think this came from outer space."

408
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,560
 I'm putting words in his mouth, but.

409
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:38,200
 So now we're looking at a new conspiracy theory.

410
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,840
 COVID came from outer space.

411
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,920
 So Chandra and some other scientists got together and recently published a paper asking the

412
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,080
 question, "Is coronavirus from space?"

413
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,600
 They also connected there's a thing called Candida fungal disease that's going around.

414
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,480
 It's hit in Canada pretty bad.

415
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,880
 They also believe that's from space.

416
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,920
 I guess the spoiler alert is they kind of believe everything's from space.

417
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,560
 But for the topic at hand, we're going to look at the COVID thing and they said, "Listen,

418
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,200
 Spanish flu came from space, killed millions of people."

419
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,840
 The fungal disease they're talking about, they said, "Listen, the fungal disease has

420
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:22,640
 existed before 2009, but at 2009 it got way worse, way bad, super more infectious."

421
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,160
 What they believe is that the planet Earth passed through a cloud of radioactive cosmic

422
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:35,080
 dust and the fungus mutated and became even more viral, even more vicious.

423
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,280
 It's coming after you.

424
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,120
 It's looking for your eyeballs and stuff like that.

425
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,160
 And COVID-19 completely came from space like the Spanish flu.

426
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,160
 It wasn't a simple mutation.

427
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,440
 It was actually a meteorite coming down.

428
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,200
 So fast forward, we got the Pandora virus which may have come from space.

429
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,280
 They were talking about influenza and the common cold coming from space.

430
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,280
 Basically, this is why we can't really defeat these things because it's an alien menace.

431
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,240
 It's just not meant to be on this planet.

432
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,920
 You're going to get the common cold every year.

433
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,920
 What are you going to do?

434
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:07,120
 So when Chandra and these other scientists recently put out this paper saying COVID-19

435
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,880
 came from space and they actually specify the meteor that was spotted over China.

436
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,720
 On October 11, 2019, they said that that might have been a virus bomb.

437
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,880
 That could have been a bunch of viruses in that, or specifically the COVID-19 virus.

438
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,560
 And it explodes like meteorites tend to do.

439
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,000
 And then it rains down little particles on people.

440
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,680
 They're getting hit with pebbles.

441
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,320
 And one guy's, "Look at that!"

442
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,680
 And he has his mouth open and a little virus lands on his tongue.

443
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,400
 It didn't actually lay out that scenario.

444
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,040
 But the idea was that this meteorite contained COVID-19.

445
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,680
 It's a fascinating conspiracy theory.

446
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,480
 The problem that they started to run into is apparently when they were writing the paper,

447
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,280
 they said, "Since it's from space and there's nothing we can do about it, we don't have

448
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,360
 to worry about getting any sort of vaccine or doing anything like that."

449
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,880
 And the scientists were like, "Okay, listen, we might believe that panspermia exists.

450
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,640
 And I'm sure it does on some level."

451
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,200
 But to say that every disease comes from space, but if your answer is everything came from

452
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,320
 space and there's nothing we can really do about it, that's not super helpful.

453
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,080
 So when they were saying, "Oh, we don't even need a vaccine," that's when scientists were

454
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,360
 like, "Okay, this is where the theory can actually start to become dangerous."

455
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,720
 Right?

456
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,160
 It's also interesting to look at their theory.

457
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:29,080
 There was a meteorite spotted over Songyang on October 11, 2019.

458
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:36,840
 And the virus appeared in November of 2019 in that same region of China, northeast China.

459
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:42,320
 However, I think whether or not you believe it came from bat soup or it came out of a

460
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,320
 laboratory or a can in my ever-ending quest to get this podcast completely obliterated,

461
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,360
 built by some government or whatever.

462
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,640
 Bill Gates is over there with his 5G tower personally building the disease.

463
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,960
 However you believe it happened, I think everyone agrees that it started in Wuhan, Wuhan, China,

464
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,480
 which is in northeast China.

465
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,160
 This is where you start to get a little bit of the fudge going on because, yes, Wuhan

466
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:12,880
 is in northeast China, but it's 1242 miles away from Songyang.

467
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,920
 So that's a bit of a stretch, right?

468
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,520
 And they go, "Oh no, we got an answer for that."

469
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:24,720
 You see meteorites when they break up, pieces go everywhere, and maybe the extra juicy piece

470
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,920
 with all the viruses went towards Wuhan.

471
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,080
 I guess, right?

472
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,080
 It's possible.

473
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:33,000
 But you would have think you would have seen an outbreak over a larger area in the beginning.

474
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,920
 It wouldn't have been isolated in Wuhan.

475
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,640
 So there's no proof of any of this really outside of these theories.

476
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,000
 And I know that's how science works.

477
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,600
 They have to build up to the proof.

478
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,560
 I think what left a bad taste in people's mouth was one, the virus landing on their tongue

479
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:50,240
 when the comet exploded, and then two, the same, we don't even bother working on a vaccine.

480
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,320
 And this paper was published a long time ago.

481
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,480
 It was published back in July of 2020.

482
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,600
 So this is when people were still locking themselves in their houses and things like that.

483
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,800
 So when they came out, we're saying, "Oh, we don't need any vaccines."

484
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,120
 Then people were upset by that.

485
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:08,880
 But what's interesting, there's a really cool take on this from Rahan Gabriel-Joseph on

486
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,280
 this website called Cosmology.com.

487
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,520
 That kind of takes it to another level.

488
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,840
 This is where we're going to wrap up this episode.

489
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,480
 This is a really cool way to look at it.

490
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,160
 So let's say that this is true.

491
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,160
 Let's put on our conspiracy caps and say this is true.

492
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:31,040
 That these diseases that seem to plague mankind for years and years and years are alien.

493
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:41,760
 He goes, "Maybe this is why comets are seen as signs of doom."

494
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,720
 Maybe this is why when people looked up in the sky and they saw a comet, they thought

495
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,720
 the world was going to end.

496
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:52,920
 These previous times and previous civilizations, when a comet showed up, the earth pastored

497
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:59,160
 the tail of the comet and got a face full of microbes, or when a meteorite flashed into

498
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:04,520
 the sky, it brought death.

499
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:09,640
 It brought disease.

500
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,080
 We did an episode a long time ago about, did aliens bring about the black plague?

501
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,240
 You think about how much the world or especially like European history changed because of the

502
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,240
 black plague?

503
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:24,840
 It wouldn't even have to happen every single comet or every single meteorite, bright big

504
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,840
 meteorite in the sky.

505
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,160
 It wouldn't have to happen every time.

506
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:35,280
 But if it happened enough, your civilization as it's dying would write in its record books

507
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,600
 we ended when the great light appeared in the sky.

508
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:45,560
 The great and the poor both fell ill.

509
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:50,120
 There was no safety in the streets or in the temples.

510
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,400
 We were cursed by the gods.

511
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,360
 We have been written out of the books of humanity.

512
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:00,000
 How many times would that have to happen through human history before people just started seeing

513
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,120
 comets and go, "Oh!"

514
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,860
 And that is super common throughout history.

515
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:10,600
 Comets were seen not as a good omen, but as an omen of destruction.

516
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,880
 I keep using the words comet and meteorite interchangeably here, just a bright light

517
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,000
 in the sky.

518
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,800
 Something happening in the sky or even in the day if it's bright enough that it shouldn't

519
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,800
 be there.

520
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,960
 It's not part of the normal order.

521
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:28,440
 And as we're floating through space and we see the celestial objects today we go, "Oh

522
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,360
 that's just the way the universe works.

523
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,380
 Look at those old superstitious goons back then."

524
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,800
 And maybe they had it right.

525
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,840
 Maybe when they saw these things there was a chance.

526
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,960
 It didn't happen every time.

527
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,960
 There's meteor showers all the time.

528
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,440
 It didn't happen all the time.

529
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:48,720
 But it happened enough throughout world history that they became very cautious when they saw

530
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:56,120
 the brightest falling star or the comet that hung in the sky for weeks.

531
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,080
 Because these were heralds of doom.

532
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:08,340
 If they landed in the right area, it could wipe out a civilization.

533
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:12,340
 So do I believe that COVID-19 came from outer space?

534
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:16,460
 I think the answer is far more terrestrial than that.

535
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,580
 COVID-19 aside, probably not.

536
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,580
 But when we look through the scope of human history and the diseases that have plagued

537
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:26,700
 us through human history, mysterious diseases that have popped up, I think we know the origins

538
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:34,100
 of COVID-19, but previous discoveries, previous diseases that are unexplainable, pandora viruses

539
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:40,840
 that are sitting off the coast of Chile that they're just too big to exist on this planet

540
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,380
 to evolve the naturally.

541
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,920
 It makes sense of why other cultures would look up at the sky and be scared when they

542
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:52,080
 saw that because they all heard the stories of the previous culture.

543
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,360
 They had moved into this area.

544
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,260
 The buildings had been abandoned and streets had been littered with bodies.

545
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:03,380
 So they built a new culture on top of it and they'd been there for 50, 100, 200 years and

546
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:07,020
 then once again this comet's coming and they remember the old records.

547
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,540
 They remember the old stories.

548
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:12,500
 The light in the sky brought death.

549
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,420
 The gods were angry with them.

550
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,860
 Creepy.

551
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:23,580
 Makes us feel so fragile and small that for all of our medical technology, all of our

552
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:30,420
 wonderment, all of our hopes and dreams can be dashed because a rock that had been tumbling

553
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:39,180
 through space billions of years finally nears Earth's orbit.

554
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:43,000
 Everyone always talks about the planet killer meteorite that comes zooming from the opposite

555
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 side of the sun.

556
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,920
 We don't see it in time.

557
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:51,240
 We have a day to prepare and it smashes into the planet.

558
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,380
 Being life as we know it.

559
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,140
 But maybe it's not that dramatic.

560
00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:01,500
 Maybe it's far less of a noble last stand kind of death.

561
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,940
 Maybe it's just that same meteorite coming into Earth's orbit.

562
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,820
 We don't even notice it.

563
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,300
 Maybe a couple of rock nerds do.

564
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,020
 It burns up in the atmosphere.

565
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:15,340
 Explodes over the Earth high in the atmosphere and we go about our days and this disease

566
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:18,660
 rains down on us.

567
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:21,680
 We catch the sniffles.

568
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:25,480
 We get a little bit of a sore throat.

569
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,960
 And then you hear about an epidemic in downtown Detroit.

570
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,400
 People are vomiting up blood in the middle of the day.

571
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,000
 It was a Wednesday afternoon.

572
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,120
 People were getting off work and someone on the bus started vomiting up blood in the middle

573
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,840
 of the bus.

574
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,160
 They send any Ebola experts.

575
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,480
 It's not that.

576
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,240
 The disease continues to spread.

577
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,240
 It's mysterious.

578
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,460
 So organs are being liquefied.

579
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,100
 You lose your vision.

580
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:57,020
 You're both paralyzed and your body is wracked with uncontrollable seizures.

581
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:04,220
 Hospital beds as far as the eye can see of humans suffering, suffering, suffering until

582
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:08,220
 they finally die.

583
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:12,660
 This disease ravages Midwest United States.

584
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:17,840
 In three months it's spread across the entire North American continent.

585
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,480
 Borders are shut down.

586
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,780
 They don't even know what's causing this.

587
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:27,340
 But the borders are closed far too late.

588
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:34,360
 And the disease ravages the entire world.

589
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:44,860
 A disease from an alien world mutated by cosmic dust during its journeys pierces the sky of

590
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:50,580
 planet Earth and rains down hell.

591
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:56,840
 We always wanted to make first contact with an alien life form.

592
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:04,020
 Little did we know it would be last contact with an alien virus.

593
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,540
 It wasn't first contact.

594
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,920
 It was the last contact.

595
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:31,960
 Man whatever have.

596
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:38,960
 It's not the first contact.

597
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:45,280
 It's the first contact.

598
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:51,960
 It's the first contact.

599
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:58,960
 It's the first contact.

600
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,540
 (upbeat music)
