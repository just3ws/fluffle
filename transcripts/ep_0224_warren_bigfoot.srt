1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,820
 A man is stopped at a DUI checkpoint, and what they find in his car is terrifying.

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,880
 And then we take a look at a story that is often forgotten when we look at the life of

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,120
 Ed and Lorraine Warren.

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,200
 The Conjuring movies are based on them.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,600
 They were at the forefront of major haunting stories.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:29,520
 But did you know that they also once had an encounter with Bigfoot?

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,520
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:42,080
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,080
 I'm your host Jason Karpner, I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,840
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,480
 It's funny, the story we're going to start off here wasn't the story I originally had

12
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,480
 planned for today.

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,160
 I just read about it in the news today.

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,960
 I'm doing it for one or two reasons.

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,720
 I think it's a good follow up to our Ouija board episode, especially the ending.

16
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,720
 Yesterday, you don't have to listen to yesterday's episode to follow this one.

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,920
 But yesterday, I ended that episode with saying I don't know what's scarier.

18
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,360
 The idea that a demon can possess someone via Ouija board or simply that people can

19
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,080
 simply snap under the smallest provocation.

20
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,480
 Is that a word?

21
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,920
 Underneath the smallest of circumstances, someone could just snap and start murdering

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,920
 people.

23
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,000
 The story actually really gets me worked up.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,600
 Now I have an unofficial rule that I try not to cuss on this show.

25
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,080
 They do slip out from time to time.

26
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,320
 I'm going to do my best because this story actually really gets me worked up.

27
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,040
 It's kind of depressing too.

28
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,240
 And that's another reason why I want to cover it because I almost need to just tell it and

29
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,400
 get it off my plate.

30
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,320
 I can't let it be sitting in my notes.

31
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,960
 And you're like, Jason, why are you telling us this story?

32
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,040
 It's so depressing.

33
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,360
 Because again, I just think it's an interesting story and it's an ongoing trial.

34
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,560
 And you guys can follow as well.

35
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,560
 It's September 2014.

36
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,120
 There's a little DUI checkpoint in the state of Mississippi.

37
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,360
 Board police officers sitting there.

38
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,360
 Cars are coming.

39
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,360
 Stopping the car.

40
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,760
 Have you had anything to drink tonight?

41
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,760
 No.

42
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,760
 Yes.

43
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,760
 How many drinks?

44
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,000
 This routine.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,720
 This DUI checkpoint.

46
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,600
 And this van pulls up.

47
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,760
 There's a man in it.

48
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,760
 37 year old man.

49
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,480
 The cop's like, oh, he's either drunk or he's not.

50
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,080
 Maybe he'll be smuggling some coke and it'll be a cool Miami Vice moment.

51
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,080
 But the cop knows.

52
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,320
 Listen, guys are either drunk or he's not.

53
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,680
 The guy either keeps driving or he gets out of his car, breathalyzer, all this stuff.

54
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,320
 Just a routine stop.

55
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,760
 But as the car pulls up and the man rolls down his window, the police officer recognizes

56
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,760
 a smell.

57
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,360
 It's a smell that only people in certain professions know.

58
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,440
 Morticians, military, doctors, cops.

59
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,160
 It's the smell of death.

60
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,400
 That was the officer's exact words when he was filing the report.

61
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,880
 I smelled the smell of death.

62
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,360
 Now the guy in the car, his name is Timothy Jones Jr.

63
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,960
 He's a 37 year old dude.

64
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,880
 And he's just kind of chatting but the cop just smells the fact that there have been

65
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,520
 bodies in here.

66
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,520
 Animal maybe?

67
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,520
 Human maybe?

68
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,520
 He doesn't know.

69
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,560
 But he begins kind of looking around the car with his flashlight, checking it out.

70
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,440
 And that's when he notices three things you never want to see in combination.

71
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,800
 Maggots, blood, and children's clothing.

72
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,560
 Timothy Jones Jr. and his wife were married.

73
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,160
 They had five kids.

74
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,840
 So this is going to get grim, guys.

75
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,280
 So again, you can just jump ahead ten minutes and get to the funny story or just keep hitting

76
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,560
 that skip button if this isn't the way you want to start your day.

77
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,760
 Seven, six, two, and one were the ages of his children.

78
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,400
 They had a divorce.

79
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,720
 He got sole custody of the kids or at least most custody of the kids.

80
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,400
 I don't know if it was sold but they spent most of the time with him.

81
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,600
 And he had a really hard time dealing with it.

82
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,560
 Had a really hard time dealing with it.

83
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,640
 Now we've talked about this before on the show.

84
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,520
 There's good ways to deal with stuff and there's bad ways to deal with stuff.

85
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,040
 The way that he dealt with stuff is that when his kids misbehaved, he made them do push-ups

86
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,520
 and sit-ups and do physical training.

87
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,080
 There was this way of kind of like breaking them down.

88
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,160
 Very bully-ish type behavior.

89
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,320
 Very bully-ish type behavior.

90
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,920
 But anyways, he said, "Child protective services have come out to his house because they noticed

91
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,160
 the mark on his kids.

92
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,520
 They actually visited his house two weeks before this incident."

93
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,440
 And they're like, "Yeah, he does make them like run laps and stuff like that, but the

94
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,600
 kids actually seem to be well fed.

95
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
 They're clean.

96
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,600
 They're well groomed.

97
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,600
 The house is clean.

98
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,880
 It's nice."

99
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,920
 But what people didn't really know was that he was hearing voices.

100
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,760
 At least he says he was hearing voices.

101
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,960
 Now his mother had done 20 years in a mental institution for schizophrenia.

102
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,640
 He says that he was self-medicating himself that he was hearing voices.

103
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,680
 And at one point, the voices told him to kill his kids.

104
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,680
 And he's like, "What?

105
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,120
 Nah, I'm not gonna do that."

106
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,520
 But one day he comes home.

107
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,960
 It was August 28th, 2014.

108
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,680
 He comes home and the electrical outlet is blowing out.

109
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,640
 And he accuses his six-year-old son of blowing out the electrical outlet.

110
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,560
 And the kid's like, "I didn't do it."

111
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,880
 And the dad's like, "Yeah, you did."

112
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,200
 And they started having this back-and-forth argument.

113
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,440
 So he started making his son do push-ups and sit-ups until he admitted that he blew out

114
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,440
 the outlet.

115
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,280
 And the boy was adamant that he didn't.

116
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,800
 So then Timothy, like a real man, starts smacking his six-year-old son around.

117
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,720
 This one, his story's really pissing me off.

118
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,160
 He starts smacking his son around.

119
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,280
 And then he sends the son to bed.

120
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,560
 And then later on he checks on his son and his son is dead.

121
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,480
 So this is all his version of the story.

122
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,920
 We don't know exactly what he did to the boy, but the boy ended up being beaten to death.

123
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,400
 He says he just smacked him around a bit.

124
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,400
 The kid goes to bed.

125
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,680
 But the boy, when he checks on the kid later, the six-year-old kid is dead.

126
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,240
 At that point, he said the voices came--the little spoiler alert here.

127
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,400
 He's trying to get insanity.

128
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,200
 That's why I think all this voice is nonsense is in this story.

129
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,880
 Timothy was hearing voices, maybe not.

130
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,880
 I don't know.

131
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,840
 I really don't care.

132
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,680
 But anyway, so he's sitting there and he's looking at his dead six-year-old son in bed.

133
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,280
 And he says the voices came to him and that the other kids were conspiring against them,

134
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,520
 so now it's the time to take them all out.

135
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,000
 He goes into the eight-year-old's bedroom, strangles.

136
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,440
 I think the eight-year-old was a girl.

137
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,440
 They were mixed.

138
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,320
 So some were girls and some were boys.

139
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,360
 I didn't even want to really picture the genders of the kids.

140
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,400
 But he strangles the eight-year-old.

141
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,480
 He strangles the seven-year-old.

142
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,560
 He then goes into the room where the two-year-old and the one-year-old are sleeping.

143
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,080
 And in a particularly brutal detail, he said their necks were too small for his hands,

144
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,800
 so he used the belt to strangle them.

145
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,560
 He throws all of them into the car.

146
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,560
 You know what's funny?

147
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,560
 The element that I think really kind of got--that is when you deal with true crime and stuff

148
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,000
 like that, you read stuff like that.

149
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,040
 That bugged me, but the detail that I think really bugs me the most about this story,

150
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,960
 honestly, is you get immune to the death type of stuff.

151
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,280
 He throws the kids' bodies in the back of his van.

152
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,160
 He drives around for nine days.

153
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,080
 He doesn't really know what he's going to do.

154
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,300
 He's thinking about, well, maybe I should melt him, maybe I should cut him up, and maybe

155
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,360
 should I ground the bones to dust and just scatter him somewhere so no one will ever

156
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,520
 know what happened to the kids.

157
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,840
 Now, obviously, cops will figure out that his kids are missing, but as he's on this journey

158
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:37,680
 to dump these children, his children, wherever he's going to put them, they have video surveillance--I

159
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,200
 don't know why this pisses me off so much, but they have video surveillance footage of

160
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:48,240
 at one point him going into a convenience store and buying cheese sticks and curly fries.

161
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,320
 I don't know why that bugs me so much.

162
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:57,320
 I think it's because the--it's--this is going to sound so weird, but you don't deserve a

163
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,320
 treat, dude.

164
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,160
 You don't deserve your favorite food, okay?

165
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,240
 You don't get to take a break.

166
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,440
 You don't get to go to your--the place where you want and get some food you want when you've

167
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,680
 got murdered kids in your backseat.

168
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,880
 You don't get to do that.

169
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,720
 You don't get to have a fun summer day.

170
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:28,880
 At one point he goes to the store, he buys a saw, acid, goggles, candy, and Gatorade.

171
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:35,640
 And I can just imagine this asshole sitting in his car in some parking lot, eating a Snickers

172
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:41,560
 bar, drinking a Gatorade, and just having a good time as his kids are rotting in his

173
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,200
 backseat.

174
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,080
 You know, it's so bizarre.

175
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,360
 It's so bizarre because, again, when you read a lot of this stuff, when you research a lot

176
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:58,800
 of this stuff, you do become immune to a lot of the super grisly details.

177
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,720
 But when you read the mundane stuff, it gets to you.

178
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,720
 It gets to you.

179
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,560
 I've lost track of the amount of people that I've seen--I've probably seen about seven

180
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,640
 or eight people die in real life, and I've lost track of the amount of people I've seen

181
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,640
 die in video.

182
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
 Like, absolutely.

183
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,360
 Which couldn't even give you a rough estimate of how many people I've seen blowing up, or

184
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:27,000
 accidentally electrocuted, or get their brains blown out in some sort of Syrian war video.

185
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,400
 I've completely lost track of that stuff.

186
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:41,760
 But this detail, it's just so--when you look at the horribleness of these crimes, the mundane

187
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,520
 details are what tend to haunt me.

188
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,360
 I remember--I think it was the Zodiac Killer.

189
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,840
 I remember reading a long time ago, there, I think it was the Zodiac Killer.

190
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,800
 There was a guy who was like 50 years old, he was one of the victims of the serial killer,

191
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,600
 and I can't swear that it's a Zodiac Killer, but it was in San Francisco.

192
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,840
 There was a guy who was like in his 50s, he worked at the Coke bottling plant, and every

193
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,720
 day he got a free bottle of Coke, and that was his favorite drink, and he would walk

194
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,360
 home with his bottle of Coke, and he would sit at home and watch television and drink

195
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,720
 his Coke.

196
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,200
 And when he was walking home that night, he was shot by the serial killer, and they found

197
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,680
 his body and the Coke was spilled next to his body.

198
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,880
 That detail really stuck with me for a long time, because that's me.

199
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,800
 I'm the guy who enjoys the little things in life.

200
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,880
 I'm the guy who enjoys walking to the store, grabbing my three favorite items.

201
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,480
 I got my drink, I got my favorite snack, and then I walk home and I enjoy them.

202
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,240
 That was me getting gunned down.

203
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,920
 Those mundane things are the things that always stick with me.

204
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:46,720
 It's not necessarily the grizzliness of the murders, but it's the mundane stuff that really

205
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,560
 gets to me.

206
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,760
 So he's on trial right now, and he's confessed to it.

207
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,760
 He's totally confessed to it.

208
00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:01,160
 The question is whether or not he's insane, legally insane, or if he just snapped.

209
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,040
 He said to in his police interview, "If Nathan," that was the name of his six-year-old son,

210
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,400
 "if Nathan had admitted that he'd blown out the outlets, all the other kids would be

211
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,400
 alive.

212
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,840
 He's the one who caused me to do this."

213
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,340
 You've...

214
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:19,200
 On the Ouija Board episode, I said, "I don't know what's scarier, the demon creeping through

215
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,200
 the darkness or people just snapping."

216
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,440
 I have my answer.

217
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,400
 It's people just snapping, because you really can't predict it.

218
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,480
 This guy didn't have a Ouija Board.

219
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,680
 By all accounts, he seemed to be fairly normal.

220
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,480
 Child Protective Services came out two weeks before this happened and talked to him.

221
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,840
 They felt he was normal.

222
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,760
 The wife never thought he was a dangerous person.

223
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,040
 She felt comfortable with him watching the kids.

224
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,600
 He just murders five of them in one night, because one kid doesn't admit to blowing

225
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,100
 out an outlet.

226
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,600
 Far, far insanity.

227
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,600
 People snapping is far creepier than a demon.

228
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,300
 Because demons may or may not be real, but insanity, and I'm not using a legal definition.

229
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,300
 This guy's guilty.

230
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,520
 This guy needs to go to prison, not some hospital.

231
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,520
 Yeah.

232
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,520
 Far creepier.

233
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,000
 Far, far creepier.

234
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,680
 Okay, but enough of the...

235
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,680
 That story.

236
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,680
 I went to...

237
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,680
 I was like, "I'm gonna get some and eat."

238
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,280
 It just kind of left a sour taste in my mouth.

239
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,920
 But again, it couldn't be because I just read it right before I was recording it.

240
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,440
 Didn't really have time to digest it.

241
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,920
 I haven't listened back to that segment yet, but you might be able to tell that my voice

242
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,600
 is a bit different just because...

243
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,840
 So like two hours later, I'm recording the rest of this.

244
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,680
 Let's go ahead and change gears here.

245
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,960
 And right now, we are going out to Tennessee.

246
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,760
 Now, Ed and Lorraine Warren were the people the Conjuring movies are based on them.

247
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,040
 I believe they were part of Amityville, I'm pretty sure, and they might have been part

248
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,120
 of the infield haunting, but really the Conjuring universe is all built around the life and

249
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,560
 times of these two investigators.

250
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,960
 Ed passed away a couple years ago, and Lorraine Warren just passed away this year.

251
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:58,400
 We always hear about them being connected with these hauntings, but not a lot of people

252
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:04,320
 know that they also had a run-in with everyone's seven-foot friend who's covered in hair,

253
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,320
 Bigfoot.

254
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,200
 Now, apparently, so I found out about this because I was reading this article.

255
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,480
 So there was a book that they wrote back in the 80s called Ghost Hunters, back when they

256
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,000
 were still kind of just starting to become super popular.

257
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,160
 And I'm reading an article about the book and about their Bigfoot adventures, and I

258
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,440
 came across this passage.

259
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,320
 It said, regarding the book, this is what it says, Ed and Lorraine Warren lay out some

260
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,800
 of their most terrifying cases.

261
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:38,920
 Which include elements like disappearing Nigerian priests, judo chop, martial arts murders,

262
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,040
 porno theater demons, and possessed biker gangs.

263
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,680
 Just to name a few.

264
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,960
 So yes, I did buy the book.

265
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,480
 I went and I bought that book.

266
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,640
 I was like, "I gotta read this thing."

267
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:54,160
 And the author of this article says it's actually probably one of the craziest ghost books story

268
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,920
 collections out there.

269
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,040
 He goes, "It's just kind of all over the place, but in the middle of the book," written

270
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:06,200
 by Ed and Lorraine Warren, there is an eight page chapter simply titled Bigfoot.

271
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:11,280
 So Lorraine and Ed were on a lecture tour in Tennessee.

272
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,560
 Reporter comes up to him and goes, "Hey listen, I need your help."

273
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,760
 Well I don't need your help, but I know a bunch of hillbillies who need your help.

274
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,720
 I'm a little, I question this reporter, was his beat the hillbilly beat, or did he have

275
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,200
 family members who were hillbillies?

276
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,880
 Like how were they so easily able to get a hold of this reporter and being like, "Hey,

277
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,640
 we got a scoop for you, Bigfoot, still in kids."

278
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,960
 Actually that is something a reporter would want to hear.

279
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,480
 But anyways, the reporter goes to Ed and Lorraine Warren and says, "There's a bunch of hillbillies.

280
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,720
 They're being harassed by a Bigfoot."

281
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,600
 And Lorraine says, "I never believed in Bigfoot.

282
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,120
 It was something that I never really paid attention to.

283
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,520
 It was just kind of whatever."

284
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,320
 You know, and that tends to be the case.

285
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,480
 A lot of criticism, I get two big criticisms about this show.

286
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,320
 One, my voice is too sexy.

287
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,800
 And two, they go, "Jason, the only thing you believe in is ghosts.

288
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,840
 You're always like poo poo and everything else."

289
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,480
 And both of those criticisms are quite valid.

290
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,000
 But I get where she's coming from.

291
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,280
 You do tend to just kind of focus on one particular form of freakish beliefs and then you kind

292
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,280
 of poo poo the rest.

293
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,240
 So that's how she was with Bigfoot.

294
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,720
 But for whatever reason they do decide to go.

295
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,720
 I think it was just kind of like, maybe they just want to see hillbilly people in their

296
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,760
 natural environment, the suns of the soil.

297
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,920
 They just wanted to really see what they were like and maybe catch the sighting of a Bigfoot,

298
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,720
 a creature that they don't really believe in.

299
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:35,680
 Also, it probably helped the reporter ask them to because they seem to be a bit on the publicity

300
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,400
 pound kind of side.

301
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,240
 They seem to really like publicity.

302
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,240
 They go up there, so they go to the hillbilly village and everyone's just kind of like playing

303
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,520
 on their banjos and stuff like that.

304
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,760
 Lorraine and Ed are, I imagine, like dancing around doing a traditional dance, a traditional

305
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,960
 hillbilly dance, which is just a drunken stupor.

306
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,360
 But the people in the hillbilly village were like, this is like, I should say, this is

307
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,000
 like in the mid-70s, early 80s.

308
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,800
 This isn't like, when I keep saying hillbilly village, this isn't like the 1880s.

309
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,160
 Anyway, so they're in the hillbilly village and the grand chieftain of the hillbillies

310
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:12,640
 comes out in his headdress made of a Paps Blue Ribbon cans and he's like, I am the leader

311
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,760
 of the hillbilly clan.

312
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,640
 This is what happened.

313
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,200
 Many moons ago, no, he's like, so this is what happened.

314
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,840
 One day we were sitting here, minding our own business, not making meth, not making any

315
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,760
 meth whatsoever.

316
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:30,880
 But there's a little two-year-old boy kind of hanging on the outskirts of town, town

317
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,000
 being where the caravan stops, where the mobile homes only reach out to.

318
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,160
 And we saw a giant monster come out of the woods, giant bigfoot, try to take the boy

319
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,320
 and the boy started crying, the monster ran away.

320
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,560
 So we want your help finding this thing.

321
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:51,040
 Now again, according to the book Lorraine and Ed were like, because they didn't believe

322
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,040
 in bigfoot.

323
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,600
 But again, she's like, fine, let's do it.

324
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,360
 Now, after a certain point, after a couple hours, she's thinking this is a waste of time.

325
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,760
 As far as she's concerned, they're not looking for, what they're looking for doesn't exist.

326
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,120
 So it would be like if you were hiking for four hours and you knew nothing was going to

327
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,120
 be found.

328
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,540
 Let's imagine you were looking for forest fins treasure.

329
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,000
 That's what she was going through.

330
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,360
 They were looking for something that just flat out didn't exist.

331
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,160
 So she's in the woods, they're walking around.

332
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,440
 And then all of a sudden she gets a psychic blast.

333
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:32,600
 Oh, oh my head.

334
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,800
 And she sees bigfoot.

335
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,440
 I guess they're just saying, because she didn't know Lorraine Warren is a psychic.

336
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,960
 She was reportedly a psychic, allegedly had the psychic powers.

337
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,220
 She just wasn't walking through the woods and she's like, oh, these new found abilities.

338
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,820
 This was her gift.

339
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,500
 Anyway so she's like, oh my head, Charles, go save Logan.

340
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,780
 Cyclops is in need of help.

341
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,300
 But actually no, she doesn't do that.

342
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,500
 That would have been cool.

343
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,300
 But no, bigfoot's there instead of Charles Xavier.

344
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:07,740
 And he goes, oh, why humans follow me?

345
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,380
 And she's like, she starts talking with it.

346
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,860
 And she goes, well, you scared.

347
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:17,200
 What's so bizarre is that, again, I haven't read the exact chapter itself because I'm

348
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:23,280
 getting the book, but I'm basing this off what the article said about the chapter.

349
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,840
 And she just kind of like goes into a conversation with this thing that she didn't really believe

350
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,840
 existed.

351
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,160
 She said it was about 40 yards away from where they were at.

352
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,120
 She knew it was very, very close to where this hunting party was and she's psychically

353
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,120
 connected.

354
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,400
 She tells everyone in the party, shh, shh, shh.

355
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,680
 I'm talking to bigfoot with my magic brain.

356
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,740
 You've got to be quiet so I can concentrate with my magic brain.

357
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,340
 So the hunting party falls quiet.

358
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,340
 She's talking to bigfoot.

359
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,860
 And he goes, me, hurt.

360
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:55,500
 Me, foot, get scratched on ground point thing.

361
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,300
 She's like a rock and he's like, whatever.

362
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,540
 It's, my foot's all cut up because you chase me.

363
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:06,780
 And she's like, well, we're chasing you because you were trying to kidnap a little boy.

364
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:15,160
 He's like, no kidnap, no, me understand crossing state lines with individual, his federal law,

365
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,520
 me no do that.

366
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,000
 Me want to play with baby.

367
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,040
 And she's like, well, okay, that's all well and good.

368
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,640
 And you have an understanding of federal law regarding kidnapping.

369
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,520
 But he's like, yes, bad experience back in '60s.

370
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,360
 No talk about it.

371
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,160
 And she's like, okay, we'll table that for later.

372
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,800
 But the kid was scared.

373
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,940
 Your giant, giant Harry monster, you're coming out of the woods.

374
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,740
 He's like, yes, yes, I am.

375
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,260
 Potuitary gland problem.

376
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,660
 And they're having this conversation.

377
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:50,020
 And she's like, she's mentally, she said at this point, she's mentally bandaging his

378
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:54,220
 foot like she's giving him visions of her like physically helping them.

379
00:19:54,220 --> 00:20:01,260
 And then in true hillbilly fashion, let's say I'm assuming that oddly enough, I'm assuming

380
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:05,460
 this story is true in the sense that I'm assuming that a bunch of people walked down

381
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,720
 the woods and she might have imagined the conversation.

382
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,040
 I don't think she made the whole thing up.

383
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,320
 I don't think she made up the hillbilly party or anything like that because it's such a

384
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,400
 brief section of this book.

385
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,240
 And if you took it out, it wouldn't matter.

386
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,360
 So I'll say that she probably did go in the woods with a bunch of hillbillies, a bunch

387
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,920
 of rednecks and imagined that she was talking to Bigfoot.

388
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,160
 Maybe she was really talking to Bigfoot.

389
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,160
 I don't know.

390
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:32,080
 But whatever the case in true hillbilly fashion, if she made this up, she definitely knows

391
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,720
 her hillbillies.

392
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:39,540
 In true hillbilly fashion, while she is talking to Bigfoot psychically, after telling everyone

393
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:44,420
 - hey guys, be quiet, I'm talking to Bigfoot psychically - they invited her out here to

394
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:49,740
 talk to Bigfoot psychically, a guy, uh, hillbilly, starts honking his horn.

395
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:53,940
 He's honking the horn and it's quoted in the article as a joke.

396
00:20:53,940 --> 00:21:00,620
 So imagine you're in the middle of making first contact with a Sasquatch, a creature

397
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:06,600
 that is a legend all over the world, and some hillbillies all "Yuck, yuck, this will be

398
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:06,600
 funny, na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na

399
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:12,760
 funny" - you know, like, honking and just playing on his horn.

400
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,880
 And of course the psychic connection was not only broken, but then Bigfoot took off through

401
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,960
 the woods so they heard this huge noise running through the woods.

402
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,440
 And Lorraine says she took off after it.

403
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:29,720
 This part of the story is probably 100% made up this indie, but anyways, Lorraine says she

404
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,280
 took off after it and she sees blood that is described as more viscous.

405
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,240
 Is that how you pronounce that?

406
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,200
 Viscous and more redder.

407
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
 Is that a word?

408
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,200
 Redder?

409
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,200
 This was the quote.

410
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:49,880
 The blood trail was both redder and more viscous than a human blood.

411
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:55,320
 So anyways, that might have been - actually I might have missed - I might have added in

412
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,320
 the "A".

413
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,640
 So I'm not going to put that on the article, "Redder" or Lorraine.

414
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:05,360
 Anyways, she's following this trail that has a human blood on it and the other - the hillbillies

415
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,280
 are following behind and then Ed is like barely walking after.

416
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,520
 He's like, "That's all made up."

417
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,360
 I don't believe - I don't even believe my wife has these psychic powers.

418
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,080
 She's just really hot and good in bed.

419
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,400
 So I just play along.

420
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,400
 I don't care.

421
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,040
 I think - I know it's all fake.

422
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:25,400
 I've been faking hauntings for the past 20 years just to keep my hot wife interested

423
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,280
 in going to spooky hotels with me.

424
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,280
 That's not true.

425
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,240
 That is 100% an allegation.

426
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,240
 It's a joke.

427
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,600
 I don't assume a state of the warrants.

428
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:43,200
 Anyways, they follow this viscous trail of a human blood to a cliff and then nothing.

429
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:50,000
 So the idea is that Bigfoot either killed himself, jumped off the cliff, or was running

430
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,880
 so hard and his foot hurt so bad that he just really wasn't paying attention to where he's

431
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,680
 running and accidentally ran off the cliff, like Wiley Coyote.

432
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:04,840
 And I guess the story has an afterword as well, where Ed Warren says, "I think Bigfoot's

433
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,000
 not real.

434
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,240
 I think it's a tulpa.

435
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,400
 I think it's a thought form.

436
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,640
 I think it's something that so many people have believed in.

437
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,360
 It has become something that's real and that's Bigfoot."

438
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,840
 I think that it probably just ran off the cliff and then just magically disappeared,

439
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,240
 which raises a couple of interesting questions.

440
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,920
 One, we've talked about tulpas before and I've talked about Bigfoot's being tulpas as

441
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,920
 well.

442
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,760
 So me and Ed were in the same vein.

443
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:35,480
 But you know, I think that's kind of a common sub belief among Bigfoot followers.

444
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,360
 Not Bigfoot followers because that's like they're super into Bigfoot being real.

445
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,680
 But people who kind of just look at it every once in a while go, "It could just be people's

446
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,880
 imagination have made it real."

447
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,080
 But here's the interesting question about that.

448
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:54,040
 If that's true, can you have a psychic link to a tulpa you didn't create?

449
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:58,440
 Because you can have psychic links to tulpas you did create if you listened to my episode

450
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,000
 about the guy creating the cartoon character and having sex with it and it's screaming

451
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,440
 in his brain for the rest of his life.

452
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,040
 We don't know if he killed himself or not.

453
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:12,480
 But can you have a psychic link with a tulpa that you didn't create?

454
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,040
 If you can have a psychic link with a tulpa that you didn't create, then a tulpa really

455
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,560
 is technically life at that point.

456
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,200
 If there's a tulpa that can be released into the world and it's indistinguishable from

457
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:31,640
 any other life form and it has its own inner thoughts, it has basically its own soul, then

458
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,000
 it's its own life form.

459
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,400
 And then in that case, do tulpas, well where do tulpas go when they die?

460
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,080
 Does their soul go somewhere?

461
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,760
 Do they deserve rights?

462
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,760
 Do these imaginary creatures that become real deserve rights?

463
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,200
 Those are all huge rabbit holes that I don't want to jump into.

464
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,120
 At the end of an episode like this, maybe we'll do it on a future episode.

465
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,760
 But I think it's interesting, the reason why I wanted to look at this was you have someone

466
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:03,080
 who's made all of their money telling people that ghosts are real and houses can be haunted

467
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:09,080
 and Annabelle is dolls running around and Annabelle too is dolls running around in the

468
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:17,320
 olden times and the none and all this stuff is based off these stories and legends from

469
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,320
 the Warrens.

470
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:24,720
 And the Conjuring Universe is really the only other big cinematic universe is the Conjuring

471
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,720
 Universe.

472
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,040
 You have Marvel Universe and Conjuring Universe and that's about it.

473
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,720
 Other ones like Fast and Furious is just kind of a franchise but Conjuring Universe has

474
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,920
 all these interconnected movies and it's funny because even they're like I don't believe

475
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,920
 in Bigfoot.

476
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:42,800
 Like until they have that encounter they can see dolls running around and all sorts of

477
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,880
 crazy stuff but when someone brought a Bigfoot to them they're like I don't believe in it.

478
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,080
 I think that's a pretty normal thing.

479
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,520
 Plus, James Wan, I know you listen to this show, you gotta do this Bigfoot movie.

480
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,400
 You have to include a Bigfoot reference in at least one of the next Conjuring Universe

481
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,400
 movies.

482
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,120
 Gotta put a Bigfoot in there.

483
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:06,040
 It would be a deep cut for the true Warren worshippers out there.

484
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:12,520
 So that is the story of Lorraine and Ed Warren meeting Bigfoot which is similar like stating

485
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,080
 something like the Mummy meets Frankenstein.

486
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,920
 You have these huge paranormal investigators, these heavyweights in one world and then you

487
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,640
 have this heavyweight in the world of cryptids actually meeting.

488
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,320
 I'm surprised this story isn't more popular but it's not, I would assume it's not more

489
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,760
 popular because it's fake and they knew it when it stand up to scrutiny if they were

490
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,880
 constantly questioned about Bigfoot so they just kind of wrote it in a book, kind of tossed

491
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,880
 it away.

492
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,120
 I could be wrong on that though.

493
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:44,160
 I'm kind of harsh on the Warrens just because of their, some of their cases turned out to

494
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,360
 be fraudulent.

495
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,800
 Not them but the people behind the cases it turned out not to be true.

496
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:54,320
 So you know, I'm a little more harsh on them but they did good paranormal work.

497
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,120
 They kind of brought that more into the whole like haunting stuff and they're part of the

498
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,080
 big boom.

499
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,320
 With that, but Amityville was a hoax, Enfield Haunting was a hoax and they were kind of

500
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,880
 involved in these things.

501
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,320
 I think, I think.

502
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,880
 I don't know what their level of involvement was but yeah, you know, that's the problem.

503
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,360
 You get caught up in a couple different hoaxes.

504
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:18,080
 You could really run into Bigfoot and have a psychic conversation with him in the woods

505
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,600
 and then eventually Hillbilly hunks the horn and Bigfoot kills himself.

506
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,760
 That could be the one true story you tell but you know, how many times do I have to

507
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:31,120
 believe that Annabelle the doll got raised by the nun and then the Amityville house and

508
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,480
 then they moved to Enfield.

509
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,520
 Like, at what point do I have to say, I don't think that's true and they're like, no, no,

510
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,520
 no, we really saw Bigfoot.

511
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,520
 Here's some of his blood.

512
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,760
 It's so viscous and I'm like, you know, what can I say?

513
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,220
 Could be the one true story out of all the nonsense.

514
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:51,080
 Could be more nonsense and a story of nonsense or they could all could be true.

515
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,280
 But one thing's for sure, I'm gonna read this book because I want to find out about porno

516
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,360
 theater demons.

517
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:17,560
 And once I do, we'll have to talk about it on Dead Rabbit Radio.

518
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:31,960
 Bye.

519
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,540
 (upbeat music)
