1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,200
 In the town of Alma, Kansas sits a chair, but if you sit there, you'll disappear.

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,320
 You- now from now on, these intros are all gonna rhyme.

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:21,120
 And then we traveled to Russia to take a look at a group of coal miners who found a giant

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,100
 box deep inside of a coal mine.

5
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,960
 When they're able to get it to the surface and they try to open it up, they have no idea

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:37,160
 they're about to unlock an 800 million year old mystery.

7
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,080
 Today on Dead Rabbit Braking.

8
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:50,760
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Braking.

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,760
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, and I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,640
 I hope you guys are having a great day too, I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,480
 whatever you're doing.

12
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,880
 We got a lot of stuff to cover, so we're gonna get started right away.

13
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,520
 First off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now, everyone get on your feet and give

14
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,280
 a big round of applause for our newest Patreon supporter, Melissa.

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,280
 Woohoo!

16
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,280
 Yeah!

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,280
 Come on in, Melissa.

18
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,840
 She's bringing in a birthday cake.

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,600
 Oh man, I'm still trying to eat through that ice cream cake I got on Saturday.

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,320
 Melissa, just go ahead and make the cake or something.

21
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,760
 I just throw it in the corner there.

22
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,480
 Maybe I'll get to it eventually.

23
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,760
 But Melissa, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

24
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,800
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, or if you haven't gotten diabetes over the past

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,920
 24 hours, that's fine too.

26
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,040
 Preferably you didn't have the second one.

27
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,760
 Just help spread the word about this show that really, really, really helps out a lot.

28
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,400
 Now Melissa, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider.

29
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,040
 And grab onto her ankles.

30
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,760
 And Melissa, jump off the highest point of Dead Rabbit Command.

31
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,160
 We're gonna glide all the way out to Alma, Kansas.

32
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:00,160
 [Hissing]

33
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,640
 I'm eating ice cream cake as we're flying.

34
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,640
 I'm...

35
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,640
 Uh...

36
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,160
 Melissa, land us gracefully as you can here at Alma, Kansas.

37
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,960
 We're walking around the town of Alma.

38
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,960
 It's a tiny little town.

39
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,600
 It has less than a thousand people in it.

40
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
 We're walking around.

41
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,080
 Within probably like an hour, we could say hi to everyone if there's only a thousand

42
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,080
 people.

43
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,960
 Actually, Jamie, can you run the math on that?

44
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,960
 How many people?

45
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,320
 Let's actually find out.

46
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,520
 If I greeted a person a minute, it would take me a thousand minutes.

47
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,520
 So never mind.

48
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,520
 Never mind.

49
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,400
 Forget my original assumption.

50
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,400
 This is not a math class podcast.

51
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,720
 Takes us a while, but we finally say hello to everyone in the city of Alma.

52
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,480
 And that's not why we're here.

53
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,680
 We're actually here to check out Alma's Cemetery.

54
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,440
 So finally, when we walk out of town, a thousand minutes later as we walk out of town, we're

55
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,120
 gonna reach Alma's Cemetery.

56
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,920
 Alma Cemetery is what it's known as.

57
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,200
 And as we're walking through it, I go, "Hey, bro, dude, check this out.

58
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,600
 You see that over there?"

59
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,080
 And I'm like, "Have my arm wrapped around you?"

60
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,960
 And I'm like, "Get you to show cold and I'm making you look where I'm pointing.

61
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,760
 Look, look over there."

62
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,480
 That is known as the Devil's Chair.

63
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,640
 And you see like this chair just sitting in the cemetery.

64
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:18,360
 And I go, "According to legend, if you sit in that chair, everything's fine, right?

65
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
 It's just a comfy chair.

66
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,360
 You sit in the chair.

67
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,360
 No big deal.

68
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:28,600
 But if you sit in that chair and nobody's looking at you, you disappear."

69
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,520
 So it's kind of like that movie Don't Blink.

70
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,560
 Did you guys ever see that movie with Brian Austin Green and Mena Savari?

71
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
 Pretty decent movie.

72
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,040
 Basically, it's the same setup, except that took place in a cabin.

73
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,400
 If someone's not looking at you, you disappear.

74
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,160
 You totally disappear.

75
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:52,720
 So I'm dragging you over to this chair and I sit you down and then I go, "Okay, buddy.

76
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,040
 Thanks for listening to the show.

77
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,680
 Really, really appreciate it."

78
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,880
 But a bird just flew by.

79
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,800
 I got a look in the other direction and I turn around and when I look back, you're

80
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,040
 gone.

81
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,240
 Back in the 1800s, there's a little bit of history that goes along with the story, apparently,

82
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,240
 right?

83
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,920
 There have been other paranormal researchers that have looked into this.

84
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,480
 Back in the 1800s, though, this is the story where the city of Alma is now.

85
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,480
 It was founded back in 1867, so late 1800s.

86
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,560
 There was this farmer.

87
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,480
 There was this mean old farmer who owned all of this land in the portion of what would

88
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,960
 eventually become the cemetery.

89
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,320
 And he had all of this land.

90
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,560
 He had all of this land just to himself and he's sitting there and he's like, "Oh, he's

91
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,520
 not even letting the cows graze on his land.

92
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,520
 They're like, "Dude, you're a farmer.

93
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,080
 You should share it with your cows."

94
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,080
 Never.

95
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,400
 This is my grass to chew.

96
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,400
 I'm not numb.

97
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,920
 He was a mean old farmer.

98
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,840
 And the city eventually was like, "You know, we really need to build a cemetery somewhere

99
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,560
 in town.

100
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,600
 Maybe we should ask the meanest man around if he'll give us some land."

101
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,280
 So the townspeople, not all of them.

102
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,000
 It wasn't like a lynch mob or anything.

103
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,360
 But you know, you have city officials go out to him and his name, I don't, they don't

104
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
 have his name.

105
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,440
 At least I didn't write it down on my notes, but he was farmer Jim.

106
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,400
 Town officials come out and they go, "Hey Jim, we are wondering if we could buy some

107
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,160
 of this land to build our cemetery on."

108
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,960
 He's like, "Well, haven't you guys heard my reputation?

109
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,720
 I'm like the meanest dude around."

110
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,760
 And they're like, "Yeah, we kind of knew that.

111
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,000
 But we were figuring, you know, we do this whole thing where we give you money and you

112
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 give us some, and return."

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,880
 He's all chasing him off with a bitch where he's like, "I'm too mean to understand capitalism.

114
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,880
 Get out of here."

115
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,320
 Well, the city really wanted this land.

116
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,520
 I wonder if it's like, I don't know why they specifically wanted his land.

117
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,520
 Maybe it was flat.

118
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,600
 I imagine graveyards, you prefer them to be flat.

119
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,400
 You don't want like a super bumpy graveyard.

120
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,760
 You don't want like rolling hills.

121
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:53,800
 You don't want it to look like this peaceful glen, a river running through it.

122
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,840
 And it would just be easier to mow.

123
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,280
 Imagine that's where you want a flat cemetery.

124
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,960
 You want to want to put a cemetery in like a hilly area or make a lot of gravel and

125
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,960
 stuff like that.

126
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,280
 Anyway, so they really wanted this land, he wouldn't sell it to them.

127
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,360
 Well, one day, the townspeople, they continue to go out there apparently.

128
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,680
 They're like, "Maybe it'll be different.

129
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,640
 Maybe he won't chase us away with a pitchfork.

130
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,240
 Maybe it'll just be a shotgun full of rock salt."

131
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,360
 And that's an improvement.

132
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,280
 They go out there one day and they're like, "Jim, hey Jim, we're here to get chased off

133
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,280
 your farm again."

134
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,280
 "Jim?

135
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,280
 Hey Jim."

136
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,960
 "I couldn't find him anywhere."

137
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,240
 "Jim, where you at buddy?"

138
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,040
 Eventually, the city officials, they check everywhere and they're like, "Where possibly

139
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,040
 could Jim be?"

140
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,040
 "I don't know, but I started smelling something with this one.

141
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,800
 What does somebody do with the mysterious disappearance of this guy?"

142
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,960
 I smell something really weird coming from the well.

143
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,440
 It smells kind of like stinky down there.

144
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,600
 And sure enough, the well is stinky.

145
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,360
 The well smells, well stinky is probably understating it.

146
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,440
 It smells like rotting flesh.

147
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,640
 The smell, it smells like death.

148
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,560
 And they kind of look down the well, but they don't investigate it too much.

149
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,520
 They just go, "Oh, well, I guess then that we couldn't find Jim and for all we know he

150
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,320
 abandoned this property.

151
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,800
 Let's go ahead and just take it over.

152
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,280
 Let's build a cemetery here.

153
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,720
 That's what Jim would have wanted anyways.

154
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,480
 And maybe if he ever comes back in town, we'll give him the money for his land."

155
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:31,600
 And so they ended up building the Alma Cemetery on his land.

156
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,920
 Well, flash forward to the 1980s.

157
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:40,720
 So it's a pretty long jump, right, between the initial mystery of what happened at Farmer

158
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,320
 Jim's property to now or to the 1980s.

159
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,200
 An urban legend starts to spring up around town.

160
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,760
 Hey, you know that cemetery?

161
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,920
 Alma Cemetery, the only cemetery in town?

162
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,920
 Yeah, sure buddy.

163
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,920
 Well, let's go there.

164
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,120
 Let's go there and hang out.

165
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:01,080
 And I heard that there's a chair you can sit in for all you teens that are into drugs

166
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,920
 and alcohol, but also want to rest your legs.

167
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:11,320
 Apparently right near the spot where Jim had "gone missing," right, the idea is that

168
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:16,840
 he fell into the well and couldn't get out and died, there was a chair, right, because

169
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,800
 everything was just kind of covered up.

170
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,920
 There was a chair there.

171
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,080
 Maybe it was part of somebody's gravestone.

172
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,320
 Maybe it was just a folding chair that some lazy guy brought, sat down for a funeral and

173
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,760
 he's too lazy to carry it out.

174
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,000
 He's like, "Ah, whatever."

175
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,280
 There's this chair there and teenagers started going there late at night.

176
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:39,080
 They're drinking, having sex, they're doing all the stuff you see in those movies.

177
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,760
 And one of the teenagers goes missing.

178
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,760
 What?

179
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,760
 Where'd Joey go?

180
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,120
 Oh, oh.

181
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,680
 They gnashed their teeth and lamented, Joey.

182
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,680
 So the legend arose.

183
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,040
 I don't know how many times this happened, right?

184
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,400
 Generally, like we say on the show, first one is an anomaly, the second one's a coincidence,

185
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,080
 but the third time's a phenomenon.

186
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,200
 You would have to have it happen so many times before this legend started.

187
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,960
 If you sit in the devil's chair and no one's looking at you, you will disappear.

188
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,480
 That's the legend that sprung up around town.

189
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,920
 I'm sure teenagers are putting to a test and all of that stuff.

190
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,640
 And to this day, it is a ghost story.

191
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,520
 It's a ghost story that has left the town of Alma and hit the age of the internet.

192
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,920
 Now, what's really interesting is I originally found out, if I remember correctly, I originally

193
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,480
 found out about this from my favorite book, The National Directory of Haunted Places.

194
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:39,960
 And I was researching this and two ghost hunting groups did on-the-ground research into this

195
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,560
 area.

196
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,680
 One of them we talked about last week, they're a now-defunct paranormal group called Enam

197
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,000
 Paranormal.

198
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,760
 They had boots on the ground, they were doing an investigation in this area.

199
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,440
 The other one is a group called darkkansas.com.

200
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,440
 Now when, I've had these notes sitting there for like a year.

201
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,080
 I had this story ready to go for a long time.

202
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:10,360
 And I'm trying to do like a ghost story a day for Halloween, like this 31 days of October

203
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,360
 or spooktobular, whatever.

204
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,160
 Whatever I came up with.

205
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,360
 I'm just hoping to get a ghost story for episode for the first week and then after that who

206
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,360
 knows what's going to happen.

207
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,240
 But I've been going through my notes, I've been looking for some really cool ghost stories.

208
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,360
 What's so interesting about this, and this could just be a coincidence, but last week

209
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,160
 I told you guys that Enam Paranormal is gone.

210
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,680
 Their website's completely gone.

211
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,720
 Everything they did is scrubbed from the internet.

212
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,200
 They investigated this.

213
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:43,520
 Darkkansas, the other group that investigated this, is also no more.

214
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,200
 Websites completely gone.

215
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,600
 All their research is gone now.

216
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:52,000
 The most likely scenario is that the groups broke up and they could no longer, or no longer,

217
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,800
 had a will to pay their hosting bills for the internet hosting website.

218
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,120
 And all the information was gone.

219
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:04,360
 However, I do find that, like I said, once is an anomaly twice is a coincidence.

220
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,000
 It is interesting that both these groups both investigated the devil's chair and then they

221
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,960
 both went out of business.

222
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,640
 On the other hand, these paranormal groups go out of business quite often.

223
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,200
 Same thing with Paranormal Podcasts, right?

224
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,840
 I always hope that the show goes on for a long time, but you just don't know, right?

225
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,320
 External factors can always interfere with things.

226
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,040
 So both of these websites are down that talked about it.

227
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,600
 Really all I have in my notes that you can click on is the Wikipedia page for Alma, Kansas.

228
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,520
 All of this on the boot stuff is gone.

229
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,240
 But what's in, I mean, obviously I have the story prepped to go.

230
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,320
 I have these notes to look at.

231
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,520
 What's interesting is one of the two groups, and I'm not for sure which one I got this

232
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:51,640
 from, but they talk about, listen, if you go to Alma Cemetery now, there is no chair.

233
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,080
 It doesn't exist anymore.

234
00:11:53,080 --> 00:12:00,920
 They said, what you'll find is this kind of rickety old structure type of thing.

235
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:08,400
 Not like it has a roof or anything like that, but it's just, you see, the remains of something

236
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,600
 and it's right over a deep well.

237
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,000
 So the initial part of the story does seem to be true.

238
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,880
 They have this well, they have a well who wants to drink fresh water out of a graveyard,

239
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,040
 but I'm sure some wizard is glad that that's still there.

240
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,080
 He can use it to cast some spells, but there's this deep well and there's like a rotting

241
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,280
 structure over it.

242
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:36,680
 And the theory was, was people that the story does have a little bit of legs to it where

243
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:42,560
 people were goofing off in this area and they were falling into the well.

244
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,240
 And that's where the idea of, oh, and they disappeared and I never saw them again.

245
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,880
 They just fell, they fell 20 feet into a well and then someone had to go get a rope or get

246
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,240
 the fire department to get the dude out.

247
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,440
 So that probably did happen a couple times in the 80s as you had these people walking

248
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,120
 around the graveyard drinking and smoking and all that stuff.

249
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,880
 You probably did have a couple of reports of people falling into the well and that became

250
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,680
 the story of if you, if you sit there and no one's looking at you, you disappear forever.

251
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,120
 What's interesting though is we also have, I also have these notes in my show notes and

252
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,240
 again it sucks because we don't know exactly which group did this investigation, but they

253
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,360
 had another take on it.

254
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,760
 They go, yeah, there is something you can sit on.

255
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,840
 They may not necessarily call it a chair, but there is an area you can sit down.

256
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,600
 And remember the legend is if no one's looking at you, that's when this happens.

257
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,040
 They said, I went to this location and I sat down, I was about to sit down.

258
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,880
 We're there with a couple of friends and I said, hey, I'm going to go ahead and sit in

259
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:47,800
 this chair, but don't look away because that's a key component of this mystery.

260
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,800
 I'm going to sit in this chair right next to this well, right next to this well opening.

261
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
 Don't look away.

262
00:13:53,800 --> 00:14:03,680
 And this ghost researcher says, as I was sitting down, both of my friends swear they heard something

263
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,840
 behind them.

264
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:12,480
 And as my butt's about to hit the chair, they're actually turning around to look at something

265
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,920
 in the distance.

266
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,240
 So the person left up out of the chair and started screaming at him for turning around.

267
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,920
 And dude, I told you guys not to turn around and they said it's almost like an involuntary

268
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,920
 thing.

269
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:32,080
 Like as someone sitting down and other noise happens, that makes you turn to look.

270
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,240
 It's an interesting phenomenon.

271
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,600
 This is a place that I would really like to see some photos from.

272
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,640
 I would really like to see a photo of you from the well, just the cameras like looking

273
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,600
 up at a circle of light in the sky.

274
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,600
 I think it's fascinating.

275
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,840
 I love these type of stories, right?

276
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,360
 Where you get a little bit of truth, a little bit of legend.

277
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,760
 You get a ghost story with a rational explanation, right?

278
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,000
 Like I'm sure people have fallen into this well because who expects for there to be a

279
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,360
 well in a graveyard?

280
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,640
 And teenagers aren't visiting the graveyards during the sunniest part of the day, right?

281
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,520
 They're doing it at night where they won't get caught by the police, where they can smoke

282
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,960
 and drink and fool around and all that stuff.

283
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:15,280
 And when you add all that stuff in, the chances of you falling into a well go up, right?

284
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,720
 When you're drinking, Yeager mice are right out of the bottle that you stole from your

285
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,720
 dad's cabinet.

286
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,280
 There's a very high likelihood that you're going to fall into a well if one is nearby.

287
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,480
 So fascinating story.

288
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,320
 I really do want to do like a ghost story a day this month.

289
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,640
 I've never been able to pull off a full spooktobular.

290
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,120
 I always just kind of forget.

291
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,240
 I always just kind of forget halfway through the month what month it is.

292
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,760
 But that's two in a row, baby.

293
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,440
 We got those and I really like the story.

294
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:45,120
 And it is, again, I hate it to, I hate to see these paranormal groups go under.

295
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,920
 It is, unfortunately, a risk of the business.

296
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,800
 I'm not saying that both of these groups eventually, they all fell into the well, although I could

297
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,880
 say that because they both investigated it.

298
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,880
 But yeah, it sucks.

299
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,240
 These groups do this and they get a lot of good information.

300
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,000
 And then one day you just go to check the website and gone.

301
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,200
 But thanks for your on the ground research and all the work you've done before, Enam,

302
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,040
 Paranormal and Dark Kansas.

303
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,360
 Well, so let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the world famous.

304
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,160
 Garbantacopter, we're leaving behind Alma, Kansas.

305
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:25,440
 Fly us all the way out to Russia.

306
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,240
 This is another story like the first one that's interesting because you can kind of see how

307
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,640
 parts of it could be real.

308
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,000
 Parts of it could be legend.

309
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,920
 And I believe in this one, parts of it could be government disinformation.

310
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,320
 Definitely government disinformation.

311
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,960
 Definitely making the story more ridiculous than it may have originally started off.

312
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,800
 But we're headed back to Russia.

313
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:58,200
 Specifically we're in the town of Zavchik, that's in the Tulski district of the Khmerovar

314
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,760
 region in Russia.

315
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,920
 It's September 1969 and it's a bright sunny morning.

316
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,160
 Hey, dude, bring that coal over.

317
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,280
 Some guy yells and all of a sudden we're wearing like old coal mining Russian outfits.

318
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,880
 We're like, oh man, we got the hat on with a little lamp and some guys hitting us with

319
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,880
 a shovel.

320
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,280
 Get in the coal, get to the day started.

321
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,280
 Go down there.

322
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,160
 And all of a sudden we're walking through this coal mine.

323
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,560
 We become slaves in the shop.

324
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,880
 I don't think they're getting beat with shovels.

325
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,360
 I'm sure people are like happy to show up for work in the coal mine.

326
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,560
 But anyways, they're walking through the coal mine and we're about to meet a guy at the

327
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,560
 bottom of this coal mine.

328
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,360
 And when I say bottom, we're going down 230 feet.

329
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,440
 We're walking through the coal mine and stuff like that.

330
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,440
 Oh, my legs are tired.

331
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,440
 I'm in a mine cart and you guys are pushing me.

332
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,480
 I'm like, I ate so much ice cream cake, I can't walk anymore.

333
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,080
 We're about to meet a guy named Alexander Ivanovich Karnakov.

334
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,160
 And he's standing down there at the bottom of the mine.

335
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,200
 He is a blacksmith working for the mine.

336
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,560
 So he was probably down there like repairing something.

337
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,720
 I don't know, maybe repairing the mine cart that I shattered with my ice cream infused

338
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,920
 weight.

339
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,920
 He's down there.

340
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,920
 He's fixing stuff.

341
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:16,040
 And it's funny, I got to say right now in this detail, he's a blacksmith in the mine.

342
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,040
 There's a lot of variations of the story.

343
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,840
 A lot of times, if you're familiar with this story, you're probably thinking, no, no, that's

344
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,840
 not true.

345
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,680
 This story's been told so many times that there have been other news sites that have

346
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,200
 tried to correct some of the details because a lot of these people did exist.

347
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,200
 A lot of these people did exist.

348
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,720
 They just are going to be involved in such a fantastical story that you really start

349
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,280
 to think like, what is real and what isn't.

350
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,960
 But Alexander Ivanovich Karnakov was actually the blacksmith of the mining company.

351
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,600
 He was not a miner himself.

352
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,040
 You'll see other reports stating that.

353
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,040
 He's a blacksmith.

354
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,040
 He's working down there.

355
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,560
 And while they're down there in the darkness, they have their little headlamps, probably

356
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,160
 some lamps hanging from the ceiling.

357
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,880
 He probably had modern technology, actually, it wasn't like a little oil lamp.

358
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:07,600
 But anyways, as they're down there, Alexander finds embedded in the wall of the cave.

359
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:13,520
 It's actually sticking out of this cold seam along the side of the wall, the side of the

360
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,520
 mine.

361
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:19,400
 They see this giant rectangular box.

362
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,440
 And they can obviously tell it doesn't belong to part of the...

363
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,320
 It's not a natural formation.

364
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,560
 For one, it's made of marble.

365
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:34,440
 So even a geology expert would realize it doesn't normally just a giant thing of marble

366
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,440
 like a giant perfectly...

367
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:45,320
 Well, marble does come from mines, but not perfectly ornately carved a six foot long marble

368
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,720
 rectangle inside this coal seam.

369
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,720
 So they immediately start liking, okay, whatever we are doing today, we're coal miners.

370
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,960
 We're getting coal.

371
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,800
 Let's coal mine this particular part.

372
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,720
 Let's get this giant chunk of marble out.

373
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,480
 Because they can obviously tell it's not a natural formation.

374
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,600
 All work at the site is stopped.

375
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,720
 Everything stops because they want to get this out of here.

376
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:13,040
 They can see that it is manmade.

377
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:20,000
 Not just from the smooth edges, not that it's just a perfect rectangle, but there's a seam.

378
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,600
 There's a seam that runs along the upper top of it.

379
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:30,520
 Like there's a lid on it and they see a seam and it's covered with this paste.

380
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,480
 It's covered with some sort of sealant on it.

381
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,960
 So anyways, all work is stopped.

382
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:42,600
 They're able to get this giant heavy box out of the coal seam and slowly but surely they

383
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:48,080
 move it out of the mine onto the surface.

384
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:54,000
 And it was sealed with this putty that they could tell it had been.

385
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,840
 However long this has been down here for, the sealant had petrified.

386
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,720
 It had turned to stone.

387
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,520
 So they're out there in the morning sun and they're smashing this thing.

388
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,920
 This is the wondrous thing.

389
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,920
 They want to get it open.

390
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,000
 They're smashing it with hammers and chisels and stuff like that.

391
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,360
 And they can't break through the putty and they just keep smashing.

392
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,360
 Smash, they can't do it.

393
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,360
 They're taking shifts.

394
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,600
 They're trying to get this open and it won't open up.

395
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:29,960
 However, the putty starts to slowly drip, drip, drip off.

396
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,840
 And it's not because of all of the force they're applying to it.

397
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:45,520
 The sun, the heat of the mid-morning sun is melting off this sealant.

398
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,520
 Now it's September.

399
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,520
 The sun's not that hot.

400
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,040
 It's not that hot out.

401
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:57,920
 However, this box was never meant to be exposed to the sun.

402
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,160
 So the sealant completely drips off onto the ground.

403
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,360
 And as it's dripping off, this shows an intrepid individual.

404
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:10,400
 I consider myself a pretty good hunter of the weird.

405
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,400
 I wouldn't do this.

406
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,400
 I wouldn't do this.

407
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,600
 I wouldn't never do this, right?

408
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,640
 This guy, as this sealant is dripping off at this point, is pretty much liquid running

409
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:24,160
 down the side of this box and just dropping across the forest floor.

410
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,000
 Some dude licks it.

411
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,360
 He runs his finger through it and goes, "Ah, that's good putty.

412
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,960
 That's the most delicious putty."

413
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:39,280
 He licked it and according to reports, he's a guy we don't have the name of.

414
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,440
 There's nobody who would want to report this dude's name.

415
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,160
 This is a story that the locals in the area will swear up and down is true.

416
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,920
 And that's what I like about this because I'm going to tell you the story as we know

417
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,760
 it and then I'm going to tell you what I think is the government disinformation.

418
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,560
 But one of the guys, the locals probably know it, would be like, "Oh, it's that, you know,

419
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,720
 him is crazy Joey.

420
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,240
 Crazy Joey."

421
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:09,080
 For sure, he licked this goo off and they said that a week later, he went crazy.

422
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:17,960
 And the next February, February 1970, he froze to death right outside of his own home.

423
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,240
 So just a word to the royal.

424
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,120
 If you ever find a giant box, hit it in the earth.

425
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,120
 Don't lick it.

426
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,560
 I might lick an alien's head.

427
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,680
 Like a great alien, I might walk up to it and lick the back of its head.

428
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:33,000
 You know, that would probably be how much licking I would do.

429
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 But don't do that.

430
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,200
 Don't probably don't do the alien thing either.

431
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,520
 That's not an endorsement of that.

432
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,880
 I would just be curious.

433
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,880
 You have that.

434
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,880
 And one thing to kind of skip to the end too, almost all the principles in this story.

435
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,600
 We have Alexander who found it.

436
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:52,400
 Then we have another Alexander who is the guy who runs the mining company or in charge

437
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,820
 of the operation in this area and a bunch of other principles in this story.

438
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,720
 They're all dead within a year or two.

439
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,520
 And you'll see a lot of reports like one of them died of an ulcer.

440
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:07,800
 One of them got crushed under the wheels of a giant Soviet-era truck.

441
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,040
 So this story leaves a bloodbath as well.

442
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,760
 And that's again, people go, people in the area go, it was a cover like that guy really

443
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,080
 didn't die of an ulcer.

444
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:21,520
 That person was not accidentally killed underneath the wheels of that six-axle truck.

445
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,600
 Was killed by the government.

446
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:27,200
 But anyways, the guy who went crazy, the guy who went crazy from licking the stuff, the

447
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,120
 Soviets didn't have to do anything to him.

448
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,720
 They just figured his time was coming up.

449
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,800
 Anyways, this giant box is now on the surface.

450
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:38,240
 The putty has completely melted off.

451
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,280
 And they are finally able to lift the lid.

452
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:50,680
 The men of the coal mining company now find themselves standing around an open coffin.

453
00:24:50,680 --> 00:25:00,120
 This sarcophagus was filled almost to the brim with a pink, blue, pink and blue mixed

454
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,360
 together crystal clear liquid.

455
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,360
 I love that detail.

456
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,320
 It doesn't make sense.

457
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,840
 Right, try to imagine that.

458
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:16,160
 Try to imagine pink and blue mixed together in such perfect amounts that you can see both

459
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,440
 colors and one color doesn't overpower the other one.

460
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,920
 And it's see-through.

461
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,640
 The story could totally be made up, but in the world of the paranormal, in the world of

462
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,440
 UFOs, things like that, we'll see things that just don't make sense.

463
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,440
 Because they don't make sense.

464
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,440
 It's a world of paranormal.

465
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,360
 So they're looking at this liquid and it's pink and blue in equal measures.

466
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,840
 One is not more than the other.

467
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,240
 And it's see-through at the same time.

468
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,480
 You can look right through it.

469
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,520
 And submerged in this liquid is a human.

470
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,800
 A human woman.

471
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,920
 She's described as five foot nine.

472
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,920
 She's Slavic.

473
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:04,680
 She has Slavic features.

474
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:09,040
 And her eyes are wide open.

475
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:15,960
 Big beautiful blue eyes staring upwards.

476
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,720
 But she's dead.

477
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,240
 She's clearly deceased.

478
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:26,400
 Although what makes you think she's deceased is she's not moving.

479
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,200
 She's in a coffin.

480
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,600
 She's in a coffin.

481
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,280
 She's been down in this coal mine for who knows how long.

482
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,640
 Remember, this was embedded into the side of the mine.

483
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,520
 So it's not like someone just dropped her off yesterday.

484
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:45,120
 However, although they reasonably know that she's dead, just from all of that, she has...

485
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,080
 Her cheeks are blush.

486
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,960
 Like she... it looks like she has color in her face.

487
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,920
 The describer is being around 30 years old.

488
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,080
 That would be the age that she would think.

489
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:01,520
 And she had long blonde hair, thick dark blonde curls that reached all the way down to her

490
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,520
 waist.

491
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:09,000
 And she's laying there perfectly still, submerged in this liquid.

492
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,320
 Near her head is a small black rectangular box.

493
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,800
 Just sitting there.

494
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,800
 And it's been compared...

495
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:25,760
 They don't give any details as to specifically this, but it's been compared to the size.

496
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,880
 The size and the general shape would be the equivalent of a cell phone.

497
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,280
 They are not saying it's a cell phone.

498
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,240
 They weren't saying that there was a screensaver or buttons on it or anything like that.

499
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,800
 That's just kind of what it's been compared to.

500
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,880
 She was also only wearing one thing.

501
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:50,080
 She was wearing a long see-through, totally see-through dress.

502
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,880
 A lace dress.

503
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,360
 No underwear.

504
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,240
 So all these perverts, a thousand fetishes were born that day at the coal mine.

505
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,880
 All these perverts could look around at this naked woman wearing this see-through lace dress.

506
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:09,320
 And if you didn't know she was pulled out of a sarcophagus that was embedded deep inside

507
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,120
 of a coal mine, you would have thought she was just sleeping.

508
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,600
 I mean, also not underneath this ethereal goo.

509
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,720
 If this body was just sitting in your bed, you would assume that this woman was just

510
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,680
 sleeping.

511
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:27,960
 Now this was a coal mine very near the town of Rastik.

512
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
 Right?

513
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,520
 It was right there.

514
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:36,200
 So as like once the boxes found, you already had people going to the village being like,

515
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,680
 "Dude, we found something really weird in the coal mine.

516
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,480
 We found a giant box."

517
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,760
 And you'd have like grandmas there making pancakes and say, "Ah, a giant box, I don't

518
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,760
 care about that."

519
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,880
 Back in 1863, we found the biggest box of all.

520
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:55,560
 You kids in your boxes, you have people going back, leaving the coal mine and telling people

521
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,560
 about this.

522
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,000
 "Oh, we finally got it free from the side of the mountain.

523
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 We're hauling it up."

524
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,800
 "Oh, you know, I'll come down there and check it out."

525
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,360
 "Yeah, come on down."

526
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,720
 So by the time that this box is getting opened up, people are still running back and forth

527
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,240
 to the village being like, "We got it sealed and some crazy guy ate some of it.

528
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,120
 Can you believe that?"

529
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,720
 More and more people are coming to see this as this is progressing because this is all

530
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,080
 happening in the morning.

531
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,320
 And by the end, when the box is finally opened up and you realize it's a coffin and people

532
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:27,680
 are running back to town for the remaining like two dozen people that haven't come out

533
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,560
 to see yet, they're like, "Dude, there's a woman in the box."

534
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:35,040
 Even then, the grandmas done making pancakes at that point, she's like, "What?"

535
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:39,920
 One in the village came to look at this thing because they have this giant stone sarcophagus

536
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,920
 with a woman inside of it inside this liquid.

537
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,520
 There's a bunch of perverts again.

538
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,520
 They're like, "Oh, she's nude.

539
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,960
 I can't wait to be down there."

540
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:56,520
 So of course, the authorities are also alerted.

541
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,720
 You have like firefighters showing up.

542
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,240
 I think they have a better thing to do.

543
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,440
 You know the military and the police are going to say, "What?"

544
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,280
 The firefighters, cats left in trees all over the region.

545
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:10,040
 So a bunch of firefighters can come out there and see this.

546
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,880
 This is a astonishing sight.

547
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,120
 And of course, the police and the military did show up and they're taking a look at it

548
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,840
 and they have no idea what to do.

549
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,960
 This is obviously some sort of anomaly.

550
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:25,320
 We've covered a lot of Soviet UFO stories and the one thing that always happens in these

551
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:30,080
 stories is the Soviet government gets involved.

552
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:44,320
 So by 2 p.m. that same day, a massive, what's known as, they keep using this terminology,

553
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:51,320
 brick-colored helicopter, a brick-colored helicopter, which I'm assuming is what we

554
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,240
 would call like a tan helicopter, like a clay brick.

555
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,440
 I don't think it was like a red brick, but like a clay, like a military type helicopter,

556
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,440
 right?

557
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,840
 Like a cargo helicopter.

558
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,520
 [imitates helicopter]

559
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,920
 Comes to the area and you've got to love the Soviet Union.

560
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:12,480
 They did kill tens of millions of people and one of the most brutal regimes in modern

561
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,880
 times, but they, for some reason, think everyone's an idiot.

562
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:23,480
 This giant military vehicle lands and outsteps 12 people in civilian clothes.

563
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,920
 Because, you know, they just want to blend in with the locals, right?

564
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:31,720
 Even though they just got off of this huge military helicopter AND start barking orders

565
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,760
 at everybody, telling everyone to get out of here.

566
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,840
 And if that was almost the scariest thing you could see, running into a KGB officer was

567
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:45,880
 bad, but if you ever entered a room and there were two KGB officers in KGB uniforms and

568
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:52,120
 also in that room was just a normal looking dude in sweater and slacks, you were done.

569
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,600
 You were absolutely done.

570
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,800
 If you ever ran into a KGB agent and he was dressed like a civilian, that guy's so high

571
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,800
 ranking.

572
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,400
 It would be the worst possible nightmare.

573
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:08,000
 You'd rather be in a room with three dudes in full, like, police officer uniforms than

574
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,880
 just a dude walking over a room and sitting down next to you and going like, "Hi, my name

575
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,880
 is Tony.

576
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,440
 I'm a normal person just like you.

577
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,400
 You're going to get your hands chopped off at that point."

578
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:22,840
 So these "civilians" get off this military copter and start giving orders to everyone

579
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:27,120
 and obviously the police and military, everybody knew these dudes were right.

580
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,600
 So they just did what they said and everyone was ordered to go home.

581
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,320
 They told the police and military that was there, this entire area is cordoned off.

582
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,760
 Nobody gets back in here.

583
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:44,200
 And as they're sending people home, they're also stopping people and they're saying, "You,

584
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:50,160
 you, you, you, you, you, you, you go with these doctors who are also apparently getting

585
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:54,920
 off of this helicopter for an immediate medical examination."

586
00:32:54,920 --> 00:33:01,640
 And they were targeting people who were standing closest to the sarcophagus.

587
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:06,400
 So the entire area gets cleared out and it's just these people, these 12 dudes now who are

588
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,560
 left standing around the sarcophagus.

589
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:16,480
 So at this point in the story, the only witnesses that would be to this would be the police

590
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:22,080
 or the military who was standing there doing the barricade, right, doing the cordon.

591
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:28,880
 But apparently what happened was these civilians, these 12 dudes wanted to take the sarcophagus.

592
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,120
 But they thought it's too heavy to move with all of this liquid in it.

593
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,680
 What if we pump the liquid out?

594
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,760
 We'll save the liquid, we'll pump it out and we'll put it in these containers.

595
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,440
 But then it'll probably be easier to move this thing and get it on the helicopter.

596
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,720
 So they begin pumping out this fluid.

597
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,280
 And as the level of the fluid is getting lower and lower and lower and lower, eventually

598
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:56,480
 it's almost all gone and the body begins to blacken.

599
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,640
 The young woman, her blush goes away, her skin darkens.

600
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,960
 It looks like she is decaying incredibly fast.

601
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,640
 So they start pumping the liquid back into the sarcophagus, it fills up and she once

602
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,000
 again regains her luster.

603
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,040
 She looks like she's not dead but sleeping.

604
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,600
 They go, "Fine, I'll take some extra work.

605
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,840
 You know, probably should have got some of those coal miners around."

606
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,320
 The ones who got it up here in the first place.

607
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:26,040
 They are able to finally move it onto the helicopter, the brick-colored helicopter.

608
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:31,000
 The 12 men get on it as well, along with any other personnel they brought with them.

609
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,920
 And the helicopter leaves the area.

610
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:41,720
 Shortly afterwards, the coal mine is given orders to close off the area that the sarcophagus

611
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,720
 was found in.

612
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,280
 They are no longer allowed to go down there for any sort of reason.

613
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,480
 Not coal mining, not looking for other coffins, nothing.

614
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,880
 You gotta seal it up.

615
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:54,600
 And by 1973, the mine was completely shut down.

616
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,680
 You can go to this area now, it's just dense forest.

617
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,920
 The place has been recovered by nature.

618
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:09,640
 1973 is also important because just four miles away from the mine is a place known as Lake

619
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,640
 Birchichol.

620
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,640
 Lake Birchichol.

621
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:22,000
 1973, around the same time that the mine is shut down, the area is flooded with military

622
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 and police.

623
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 They completely cordoned off the shore of the lake and a large-scale excavation operation

624
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 begins.

625
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,360
 You'd be getting reports from the locals.

626
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:39,400
 You started to have sightings of major work being done in this area, machinery and things

627
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,400
 like that.

628
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:48,600
 But also, you'd keep seeing the brick-colored helicopter flying in and out of the area.

629
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:53,600
 Eventually, the military blockade ends of the shoreline.

630
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,240
 They leave, right?

631
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,160
 The military leaves, the police leave, the cordon is done.

632
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:04,120
 And so, of course, the villagers are curious as to what was going on.

633
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:08,760
 They would only see the occasional thing or maybe hear the occasional whisper from a drunken

634
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,240
 visitor to their tent.

635
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:15,600
 From a drunken soldier or police officer coming into the town for a drink.

636
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:21,400
 Once the cordon ends, the villagers go out to the shoreline and they see what looks like

637
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,960
 hundreds of freshly dug graves.

638
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,120
 But then the graves were covered back up.

639
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:33,640
 Let me just see these dotting the shoreline.

640
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,600
 That is the story of this phenomenon.

641
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,600
 What I find fascinating about it is I left out, I mentioned in the show intro, but I

642
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,720
 kind of skipped over it here.

643
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:47,000
 I am going to address it five days after the initial find.

644
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,200
 Five days after this body was found.

645
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,080
 This happened in the town.

646
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:58,120
 This elderly man showed up to the village and said, "I'm a professor from a local college

647
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:01,480
 and I'm here to tell you about what was found."

648
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:07,760
 And he tells a tale that's so unbelievable that I believe is government disinformation.

649
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,720
 There's a chance the whole story is made up, right?

650
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:15,360
 There's a lot of people who think that this story is based either on the story of Snow

651
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,680
 White and the Seven Dwarves, because you know the sleeping woman, but wasn't that sleeping

652
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,680
 beauty?

653
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,520
 There's a Russian version called Snow White and the Seven Warriors.

654
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:29,240
 There's also a chance that there was a YouTube video that was released in 2014, and some

655
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,960
 people say this story didn't exist until before that YouTube video.

656
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,960
 I couldn't verify that.

657
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,120
 The YouTube video doesn't exist anymore.

658
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,480
 Like the channel's been completely deleted, so that sucks.

659
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,640
 That would have been interesting.

660
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:46,240
 But what you have, a lot of times when you see the story, is this is the information

661
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,240
 you get.

662
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:51,440
 The professor, the singular guy walks into town and he goes, "I'm a professor from a

663
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:57,120
 nearby college and we've been doing studies on this body and I'm here to tell you what

664
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,120
 we found."

665
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,480
 Because the people in town were really upset by what happened.

666
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,960
 They're like, "Dude, we found this thing and then it disappeared and then no one told

667
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,960
 us anything.

668
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,320
 A bunch of our relatives were forced to do these military examinations.

669
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,280
 One dude, one guy went crazy from looking stuff.

670
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,560
 What is going on?"

671
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,840
 So the military didn't address it.

672
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,600
 The government didn't address it.

673
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:20,600
 Just this random elderly man shows up and says, "Okay, here's what it is.

674
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,880
 We've done studies on the body and on the casket and everything."

675
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:31,040
 And this woman is 800 million years old.

676
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,920
 Like the way it was embedded on the side of the mine.

677
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:40,040
 The only way it could have been there is if it had been there for 800 million years.

678
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,480
 We also have run DNA tests on her.

679
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,360
 She's 100% human.

680
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,360
 This isn't alien.

681
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,760
 This isn't any sort of thing like that.

682
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:53,920
 And her dress, her see-through dress that I personally examined myself because I'm a

683
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,280
 randy old man.

684
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:02,880
 The see-through dress is made of a material and from a technique that is unknown to man.

685
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,640
 There is no way we could replicate this dress.

686
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:10,000
 Victoria's secrets themselves could not manufacture this.

687
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,720
 We don't know where the metal box is as well.

688
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,200
 The one by her head.

689
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,840
 We're still examining that.

690
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:18,440
 And the liquid is also an unknown composition.

691
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,800
 We have no idea what it is.

692
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,040
 So basically, I'll get back to the bullet points.

693
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,520
 She's 800 million years old.

694
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,120
 That's the most important thing, right?

695
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,520
 And what's interesting is that I don't believe that at all.

696
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,880
 I actually really like this story.

697
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:39,600
 I just found it the other day, but I don't believe the 800 million year old hypothesis.

698
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,240
 I think that's government disinformation.

699
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,240
 I don't know.

700
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,440
 I have no alternative theory.

701
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,960
 I don't know who she is.

702
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,240
 Again, assuming the story is true.

703
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,240
 Let's just put on a conspiracy.

704
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,240
 Caves and Sumas True.

705
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,640
 I don't know who she is or where she came from.

706
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,840
 I don't really buy the 800 million year old theory.

707
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,480
 I just don't.

708
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,480
 It just doesn't wash.

709
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,640
 Like, who is this dude?

710
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,640
 How does he know?

711
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,720
 They found all this stuff out in five days and five days there.

712
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:09,720
 We can barely run DNA tests that we get the answers in five days today.

713
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,160
 Five days later after all this happened.

714
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,160
 He just rolls into town.

715
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,160
 Ah, whatever dude.

716
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,360
 I think it's government disinformation.

717
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,480
 And one thing that's interesting about that, the government disinformation thing is one,

718
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,640
 it would make future tellings of the story be completely ridiculous to the scientific

719
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,640
 community.

720
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,640
 They were like, what?

721
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,160
 There were no humans 800 million years ago.

722
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,840
 The other thing is that it also plays into this idea of Russian supremacy.

723
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:33,280
 I've seen versions of the story that they said delay.

724
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,200
 Russians have been around for 800 million years.

725
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,440
 Like, you guys were still walking around in caves, bro.

726
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,520
 The Russians were building this stuff 800 million years ago.

727
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,840
 I've also seen that thread.

728
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:48,480
 Like this is proof that Russians are the most superior race on the planet because they had

729
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,000
 beautiful women 800 million years ago while everyone else in the world had just a bunch

730
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,040
 of, but just a bunch of hairy people running around caves, beating each other with clubs

731
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,760
 and sliding down the necks of Brontosaurus.

732
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,920
 So I mean, that's just ridiculous in and of itself.

733
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,640
 The 800 million year theory, I don't get, I don't believe that either.

734
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,920
 I think that's 100% government coverup.

735
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:14,080
 I would say, I mean, ConspiracyCat fully on, if they found this, I don't have another answer

736
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,080
 for it.

737
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:18,680
 I just find it completely fascinating.

738
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,640
 When I first read this, you want to know my first inclination, because I had to read

739
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,080
 a couple different versions of the story.

740
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:30,000
 My first guess of this, vampire.

741
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
 She was a vampire.

742
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,840
 You're like, Jason, that's way dumber than theirs.

743
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,840
 That's way dumber.

744
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,040
 No, she's a vampire, bro.

745
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:45,680
 And that's why the cave, the sarcophagi, the sealant melted in the sun.

746
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,480
 And that goo was protecting her from the sun as well.

747
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,680
 This thing was never meant to be put back outside.

748
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,000
 And when they pumped it out, she was turning black and all gross and stuff like that, but

749
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,840
 she was actually, that was her vampire form burning in the sun.

750
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,840
 I don't know.

751
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,560
 Like I said, I don't really have a theory.

752
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,160
 You're like, Jason, now I really do think Russians are the superior race.

753
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:15,120
 If I have to choose between vampires are real or that Russians are 800 million years old,

754
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,800
 you really put me in a hard spot.

755
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,400
 A fascinating story.

756
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,360
 And again, the local, like all the articles you read about this, even the ones that say

757
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:28,920
 it's not true, they're like, the locals 100% believe this story happened.

758
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,800
 And this area, they believe that this is a real story.

759
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,920
 I just find it so interesting that if I was later, this guy showed up and spouted gibberish

760
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,880
 and people are like, yeah, that sounds legit because they were so thirsty for answers.

761
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,880
 Right.

762
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,880
 They really wanted to know what that was.

763
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,680
 So when someone came, not only answered their questions, but also said, and Russians have

764
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,000
 been around for 800 million years, like that's a boost to your national national pride.

765
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,720
 And it gives you answers, even if the answers are dumb.

766
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,880
 It's fascinating story.

767
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,240
 I absolutely love it.

768
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,800
 Urban legend.

769
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,080
 Real life.

770
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:04,560
 Real thing that happened, but government disinformation.

771
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,800
 Or it's the whole thing.

772
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,800
 Right.

773
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,320
 Is she really 800 million years old?

774
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,880
 The Soviet government hated paranormal stuff.

775
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,600
 They really like, if you saw UFO and you told the authorities, you did disappear.

776
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,160
 No, no, well or chair needed.

777
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,120
 They hated this stuff, but I'm sure they were hoarding it.

778
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:25,880
 The information just as much as the states were just as much as the American government

779
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:26,880
 were.

780
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,880
 Fascinating story.

781
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,880
 It's true.

782
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,440
 Where is this casket now?

783
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:39,240
 Have they tried pumping the juice out once more this time in a darkened room?

784
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:45,720
 They saw the true vampiric form arise from the grave.

785
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:54,800
 Or is it just stored somewhere in some Soviet or now Russian archive, a box among thousands

786
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:02,000
 of other artifacts, paranormal and mundane, just collecting dust in some warehouse?

787
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 Who knows?

788
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:12,400
 But if there's ever a spooky fog filled night somewhere in Russia, maybe zip your jacket

789
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,560
 up a little bit more.

790
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:18,680
 Quit showing off those fancy collar bones you like to flaunt around town because you

791
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,640
 never know.

792
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:47,960
 The vampire of Russia may be loose once again looking for you.

793
00:44:47,960 --> 00:45:04,000
 I'm not sure.

794
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,580
