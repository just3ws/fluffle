1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 When a young man gets stood up on a date, he hops on his motorcycle and sadly heads back home.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Little does he know he's not going to reach home, he's going to become a soldier on an intergalactic battlefield.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 And then we take a look at a true story, we take a look at a story that actually happened and isn't made up by some lunatic.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 It's the story of a young man fighting in a very real war, the war in Afghanistan.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 A young man and his squad is on patrol in Afghanistan when they fall prey to a Taliban ambush.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 When the bullets start firing and the explosives start going off, an unknown ally will show up.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 An ally that may lie inside all of us. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day, I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 I hope you guys had a fun weekend, we got a lot of stuff to cover today.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 So let's go ahead and invite in today's show supporter walking into Dead Rabbit Command,

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 doing a little march like a little nutcracker soldier.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 It's Saint James.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Woo yeah, come on in dude, Saint James is walking around.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 You're not going to have to stop walking like a nutcracker.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Saint James, he was one of our live stream contributors for our Christmas episode last year

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 and he asked specifically, can I be in a military themed episode?

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 And here we go.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 I hope you guys brought your flak jackets and your little helmets.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 And I hope you guys are fully armed and ready for war.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command, we're jumping right in.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Do we have a tank?

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 We're jumping right inside the...

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Whatever, what's jumping inside the chase in Jalopy?

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 There's no armor on it or whatever, you're like, ah, it's super scary.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Saint James, take us out of Dead Rabbit Command, there's bullets coming from every direction.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command, we're headed all the way out to England.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 (imitates gunfire)

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 I figured for Memorial Day, people always want themed episodes.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 I don't know why you ask so much of me.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 I don't know why you guys asked me to do a particular content on a given day.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 And usually I forget, usually it's like Santa Claus has already given me my gifts

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 and I was like, oh, I supposed to do a Christmas episode.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 But Memorial Day, I remembered ten minutes ago.

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 So I quickly found some stories that I had floating around in my to-do folder.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 These are really good ones, these aren't like leftovers or anything like that.

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 I really wanted to do these, but we get them to do them.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 On Memorial Day, that makes them extra awesome.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 And the first veteran we're going to meet is a man who was introduced to me

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 by one of our regular contributors to Dead Rabbit Radio,

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 a long time listener of the show, Alexandra Watts.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 She recently sent me the saga of a man, no, a hero, known as Russ Kellett.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Nowadays, he's 58 years old and he's living in the town of Philly in North Yorks.

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 But he wasn't always 58 years old.

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Did you know that? Did you know people's age changes every year?

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 This is the saga of Russ Kellett.

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Thirty years ago, he's 28 years old and he's at a bar or a public house.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 He said he was at a public house.

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 I'm assuming that's like a British term for a bar or maybe he was at a house that everyone lived in.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 I don't know. Didn't research that. What, didn't sound spooky?

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 So I didn't bother researching that.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 He's at a public house and he's supposed to meet somebody and they stand him up.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 They never show up.

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 So he's sitting there either drinking a drink at a pub or at a pub,

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 or he's lounging at someone's house and they're like, "This isn't one of the public houses, dude.

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 This is a private house and they're chasing him off with a broom."

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Either way, Russ Kellett is sad.

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 He's sad this person he was supposed to meet to either do breaking and interings or have a drink with didn't show up.

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 So he gets on his motorcycle, revs it all, saddling stuff.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 He's driving his motorcycle home, tear drop streaming down his face.

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 He has his motorcycle helmet on so no one can see how sad he is.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 And also to protect his brain from serious injury,

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 when he sees a tunnel up ahead and he's like, "Blimey, mate. I've never seen such a tunnel before.

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 In fact, there should be no tunnel on this road."

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 But he goes through it anyways because if you're ever driving home and you find a mysterious portal,

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 just go through it.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 He goes through the tunnel and instead of the other side being more of England,

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 so he could drive home, he drives into a room he can only describe as like a dentist's office.

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 So, "Ahhhhh."

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 He comes to a stop on his motorcycle.

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 He's like, "Whoa."

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 And there's like a chair there and there's a bunch of like medical tools and stuff like that.

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 And he's like, "Oh man, that's not supposed to be through the tunnel."

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 And then he sees what- I'm gonna put my cards on the table right now if you guys haven't been able to tell.

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 I think he's making all of this up.

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 This guy has been in the game for 30 years.

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Russ Kellett, if you're listening to this and you're excited to hear your story, you're like,

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 "Oh, it's gonna be awesome."

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 I think he's making all of it up.

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 I think he's totally making all of it up.

81
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 And I'll go through why, but here's a good starting point because

82
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 probably shut off the podcast if I said this sincerely.

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Jason, this guy's clearly making it up and you're falling for it.

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 He drives his motorcycle into a dentist's office and then sees what he describes as, quote,

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 "15 foot tall alien men that look very much like Dracula."

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 And you go, "Jason, maybe aliens are..."

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 That wouldn't make sense, right?

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 There's stories of aliens sucking loose shot of people or aliens being some sort of parasitic bean.

89
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Maybe aliens do look like Dracula.

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Let me ask you this.

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 If I told you I walked into a room, forget the 15 foot tall.

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 If I told you I walked into a room and there was someone who looked like Dracula,

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 what do you imagine?

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Like, what's the first thing you would think of when you would think of Dracula?

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Or just a vampire in general, right?

96
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 He...let me finish this quote now.

97
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 It's in your head.

98
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 He drives into this dentist's office and he's surrounded by 15 foot tall alien men

99
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 that look very much like Dracula without the sharp teeth.

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 What?

101
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 That's the number one thing I associate with Dracula.

102
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 That'd be like saying, "Oh, he's running through the woods and I got abducted by this guy

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 who looked just like Bigfoot but he wasn't big, he wasn't hairy at normal size feet

104
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 and he was wearing an outfit of a park ranger."

105
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 But it was Bigfoot!

106
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 I don't...did he pull...I'm imagining then was it aliens wearing like really bad Dracula costumes

107
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 from like Party City with like the plastic medallion and the red cape.

108
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 But even then as I'm describing it, I'm still thinking of their fake teeth.

109
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 They don't have sharp teeth.

110
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 It's just 15 foot tall guys in there, I guess they're wearing capes with little medallions?

111
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Anyways, so they grab him and they pump a liquid, a thick liquid down his throat

112
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 and he's like, "No, no, uh, uh, uh, uh."

113
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 And then he's a super soldier.

114
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 This is truly a Memorial Day episode.

115
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 What would a Memorial Day episode be without a super soldier story?

116
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 These 15 foot tall Dracula rejects with no teeth, give him this liquid and he becomes a super soldier

117
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 and then they're like, they don't give him any instructions.

118
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Well, as far as he "remembers," he conveniently keeps forgetting stuff.

119
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 People are always...this guy's a master of publicity.

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Whenever he says something, there's like 10 different articles about this

121
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 because when I tried looking more into this guy, I had to put like Google filters

122
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 to only search specific time ranges.

123
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 If you type in "Ruskelet Aliens," you'll get 10 articles that were just published like two weeks ago.

124
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 So I had to like, I had to go and really figure out who this guy was.

125
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 I was sure that this guy was really a super soldier.

126
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Imagine my disappointment that this story turned out to most likely be not true.

127
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 He says they pumped me full of liquid and the next thing I know, I was in like this hangar area

128
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 and there was like these spaceships there and we're like walking onto the spaceship

129
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 and I turn around and I'm like, where am I? Where am I?

130
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 That's what you do, right? When you're being forced onto a spaceship,

131
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 the first thing you want to do is see what's behind you.

132
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 There's a spaceship in front of you.

133
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 He's walking up the spaceship. He's like, "God's name."

134
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 He turns around and standing behind him, or depending on the story,

135
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 he's told multiple versions of the story. I guess sometimes he's behind him.

136
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 Sometimes he sees this guy from like the next ship over or whatever.

137
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 He's looking through a porthole and he sees the other ship play by.

138
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 He turns around and he sees Robbie Williams standing there.

139
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Not Robin Williams, which would have been far more entertaining.

140
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 Robbie Williams. He is a British.

141
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 He's basically like the 90s equivalent of Harry Styles.

142
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 He was like in a British boy band called Take That or Take Two or something like that.

143
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 And then he became his own dude.

144
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 He broke off from the mold. They were all conjoined quintriplets.

145
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 He sawed his way away from them one night and became Robbie Williams.

146
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 And he had a couple hits in America. I think he's still a real big deal in Britain.

147
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 And he goes, "I know you. You're that boy bander guy."

148
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 And the aliens are like, "Eyes ahead, eyes ahead."

149
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 And he's like, "Okay, I'll look ahead at this massive starship that I've never seen before."

150
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 I've seen Robbie Williams before. I've seen him on the telly.

151
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 I've never seen his spaceship before, but for some reason I find this dude way more interesting.

152
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 And then he spent the next 30 years on and off fighting an intergalactic war versus the dragoes.

153
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 These are reptilian creatures.

154
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Now, I know what you're asking. Why would a 15-foot-tall alien race need to get a bunch of 5'8'' people to fight giant lizards?

155
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 He doesn't answer that question either.

156
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 But he goes and he fights these wars.

157
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Now, these wars aren't just in other star systems, although he does say that.

158
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 And if you ask him, "Whoa, where did you fight?"

159
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 And he goes, "I don't remember that. He has no details about anything that you'd really want to know."

160
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 But he does remember, apparently, he fought in Europe and the UK and South America.

161
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 "Boring. I mean, real people do that. Real people fight there. Tell us about the space wars."

162
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 He doesn't remember those, though.

163
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 He says that time is different when you're in a spaceship, which is probably true, right?

164
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 Einstein's theory of relativity.

165
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 If you're ever abducted by 15-foot-tall Dracula knockoffs, time will be different.

166
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 That was Einstein's theory.

167
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 He said that when you're fighting these dragos, when you're in space or whatever,

168
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 four hours on Earth is four years up there.

169
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Okay, I'll actually accept that as possible.

170
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 We've talked about lost time and how that works and just the way time works in general is weird.

171
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Fine. I'll accept that.

172
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 He then, though, uses...

173
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 He actually says that he does this.

174
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 He's at work. He does have a day job.

175
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 I don't know why he would hire this guy. His resume must be hilarious.

176
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 He has representatives like 15-foot-tall alien.

177
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 Like, can I call him? He's like, "I don't remember the guy's number."

178
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 But he exists.

179
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 He says that, I guess, a lot of times his boss and coworkers would be like,

180
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 "Hey, Russ, why are you so tired all the time? How come you're always just like, uh,

181
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 falling asleep on the machinery and stuff like that?"

182
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 And he'd be like, "Well, this might sound unbelievable."

183
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Because it is, because I've clearly made this up.

184
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 But in space, four years go by, but on Earth only four hours go by,

185
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 so that's why I'm tired all the time, because I'm constantly fighting space wars.

186
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Which begs the question that we do.

187
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 There's obviously a bunch of questions about this.

188
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Why would you even bother having an Earth job?

189
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 How come they're not paying him space money?

190
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 Anyways, his whole thing is that's why I'm tired at work all the time,

191
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 because I spent the last four years fighting.

192
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 It's only been four hours to you, but, well, first off,

193
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 this dude would look like he was the oldest man alive.

194
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 Secondly, I would say I'm sure, okay, let me assume that I'm an idiot.

195
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 I believe your story.

196
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Are you telling me in those four years you never slept, either?

197
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Like, you would get a good night's sleep over the course of four years.

198
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Right? You get to sleep. You get to rest.

199
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 It's not like he's awake for four years, I'm assuming.

200
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 That's not an excuse I would take as your boss.

201
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 I'm just saying rest, if you ever try to get a job with me,

202
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 I will not accept that as an excuse, that you were fighting a space war.

203
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 He has...he's actually written two books that I could find.

204
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 One is a classic, a UFO classic, called "Russell Kellett Is E.T. Rider."

205
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 And it's the story I just told you.

206
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 They simply just saved you 20 bucks.

207
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 He gets on a motorcycle, he drives, he starts fighting a space war.

208
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 I was looking through the table of contents, and it did seem like it was a pretty intense book.

209
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 I might...I reluctantly put it on my Amazon wish list,

210
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 because of these...the story...that story itself is pretty super soldier by the book, nonsense.

211
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 But I am curious about these particular chapters.

212
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 And I have to be honest, there's a couple of people who might be scratching their head right now

213
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 and say, "I think we've heard this guy before."

214
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 I have a vague inkling that I've covered this guy before.

215
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 We might have mentioned him in passing, because he wrote this book in these chapters.

216
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 These chapter titles definitely sound familiar.

217
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 One of them is "The Monster in the Cemetery."

218
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 That's not alien, right? I'd like to hear about...watch this.

219
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Some stupid alien monster in cemetery.

220
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 "The Three Nuns" is the name of a chapter.

221
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 That sounds interesting, right?

222
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 And then...let me...let me back up.

223
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 More interesting than this.

224
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 I want to see what happens with the three nuns.

225
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 Are they alien nuns? Are they sexy nuns? Are they nun ghosts? Who knows?

226
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Maybe the three nuns are the people who stood them up at the bar.

227
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 He's still writing about that in this book, "An Intergalactic Conquest."

228
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 He's like, "Why didn't they go? Why didn't they show up?"

229
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 And then the ninja.

230
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 Like, that does sound evocative, right?

231
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 A super soldier fighting a ninja.

232
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Now, it would only be a cool chapter if it was a real super soldier,

233
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 which we know Russell...Russell Kellett isn't.

234
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Versus a real ninja.

235
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 I'd also be willing, though, to watch someone who thought they were a super soldier,

236
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 versus a real ninja. I'm either/or on that.

237
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 Real super soldier, versus real ninja, or fake super soldier, versus real ninja.

238
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 I'm totally down.

239
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 You guys are thinking, Jason, how can you be saying that this stuff's fake?

240
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 You're constantly just pulling weird stuff off the internet.

241
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 And you're right, right?

242
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Like, I pulled something off the internet and someone said they saw a phantom hand

243
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 peeking around the corner and you don't go as hard on that.

244
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 That's true. That's true.

245
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 And I gotta give Ruskellet...

246
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 He does have a little bit of proof.

247
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 He does have a little bit of proof.

248
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Because if you read The Daily Star, which I highly suggest you don't,

249
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 it's a tabloid, it's entertaining, but nothing is ever true in there.

250
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 And considering this is the first place I saw Ruskellet, that should say something,

251
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 they do show that Ruskellet has proof.

252
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 This is actually a quote from The Daily Star article.

253
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 'Cause you want proof, right? I want proof.

254
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Here's a quote from The Daily Star.

255
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 'The author' meaning Ruskellet, 'the author has produced drawings to support his claims.'

256
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 Unquote.

257
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 It just sketches, right?

258
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 If that was the way we did things, everyone would...

259
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 The first class you would take in school would be art.

260
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 And people would just be drawn pictures of themselves as presidents

261
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 and they would just be going, like, walking away as well,

262
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 giving them, like, 'Sir, sir, you can't come in here.

263
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 You hold up a drawing of yourself, a little stick figure in the White House.'

264
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 And they're like, 'Sorry, sir, we did not know. We did not know you, the president.'

265
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 And there's another reason why I wanted to highlight this guy.

266
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 And Alexander, I had a lot of fun reading about this guy.

267
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Thanks for sending this over.

268
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 It made me make a connection.

269
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 I think we'll touch on this in a future episode as well,

270
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 but I'd like to throw my theory out to you.

271
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 It's not even a theory, it's a question.

272
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Why is the conspiracy theory community obsessed with celebrities?

273
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 It's...we...it's super bizarre.

274
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 The conspiracy theory community...

275
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 I watched and read more about the masonic meaning behind Will Smith's "Smap of Chris Rock"

276
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 than I was of legit conspiracy content over the past, like, month.

277
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 Month or two.

278
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Conspiracy theorists love celebrities.

279
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 They are obsessed with them.

280
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 And I don't know what it is.

281
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 I don't know.

282
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 There's whole websites like Vigilant Citizen that is based on,

283
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 'Look at this photo of the...'

284
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 I'm gonna write a thousand words about this photo of someone covering up their eyeball in a photo.

285
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 It's weird.

286
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 And Russ Kellett is a huge reminder of that.

287
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 During COVID lockdowns, he got on the media.

288
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 He's really good at getting his name out in the newspaper.

289
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 He sent out a bunch of press releases.

290
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 I think 'cause he's such a goofball.

291
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 And he probably does interviews all the time,

292
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 and they're so wacky, like, ten other newspapers pick it up.

293
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 He was trying to get celebrities to visit him so they could look at UFOs.

294
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 And every time a celebrity, like, in the news would be like,

295
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 "Oh, you know, when I was a kid, I saw a light in the sky.

296
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Couldn't explain it."

297
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 'Cause, you know, a lot of times celebrities do an interview,

298
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 and they answer the same hundred questions all the time in a good interviewer.

299
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 We'll toss an oddball question at everyone some while.

300
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 You ask Ariana Grande, "Do you believe in ghosts?"

301
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 She'll tell you some insane story.

302
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 We did an episode on that. I'll put it in the show notes.

303
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 So a good interviewer will look for those weird questions, right?

304
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 And so every so often, some British actor, actress, or singer, whatever,

305
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 be like, "Oh, yeah, I do kind of believe in aliens."

306
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 When I was a kid, once this alien walked through my bedroom

307
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 and pumped me full of his liquid, and I was a super soldier.

308
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 And I was standing in line, and I saw this guy in front of me,

309
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 and I swear it was Russ Kellett.

310
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Whenever someone in the media would say, or a famous person,

311
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 not one of us normals, right?

312
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 A famous person would say they saw an alien, he would contact them.

313
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Well, he would try, let me phrase that, he would try to contact them.

314
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 All of his intergalactic powers don't help him to get past bodyguards.

315
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 He would try to contact them and invite them.

316
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 And during the COVID lockdowns, you know, when everyone was afraid,

317
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 because they didn't want to run anyone else, he said,

318
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 "Come and hang out with me, this total stranger."

319
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 "We can hang out for a couple of nights and make contact."

320
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Not between you and me, but hey, if love, if sparks start flying, sparks start flying.

321
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 What I find so just so disingenuous about that, right?

322
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 There are other people of your, in your interest group,

323
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 and they want to hang out with you, Russ,

324
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 but you don't want to hang out with them because they're not famous.

325
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 It's so, he specifically was only inviting celebrities to hang out with him.

326
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 That type of stuff, it's lame.

327
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 I don't get that. I don't understand that.

328
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 I don't understand it because there's a lot.

329
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 Imagine that if I said only celebrities could listen to this podcast.

330
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 It'd be like, what? It'd be insane.

331
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 And then imagine if I said, "Oh, you want to do a meetup? You want to meet me in real life?

332
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 How famous are you?" Just invite them out.

333
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 There's a bunch of people who share your passion, Russ.

334
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 You might run into some old veterans of the Super Soldier War.

335
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Conspiracy theorists, and this guy would classify that.

336
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 He's more of the paranormal conspiracy theorist,

337
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 but they're obsessed with celebrity.

338
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 And I don't know if it's because they're obsessed with fame themselves.

339
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 I've always had a theory that a lot of hardcore conspiracy theorists are failed artists themselves.

340
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 I know when I was really trying to make it as a writer,

341
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 when I was writing screenplays and books and stuff like that,

342
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 that was the height of me 100% believing in conspiracy theories.

343
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 And I remember a long time ago, I was listening to Mark Marin, his WTF podcast,

344
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 and he is, I've talked about this several times on the show,

345
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 but one more time, he's one of the biggest podcasters, if not the second biggest.

346
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 You know, Joe Rogan would be the first.

347
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 But his career, he was gotten to drugs and alcohol.

348
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 He was a sanded comedian through the 80s.

349
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 His career never took off before his podcast.

350
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 And I remember on one episode of his podcast, he goes,

351
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 "At my lowest point, when my career wasn't going anywhere,

352
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 I started to think, is the Illuminati real?

353
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 Is this a real group? Like, why aren't I making it?

354
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 I have the talent, I have even some of the connections.

355
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 How come I can't get my break?"

356
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 And I wonder if there's a connection between trying to be an artist

357
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 and failing and going, well, it's surely not me.

358
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 It must be this group that controls the world.

359
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 I wonder if that's part of it.

360
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 I wonder if it's an obsession with being famous yourself.

361
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 And so you want to latch on to other people.

362
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 I find it fascinating.

363
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 And conspiracy theory, there was so much about that Will Smith slap.

364
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 I was on break when that happened.

365
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 That's why you didn't get bombarded with that stuff.

366
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 But yeah, obsessed with fame.

367
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 And that's where I put Russ Kellogg.

368
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 So I love this story.

369
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 I was able to talk about my own weird conspiracy theory.

370
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 That conspiracy theorist are more obsessed with fame than your aunt,

371
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 who buys National Enquirer magazine every single day.

372
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 They're more obsessed with that.

373
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 We got Super Soldier in here for Memorial Day.

374
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 We got a soldier, a real-life soldier.

375
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 I love this story.

376
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 So Alexandra, thanks for sending it over.

377
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 I don't think any of it's true, but it was definitely fascinating

378
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 to talk about it.

379
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 Nonetheless, it's a perfect mirror for this story that we're going to talk about now.

380
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 It's funny because this story also only has one source.

381
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 It was posted anonymously online.

382
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 So why do I believe this story more than Russ Kellogg's story?

383
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 It's funny.

384
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 Sometimes I read a lot about Russ Kellogg,

385
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 and the more I read, the more unbelievable his story became.

386
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 If Russ Kellogg's story was boiled down to maybe 500 words,

387
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 and I found it by an anonymous poster,

388
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 I probably still wanted to believe it because I don't really believe in the Super Soldier phenomenon,

389
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 as is, as it's presented to us,

390
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 but it probably would have carried a little more weight.

391
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 Right? Maybe.

392
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Maybe.

393
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 I don't think I would have full-on believed it.

394
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 This next story, though, sometimes less is more.

395
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 But St. James...

396
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 St. James, I want to be in a military episode, not with that buffoon.

397
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 St. James, go ahead and let's call down that carpenter copter.

398
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 We're going into a real war zone.

399
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Calling that carpenter copter.

400
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 We're leaving behind England.

401
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 We're headed all the way out to Afghanistan.

402
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 [imitates gunfire]

403
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 The year is 2010,

404
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 and war in Afghanistan were with a group of soldiers, U.S. soldiers,

405
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 currently deployed in the Horn.

406
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 That's what they call it.

407
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 I looked it up. It's the Horn of Panjwai in Afghanistan.

408
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 This is the birthplace of the Taliban.

409
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 This was a place of some of the most brutal fighting,

410
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 the most brutal continuous fighting from the beginning of the war,

411
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 all the way up until July 10th, 2021,

412
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 when the Taliban totally took control of the region.

413
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 But in 2010, the fight was still on,

414
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 and no one knew which way the war was going to go.

415
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 And we're here to join a soldier.

416
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 This young man didn't give his name.

417
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 We're going to name him Peter.

418
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 And Peter was six months into his first tour of duty,

419
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 and they're on dismounted patrol.

420
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 So they're just kind of walking through this area.

421
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 They have vehicles like riding X-Tomb.

422
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 I think it's a way so it doesn't look...

423
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 It doesn't look like a bunch of mechanized vehicles

424
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 who are just kind of riding roughshod through villages.

425
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 They get out of their vehicles.

426
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 They kind of walk around to give a human face to the occupation.

427
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 They want to try to win the hearts and minds.

428
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 And while they're doing that,

429
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 I mean, you match that's super dangerous, right?

430
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 As I understand the meaning behind it.

431
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Super dangerous.

432
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 You're exposed, and you're walking with your guns, right?

433
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 They're not wearing khaki shorts.

434
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 They don't have all their body armor off,

435
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 but they're walking.

436
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 They're fully armed.

437
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 But just to give a little bit of a human presence to what's going on.

438
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 They're walking alongside their vehicles,

439
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 walking through this town,

440
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 and then all of a sudden,

441
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 right over Peter's head, he sees...

442
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 I'm assuming he heard it first.

443
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 I don't think he has eagle-eye vision,

444
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 but all of a sudden over his head,

445
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 an RPG flies past.

446
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 Sheeeeeeeeeep!

447
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Go! No!

448
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Something blew up!

449
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 Something blew up, Peter says,

450
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 and his commanding officer is like,

451
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 "Go that way!

452
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Go away from the explosions and stuff!"

453
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 So Peter's like running,

454
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 and all of a sudden they're just under attack, right?

455
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 The Taliban launch this RPG,

456
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 they're shooting at him with rifles,

457
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 and Peter's like,

458
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 "Good, 10-6, 10-6!

459
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 I got people shooting at me!"

460
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 And he's like talking to them on his radio and stuff.

461
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 And all these other guys are doing the same thing.

462
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 It's super chaotic.

463
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 Everyone's talking to the radio at the same time.

464
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 The commander's like,

465
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 "Uh, one at a time, guys!"

466
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 Peter takes a position,

467
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 takes a firing position.

468
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 He has a saw.

469
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 He has that big machine gun

470
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 that you often see in movies,

471
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 and/or in your job if you're in the military.

472
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 And he gets behind his saw,

473
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 machine gun,

474
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 and starts going,

475
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 (imitates gun shooting)

476
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 Not just making the sound effect,

477
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 he was shooting bullets out of it,

478
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 and the Taliban's like,

479
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 "Ah, ah!"

480
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 And they're like running and stuff.

481
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 But this isn't the end of the battle.

482
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 I mean, people are just shooting at each other,

483
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 people are running,

484
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 everyone's talking at once.

485
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 It's total chaos.

486
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 And then all of a sudden,

487
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 Peter is blinded.

488
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 He says that this bright flash of light

489
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 washes over him.

490
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 And not only is he instantly blinded,

491
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 he's deaf as well.

492
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 He's laying on his back.

493
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 He can't see.

494
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 He can't hear.

495
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Now, if that happened to you,

496
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 like just walking to the store today,

497
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 you'd be pretty alarmed, right?

498
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 If you're walking into Walmart,

499
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 and the next thing you know,

500
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 you're on your back,

501
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 and you can't see or hear anything,

502
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 you'd be alarmed.

503
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 And you would think,

504
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 "Oh, no, something must have happened,

505
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 like maybe something medical,

506
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 or maybe I was blinded

507
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 by the great deals at Walmart."

508
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 But in a war zone,

509
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 Walmart, the worst thing that's going to happen to you

510
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 is maybe someone will hit you

511
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 with their shopping cart

512
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 as you're on the ground.

513
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 In a war zone,

514
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 you're pretty much toast.

515
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 If all of a sudden you're blind and deaf

516
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 and on your back,

517
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 you're not going to make it.

518
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 And that's probably going through

519
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 this dude's head as well.

520
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 And what had happened was an RPG

521
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 exploded right in front of him.

522
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 A rocket-propelled grenade.

523
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 (sneezes)

524
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 Blew him back,

525
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 rendered him senseless,

526
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 and he's laying there,

527
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 and he's bleeding out.

528
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 And he said,

529
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 "It was so painful.

530
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 The sensation of what was going on

531
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 was so incredibly painful.

532
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 All I wanted to do was to fall asleep.

533
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 I figured if I fall asleep,

534
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 I won't be in pain anymore."

535
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 And all of a sudden,

536
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 as his vision is starting to return,

537
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 he sees a soldier running up to him.

538
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 "Peter! Peter, are you okay?

539
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 Come on. Come on.

540
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 I got you, buddy."

541
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 And he is like checking him.

542
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 He's like checking his wounds.

543
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 The soldier's like looking at all the wounds.

544
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 He's like, "I got you, buddy.

545
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 Get up. Come on. Get up."

546
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 And Peter gets picked up by this soldier.

547
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 And gunfire is still raging from all sides.

548
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 And he gets his--

549
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 Like you see in the Army movies.

550
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 And/or, again, you might do this in real life

551
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 if you're in the Army.

552
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 You do that Army carrier,

553
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 where the guy has his arm over your shoulder

554
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 and you're kind of dragging him

555
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 or carrying him as much as you can.

556
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 And he's like, "We've got to get you to the--

557
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 over here.

558
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 We've got to get you to this place

559
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 where they're not shooting.

560
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 I mean, that would be preferable, right?"

561
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 There's a medical vehicle.

562
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 It's called, like, a MRAP,

563
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 a mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicle.

564
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 They left the V off of the acronym.

565
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 They get under this,

566
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 and this is like a place to be safe.

567
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 This guy drags him to the ramp

568
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 and drops him and then rejoins the firefight.

569
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 The next thing that Peter remembers

570
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 is he wakes up in a field hospital.

571
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 He's like, "Oh, man, what in the world happened?"

572
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 He's like all bandaged up and stuff.

573
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 And the doctor is--

574
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 the doctor was just standing there the whole time.

575
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 That's his job to dramatically stand there.

576
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 So when you wake up, they can tell you everything that happened.

577
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 They go, "Well, Peter, you got shot at,

578
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 and then this RPG went off next to you

579
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 and you got a bunch of shrapnel in you

580
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 and you were bleeding out.

581
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 But we took all the shrapnel out."

582
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 Well, let me rephrase that.

583
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 We took most of the shrapnel out.

584
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 You might have trouble going through

585
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 metal detectors for a while.

586
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 But you're gonna be okay.

587
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 It's like, "Oh, yeah, thanks, Doc."

588
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 And then the command team comes in

589
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 and they're talking to him.

590
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 And they go, "Hey, it's so--

591
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 we won the battle, by the way.

592
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 If the Taliban aren't ready to overrun this hospital,

593
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 we won the battle."

594
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 But they go, "Yeah, it's really weird.

595
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 From what we understand, you were sitting there.

596
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 Like, there was a bunch of witnesses to this, right?

597
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 That RPG went off in front of you

598
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 and you fell on your back

599
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 and then you just stood up."

600
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 Like, everyone was shocked, right?

601
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 They thought you were toast.

602
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 You're covered in blood.

603
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 And you stood up and you held your arm out.

604
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 You just held your arm out in this weird position.

605
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 They kind of looked like a zombie

606
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 and you staggered back to the M-Rap.

607
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 And Peter goes, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

608
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 And then they said the actual quote, "I got you, buddy."

609
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 They're trying to make use of another room

610
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 or just kind of get everything kind of cleaned up.

611
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 And Peter's going through boxes of old photos.

612
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 And he's looking through these pictures

613
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 and he sees these old family photos

614
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 and he looks at one and he goes,

615
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 "That's the guy.

616
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 That's the guy who saved my life in Afghanistan."

617
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 He's looking at this old photo and he can't figure it out.

618
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 That is clearly the man who saved him in Afghanistan

619
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 and he talks to his grandpa, Mike, about it

620
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 and he goes, "Hey, who is this? Who's this photo of?"

621
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 And grandpa, Mike goes, "Oh, that's Donnie.

622
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 He was your great uncle."

623
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 I'm not answering any of my questions.

624
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 He's in this old photograph, but he saved me in Afghanistan.

625
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 He saved my life.

626
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 And grandpa, Mike, explained, he goes, "Donnie is dead."

627
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 Donnie has passed away. He passed away a long time ago.

628
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 But he passed away a war hero.

629
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 He was awarded the Bronze Star with Valor back in World War II.

630
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 So Peter has told the story that his great uncle Donnie

631
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 served in the 32nd Infantry Division in Papua New Guinea.

632
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 It's 1942 and him and his fellow soldiers are under heavy enemy fire

633
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 and one of Donnie's comrades gets shot.

634
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 And Donnie, while he's being shot at, grabs this man

635
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 and drags him out of harm's way.

636
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 Gets him situated where he is safe.

637
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 Donnie then stands up, takes a step to walk back towards the battlefield.

638
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 And the bullet slams into his chest, killing him.

639
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 July 27, 1942, he passed away.

640
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 And Peter, sitting there, looking at this picture,

641
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 he's heard this story and he couldn't help but truly believe

642
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 that his great uncle Donnie had fought in a war

643
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 long after he had already died to save a young man he never knew.

644
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 So in the last interesting story, we talk a lot about guardian angels on this show.

645
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 And this is fascinating to me.

646
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 I think this is actually beyond the guardian angel phenomenon.

647
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 To me, this is ancestral spirits.

648
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 This is like what so many religions and cultures can be based on

649
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 this idea that we are all connected. Your bloodline is so important

650
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 that it carries through generations, it carries past time.

651
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 Absolutely fascinating because we have that idea of it.

652
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 We have that idea of ancestral strength, that who you are is who you came from.

653
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 We have a guy who died saving someone's life and then in reality,

654
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 he saved someone else's life and both times it ends the same way.

655
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 He turns around and leaves.

656
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 Now the first time he turned around and left permanently, he was killed.

657
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 He was killed on the spot, but the second time, Peter never saw where this soldier went.

658
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 He did say that the soldier who saved him thought he thought it was weird

659
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 because he was wearing an older style helmet.

660
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 That was something he did observe when he was being helped by the soldier,

661
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 but you're not going to criticize his fashion choices.

662
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 Your life is being saved, but I thought that was interesting.

663
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 The circumstances was the same.

664
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 So was it...we talk a lot about ghosts and them being recordings of them reenacting events.

665
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 Was this so much a thing of Donnie being this ancestral guardian of Peter

666
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 coming to this time when Peter needed him the most?

667
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 Was it also simply a recording?

668
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 Because the event was the same.

669
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 It was played out the same, but it was spread across what, 60, 70 years?

670
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 So it's an interesting ghost story as well.

671
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 It's a guardian angel story with the ancestral spirit to it.

672
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 This one, the words "I got you buddy"

673
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 he could have said that in 1942 to this other young man

674
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 and hoisted him up and dragged him back and dropped him off

675
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 and then took a step and got shot.

676
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 And then in the future it plays out exactly the same.

677
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 "I got you buddy" he takes from the vehicle, he turns around and then no one saw him.

678
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 No one saw him at all except for Peter.

679
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 Fascinating is a ghost story, fascinating as a story of an ancestral lineage.

680
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 I also want to say this and we'll wrap it up like this.

681
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 I find it so fascinating that as a species maybe, definitely as governments,

682
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 we're constantly trying to find the newest weapons of war to fight with.

683
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 We're like, okay, planes were cool and all.

684
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 Let's make it jets.

685
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 There we go, jets are cool and all.

686
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 Let's make a drone.

687
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 Well, drones are cool and all, but what if drones flew themselves?

688
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 What if they didn't have a human controller that could hesitate?

689
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 We're always looking for the newest weapon.

690
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 Maybe we should go backwards.

691
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 Maybe we should go backwards.

692
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 Hear me out.

693
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 Hear me out.

694
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 What if instead of now, which people are like,

695
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 "I'm just going to shut up for five minutes about some ridiculous thing,"

696
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 that you're going to keep adjusting because you realize how dumb it is once you say it.

697
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 Hold on, before you hit the button, before you shut it up.

698
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 What if we're always trying to make the newest weapons?

699
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 What if we use the old techniques?

700
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 I'm not saying that we have to start running around with sticks and clubs,

701
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 but what if we got our soldiers and said,

702
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 "Saint James has already left.

703
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 He's like, I don't want to be here for this nonsense."

704
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 You get soldiers and you go, "Have any of you had anyone close to you die

705
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 in a really, really action-packed way?"

706
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 Soldiers are like, "What?"

707
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 And the arm is like, because what we're looking for is we're going to put together a secret team

708
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 of soldiers who have ancestors who died in battle.

709
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 And then, because see that way, let's think about it this way.

710
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 Right now, if you put in a bunch of US Army troopers versus a bunch of Russian dudes, right,

711
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 we're fighting over Alaska.

712
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 It would be us like shooting at each other, but if we have a special group of soldiers

713
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 who like maybe you happen to be related with Viking,

714
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 and he got his head chopped off when he was trying to beat up a British king.

715
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 So in the middle of your battle with the Russians, you like fall down,

716
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 and then all of a sudden a goat shows up of a Viking guy,

717
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 and he's like heads up and he throws his head at the Russian right before he shoots you.

718
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 The other examples anyone else know is anyone else have a relative who's died

719
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 in a horrific and/or action packed away? Anyone blow up?

720
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 Like that could be his special ability, right?

721
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 He like sneaks into the enemy's camp at night, and he's like,

722
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 "Uh, he doesn't have a one liner. He just explodes violently."

723
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 Everyone's like, "Ugh!" Even if he did have a one liner, we wouldn't know,

724
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 because he would just blow everyone up.

725
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 Yeah, what if instead of spending money to do science, to build vehicles that we know work,

726
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 what if we didn't do that? What if we didn't do that?

727
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 What if we just started like practicing like ancestral spirit magic on our soldiers

728
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 and have them call forth all of the dead people in their lives?

729
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 They're like, "Mom, no, not you! Mom's running in. Mom's running in."

730
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 She's throwing poisonous cookies at the enemy troops.

731
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 They're like, "Oh, their cookies are so delicious. I can't help but eat them."

732
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 You obviously would have to have some requirements, right?

733
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 You wouldn't want to have just regular old ghosts,

734
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 just like Casper Goats floating through walls.

735
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 They're like, "Dude, I'm a ghost. I can float through the wall.

736
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 I can tell you what the general's saying there. Like, "Oh, that's too boring."

737
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 Do you happen to have a guy who got stabbed to death,

738
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 and now he has like swords come out of his hands,

739
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 and he's like, "Heads up!"

740
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 And he just jumps the heads off people. I don't know.

741
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 The point is that I don't see why we don't do that.

742
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 We know that might work, right?

743
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 People have been calling on their ancestors to help them out through battle for ages.

744
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 Drones have only been around for like 50, 60 years.

745
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 So that is what I'm-- I will have to do this episode.

746
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 I will write a letter to Congress asking for $1 billion to study my theory.

747
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 But until then...

748
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,000
