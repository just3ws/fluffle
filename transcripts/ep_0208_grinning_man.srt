1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,300
 A sheriff's deputy goes for a jog, and his entire life changes.

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:12,260
 And then we take a look at the story of the grinning man.

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:17,540
 Tall, lanky, maniacal smile.

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,540
 He stares at you from the darkness.

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:27,180
 His insanity is his greatest weapon today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,180
 I'm a walkie-dove.

7
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:38,180
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,180
 I'm your host Jason Garmenter, and I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,180
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,180
 We're gonna go ahead and jump right into this because we got a lot of stuff to cover.

11
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:50,180
 So let's go ahead and put on our jumping pants and wee down the...

12
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,180
 I don't wanna say down the rabbit hole, but that always sounds so stupid.

13
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,180
 Just a hole. Wee, we're going down the hole.

14
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,180
 We're gonna fall all the way down this hole.

15
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,180
 We have to find new modes of transportation since the Carvener copter got blown up.

16
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:07,180
 But we fall all the way down the hole to Azalea, Oregon.

17
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,180
 Now, I have no idea where that's at, but it sounds pretty.

18
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,180
 It sounds serene. It sounds peaceful.

19
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:18,180
 And we're specifically going back to March 19, 1991.

20
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,180
 Hair metal was on its way out. Grunge was on its way in.

21
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:26,180
 Next year, Terminator 2 was gonna be released at Theaters.

22
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:31,180
 And I was...

23
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,180
 14 years old when this story took place.

24
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,180
 Odd, really? 17 and 94, so yeah, I was 14 years old.

25
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,180
 I was a freshman in high school as the story took place.

26
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,180
 Not like that has any bearing on the story itself, but...

27
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:49,180
 I just want you to imagine Little Jason in his cross colors, big, giant, African medallion,

28
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:54,180
 and baggy pants on backwards in this story.

29
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,180
 And I'm standing like a B-boy.

30
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:00,180
 I'm just in the background of every part of the story standing just like that.

31
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,180
 Now, I have to have a little levity because this story gets a little grim.

32
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,180
 What we're gonna be doing is we're gonna be talking about the story of Tommy Gibson.

33
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:13,180
 Tommy Gibson was a two and a half year old boy playing in his yard.

34
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,180
 And he's just kind of messing around.

35
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,180
 Chasing caterpillars, sticking sticks and ant holes, stuff like that.

36
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,180
 Stuff that kids do.

37
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,180
 And his father, Larry Gibson, Sheriff's deputy, says,

38
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:28,180
 "Hey, Tommy, Tommy, don't go anywhere until your sister comes out.

39
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,180
 You gotta stay in the yard."

40
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,180
 And he's like, "Okay."

41
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,180
 And Larry Gibson's like, "Okay, my son's gonna stay.

42
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,180
 He's a good boy. He's not gonna do anything."

43
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,180
 So he leaves the yard and goes for a jog, like he had planned to do.

44
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,180
 Now, generally when he goes on his jog, he keeps his 45 on him, his sidearm.

45
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,180
 He goes for the jog. He keeps it on him for protection.

46
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:53,180
 He also is having a serious issue with cats, feral cats in the area.

47
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:58,180
 Not giant ones, but like little ones, but still they're kind of damaging the property.

48
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,180
 And he was shooting the cats.

49
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,180
 So automatically all you cat lovers out there are like, "That guy is a scumbag."

50
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,180
 But I'm just telling you what he was doing.

51
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,180
 He was shooting cats, not for fun. He was just getting them off of his property.

52
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,180
 He goes for his jog.

53
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,180
 At some point during the jog, his wife, Tommy's mom,

54
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:23,180
 here's a gunshot. And she goes, "Oh, Larry. Casual animal abuse. So romantic."

55
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,180
 And she just keeps washing the dishes.

56
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,180
 I don't know, maybe she was an attorney. That was sexist.

57
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,180
 But anyway, she's doing something in the house.

58
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,180
 She hears the gunshot.

59
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,180
 She eventually goes, "Oh, I need to go out and get Tommy."

60
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:44,180
 Changes diaper and then do the laundry and/or run a successful company because I'm a CEO.

61
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,180
 I don't know. So anyways, so she goes out to find Tommy.

62
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,180
 He's missing. She's like, "Hmm, where could that little scoundrel be?"

63
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,180
 She's looking around for him, "Tommy, Tommy."

64
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,180
 Can't find him. She's starting to get worried because he's two and a half left down in this front yard.

65
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,180
 45 minutes after he left, Larry Gibson gets back to his house from his jog.

66
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:12,180
 And he's like, "Oh, man. Oh, man. I can't. It was a good jog, man.

67
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,180
 I've been running for 45 minutes. Look at my watch. Remember that, honey?

68
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,180
 45 minutes is when I left 45 minutes ago."

69
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,180
 And she's like, "Yeah, yeah. Why are you acting so weird?"

70
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,180
 He's like, "I'm just out of breath."

71
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,180
 And she goes, "Well, you're going to have to be even more out of breath because our son's missing,

72
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,180
 so we got to find them so start running around looking for our son."

73
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,180
 Now, they end up calling the police, obviously. Police come out.

74
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,180
 And at this point, Larry's panicking. The mom's panicking.

75
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,180
 They have a daughter, an older daughter as well. Everyone's panicking. The police show up.

76
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,180
 The police are trying to calm everyone down. And Larry's like, "You know what? No, dude.

77
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,180
 Screw this, dude." He's like, "I'm going to go take my shower."

78
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:52,180
 They're like, "You are awfully sweaty." He's like, "Yeah, I was jogging for 45 minutes here.

79
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,180
 My wife saw me come back 45 minutes later." And she's like, "That's kind of weird."

80
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,180
 But anyway, so he's like, "I'm so sweaty. I'm going to go take a shower.

81
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,180
 Nice, hot, relaxing shower. But I'm like, "Cop uniform."

82
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,180
 And the other cops at this point are like, "That's a weird thing,

83
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,180
 but maybe he just really needs a shower and he wants to have the authority of his uniform

84
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,180
 as he's looking for his son." So anyways, he goes in his showers.

85
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,180
 They're not waiting around for him, but he's like reading a magazine on the toilet.

86
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,180
 They're like, "Hey, Larry. We're trying to search for your kid. Are you going to come out?"

87
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,180
 And he's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll be in a second. I'm sorry. I'm just reading this article. It's really good."

88
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,180
 And then they hear like the hot water turn on and he's like waiting for it to get hotter.

89
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:31,180
 They're like, "But anyway, so they're already searching for the kid. They don't want to wait around for him."

90
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,180
 Larry eventually comes out of the shower and he's wearing his uniform, starts searching for the kid as well.

91
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,180
 They can't find him. They're interviewing all the neighbors. They're interviewing the family members.

92
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,180
 They're trying to figure out what's going on.

93
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,180
 Now, the only thing that they know is there was a gunshot fired at some time,

94
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,180
 but the wife was like, "It was most likely my husband's shooting a cat."

95
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,180
 And he goes, "I did. I shot a cat."

96
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,180
 And the investigators found a cat with a bullet hole through it on his property.

97
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,180
 Like it was walking along the fence and a bullet went through it and killed it.

98
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,180
 So the cops are like, "Okay, that explains the gunshot, but it doesn't explain where the kid is."

99
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,180
 So they keep looking. He is then told by his boss,

100
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:12,180
 "You don't have to come to work. Really, just go home, take your uniform off, just relax. We got this handle."

101
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:17,180
 And he's like, "No, gotta help find my son. I know that he's out there. I can feel it. I can feel it on my bones."

102
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,180
 They're like, "Well, just stay at home."

103
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,180
 Okay? They don't openly want to say he's a suspect because he's a brother.

104
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,180
 He's a brother of the badge, but he's a suspect.

105
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,180
 They don't want him driving around in a cop car, but he disobeys orders.

106
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:37,180
 He gets in his cop car and begins searching local rest areas looking for whoever took his son.

107
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,180
 Now, the FBI eventually comes out because it's a kidnapping.

108
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:46,180
 And they begin interviewing the neighbors and the neighbors go, "Hmm, I did see this beige van pull up

109
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,180
 and there was this white man and this white woman get out.

110
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:57,180
 And then, you know, I didn't see them actually take Tommy, but I did see these suspicious people around the house.

111
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,180
 And Larry's like, "Aha! Yes, those are the people who took my son."

112
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,180
 And the cops are like, "Well, it's possible. Possible. We'll look into it."

113
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,180
 Quit popping out of nowhere, Larry. You can't just keep doing that every time we find a clue.

114
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:15,180
 The police get a letter that's never been disclosed to the public, and it was signed spot on the road

115
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:21,180
 that contained information that they believe, that they, that led them to believe that the person who wrote the letter

116
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,180
 knows what happened to little Tommy.

117
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,180
 But they've never disclosed what's in the letter. And then the case goes cold.

118
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,180
 There's really no leads outside of the van that pulled up.

119
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:39,180
 In 1993, there was a song, I love this song too, it was a song by Soul Asylum called "Runaway Train."

120
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:47,180
 And it's a song about runaways, and in the song, in the videos, they would show pictures of kids who had gone missing.

121
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:52,180
 And I didn't know this, but every country or every region, I guess, had different photos.

122
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:58,180
 So the photos we saw in the American version of the video was different than the photos they showed in the British version of the video,

123
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,180
 or the South American version of the video, things like that.

124
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:07,180
 Out of that video, it's amazing to think that video found 26 kids, not the video itself.

125
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:13,180
 The video didn't grow legs and start walking around, but because of that video, because of those photographs, 26 kids were found.

126
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:19,180
 One of them, though, said, "My family was abusive when I ran away because they were abusive and I was at my boyfriend's house

127
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:24,180
 and your video came on, thanks a lot jerks." She told them that, she went to a concert of theirs and said,

128
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:29,180
 "You guys ruined my life because I went back to a really bad environment."

129
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:38,180
 But 25, 25 happy endings, and Tommy's image was in "Runaway Train" in 1993.

130
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,180
 I love that song, it's still a great song.

131
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:45,180
 1994, Larry Gibson is arrested for manslaughter.

132
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,180
 And this is the working theory that the cops had.

133
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:55,180
 He shot the cat and the bullet went clean through the cat, because it's a 45.

134
00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:04,180
 He goes clean through the cat and hit his son, and he found that his son had been hit and was bleeding out and panicked.

135
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:09,180
 So he hit the body and then went on the rest of his jog.

136
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:14,180
 When he came back, the kid was missing and he's like, "I'm just going to go take a shower."

137
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:19,180
 And they think that he used his squad car to hide the body in and then dump it somewhere.

138
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,180
 That was what they argued in court.

139
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:26,180
 His daughter eventually said that she had seen him beat Tommy.

140
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:33,180
 She saw Larry beat Tommy until he went limp, put him in a black trash bag, threw it in the back of the police car, drove away.

141
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:38,180
 And then the FBI started to believe that when they were looking at notes, they said,

142
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:42,180
 "Cops interviewed the neighbors, they didn't mention anything about a beige van."

143
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,180
 But when the FBI interviewed the neighbors, they did.

144
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:51,180
 So they started thinking that Larry was basically witness tampering and telling them to say, "Say this, say this."

145
00:09:51,180 --> 00:10:02,180
 So with two possible theories of how he died, either he was shot accidentally, or the daughter saw him beat him to death,

146
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,180
 no real evidence of either one.

147
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,180
 Just a hunch.

148
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,180
 I mean, absolutely no evidence.

149
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,180
 And apparently, like people said, "Oh, he confessed to me that he killed the boy."

150
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,180
 But it was all hearsay.

151
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,180
 He denied all of it.

152
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,180
 No body, nothing.

153
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,180
 He gets convicted, oddly enough.

154
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,180
 Three years in prison for Manslaughter was his sentence.

155
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:30,180
 So it was this weird hedge thing where they convicted him of a very, very minor charge.

156
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,180
 I mean, like Manslaughter is a major charge, but three years in prison is really nothing.

157
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,180
 You can do that standing on your head.

158
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:42,180
 And then he gets out of prison and he still denies to this day I had nothing to do with the death of my son.

159
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,180
 I don't know who did it.

160
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:49,180
 He did say at one point in an interview with the police, he goes, when he was originally being investigated,

161
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,180
 they said, "Is it possible that you shot the cat and the bullet hit your son?"

162
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,180
 And he goes, "I guess it's possible.

163
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,180
 I mean, that wouldn't make sense, wouldn't it?

164
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,180
 But I didn't hide the body."

165
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:04,180
 He goes, "My brother-in-law who also lived there may have hid the body and not have told me, but I didn't hide the body."

166
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,180
 So that also made them suspicious.

167
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:11,180
 But anyways, he got out and he's like, "I'm free, I'm free, and now I will find the real killers."

168
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,180
 I mean, kidnappers of my kid.

169
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:19,180
 Last we saw of Larry Gibson, I believe he's still alive.

170
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,180
 He's a country western musician.

171
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,180
 He moved to, I think it was Idaho or Montana, you might just be traveling that area.

172
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,180
 You can listen to his songs online.

173
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,180
 I'll have the website in the show notes.

174
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:34,180
 I can't put any of his songs here, but feel free to listen to them.

175
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:41,180
 The best part of the website is, it's an old website and it warns you when you go to the photos page,

176
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,180
 this page is graphics heavy.

177
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:48,180
 If you're on dial up, it may take a while for all the pictures to load.

178
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,180
 A charming end to a chilling story.

179
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:58,180
 Did he actually accidentally shoot his son and was able to clean up the crime scene in 20 minutes,

180
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,180
 including all the blood on the grass.

181
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,180
 The kid was silent the whole time.

182
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:08,180
 Nobody saw anything as he bagged this kid up, hid him, went on a jog,

183
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,180
 endured a police search as they were searching the area they didn't find the body.

184
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,180
 Then he's able to put the body into his police car without anyone noticing.

185
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:20,180
 And then dumping it without anyone seeing him.

186
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:24,180
 Did he beat a kid, like her story kind of came out of the blue, did he beat him,

187
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,180
 put him in a trash bag, throw him in the back of the car,

188
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,180
 and the mom not see him beat him?

189
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,180
 Did the boy not make any noise when he beat some?

190
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:38,180
 What's bizarre is like, I think the guy probably did do it.

191
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,180
 I don't think I'm not giving this whole thing like he's innocent.

192
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:45,180
 I just think it's weird that he got convicted with absolutely no evidence,

193
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:49,180
 just hunches, and what people were saying.

194
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:55,180
 And a sheriff's deputy for a member of law enforcement to be prosecuted successfully

195
00:12:55,180 --> 00:13:00,180
 for something like this with no evidence is bizarre,

196
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,180
 because normally it's the other way around.

197
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,180
 Normally there's that code of silence.

198
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:12,180
 I think one of the key pieces of evidence is that spot on the road letter.

199
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:18,180
 It either exonerates him completely, or it damns him to his three-year prison sentence.

200
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,180
 But we don't know what that letter says.

201
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,180
 I think they're keeping that under wraps because of that.

202
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:31,180
 But whatever, guilty or innocent, Tommy is missing, presumed to be dead,

203
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:37,180
 and the father on his search for the real killers is playing honky-tonks,

204
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,180
 granges, and the occasional wedding.

205
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,180
 Maybe he'll find the killer in those places.

206
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:47,180
 Maybe he finds the killer every time he looks in the mirror.

207
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,180
 But let's go ahead and move on to another story,

208
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:55,180
 one that's a little more upbeat unless you are scared of maniacs in your bedroom.

209
00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:02,180
 So this is, again, a bizarre story, because it kind of falls into an area where is it,

210
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,180
 what is this phenomenon?

211
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,180
 Some people may classify it as a ghost.

212
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,180
 There's been a lot of effort to classify it as an alien.

213
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,180
 Is it a demon? Who knows.

214
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,180
 Hopefully, you never have to find out.

215
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,180
 Tonight, you go to sleep.

216
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:26,180
 You're lying in bed comfortable in the safety of your own home.

217
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:31,180
 But out of your sleep, you sense something in your room.

218
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:35,180
 It's so palpable it wakes you up.

219
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,180
 And you're laying there in the darkness,

220
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:44,180
 and you know there's something there that shouldn't be.

221
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,180
 You don't have to see it. You don't have to hear it.

222
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,180
 You just know.

223
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:55,180
 And that feeling of dread that is just washing over you,

224
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,180
 freezes you in place,

225
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:02,180
 and you feel the foot of your bed become a little heavier.

226
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:07,180
 Something has now joined you in your bed.

227
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:11,180
 You don't want to look,

228
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:15,180
 but you feel compelled to.

229
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,180
 Whether it's curiosity, whether it's caution,

230
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:25,180
 whether it's blind fear of what will happen if you don't look,

231
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:28,180
 you roll over and you see it.

232
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,180
 He's sitting on the edge of your bed,

233
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:35,180
 and his face has a grin so wide,

234
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,180
 it's inhuman.

235
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:44,180
 It's a mixture of both fiendish delight and torment, pain.

236
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,180
 You can't tell. It's both and neither.

237
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:51,180
 His eyes are wild. He's staring at you.

238
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,180
 And he's rubbing his chest with his hands,

239
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:59,180
 just rubbing himself up and down, just staring at you.

240
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:03,180
 Silently, you just hear the sound of the fabric

241
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:07,180
 as his hands brush against his chest,

242
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,180
 and then he's gone.

243
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,180
 You still have this afterimage, of course,

244
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,180
 of this thing that was at the foot of your bed.

245
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,180
 In your bed with you.

246
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,180
 You can't get it out of your mind.

247
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,180
 And if you think Jason's just telling,

248
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,180
 oh, a spooky story, because he knows a lot of people listen to the podcast at night,

249
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:29,180
 that story I just told you was exactly what happened to young women

250
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:34,180
 between the year 1976 and 1979 in Glasgow, Scotland.

251
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,180
 Most specifically, there was an area,

252
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,180
 it was the Crosshill District in Glasgow.

253
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:43,180
 And, oddly enough, they could fit it into a time period,

254
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,180
 4pm to 9pm.

255
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,180
 Now, usually in that time period.

256
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,180
 But not all the time.

257
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,180
 Because the story I told you was later at night,

258
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,180
 a woman was in bed with her husband.

259
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,180
 She woke up.

260
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,180
 The grinning man was sitting at the foot of her bed,

261
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:01,180
 describing what she said he was wildly rubbing his chest.

262
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,180
 Which, it's funny, because if you wake up

263
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:07,180
 and there's something standing at the foot of your bed just staring at you,

264
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,180
 that's quite terrifying.

265
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,180
 Or if you wake up and you see a little girl standing in the corner of your room,

266
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,180
 that's very scary.

267
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:18,180
 But if you woke up in the middle of the night and you saw that shadowy figure

268
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,180
 at the end of your bed,

269
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,180
 not just standing there silently,

270
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,180
 but spinning around like a top with his arms stuck out,

271
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,180
 his tongue just wagging.

272
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,180
 Each time Revolutiony sees his tongue going "Uhhh, whoa!"

273
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,180
 That's creepier.

274
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:36,180
 We have this thing where there's what we expect to be normal behavior

275
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,180
 and what's abnormal behavior.

276
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,180
 And it's funny because that also comes into the paranormal.

277
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,180
 When I was reading this story,

278
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,180
 the grinning man does such crazy creepy things

279
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:50,180
 that it elevates it to other than just like a girl jumping with a rope.

280
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,180
 Like a little ghost girl.

281
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,180
 Not just a regular girl jumping, but like a ghost girl jumping.

282
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,180
 If instead of the girl, the ghost girl,

283
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,180
 you could have them like you're walking down the hallway

284
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,180
 and you see a ghost girl riding a tricycle.

285
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,180
 But what if you're walking on the hallway and you saw the ghost girl

286
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:05,180
 rolling around on the ground like she was a pig going "Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk

287
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:35,180
 rolling around on the ground like she was a pig going "Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk

288
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:59,180
 above the neck and you saw his feet?

289
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:29,180
 It's like "Uhhh, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, eee

290
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:34,180
 And then you see a ghost girl walking across the street just jogging in place.

291
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,180
 What is up with this guy?

292
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,180
 Only women saw him.

293
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:43,180
 I think they had like a total of like between like 11 and 17 sightings.

294
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,180
 Only seen by women.

295
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:50,180
 And some women were reportedly so disturbed by it, they moved away.

296
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,180
 It was such a creepy thing to see.

297
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:58,180
 What's so bizarre about the grinning man is it doesn't really fall into any particular category.

298
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:02,180
 It's human, but humans type things can be cryptids

299
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:06,180
 and it is restricted to a certain geographical location,

300
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,180
 which would make you think of something like a Bigfoot

301
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,180
 or a Levelyn fraud or something like that.

302
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:16,180
 But then it exhibits these ghostly things where it can vanish right in front of you.

303
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,180
 Cryptids normally like scurry off into the woods.

304
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,180
 That's why people think they're more like animalistic.

305
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,180
 They're more like realistic type things.

306
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,180
 He can disappear right in front of you.

307
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,180
 He can enter your home.

308
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,180
 He can move.

309
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,180
 He can enter your home unannounced where you won't notice him.

310
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:35,180
 But when he's at the foot of your bed, he can give you a sense of dread so you do notice him.

311
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:40,180
 You're walking down a dark hallway and you know something's behind you

312
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,180
 and you don't want to look.

313
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,180
 It's the grinning man.

314
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:48,180
 The fact that only women could see him is such a bizarre detail to the whole story.

315
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,180
 So you have all these...

316
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:54,180
 It's just such a weird story because when you think about stuff like Friday the 13th,

317
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,180
 I know movies aren't documentaries, but when you talk about stuff like Friday the 13th,

318
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:01,180
 they take place at Camp Crystal Lake when you talk about Nimeran Elm Street.

319
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,180
 It takes place on Elm Street.

320
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:10,180
 So you have all this stuff that is very area specific and so are cryptids with like the Levelyn fraud like I was talking about.

321
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:14,180
 But to have this neighborhood place for three years with this creature that only women can see,

322
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,180
 it seems so sex-based.

323
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,180
 It seems so perverted.

324
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:23,180
 Mixed with that insanity plus that horrible face.

325
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:29,180
 There's very few things people can do that's more unsettling than an unearned grin.

326
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,180
 If I tell a joke I expect someone to smile.

327
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,180
 I demand it almost.

328
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:40,180
 But if I'm talking to someone and as I'm talking to them they just start getting this huge grin on their face.

329
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,180
 You're just walking in a room and someone turns to you and they have a huge smile.

330
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,180
 It's very, very disconcerting.

331
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,180
 It might be some evolutionary thing about people showing their teeth.

332
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,180
 It might just be because it's very out of place.

333
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,180
 If you walk into a room and someone's making a sad face you're going to go like,

334
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,180
 "Oh man, what's the matter?"

335
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,180
 But if you walk into a room and someone has a wide grin you're not going to go,

336
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,180
 "What's so funny?"

337
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,180
 You're going to be like, "Slowly back out of the room."

338
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:05,180
 I would at least if someone's generally laughing when they think something's funny.

339
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,180
 Like I've never seen anyone just sit in a room just smiling wildly.

340
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:13,180
 The grinning man, it's also referred to as the "girning man" of Scotland.

341
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,180
 And there's a grinning man in America.

342
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,180
 We'll cover that on a future episode because that's more of an alien thing.

343
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,180
 And I don't think there's a connection between the two.

344
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:26,180
 I've tried working out connections with those, but there just doesn't seem to be any connection.

345
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:31,180
 The experiences of the women, well one, grinning man in America was seen by a man,

346
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:35,180
 only one man, and then this one's only by women in this other country.

347
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,180
 The only thing that they have in common is they're bald and they have grins.

348
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:42,180
 Which might sound like a lot in common. We'll cover that on another episode.

349
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:46,180
 But I mean, you know, when you lock your doors to your house, when you get into your bed,

350
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:50,180
 you assume those things are safe and you assume, worst case scenario,

351
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,180
 someone's gonna kick down your door, you're gonna hear it, you're gonna be prepared,

352
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:57,180
 or maybe you're asleep and someone jumps on top of you and you have to start wrestling them and things like that.

353
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:01,180
 Obviously worst case scenario is you get a knife through your head while you're sleeping,

354
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,180
 but you're like, "Jason, I'm not gonna bed tonight."

355
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:06,180
 But you know what I mean? Like there are certain things we can prepare for.

356
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:12,180
 You don't prepare to have a silent visitor creature show up at the edge of your bed,

357
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:17,180
 but if you do, you do plan that if you woke up and there was a man sitting on the edge of your bed,

358
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,180
 how you would fight back.

359
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:25,180
 But if that man was rubbing his chest and smiling at you, there's just such a bizarre scenario.

360
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:29,180
 Jogging in place. Just moving in a creepy fashion.

361
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:34,180
 Those would all kind of set you off. That would activate your flight response.

362
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,180
 How would you fight someone who was jogging in place?

363
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:42,180
 Like you would yell at them, tell them to stop and they would keep doing it and they're,

364
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:45,180
 "I'm gonna bust you a good one, mate. I'm gonna bust you a good one."

365
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:48,180
 Like how? And then you get there and he's just looking at you jogging in place.

366
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:53,180
 I feel like you'd almost be too afraid to hit him. This guy's obviously insane.

367
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:59,180
 But what happens when you mix the insanity with magic?

368
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:06,180
 You get something that really can't be stopped, that can get you anywhere it wants to.

369
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:11,180
 But to me, the weirdest part of this story is why did it stop?

370
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:15,180
 Did it get what it wanted and it wanted to scare 17 women?

371
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,180
 Wanted to be a lasting impression in their brain?

372
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:23,180
 Did it move on to somewhere else? I think that's what happened.

373
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:26,180
 I think it's become more discreet.

374
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:32,180
 Instead of popping up 17 times over the course of about 3 years in one neighborhood,

375
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,180
 take your show on the road.

376
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:39,180
 You can only rob so many banks in a city before they get wise to you.

377
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:44,180
 You can only pass so many counterfeit bills before they know what to look for.

378
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:50,180
 Maybe Scotland was just a little training ground for it, for it went worldwide.

379
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:55,180
 Because if someone saw this now, in the middle of Idaho,

380
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:58,180
 they would think it was a one-off thing that only they experienced.

381
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:02,180
 Some creepy apparition ghost demon thing that they saw.

382
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:05,180
 Is it stood in the bushes, this tongue sticking out,

383
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:05,180
 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

384
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:10,180
 and then blinks out of existence?

385
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:14,180
 There'd be no one hunting for it if no one knew it existed.

386
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:18,180
 I think that seeing it at the end of your bed,

387
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:23,180
 rubbing its chest, which is such a bizarre image, is creepy.

388
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:27,180
 But what would almost be even more creepy than that?

389
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:32,180
 If it was doing that, but was invisible.

390
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:35,180
 The grinning man may still be in Scotland.

391
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:39,180
 It may have taken a show on the road, but it may have become more discreet.

392
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:42,180
 So now when you're walking down the hallway,

393
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:46,180
 and you get that kind of chill up the back of your neck,

394
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:50,180
 you don't want to look, you don't turn around, but you feel compelled to,

395
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:54,180
 and you turn around,

396
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,180
 hallway's empty, it's just you,

397
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:01,180
 just outside of our field of vision,

398
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:04,180
 visible to the human eye.

399
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:08,180
 May be a tall, bald man,

400
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:12,180
 rubbing his chest right behind you,

401
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:18,180
 grinning wildly at all the fun he's having.

402
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,180
