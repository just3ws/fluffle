1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
 Do ghosts keep humans as pets?

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,280
 It's a bizarre sentence I never thought I'd say.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:16,600
 And then we travel to Pennsylvania to meet a teenage boy who has to help set up a computer

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,000
 for a bunch of old people.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,940
 Now that's not the most horrific part of the story, but it does sound pretty rough.

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,000
 After he's all done setting up the computer AND giving the elderly a tutorial on how

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,480
 to use it, he's packing up and getting ready to leave.

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,760
 And then the insectoid showed up.

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,080
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:50,120
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,080
 I'm your host Jason Garminer, I'm having a good day.

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,880
 I hope you guys are having a great day actually.

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,400
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

14
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,800
 I hope you guys had lots of fun over the weekend.

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,320
 We got a ton of stuff to cover so we're going to get started right away.

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,680
 First off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

17
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,800
 Everyone give it up for one of our newest Patreon supporters.

18
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,720
 Round of applause, get those hands ready to clap for Brian Hernandez.

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,720
 Oh yeah, walk on in, yay, wee, walkin' coming in on a slide apparently, wee.

20
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,680
 Sliding on into Dead Rabbit Command.

21
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,040
 Brian, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

22
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,720
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I said it a thousand times, I mean it each time.

23
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,120
 That's okay.

24
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,120
 Just helps read the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

25
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,280
 That helps out so much.

26
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,040
 Now Brian, I want you to go ahead and break out the hair hang glider.

27
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,320
 We're going to jump off the highest point of Dead Rabbit Command and we're going to

28
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:47,280
 glide all the way out to warning, warning, warning lights.

29
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,760
 Red lights are flashing in your eyes.

30
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,480
 I have a flashlight right in your eyes.

31
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,480
 I'm going warning, warning.

32
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,000
 You're like, "Ah, Brian Hernandez is like, ah, everyone's kind of flipping out."

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,840
 This is a breaking story.

34
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,840
 This is nuts.

35
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,720
 I actually wasn't going to cover this because it's so, it's been covered so much, but I

36
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,320
 just woke up from a nap.

37
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,720
 It's right now, I'm recording this on Saturday.

38
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,720
 It's like 3.30.

39
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,200
 I'm a baby, I take naps, I take naps all the time.

40
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:20,680
 You know that whole UFO thing going on over Alaska?

41
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,920
 First we have the balloon from China come over and then it got blown up.

42
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:32,920
 And then the next day, I saw all these reports that the US military blew up another thing

43
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,920
 coming over Canada.

44
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,880
 Now the first thing, everyone was looking up at their binoculars or just looking at

45
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,560
 photographs online was the most part.

46
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,960
 China sent a weather balloon or a spy balloon.

47
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,960
 It really depends on who you believe.

48
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,240
 It was a spy balloon.

49
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,640
 I guess even the Chinese are like, yeah, we knew it was a spy balloon.

50
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,000
 We are just spying on your weather is all.

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,680
 They sent that over, it got shot down.

52
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:05,360
 And then the next day or Friday, what was being reported in the media was an object

53
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:12,000
 about the size of a car was flying at about 40,000 feet in the air, which is dangerous

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,120
 for air traffic.

55
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,000
 So a jet flew up there.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,160
 Blew it up.

57
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,360
 Pilot probably flew through the debris to be extra cool.

58
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,240
 They blew it up and I saw this pop up in the news and then it immediately began popping

59
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,360
 up in all the UFO circles.

60
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,960
 The government just admitted they shot down a UFO.

61
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,240
 I was like, yeah, because they don't know what it was yet.

62
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,720
 They shot it down.

63
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,760
 I don't think it was from Alpha Centauri.

64
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,080
 It did blow up pretty quickly, guys.

65
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:53,160
 Remember we have like 70 years of pilots chasing these things, disappearing before they can

66
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,760
 get a lock on them.

67
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,920
 70 years of these things being bulletproof and these evasive maneuvers and then so when

68
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,360
 they blew up something over Alaska, I go, guys, this is clearly not.

69
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,280
 I'm talking to my computer.

70
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,360
 I didn't even post any of this stuff.

71
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,160
 Just reading these articles and I'm shaking my computer.

72
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,240
 I'm like, guys, it's not an alien spacecraft.

73
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,080
 If it is an alien spacecraft that we literally have nothing to worry about, they seem to

74
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,880
 blow up when you shoot them.

75
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,880
 I don't care.

76
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,760
 I don't want aliens to invade Earth, but if they're going to invade Earth and their

77
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,400
 vehicles suck, then that's totally fine.

78
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,960
 I'm totally fine with that.

79
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,520
 It would be like a totally short war.

80
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,440
 But I mean, I'm afraid they're going to come down and they're going to overwhelm us with

81
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,840
 technological superiority.

82
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,640
 It would be hilarious if they've somehow managed, aliens have somehow managed to be

83
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:48,240
 able to travel the cosmos in the blink of an eye, but they have no shields.

84
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,740
 Nothing is protected.

85
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,560
 Like you could literally walk up and punch a UFO and the whole thing explodes.

86
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,560
 That's another thing.

87
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,280
 We've had people punch UFOs.

88
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,040
 We've had people attack them with tools and they're impervious.

89
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,200
 That was the scary part.

90
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:07,560
 If they were just, if aliens were coming down and their stuff sucked, then no one would

91
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,560
 care.

92
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,480
 I mean, I guess we would care like scientists would be like, there's like people from another

93
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
 planet.

94
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,480
 They don't.

95
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,400
 Yeah, but how strong are they?

96
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
 Can I beat them up?

97
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,720
 Oh, they're lame.

98
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,560
 So I saw that and I was like, it was all over the UFO community and they're like, oh, they

99
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,440
 finally admitted they shot down a UFO.

100
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,440
 They finally admitted it.

101
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,320
 And I was like, well, that's kind of kind of suspicious too, because they've been denying

102
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,280
 that these things have existed for so long.

103
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,200
 They've denied that Roswell was even an event.

104
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,640
 And now they're just telling us when they blow them out of the sky.

105
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,800
 But at the end of the day, we didn't know what it was.

106
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,800
 We shot it down.

107
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,800
 It was all over the news.

108
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,480
 It was all over the conspiracy theory world.

109
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,320
 It was all over the UFO world.

110
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,720
 It was all over the Patreon discord.

111
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,840
 We were talking about it there.

112
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,440
 So I go, well, you probably won't cover it because we've already had a lot of coverage

113
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,920
 about the Chinese balloon.

114
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,320
 It's been all over the news.

115
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,920
 We've had a ton of coverage now about this second thing.

116
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:10,400
 So I wake up from my baby nap on, what is it, February 11th, and I'm getting ready to

117
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,400
 record this episode.

118
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,880
 You're listening to right now.

119
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,880
 And I check my phone.

120
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:19,680
 I check my phone right when I wake up, not for lost cause, but to read the news.

121
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,260
 I'm a news guy.

122
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,920
 Some people would say it's an information addiction.

123
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:31,400
 I wake up and I check my phone and I go to the news and around 3pm, another thing, another

124
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:37,400
 unknown vehicle has been shot down coming over Alaska, the near Alaska.

125
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,840
 This time, I didn't know this was a thing.

126
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:47,440
 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau gave the order for a US jet to shoot this down.

127
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,680
 They might that I guess that's why you're not even possible all of a sudden you have

128
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,360
 the Queen of England being like attack Yankees attack.

129
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,400
 I don't think you can do that.

130
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,920
 So I kind of maybe I read the article wrong to be honest.

131
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,160
 Either international relations is not what it used to be or I read the article wrong

132
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,480
 cause I just woke up from a nap.

133
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,520
 But anyways, maybe he gave them permission.

134
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,520
 Maybe he ordered them.

135
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:18,560
 The whole point is, is that another US fighter jet just today, just while I was napping,

136
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,840
 shot down an other object coming over Alaska.

137
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,920
 The reason why the key is so funny because I was like, oh, that's interesting.

138
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,520
 This one maybe some of the Thomas Kyle on the planet.

139
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,840
 But I go, I'm watching this stuff and I was like, oh, wow, China launched that balloon.

140
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,840
 This was during that thing.

141
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,400
 I was like, China launched the balloon.

142
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,520
 It's coming over Alaska.

143
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,520
 That's weird.

144
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,960
 I thought it would like, I don't know, come over California first.

145
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,800
 Cause you know, the way a map works.

146
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,200
 And I get to the world's a globe.

147
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,400
 But they've shown on this, I was watching this, I read a bunch about the balloon.

148
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,880
 It was, it was quite interesting.

149
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,880
 And you couldn't avoid it.

150
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,880
 It was everywhere.

151
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,640
 But they were showing the flight plan because the world is a globe.

152
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,880
 It floats over the top of the planet.

153
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,480
 I was like, oh, I guess that makes sense.

154
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:09,440
 I guess it would be like by boat, it would be quicker to go through the Pacific Ocean.

155
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,880
 You don't have to worry about like ice or nothing.

156
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,080
 You're just like full steam ahead.

157
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,280
 But if you didn't have to worry about ice, you just send in a balloon over it would like

158
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,460
 float over the Arctic area, whatever.

159
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,460
 So I thought that was interesting.

160
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,080
 That was a little geography lesson for me.

161
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,600
 Good thing I'm not in charge of like nukes or like fighter bases.

162
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,920
 I'm like, sir, China's way too far away.

163
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,920
 They'll never attack us.

164
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,400
 And they're like, look at a globe you moron.

165
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,200
 They're like super, super close.

166
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,840
 Anyways, we've shot down this third thing.

167
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,400
 This third thing has been shot down and they are going, we don't know what it is.

168
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,400
 So now it's interesting.

169
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,640
 I mean, it was interesting the whole time, but I debated whether or not it was anyone

170
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,340
 cover it and it's getting weird.

171
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,740
 Do I think they're from outer space?

172
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,900
 No.

173
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,100
 But it's definitely something.

174
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,500
 I mean, obviously it's something they're blowing up.

175
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
 It's not a conspiracy.

176
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,500
 They're there.

177
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:10,260
 It's just weird what they are, but I wanted to make sure I covered it.

178
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,540
 And then I thought if it was at this point, if you don't cover it, people are just going

179
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,700
 to think you're a CIA asset.

180
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,700
 There's actually like flying saucers having outside your house right now.

181
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,480
 I was like, nope, everything's totally fine.

182
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,800
 Watch the television.

183
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
 Just watch the television.

184
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,240
 Yeah, at a certain point, at a certain point you do have to say we've shot down two UFOs

185
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,640
 in two days.

186
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,120
 Hey, paranormal podcast, you may want to address it.

187
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,880
 You may want to not look like you're funded by the government.

188
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,040
 Okay, let's go ahead.

189
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,600
 It's funny I say get started.

190
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,960
 That almost was its own segment.

191
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,320
 Brian got that hair hang glider already.

192
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,940
 Slowly regaining his vision.

193
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:54,500
 Let's grab onto his shoes and hold on tight.

194
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,260
 Brian jumped off the highest point at Dead Rabbit Command and glided us all the way out

195
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:07,780
 to a little girl's bedroom.

196
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:12,180
 We sneak in, got her sneakers on, so we're extra quiet and we're sneaking into this little

197
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,580
 girl's bedroom.

198
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,980
 This is an anonymous story.

199
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,980
 She didn't post her name.

200
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,640
 I'm going to go ahead and call her Molly.

201
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,680
 Molly is fast asleep.

202
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,160
 We're sneaking into this room.

203
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:31,760
 Molly is nine years old and she shares this bedroom with her 12-year-old sister.

204
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,120
 The way she described it, she goes, "Let me describe the room to you."

205
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,120
 This story will make more sense.

206
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,240
 I don't understand it.

207
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,200
 Had a hard time figuring this out, how it is set up.

208
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,000
 She says, "We had two beds.

209
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,980
 We had my 12-year-old sister, who I shared the room with.

210
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:53,060
 Her bed was against one side of the wall.

211
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:57,980
 And then my bed was against the other side of the wall."

212
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,780
 This sounds like a riddle.

213
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,140
 The sister's bed was against one side of the wall.

214
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:09,940
 My bed was against the other side of the wall, but we shared a room.

215
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,100
 I don't get it.

216
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,920
 I imagine...I can't even picture it.

217
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,840
 I was all puzzled as this paranormal story is happening.

218
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,880
 I'm like, "But where were the beds?"

219
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,040
 Maybe you guys can picture it easier.

220
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,880
 That's how it's laid out.

221
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,640
 And between the beds, this is another detail you totally got a picture in your head.

222
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,640
 You're like, "Oh, I got it."

223
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,640
 Now I'm going to add this.

224
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,160
 You're like, "Ah."

225
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,640
 Molly's bed is against one side of the wall.

226
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,160
 The sister's bed.

227
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,960
 We talk about the head parts when you wait too much time talking about how these stupid

228
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,960
 beds are set up.

229
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,940
 But anyways, Molly's headboard is against one side of the wall.

230
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,060
 The sister's headboard is against the other side of the wall.

231
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:53,820
 And in between the two of them, there is a window on the wall.

232
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,220
 I don't understand.

233
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,220
 I don't get it.

234
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,340
 But anyways, this is not a brain teaser.

235
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,620
 This is not what's the most paranormal part of the story.

236
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:09,300
 It was posted online by a girl going by the name of MajorAir4089.

237
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,500
 It's definitely a really weird one.

238
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,400
 We had bedrooms and non-withstanding.

239
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:23,320
 One night, Molly wakes up and she sees a dark figure of a woman standing in the bedroom.

240
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,880
 She's looking right at this woman and she doesn't recognize her.

241
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,880
 It's not the mom.

242
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,880
 It's not another relative.

243
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,560
 It's nothing like that.

244
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,080
 She knows that this person is an interloper.

245
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:40,200
 She describes this figure as having medium length hair, a tank top, and a skirt.

246
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:47,180
 Probably the most important detail of all of that.

247
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,500
 You're like, "Wow, okay.

248
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,900
 Tank top and a skirt.

249
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,900
 Got it, Jason."

250
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,140
 She had no legs.

251
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:59,340
 This apparition was just floating there.

252
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:03,740
 Molly throws her pillow over her head and it's just that childlike reaction.

253
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,180
 If I can't see it, maybe it can't hurt me.

254
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,420
 Not effective.

255
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,120
 And about a minute passes.

256
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:17,220
 Molly is hiding for a good period of time and when she slowly moves the pillow off of

257
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:24,640
 her face, the woman is still standing in the exact same position.

258
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:30,080
 It's not a trick of the light at this point.

259
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,600
 It's not your imagination.

260
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,280
 Enough time has passed that I should be scared right now.

261
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,280
 I should.

262
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,280
 I've done the hiding part.

263
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,240
 It's time to do the screaming part.

264
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,440
 Molly begins to scream and she starts kicking the wall.

265
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,440
 I don't know how.

266
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,240
 I don't know how this bedroom is set up.

267
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,240
 She's Mr. Fantastic.

268
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,760
 Her legs are all "woooow."

269
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:59,080
 Anyways, she's kicking this wall and dad comes in.

270
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,880
 It's dad time and he's like, "What in the world is going on?"

271
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,640
 Molly's like, "I saw it.

272
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,640
 I saw it.

273
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,640
 The woman with no legs."

274
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,280
 And he can't calm Molly down and so he goes, "Tell you what.

275
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,000
 I will sleep in this bedroom with your older sister.

276
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,440
 You go sleep with mom.

277
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,080
 Go to sleep."

278
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,080
 So Molly does.

279
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:25,080
 She walks on down to the bedroom, crawls into bed with mom.

280
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:30,240
 Molly said when she did crawl into bed with her mom, she did fall back asleep.

281
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,080
 But then she wakes up.

282
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:39,640
 It's still the middle of the night and they're standing next to the bed next to Molly.

283
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,640
 She's on Molly's side.

284
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,360
 Molly sees the floating woman.

285
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,440
 Tank top skirt, no legs.

286
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:58,160
 This woman is now floating right on Molly's side of the bed right next to Molly.

287
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,800
 And at this point, Molly then like she said, "I did this little jumpy.

288
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,200
 Like I'm laying down and I felt my body kind of jump towards my mom.

289
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:13,320
 Like I'm like a startled scoot to kind of cower next to my mother.

290
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:28,120
 And when I moved, I saw myself wearing the exact same clothes that I was wearing to bed.

291
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:37,120
 She sees herself sitting on the bed wearing the same clothes, but smaller.

292
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,120
 Not the clothes.

293
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,120
 Not the clothes.

294
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,120
 It's all super tight.

295
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,120
 She's like, "I can't move my arms to spook people."

296
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:53,120
 No, it was a smaller version of Molly sitting on the bed next to the floating woman.

297
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,120
 It's a super interesting story.

298
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,120
 You know when I read this, we cover a lot of stuff on the show that you can't categorize.

299
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,120
 And this falls into that category.

300
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,120
 On the one hand, you think it's a ghost, right?

301
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,120
 A floating apparition in a dark room.

302
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,120
 Very ghost-like.

303
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:20,120
 But when you see yourself outside of your body, especially while you're sleeping, some may call it dreaming.

304
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,120
 But you're right.

305
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,120
 A lot of this could be dreaming.

306
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,120
 But in the world of paranormal, you're connected to astral travel, right?

307
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,120
 Astral projection.

308
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,120
 You're leaving your body.

309
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:44,120
 So, but again, even then, even accounts of astral projection, most of the time it's from the point of view of the soul floating out of your body.

310
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:52,120
 People will say, "I woke up in the middle of the night and I found myself floating outside of my body and there was like a silver tether leading from me back into my body."

311
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,120
 Not everyone sees the tether, but you have that idea.

312
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,120
 It's the soul looking down at the sleeping you.

313
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:09,120
 I'm sure I've come across it, but off the top of my head, I can't think of a story where someone woke up and they saw their soul floating around.

314
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,120
 I'm not saying that it's never happened.

315
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,120
 And we may even cover something like that on the show, but it just nothing pops out of the top of my mind.

316
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:22,120
 What I really haven't seen before, again, I could be wrong.

317
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,120
 We could have covered this or it could be, it's not common.

318
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:34,120
 Whatever way you want to put it, you seeing your soul outside the body is far less common than the soul floating outside the body.

319
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:49,120
 And the soul looking different, I can't think of another time that we've covered that or that I've even read about that, where the soul is actually a different size.

320
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:58,120
 And so, you know, this actually kind of goes, this is one of the things I'm going to be talking about at the Oregon Ghost Conference on March 24th in Seaside, Oregon.

321
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:05,120
 I actually didn't plan on doing this pitch, but we're going to be talking about how the soul may look different than the body.

322
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,120
 I think a lot of people agree with that, but does that change how you'll haunt as a ghost?

323
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,120
 So I'll put information in the show notes about that.

324
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,120
 I'm giving a presentation at the Oregon Ghost Conference on March 24th, 2023.

325
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:32,120
 But, you know, I talk about that theoretically in that presentation I'll be giving, but to see your soul looking outside of your body, like again, this is totally un-categorizable.

326
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:38,120
 Now, obviously, the story could be made up. That could be why it just doesn't fit any pattern. All of these stories could be made up.

327
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:43,120
 I think most of them are not. I'd say a good chunk of them are not.

328
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:50,120
 Is it ghost? Is it astral projection with the smaller version of herself?

329
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:56,120
 And then really, it really opens up a whole can of worms. Where does that Venn diagram exist?

330
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:05,120
 I would say ghosts and astral projection. They're two different phenomenon, but they're closer than, say, ghosts and aliens.

331
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:21,120
 And I think, you know what I mean? There are connections between these things. And it would be interesting if she woke up and she recognized this, like, let's say it was her great aunt that she always went over to her house every Sunday to have Mickey Mouse pancakes.

332
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:29,120
 And the great aunt passed away three months ago, and then one day she woke up and a great aunt was floating around in the room, and a tiny version of her was sitting next to her.

333
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:36,120
 And that would make sense. That fictional, totally fictional thing I just made up would make sense.

334
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:47,120
 And you could classify it. But she doesn't recognize the woman. It's not supposed to be there. It's a ghost or a spirit of some sort.

335
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:55,120
 Then, and as far as I can tell, she's never seen this thing again. She hasn't talked anymore about seeing this phantom. It was like a one-time thing.

336
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:09,120
 It happened when she was nine. It happened years and years ago. Then she sees a tinier version of herself with this ghost, or whatever it was, that has now followed her into another room.

337
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:18,120
 Is it ghost? Is it astral projection? If it's astral projection, what's the ghost doing with the tiny Molly?

338
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:27,120
 Fascinating story. So many questions. I said in the beginning to ghosts to keep humans as pets, because I imagine little Molly is a little pet of this ghost.

339
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:34,120
 How terrifying would it be? I mean, it's already bad enough. There are demons out there trying to steal your soul.

340
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:41,120
 But if we also have to just be aware of the regular old ghost, I guess that's another thing. It could have been demonic.

341
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:49,120
 But again, it's not like she was like we had a lot of poltergeist activity in this house. It was just like a one-off thing, which again makes it bizarre.

342
00:20:49,120 --> 00:21:01,120
 That's why I love covering the obscure stuff on this show. Because this is just so weird. Even for people like us, people who love the world of the paranormal, who've been studying it.

343
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:07,120
 Maybe this is your first year of being interested in the paranormal. Maybe, like me, you've been doing it for decades.

344
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:17,120
 You can still find weird stuff like this. What is this story about? Absolutely fascinating story. I don't have any answers for it. What was it? Who knows?

345
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:26,120
 Crazy, crazy story. Brian, let's go ahead and touch the keys to the carbonar copter. We were saying goodbye to Molly, the demon's all eating her soul.

346
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:35,120
 We're like, I don't know what it is. So we're just going to leave. Brian, go ahead and get the carbonar copter started. We are leaving behind this little girl's room, flying us all the way out, too.

347
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:46,120
 You know what? Actually, we don't have time for the insectoid story that I mentioned in the intro. We're going to do a quick audible. That's the term, right? To change. Does an audible mean to like change stuff?

348
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:54,120
 I also know it means like the football, right? You call an audible and that means we're going to change everything. I don't know. I don't know.

349
00:21:54,120 --> 00:22:05,120
 But anyways, we're pulling an audible, Super Bowl, Super Bowl related. We're pulling an audible. Brian, stay away from that fascinating insectoid story. We'll save it for another day.

350
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,120
 Fly us all the way out to Crystal City, Missouri.

351
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:32,120
 We're heading out to Crystal City, Missouri. We are about to check out Jason seriously. We're waiting this whole time for insectoids. We're waiting this whole time for a teenage boy setting up an old person's computer and then an insectoid to show up.

352
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:49,120
 And now we're headed to the very last Kmart in the state of Missouri. That's just... That's just as cool. Come on, guys. I can tell this story in 10, 15 minutes. I couldn't tell the other story in that amount of time.

353
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:58,120
 All that UAP talk, UFO Alaska stuff, cut down on the time. But anyways, the last Kmart. I'm like, come on, kids. Isn't this just as cool as Disneyland?

354
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:09,120
 We're standing in the parking lot of the very last Kmart in Missouri. No, it's not even that. It's not even that anymore. They ended up shutting it down in 2018.

355
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:20,120
 So now we're standing just in pretty much an abandoned parking lot. I'm like, there, kids. There once stood the very last Kmart in Missouri.

356
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:34,120
 The reason why we're here, I was on the Shadowlands.net looking up ghost stories. Looking up some really cool stuff. And I came across this odd entry for the Crystal City Kmart.

357
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:48,120
 They said over the years, a lot of stuff, a lot of, if you can imagine this, put on your conspiracy cap. A lot of bad stuff has happened in this Kmart parking lot, including murders, kidnapping, shootings.

358
00:23:48,120 --> 00:24:03,120
 And what people have said is they go, the parking lot, the parking lot in particular is the haunted part. When this Kmart still existed, they said, sometimes late at night when you were out on the parking lot of a Kmart,

359
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:13,120
 you're ready to suspend disbelief, sometimes late at night when you're out in the parking lot of a Kmart, you'll hear gunshots. You'll hear people firing guns, phantom gunshots, though.

360
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:22,120
 You can never tell where it was coming from. Every show I often do to hear a screaming girl in the distance. I mean, these are basically things that just happen at any Kmart, right?

361
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:31,120
 I'm reading this and I was like, screaming people in the distance. They said that when you're sitting in your car in the parking lot of headlights may blind you.

362
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:50,120
 I was like, this is every single Kmart parking lot ever. Gunfire, screaming headlights. But I was laughing when I was reading this, I go, really, you're scraping the bottom of the bucket when you're putting this into a haunted database like theshadillands.net,

363
00:24:50,120 --> 00:25:01,120
 which is where I found it at. And I continued to look because I was having a ball at this point making fun of Kmart. I started looking around and sure enough there were other haunted sightings in the Kmart.

364
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:11,120
 A boy ghost and a girl ghost, the boy ghost would play with a ball. Ball would be rolling through the store and you would just hear the girl laughing.

365
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:25,120
 And it's crazy to think that the Kmart shut down now. Do those spirits still linger there? Was there a period of time, or maybe even today, that the building is just dilapidated?

366
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:34,120
 It's fallen apart, fixtures have collapsed, and it's in perpetual darkness and there's still a little boy rolling a ball down the aisle.

367
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:43,120
 But as I continued to look into this, I keep seeing these reports saying, you know, there's all this bad stuff that happened in this Kmart parking lot, and that's why we think it's haunted.

368
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:52,120
 People have been shot here, and then they said, and then Diana Jane Brongart was kidnapped.

369
00:25:52,120 --> 00:26:01,120
 And I thought, okay, this is interestingly specific. Who is this person? Is this a true story?

370
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:09,120
 In 1987, this was a venture store. I guess it was another chain of stores, but this was before it was a Kmart.

371
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:20,120
 And there was a young high school senior working there named Diana Jane Brongart. She was 18 years old, and it was her shift on March 11th, 1987.

372
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:34,120
 She had to test the next day, so she's like, hey guys, I'm done with my shift. I'm gonna go home, I'm gonna stay there for the test. I really, really hope that I pass it.

373
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:48,120
 That happened at 10pm by 1030 in the nearby town of Festus, which is the disgusting, don't want to name me, I don't care if that's named after the founder of your city, Festus, Missouri.

374
00:26:48,120 --> 00:27:01,120
 It's a couple minutes away. That's where Diana lived with her parents. It's 1030pm. They know she got off at 10, and Diana is so punctual.

375
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:12,120
 It's only a half hour since she left her work that her parents began searching for her. Her mom is making phone calls to all of her friends. That's how punctual she is.

376
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:30,120
 It's interesting to note everyone should be like that, not just because it personally annoys me when people are late, but in case you go missing, in case you go missing, if you're one of those people that can be three hours late and people go, that's good old Andy,

377
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:39,120
 if you ever get kidnapped, you're gonna be tied up in the backseat of a car and they're gonna be hitting you with crowbars and they have a clock set right there.

378
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:47,120
 And you go, oh my god, people aren't even gonna start looking for me until three hours of crowbar related injuries.

379
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,120
 And it's only one minute as past, you're like, oh, it's gonna be a long afternoon.

380
00:27:51,120 --> 00:28:00,120
 She was so punctual they began searching for her right away. The dad is driving all over town looking for her. The mom's calling up all of her friends.

381
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:09,120
 When the dad swings by the Kmart, they see her car sitting there.

382
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:15,120
 Police are called pretty much the next day. The parents are still holding out hope.

383
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:21,120
 Investigation starts and the police believe she never made it to her car.

384
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,120
 The police believe that at some point walking across this Kmart parking lot, she was snatched up.

385
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:35,120
 And to this day, Diana has never been seen again.

386
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:43,120
 Both of her parents passed away. I think her dad died in 2015 and her mom died in 2017, which you know, absolutely tragic, right?

387
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,120
 You never know what happened to your daughter. You die not knowing.

388
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:56,120
 Her brother has continued kind of bringing attention to the case, but Diana has never been found.

389
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:06,120
 And that's a true missing person story. When I was reading it, because I found it after researching ghost stuff, I go, what if a ghost got her?

390
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,120
 What if a ghost snatched her out of this Kmart parking lot?

391
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:20,120
 The police do not appreciate that story. If you call them up, if you call up the Crystal City Police Department and tell them you think it was a ghost, they will hang up on you.

392
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:31,120
 I didn't actually do that, but they actually talked to, there was a couple of witnesses and the employees of the store said, yeah, there was this guy who was kind of hanging around longer than his transaction.

393
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:43,120
 We thought that was a little weird. And then a woman changing a baby's diaper in the parking lot around a little bit after 10 p.m. said she saw that girl, because eventually the missing person posters went up.

394
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:49,120
 She saw that girl talking to a man, but she didn't think anything of it, right? You just see two people talking in the parking lot.

395
00:29:49,120 --> 00:30:00,120
 And police believe it's that man for two reasons. One, they did a police sketch and both the people described the same man, the employees of the store.

396
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:08,120
 And the woman changing the poopy diaper. And that man is also responsible for the kidnapping and murders.

397
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:18,120
 The kidnapping and murder of at least one woman he was found guilty of, two other women have gone missing, not including Diana, that have been linked to this guy, his name.

398
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:24,120
 It's interesting how to dig his name up, because a lot of people weren't reporting his name because he was just a suspect, even though he was in prison.

399
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:35,120
 His name is Marvin Chaney, but even that break in the case didn't come till 2007. Nobody knows where Diana is at.

400
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,120
 She's probably dead.

401
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:46,120
 And the reason why I wanted to tell that story, just to pull me up for a Monday, I normally don't do true crime stuff on Monday.

402
00:30:46,120 --> 00:31:05,120
 The reason why I wanted to tell you that story is that so we do have a historical connection to listen, man, if a woman went missing in your Kmart parking lot, you should be hyper aware, not just because of you're afraid of a spooky ghost getting you or a headlight, phantom headlights blinding you, but because a woman got abducted in your parking lot.

403
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:17,120
 The other person that he, this Marvin guy, was him and his brother, the other person that they got convicted of raping and murdering was a woman working out like a convenience store.

404
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:26,120
 And she called her son up and said, "Hey, there's some sketchy guys standing outside the convenience store." And the son got in his car and got there about 10 minutes later and she was gone.

405
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:33,120
 That's who they got convicted of, so this seemed to be their MO, picking clerks up outside of stores.

406
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:42,120
 So, I mean, you should be hyper aware. You should be in fear at all times. No, not that, but you should be aware, especially if there was a kidnapping in that area.

407
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:51,120
 But I wanted to talk about it like this. We're going to wrap this episode up like this. This wasn't just a true crime story with a little bit of ghost parking lot stuff.

408
00:31:51,120 --> 00:32:01,120
 I wonder how, we talked about this before on the show, the Hood River Walmart is haunted, where I live, Hood River. I know that Walmart's haunted.

409
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:15,120
 We've talked about haunted retail stores a couple times on this show. Is it possible that a retail establishment is the perfect place to hunt?

410
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:23,120
 It does seem that there needs to be some sort of energy that the spirit can call upon.

411
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:32,120
 Like an orphanage, a school, a playhouse, a theater, those type of places tend to have a lot of ghosts. It could be because people are telling spooky stories to each other,

412
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:42,120
 but it could also be that there's so much raw emotional energy being generated in a high school, in a theater, that would cause this.

413
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:48,120
 Not just that as someone fell off the balcony and broke their neck. That helps where the ghost.

414
00:32:48,120 --> 00:33:07,120
 But the thing about what happens on a daily basis in a store like a Walmart or a Kmart, every day this happens, you have people walking in to go buy cards for their loved ones who are sick or suffering or who just had experienced a deep loss.

415
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:19,120
 And they're walking right past people, also going to the stationery department to buy cards for a new baby being born, or birthday.

416
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:30,120
 You're having all of this positive and negative energy just flowing through the store. You have children getting toys for their birthday.

417
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:43,120
 You have people in the pharmacy getting medicine for the sick. People piling out of a car to go grab snacks and drinks for a road trip they've looked forward to for months.

418
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:54,120
 As another person trudges past them to the automotive department, because they have to replace the passenger side tail light for the fourth time this year.

419
00:33:54,120 --> 00:34:01,120
 They are basically machines of just generating raw energy, positive and negative.

420
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:12,120
 We're not even talking about the employees, the employees that love their job, the employees that stand back and look at their department and go, "Man, I really like the way my department looks.

421
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:19,120
 Sales are good. The customers are happy. I love working here." And then the people who just would rather be anywhere else.

422
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:28,120
 Like literally anywhere else. The only reason they're there is because they have to work and this is the place that would hire them.

423
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,120
 Or this is the place that was closest to them.

424
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:40,120
 Just right, you couldn't have, like a small country store, like a little convenience store, you wouldn't have this level of energy.

425
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:46,120
 You don't have enough people coming in and you don't have the variety of energy, right?

426
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:54,120
 People stop at a gas station, get a couple of snacks, fill the gas up, buy a lot of a e-ticket. You'll still get energy generated in there.

427
00:34:54,120 --> 00:35:02,120
 But these huge retail establishments, these big box stores, are just generating so much of it.

428
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:08,120
 So you wonder, like, over time will we see more haunted retail establishments?

429
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:24,120
 There are more than a few now, but since they've basically replaced the town square of America, since these are the places where people interact with each other on grand scales outside of, like, local firework displays or parades,

430
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:32,120
 will the future ghost stories be told not in the haunted graveyards or on the outskirts of town where nobody goes anymore?

431
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:39,120
 But the retail stores, the big box stores, will over the decades, these become the no-unhaunted spots.

432
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:46,120
 They're not as awesome to look at as a spooky graveyard at 3 AM on the edge of town as the mist rolls in.

433
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:52,120
 But the ghosts are going to manifest where the ghosts can manifest.

434
00:35:52,120 --> 00:36:04,120
 And we may see this spectral activity leave the outskirts of the cities and come into the retail establishments. It's a bizarre theory. It's a bizarre theory, sure.

435
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:16,120
 But it's one that I think we should think of because there is just so much raw emotional energy and true life trauma, true crime deaths and murders and shootings and kidnappings,

436
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:31,120
 mixed with every minute of every day raw emotional energy that these spirits can pull off of to manifest themselves when you have these two factors colliding into each other.

437
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:42,120
 When you have these things combined, strong emotions, both positive and negative, and these retail establishments are the sites of people dying.

438
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:54,120
 You do have the true crime, you do have the murders, the kidnappings, the sexual assaults, all of that happening in the parking lot, around the store, and sometimes even in the store, right?

439
00:36:54,120 --> 00:37:07,120
 And then you have customers dying. I know at the local Walmart here in Hood River, it's more than one customer has died in the store or had a massive health problem and had seizures in the middle of the store.

440
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:14,120
 These things happen because so many people are going to them constantly, they are like the town square.

441
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:24,120
 So people are dying there and they're able to gather all of this emotional energy. It's just sitting there waiting to be used.

442
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:47,120
 It's insane and I think that over time, these big box stores will become the haunted hotspots. They're not as creepy. They're not as creepy as the graveyard or the abandoned house, but those places, the emotional energy is diminishing over time.

443
00:37:47,120 --> 00:38:07,120
 The last person who was buried in that graveyard was 100 years ago. Families aren't even visiting anymore. And the problem with this is, is on the one hand, if you have a ghost hunting television show, it's way better to, for camera, especially, to go to the spooky asylum, walk around looking for a ghost,

 but from what we know of ghosts, the energy does dissipate over time. These retail stores, these big box stores are having more and more people recharge the energy because they're there all the time, employees and customers, and more people are dying in them.

445
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:44,120
 I know that's not a super common thing, but unlike the spooky house on the edge of town, these stores are constantly being replenished. So while it may not be as cinematic as going to an old timey asylum to look for ghosts, these big box stores, K-Marts and Walmart and Targets and all of these places may become the haunted

446
00:38:44,120 --> 00:39:00,120
 graveyards of the future. These may be the places where there is more haunting activity, more poltergeist activity, more spectral manifestations than anywhere else, because it is constantly being recharged with energy.

447
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:14,120
 And here's the thing, we have long been taught to avoid the abandoned house at the edge of the street, or to stay away from crybaby bridges, or the darkened asylum, the lonely cemetery.

448
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:31,120
 We've been told to stay away from these places because these spirits may follow us back home. We may be inviting ourselves up to demonic infestation. We ourselves may bring a haunting away from these locations back with us.

449
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:46,120
 But we can't avoid a good deal, even if you knew your local Walmart was haunted, it still has the best price on Dorito chips. You can always get a six pack of Coca-Cola to go with them.

450
00:39:46,120 --> 00:40:07,120
 We've long been warned of messing with the supernatural and going to their turf. But if the newest places where these spirits can manifest far easier, because they're feeding off of all of that energy that's constantly flowing into the store,

451
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:18,120
 the next time you go shopping at your favorite big box retailer, you may be bringing home more than a bargain.

452
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:29,120
 You may be bringing home the ghost of an old lady who died of a heart attack in the fabrics and crafts section.

453
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:39,120
 Have fun installing your flat screen television and right before you turn it on, you see an old woman banging from the inside, "I'm going to get you when you're asleep!"

454
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:45,120
 You're like, "Wow, this is a really cool demo! It looks so lifelike! Hey honey, look at this! Come check this out!"

455
00:40:45,120 --> 00:41:05,120
 I'm going to do the color volume, she's turning purple, she's like, "I'm even madder now!" Who knows, right? You don't go to the spooky graveyard because you don't want to invite a demon home with you, but if the spirits are at the places where we shop, you may have no choice.

456
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:23,120
 Every time you go to a big box store, you may be bringing home a spirit. Okay, maybe not every time! You're like, "Oh man, there's like 50 ghosts in your house!" You're like, "Oh man, what do I keep shopping there?"

457
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:31,120
 There's like, phantom children running around and there's like a phantom school teacher and the old lady's still trapped in your television set and you're trying to play video games.

458
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:39,120
 She's all making her guy do crazy moves, she's like, "How do these video games work?" Oh my kids, they always waste of time to keep shutting it off.

459
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:45,120
 She keeps shutting off the television, you're like, "Ahhhhh!" You're pulling your hair out, "Oh, why do I keep shopping there?" You're like, "Oh!"

460
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:53,120
 Because the deals are so good, I don't know, it's just a theory. So maybe not every time. Maybe, maybe honestly, maybe not any time, it's just a theory.

461
00:41:53,120 --> 00:42:04,120
