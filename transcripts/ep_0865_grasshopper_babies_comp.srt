1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,400
 Has an insane man discovered the way to guarantee a ghost is left behind when you die?

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:15,640
 Then we travel to a small town to meet a young man whose life is kind of on the skids.

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,480
 Things just really aren't working out for him.

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,800
 So when he's taken a little vacation in between jobs to hang out with his friend and his friend's

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,760
 family, he's hoping it'll be a nice quiet getaway.

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:35,760
 But turns out he's about to get into a bar brawl with the cryptic today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:43,520
 [Music]

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,520
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,600
 I'm your host Jason Garvener, I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,920
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,600
 We got a ton of stuff to cover so we're gonna get started right away.

12
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,160
 First off, coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our legacy Patreon supporters

13
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,160
 walking in.

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,160
 Give it up for Mikhail Malone.

15
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,160
 Woo!

16
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,240
 Everyone give him a big round of applause, voice them up on your shoulders.

17
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,720
 He has a fear of heights, that's why we're doing that.

18
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,960
 Mikhail, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

19
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,360
 If you guys can't support the Patreon and totally understand, just help spread the word

20
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,360
 about this show.

21
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,000
 That really, really helps out a lot.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,480
 And just a quick reminder, May 14th, I will have this.

23
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,600
 I built this up like it's some giant thing.

24
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,600
 It is.

25
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,680
 I will be at the McMinnimin's UFO Festival.

26
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,800
 It's the second largest UFO festival in the United States, but who's counting?

27
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,640
 In McMinnville, Oregon.

28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,640
 That is where I'm gonna be at.

29
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,280
 I'm not a speaker, but I'll have a vendors table.

30
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,280
 So I'll be out there.

31
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,440
 I'm gonna have a little museum of some haunted items.

32
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,920
 We're gonna have Mikhail Malone on the tallest ladder in the city just to watch him freak

33
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,920
 out.

34
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,520
 And yeah, come on down.

35
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,520
 Check it out.

36
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,360
 Meet me.

37
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,000
 And look at some haunted stuff that I've collected over the years.

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,400
 Assuming again, there's a big, there's a big flaw to my plan.

39
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,320
 I have to transport a bunch of haunted and/or cursed items.

40
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,240
 Several hours.

41
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,720
 Several hours on a road trip.

42
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:12,360
 So I mean, assuming the car doesn't blow up into flames or get abducted by aliens or

43
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,440
 we get possessed by ghosts along the way, who knows?

44
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,000
 But assuming we're able to make it there safe and sound with a menagerie, I think we'll

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,520
 be safe because I have all of these haunted items in my apartment.

46
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:28,200
 And even though I'm constantly suffering from these really weird medical problems, I will

47
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,200
 be there.

48
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,600
 Assuming that I'm still alive, I will be there on May 14th, 2022.

49
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,720
 Check out the vendors area and meet your favorite paranormal podcaster.

50
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,720
 Me.

51
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,720
 Hopefully.

52
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,000
 You're like, "Aw man, I thought ArtPel was gonna be here.

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,600
 I thought his ghost is gonna float around."

54
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,480
 Anyways, that was kind of a bummer way to end my promo.

55
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,120
 Mikhail, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

56
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,680
 We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

57
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,840
 We're headed all the way out to Southern California.

58
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,800
 There's no haunted items in this car because this car is not insured.

59
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,480
 I definitely don't want to get a car accident in the Jason Jalopy.

60
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,960
 We're headed down to Southern California.

61
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,600
 I believe it's been so long since we visited this man.

62
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,040
 I believe he's still in Santa Monica, but I don't have that in my notes.

63
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,600
 I've covered this guy a lot.

64
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,400
 I'll put the episode in the show notes.

65
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:27,520
 It's everyone's favorite homeless video game designer who wants to wear your skin and attack

66
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,680
 your children.

67
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,680
 Give it up.

68
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,320
 Dude, I don't want to applaud for this guy.

69
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,320
 He is a lunatic.

70
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
 He is a lunatic.

71
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,920
 We're not gonna give him a round of applause, but we're gonna drive through, again, Santa

72
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,920
 Monica, I think.

73
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,160
 We're just gonna walk up to a random hobo and be like, "Are you the video game designer?"

74
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,480
 He's like, "I'm whatever you want for five bucks."

75
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,000
 We're like, "Oh, okay."

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 So Max Kramer, he is a homeless video game designer who is just, he's gone insane, but

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,520
 he also knew how, and he's still alive.

78
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,040
 We have, I have so much more to cover about him.

79
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,280
 I've really been spacing it out because I don't want to just do this dude.

80
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,280
 I got other stuff.

81
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,920
 I got Ghosts and Alien Invasion and stuff to talk about.

82
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:12,520
 Max Kramer's still alive and he did have a pretty big web presence with his Jewish car

83
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,880
 machine website.

84
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,560
 He believes, and in short, that we're all in the simulation.

85
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,480
 Well, he's in the simulation.

86
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,480
 We're all NPC character.

87
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,160
 This is a very common conspiracy theory.

88
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,880
 But to be fair, he was one of the first people to be, to be screaming this theory out on

89
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,200
 the street corner.

90
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,040
 He believes that he's one of the few actual player characters, blah, blah, blah, blah,

91
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,040
 blah.

92
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,040
 We got a bunch of episodes on him.

93
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,040
 I'll put him in the show notes.

94
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,320
 The reason why I want to talk about him here is because it's not just, we're not just gonna

95
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,480
 look at some of his crazy rantings, we will.

96
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
 Right?

97
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,760
 I found this super bizarre connection.

98
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:51,040
 I've been doing a bunch of research lately and while I was researching it, I kept going

99
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,040
 back to this particular set of weirdo stuff.

100
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,080
 And let's go over a couple of them I have here.

101
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,880
 Oh, and I want to give a shout out to Oogs.

102
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,280
 Oogs is the person who originally sent me the Max Kramer stuff.

103
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,480
 So thank you so much for sending it over Oogs.

104
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,920
 He said he has these random thoughts things and I found a couple that were funny or weird

105
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,880
 and recently due to recent research I've been doing, one of them is just, ugh, it's terrifying.

106
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:23,520
 But let's look at one of the weird ones first and strap in because this weird one is, okay,

107
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,520
 so here we go.

108
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,640
 This is one of his random thoughts.

109
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,280
 I know I have odd random thoughts, right?

110
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,880
 But this one, this is one of his random thoughts.

111
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:45,840
 What if a female sex organ of an insect was, you're like, just stop, I don't want to hear

112
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,000
 what a crazy homeless person, I don't want to hear the rest of that sentence.

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,480
 I don't want to know what a crazy homeless person thinks about female sex organ of an

114
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:19,000
 insect, you're like, nope, I'll be back tomorrow, click.

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:29,520
 That is important for the rest of the sentence, I don't know.

116
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:39,040
 What if a female sex organ of an insect was transplanted into a male human's body to give

117
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:45,560
 birth, you stuck around that long and you're like, nope, still don't want to know, you

118
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,080
 came back from the podcast and you're like, oh maybe this is a short segment, nope.

119
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:55,280
 What if a female sex organ of an insect was transplanted into a male human's body to give

120
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:01,160
 birth to grasshoppers?

121
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,960
 Would the offspring, let me stop right there, let me stop right there.

122
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:14,320
 The real question is, my random thought would be, first off, are bumblebees as succy as the

123
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,160
 loony toons made me believe?

124
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,120
 Secondly, I would go, how does a bug have babies?

125
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:26,320
 I'm assuming they lay eggs and I'm assuming the eggs come out of some sort of bug uterus,

126
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,320
 but I don't know.

127
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:33,480
 I've never cared to look it up, I've never ever concerned myself with this.

128
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:42,280
 What would happen if you took an insect's sex organ and put it into a human body, male

129
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:47,640
 or female, he specifies male, let's say I took a grasshopper's uterus and put it in

130
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,120
 a man.

131
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,520
 My first question would be, would that work?

132
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,360
 Could a dude be like, oh, nine months, nine months, he's like, come at you little darlings

133
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,520
 and then a bunch of little grasshoppers jump out of them?

134
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,480
 You choose the body part that they're coming out of, but would that work?

135
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,680
 Would the human body be able to provide the nutrients?

136
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,840
 Clearly not, Jason, clearly not, but what if you put it in just the right spot?

137
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,760
 What if you took it out of the grasshopper right before the eggs were coming out?

138
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,200
 Maybe two or three eggs had already popped out and then you like slide it into a dude's

139
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
 armpit.

140
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:28,200
 These two in fart noises, with his armpit and eggs are shooting out?

141
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,360
 That would be my question, is could you do it?

142
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,440
 Could you possibly get a grasshopper uterus put into a human male and have it still be

143
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,440
 viable?

144
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,360
 That would be my question.

145
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,800
 And to me, if someone asked that question, I would be like, well, I don't know.

146
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,360
 I don't know, and let's never find out the answer.

147
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
 Let's not look it up.

148
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,680
 I don't want to see photos of this.

149
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,480
 But that's not Max Kramer's answer, and I might have more abnormal thoughts than like

150
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,400
 say the average person, the NPC, you non-player characters, not you.

151
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,280
 You're one of the good guys, you're one of the players, but so the rest of those normies

152
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,200
 out there, they would never think of a disgusting thing like that.

153
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,400
 So would it be viable, would be my question, from like a scientific slash weirdo point of

154
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,400
 view?

155
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,040
 That's not even, Max Kramer just assumes that it's viable.

156
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,960
 That's not even what Max Kramer's finished sentences.

157
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:27,720
 His whole thought is, what if a female sex organ of an insect was transplanted into a

158
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,760
 male human's body to give birth to grasshoppers?

159
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,160
 Would the offspring consider the male human to be female?

160
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,360
 As their mother?

161
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,240
 That is so weird.

162
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:51,200
 His question is whether or not it's scientifically possible or viable or how bugs have babies.

163
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,800
 It's would the baby grasshoppers think the man was a woman?

164
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,320
 That is an interesting question.

165
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,040
 We can't only a mad man would ever figure it out.

166
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,720
 Would the grasshoppers instinctively think, oh this must be a woman because I came out

167
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,600
 of them.

168
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,880
 So I mean to say stuff like that's weird, that's bizarre, that's insane, it's almost

169
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,720
 underselling it, right?

170
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,240
 And he actually, I guess I probably should have given you some more info in the beginning.

171
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,600
 He has this weird delusion that he thinks that people are constantly trying to turn

172
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:33,480
 him gay and that sexy black people are actually Asians in disguise trying to turn him gay.

173
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,160
 That's all, you'll find those episodes in the show notes and all over his website as

174
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,160
 well.

175
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,360
 So he has these weird sexual feelings to begin with.

176
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,960
 And I didn't think about that when I started thinking about putting a grasshopper uterus

177
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,120
 in a man.

178
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,800
 I think that's where he's coming from.

179
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,560
 How would this affect the man's sex or the way that people view the man?

180
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,160
 Would they view where the grasshoppers view was a woman?

181
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,400
 I mean that might be part of his sexual hang up as well.

182
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:08,840
 He's constantly talking about black dudes trying to trick him into having gay sex with them

183
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,560
 and then him finding out they're actually Asians.

184
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,280
 He's like, "Oh man!"

185
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,840
 But that, despite the fact that he talked about that for 10 minutes, that's not the

186
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,360
 reason why I really wanted to talk about him.

187
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,280
 That was entertaining in and of itself, but that was just one of his random weird facts.

188
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,680
 The reason why or, sorry, I misspoke.

189
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,680
 I misspoke.

190
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,320
 That was not a fact.

191
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,320
 That was not a fact.

192
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,600
 That was one of his thoughts.

193
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,640
 Please do not ever think, even though this is the number one science podcast in El Salvador,

194
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:41,600
 please do not ever think that I once said it is a fact that you can remove one that

195
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,720
 insects have uteruses, but two that you can remove it, put it into a man and it would

196
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,720
 give birth.

197
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,720
 Not a fact.

198
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,440
 A thought of his, not mine.

199
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,200
 But then, here's another one that he came up with.

200
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,200
 And I read it.

201
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,600
 I read like this grasshopper one.

202
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,040
 I've had these sitting in my files for like three or four months, because I was like,

203
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,040
 "Yeah, it's weird stuff, but you gotta find a good place to put it."

204
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,320
 Like, are you gonna put it in the armpit?

205
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,760
 Or are you just gonna leave it in the grasshopper?

206
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,960
 And I left it in the grasshopper.

207
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,640
 I just had it sitting here for a while.

208
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,840
 And then recently, I've been going to this website called Shadowlands.net, which is just

209
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,920
 a ton of ghost stories, because I think the show needs more ghost stories.

210
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,200
 We just don't have enough ghost stories on the show.

211
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,520
 So I've been really aggressive about finding ghost stories.

212
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:30,280
 I'm just talking about training grasshoppers then, because I noticed when I was going through,

213
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,760
 I was just starting alphabetically.

214
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,640
 So I'm going through Alabama's, all these hauntings and things like that.

215
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,000
 A lot of hangings.

216
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,720
 A lot of hangings down there, a lot of racially, you know, charged hangings, a lot of Ku Klux

217
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,600
 Clan, a lot of Southern lynching of Black men.

218
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,920
 There's a lot of hanging ghosts in Alabama.

219
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,600
 And that should really, I mean, just through the numbers and through the tragic history

220
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,800
 of that state, should come as no surprise.

221
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,760
 So I'm reading these and I was like, you know, hanging ghosts, hanging ghosts, hanging ghosts.

222
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,880
 I was just reading so many of them, but I was like, that's pretty common.

223
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,440
 I've talked about hanging ghosts out on Dyer Lane in California.

224
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,680
 I've never seen one, but in California, we had, because lynching was also just mob justice

225
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:22,000
 and hanging people, executing people by hanging has been an official mode of killing people

226
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,640
 for probably since the invention of the rope.

227
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:31,280
 So Alabama just had them back to back to back all of these, you know, Ku Klux Clan hangings.

228
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,280
 They're just popping up.

229
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:37,200
 So, but I started to think about just 30 years of paranormal research I've been doing.

230
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,080
 I'm like, this is not uncommon.

231
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,040
 Hanging ghosts is very, very, very.

232
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,880
 And you think about it because you have a lot of times it's an injustice, right?

233
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,960
 It's a mob doing it.

234
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:53,560
 But even when it's a state run execution, there's still just such a tragedy of grabbing

235
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,760
 someone dragging them into the tree and hanging them because it's so, so let.

236
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,800
 So this is what's super interesting about that.

237
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,960
 That's actually a great segue for what I'm getting at.

238
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:10,080
 Max Kramer says this quote, the historical execution of people hanging seems to be a

239
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,960
 way for the executioners to be respectful of God.

240
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:21,520
 As if it is as though the victim, one of God's creations, is sent back to him dangling on

241
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:29,560
 a rope, a metaphor of a baby and its umbilical cord.

242
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,720
 And I saw that.

243
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,400
 I put it, that's gonna be my new thing for my notes.

244
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,120
 I put it in the grasshopper, put it in the grasshopper uterus.

245
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,120
 I saw that.

246
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,240
 I clipped that out with a bunch of other random thoughts, put it away.

247
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:46,160
 But when I was reading all of these hangings, all of these lynchings, right, in Alabama,

248
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,280
 where they're using the tree, they're using the tree out in front of the plantation, they're

249
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,720
 using the tree on the edge of the forest, they're using the tree, they're using the

250
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,720
 tree.

251
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,520
 And people to this day say you can go down there and sometimes you'll see a body hanging

252
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,520
 from the tree.

253
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:04,600
 I started to think about it and I go, not necessarily that Max Kramer was right, but

254
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,120
 he might be more right than even he thinks.

255
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:15,600
 There may be something actually to the act of hanging that seems to bond the body to

256
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
 the location.

257
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,360
 There do seem to be a couple of caveats.

258
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:25,160
 It seems to be related to people being hung from a tree or in a place of residence.

259
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,880
 And you go, Jason, where else would you hang somebody from?

260
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:36,080
 Well, this is, I don't, I don't, maybe, maybe I ate too many bagels this morning and I'm

261
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,320
 in a carb fog.

262
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,040
 But I'm thinking this is so interesting because the state, right, when the government wants

263
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:50,480
 to hang you, they build a scaffold and they hang you, they'll then disassemble the scaffold.

264
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,480
 It's like the whole part of the construction of the scaffold is part of the process of executing.

265
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,240
 And it's very, very creepy to watch this thing be built over the matter of days.

266
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,400
 You know, obviously, like the sentence has been rendered, you know, the date of execution

267
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,920
 and you would sit there in your jail cell in your old time in Western town as they're

268
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,200
 building a scaffold.

269
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,540
 Now when Europe, they might have, because they had, you know, they had these magnificent

270
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,120
 cities and stuff like that, they may have had, I know they had like hanging squares

271
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,120
 and things like that.

272
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,960
 But even then, I don't think you would keep the scaffold up all the time.

273
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,840
 You weren't hanging people every single day.

274
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,040
 So you wouldn't be like, well, you know, I really liked, I really liked you to have

275
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,040
 your vendor booth, but you know, the scaffold and they're like crows are constantly picking

276
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,600
 at it and they're getting like pieces of flesh out of the twine of the rope.

277
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,800
 I'm pretty sure they disassembled those as well.

278
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,960
 But yeah, when the state does it, they'll build the scaffold and then they'll remove

279
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:50,040
 it and there's nothing for the ghost to attach itself to.

280
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,640
 But when you're hanging someone from a tree that is alive, you're using this living thing

281
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,360
 to take a human life.

282
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,880
 It's sucking the energy in.

283
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:07,120
 It's taking the form of this man who, again, in a lot of cases, unjustly hung.

284
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,520
 It's just leaving that mark, leaving that psychic mark.

285
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:17,480
 And in a house as well, it would make sense that a haunting would hang around in a house

286
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,000
 because it is a place full of life as well.

287
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,280
 It could also already be full of a lot of chaotic energy and it's tapping into that

288
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,280
 as well.

289
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,320
 And then, for the state execution method, the scaffold disappears, there'd be no way

290
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,840
 for the ghost to appear.

291
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,600
 So just an interesting thing and we do see so many hanging ghosts.

292
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:43,920
 What's interesting is when you look at ghost lore in general, when a lot of times when

293
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:50,120
 like kids die, or this is a really cheery episode for Monday, but kids die, people get shot,

294
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,120
 stabbed.

295
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,880
 Sometimes the hauntings are left behind with a final scream.

296
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,800
 You know, someone gets stabbed to death, you'll hear like a scream at three in the morning

297
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,400
 every so often the woman's getting stabbed to death and stuff like that.

298
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,760
 But a lot of times you'll, someone will jump off the top of a building, die, and then they'll

299
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,280
 see her ghost walking through the hallway.

300
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:15,280
 Or kids will drown in the pool and then you'll see phantoms of the kids running around the

301
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,280
 pool.

302
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,920
 It's never the kid floating in the pool dead.

303
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:31,640
 But with a hanging, they are almost always still hanging as a ghost.

304
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,760
 People burned to death, are seen sitting in their favorite chair, people poisoned, are

305
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,560
 seen looking out the window.

306
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:45,560
 But people who are hung are often seen, their ghosts are often seen still hanging.

307
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,280
 And I never ever ever really considered that until today.

308
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,880
 When I was doing all this research and reading all, I mean it's just such a tragic history,

309
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,040
 right, of the south of these issues with people getting hung.

310
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,880
 I'm reading all of this stuff and I'm kind of putting this all together and while I was

311
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:07,160
 reading that I was remembering Max Kramer's thought.

312
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:15,880
 Maybe the act of hanging, there's something about it that is, it is so cradle to grave.

313
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,640
 We all have an umbilical cord, right?

314
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,440
 We are all coming out of our moms, not our breast-offer moms, but we're all coming out

315
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,080
 of our moms.

316
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,200
 We all are attached with an umbilical cord.

317
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,880
 Cisarian, whatever, however you're popping out.

318
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,520
 I'm not going to discriminate against you.

319
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,520
 What?

320
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,520
 Oh man, that's a Cisarian baby.

321
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,960
 Don't hire her.

322
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,200
 But the umbilical cord, I'm wondering if the cord is severed and we come to life and then

323
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,720
 the cord remains as we die.

324
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,720
 Is there a connection between that, between the life and the death?

325
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,600
 It's so perfectly mirrored.

326
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,760
 It's scary how perfectly it's mirrored.

327
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:02,160
 And they always say, right, people who are insane, sometimes they can see past the universe,

328
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,040
 they can see past the rules that we all set up, that we all follow physics in a certain

329
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,880
 way, we follow this, da-da-da-da-da.

330
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,920
 But then people say that, but then you meet people like Max Kramer who wants to wear your

331
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,800
 skin and sneak into your house and do horrible things to your children.

332
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:22,840
 And you're quickly reminded that insane people sometimes are just completely insane.

333
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,200
 And they say insane things.

334
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,040
 But maybe they're half right.

335
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:31,920
 Maybe while they're doing these horrible things to your family, someone like Max Kramer

336
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:37,760
 is so insane he can just ramble for so long that eventually he says something that's so

337
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:44,520
 profound and so terrifying that most of us just missed it.

338
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:52,160
 The act of hanging could be the complete opposite of birth.

339
00:20:52,160 --> 00:21:01,520
 And that is why when people die hanging, for the most part, their ghosts are still hanging.

340
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:08,240
 Because if you're going to be a ghost, that might be the worst.

341
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,640
 I once said being a bathroom ghost is the worst.

342
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,280
 There was a ghost in a Burger King bathroom somewhere in California.

343
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,240
 I said this might be the worst haunting.

344
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,920
 The worst place to be in a burger- empty, empty, empty, empty, empty, empty, empty, empty,
