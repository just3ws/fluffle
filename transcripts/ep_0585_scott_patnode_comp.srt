1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
 A dive bar in the Pacific Northwest may hold more than just the best fish and chips you'll ever eat.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,500
 And then we take a look at the story of a man who wanted to be a superhero,

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,700
 but instead took the route of becoming a super villain.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,500
 When the governments of the world colluded to steal his technology,

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:26,000
 he decided the only way to fight back was to make people lose at family feud.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 I'm a wild freak down.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Actually, I'm a wild freak down.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,500
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,500
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Hope you guys are having a lot of fun this holiday season.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Alex.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Everyone give a round of applause to Alex.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 He's coming in on his brand new Segway scooter.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Are those still even being manufactured? Are they new?

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 He's doing wheelies and stuff. Weeeeee!

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,500
 Alex, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,500
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand that.

20
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,500
 Just hope spread the word about the show. That also really, really helps out a lot.

21
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,500
 Alex, as much as I'm tempted for everyone to climb on top of your back and you just segway us out to our first story,

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,500
 I'm going to toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

23
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,500
 You can drive us on out to Bellingham, Washington.

24
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,000
 We've been here recently. We covered the steam stack.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,500
 So I know you know how to get there, Alex. I'm driving down the road here.

26
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,500
 This story was actually recommended to me by Brady Schmidt.

27
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,500
 He really loved the steam stack story.

28
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,500
 He's like, "Oh yeah, brought back childhood memories of Bellingham, Washington."

29
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,500
 Doo-de-doo.

30
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,500
 He's the smelling of burned bodies like I was the one who put the body in there.

31
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,500
 If you guys are going to listen to that episode, I'll put it in the show notes.

32
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,500
 It's a pretty cool mystery, but Brady sent me this story about the same town up there.

33
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,500
 So Alex drives us up to the Waterfront Tavern.

34
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,500
 It's a little dive bar that surprisingly got four out of five stars.

35
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,500
 Long time listeners of the show know I love reading bad reviews.

36
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,500
 So when Brady sent me over this story about this bar, I was like,

37
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,500
 "Oh dude, the reviews are super disgusting."

38
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,500
 No, no, I'm disappointed to tell all you guys.

39
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,500
 It actually has really good service and food.

40
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,500
 Apparently it's the best fish and chips in town.

41
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,500
 People go, "Aw, man, you're like Jason, this has just become a food review podcast."

42
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,500
 I wish, but fish and chips, if you ever find yourself there, go check out the fish and chips.

43
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,500
 But as we walk into this tavern, we see a little booth.

44
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:34,500
 We sit down, we grab the menus. We're not just here for the fish and chips that I've now mentioned 15 times.

45
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,500
 The reason why the Waterfront Tavern is known other than their delicious fish and chips is this.

46
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,500
 The door swings open.

47
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,500
 [Makes sound of door opening]

48
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,500
 I imagine it's like an old saloon door. I'm sure it's a modern door, but...

49
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,500
 [Makes sound of door opening]

50
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,500
 And a shadowy figure walks in. We all kind of look over at him.

51
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,500
 He takes a seat.

52
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
 The bartender goes, "Hey, what's up, Ted?"

53
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,500
 And the guy just kind of nods and we're like, "Oh, okay."

54
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,500
 The door opens again.

55
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,500
 [Makes sound of door opening]

56
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,500
 Another guy walks in and the bartender's like, "Hey, I haven't seen you around in a long time."

57
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,500
 "I didn't write your name down in my notes, but I know what you're known for."

58
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,500
 "Why don't I get you a drink and you can strangle it?"

59
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,500
 [Laughs]

60
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,500
 "What? What does that even mean? How do you strangle a drink?"

61
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,500
 [Makes sound of door opening]

62
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,500
 Door opens again.

63
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,500
 Another guy walks in and the bartender goes, "Hmm..."

64
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,500
 "John..."

65
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,500
 "Yeah, John, I remember you."

66
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,500
 "John Muhammad..."

67
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,500
 Come over here and sit down and have a drink.

68
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,500
 He sits down next to the guy strangling his drink.

69
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,500
 After a couple of minutes, we start to recognize these guys.

70
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
 Ted is not just any Ted.

71
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,500
 It's Ted Bundy, serial killer.

72
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,500
 And then the guy who was strangling his drink that...

73
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,500
 [Laughs]

74
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,500
 ...wrote down in my notes, but you wouldn't have known the name anyways.

75
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,500
 I didn't know it.

76
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,500
 He was one of the hillside stranglers.

77
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:53,500
 And then John Muhammad, if you are a boomer like myself, a proud boomer,

78
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,500
 you should all know the name, John Muhammad.

79
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,500
 He was one of the Beltway Snipers.

80
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,500
 That was an amazing true crime story.

81
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,500
 I'd love to cover it.

82
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,500
 I feel like it's pretty well-known.

83
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,500
 I like to cover more obscure stuff.

84
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,500
 But the Beltway Snipers story, I remember watching on the news

85
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,500
 and it was like this mass shooting.

86
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,500
 It was a spree killing, actually, is what it is,

87
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,500
 where you kill a lot of people over a short period of time.

88
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,500
 It's different than a serial killing or a mass shooting,

89
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,500
 and nobody knew who was doing it.

90
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,500
 It was all over the Washington, D.C. area, the Beltway,

91
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,500
 and it went to other parts in Eastern states.

92
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,500
 I honestly probably should do a little bit of a segment on it real quick.

93
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,500
 Beltway Sniper, again, I'm going off-memory.

94
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
 It happened in the early 2000s.

95
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,500
 I know one of the conspiracies was that he was shooting a bunch of people at random.

96
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,500
 He shot a 12-year-old boy in the stomach at an elementary school,

97
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,500
 like it was truly random.

98
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,500
 But one of the targets that seemed to be kind of out of the way

99
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,500
 was a CIA analyst who was like grocery shopping,

100
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,500
 and there was always the conspiracy theory out there that she was the real target,

101
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,500
 that everything else was just a cover to take her out.

102
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,500
 I remember, because you know, you steady true crime for so long,

103
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,500
 and you follow all this stuff, that they kind of built a profile of the killers.

104
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,500
 They didn't know if there was one or two or multiple.

105
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
 It turns out there was two of them,

106
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
 but I remember in the news when they caught the killers,

107
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
 there were two African-American dudes.

108
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,500
 Actually, one was like 16 years old.

109
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,500
 And talk about a plot twist.

110
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,500
 Everyone was like, "What?"

111
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,500
 Everyone figured it was a white dude.

112
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,500
 That was always the profile for this type of crime was a white dude.

113
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,500
 So huge plot twist.

114
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,500
 I remember, I don't know if I was eating popcorn when I heard that news,

115
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,500
 but if I was, I dropped it and choked on it at the same time.

116
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,500
 Amazing plot twist.

117
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,500
 The weirdest thing, though,

118
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,500
 the weirdest detail to come out of the Beltway Sniper case,

119
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:45,500
 it was him and his, a boy, that there was always a rumor that they had some sort of relationship.

120
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,500
 I think he was 16 and John Muhammad was an adult.

121
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,500
 There's always a rumor about that, but the day before they got arrested,

122
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,500
 this goes into that whole MK Ultra thing,

123
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,500
 which I think is, we've talked about MK Ultra before.

124
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,500
 It did exist.

125
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,500
 I don't know if it goes to the level of the sex kittens

126
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,500
 that all the conspiracy theorists believe about now.

127
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,500
 You're like, "Jason, don't just stop.

128
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,500
 Don't just say sex kittens."

129
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,500
 You have to explain that.

130
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,500
 Basically, that girls are bred.

131
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,500
 Britney Spears and Katy Perry are sent to this program to turn into sluts.

132
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,500
 I don't think the government's like, "What should we do with this million dollars today?

133
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,500
 Let's turn Britney Spears into a slut."

134
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,500
 I don't believe in that, but you had this guy, for what was it?

135
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,500
 A couple weeks?

136
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
 He was shooting, again, this is all off memory.

137
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,500
 I didn't really prep this, but he was, him and his partner were shooting people.

138
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,500
 They had a car, it was like a dot center, something like that,

139
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,500
 with a hole cut in the trunk and they would lay in the trunk and then just take shots.

140
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,500
 And after the, it was Chief, it was Officer Moose.

141
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,500
 Chief Moose was the main cop who was after him.

142
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,500
 And he said, "Don't worry guys, your kids are safe."

143
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,500
 Like, I know this is totally random, and then like two days later,

144
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,500
 he shot a 12 year old in the stomach just to prove,

145
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,500
 because the cop said that.

146
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,500
 It's a fascinating case.

147
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,500
 It's horrible.

148
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,500
 The kids survived.

149
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,500
 But the day before they got arrested, I did write this down.

150
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,500
 I did write this down.

151
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,500
 I didn't know how much I'd go into detail with this, but I did write down this quote.

152
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,500
 Police Chief Charles Moose made this comment the day before they got arrested in an interview.

153
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,500
 "You have indicated that you want us to do and say certain things.

154
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:21,500
 You have asked us to say, quote, 'We have caught the sniper like a duck in a noose.

155
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,500
 We understand that hearing us say this is important to you.'

156
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:30,500
 And Chief Moose told the media, "Don't, you, you, you, we want you to repeat this

157
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,500
 as often as you can and don't change a word of it."

158
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
 They're like, "Well, normally we do that with quotes.

159
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,500
 We just rearrange words."

160
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,500
 He's like, "I know, but don't do that with this one.

161
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
 Repeat it as often as you can.

162
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
 Don't change a word of it."

163
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,500
 Four hours later, it wasn't even the next day, looking over at my notes here.

164
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,500
 Four hours later, they were arrested.

165
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:55,500
 And there's always been that theory that that was some sort of code that shut off their programming.

166
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,500
 Like, that code was a signal for this to all end.

167
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,500
 "We have caught the sniper like a duck in a noose."

168
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,500
 You have asked us to say, "We have caught the sniper like a duck in a noose."

169
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,500
 Four hours later, after weeks, long manhunt for these guys.

170
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,500
 And I think 12 people were killed.

171
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,500
 Again, I only took notes for the quote because I always thought that was fascinating.

172
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,500
 Weird story.

173
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,500
 But let's go back to this bar because John Muhammad is sitting in this bar right now.

174
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,500
 This bar is on Holly Street in Bellingham in Washington, and it has, let me go back to the narrative,

175
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:29,500
 it has a reputation for two things, delicious fish and chips, and murderers, serial killers,

176
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,500
 hung out there over the years.

177
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,500
 Now, it wasn't just one boom year for serial killers, it wasn't like 1967.

178
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,500
 They had a party there, they had a convention?

179
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
 No.

180
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,500
 Over the decades, I mean, we're talking all the way from Ted Bundy to John Muhammad,

181
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,500
 have been going here to drink.

182
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,500
 Now, most of the information, I want to say this too, I'm getting from an article written by Charlie Liduff.

183
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,500
 He wrote it for The New York Times.

184
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,500
 So great article, great work, Charlie.

185
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,500
 I'm giving you a thumbs up.

186
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,500
 This bar is known to either attract serial killers or because of its location.

187
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:06,500
 They say it's really the last stop before you head off into the wilderness of Canada or headed towards the wilderness of Alaska.

188
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,500
 So it attracts a lot of freaks, right?

189
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,500
 Because we're the only people who live in the woods, right?

190
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,500
 Our freaks.

191
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,500
 But yeah, they said Ted Bundy drank here, one of the hillside stringlers drank there.

192
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,500
 There's a couple other names that I didn't recognize and then the Beltway Sniper.

193
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:26,500
 And it was funny because the bartender goes, "Yeah, you know, you get a lot of unsavory types in here, but I hated the Beltway Sniper.

194
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,500
 He was terrible."

195
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:34,500
 I guess they said he was cheering on 9/11 and the guy's like, "I had half a mind to take him outside and beat his head in."

196
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
 But then I'd go to jail.

197
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:42,500
 It's a short, that's the story, but I like it because it goes, and thank you for the recommendation, Brady.

198
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,500
 I like it because I've talked about this thing before.

199
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,500
 Not this particular bar, but this theory before.

200
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:55,500
 That you can have holy places and peaceful places that attract holy and peaceful people.

201
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,500
 You don't have a lot of serial killers hanging around, you know, the base of Mount Shasta trying to get into Little Maria.

202
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:07,500
 You have places that attract good people, or when you're there, you feel the goodness envelop you.

203
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,500
 You feel like, "Wow, this is a holy spot."

204
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:18,500
 It could be a grove of trees, it could be an ornately constructed cathedral, but you can feel the spirit in you.

205
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
 And you feel at peace.

206
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,500
 And I've always said there should be an inverse of that.

207
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,500
 If we have stars, the opposite of it's a black hole.

208
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,500
 I don't know, don't science that.

209
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,500
 Don't science that.

210
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,500
 Don't go over to a scientist and say, "Is the opposite of a star a black hole?"

211
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,500
 They're like, "It's not how it works, but the opposite of a good place is a bad place."

212
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:40,500
 The opposite of a place that fills you with holy, and I'm not even talking about holy in the religious sense.

213
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:47,500
 I'm talking about you go to that glen that's outside your city, and you walk around and you feel recharged.

214
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,500
 So I'm not even talking about it being any particular religion.

215
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,500
 I'm talking about you feeling refreshed and good after you leave.

216
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,500
 If you have those places, you have to have the inverse to it.

217
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,500
 Now, we as good people aren't attracted to those places.

218
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:09,500
 So we may just pass by them, the convenience store on the side of the road, the clearing in the middle of the woods.

219
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:15,500
 We'll see those things, and we may stop by to pick up some chips at the convenience store, not the grove of trees.

220
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,500
 But maybe we'll feel a little unsettled.

221
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,500
 It's sending us a weird message if we go there at all.

222
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:31,500
 But to people who are driving down the road who are already intent on being evil, who already have that side in them, birthed and unleashed,

223
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,500
 they're attracted to that convenience store.

224
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,500
 They're attracted to that bar.

225
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:45,500
 Obviously the New York Times wasn't putting a metaphysical spin on this, but I think if you were a serial killer, if you were a murderer,

226
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:51,500
 you were driving through the neighborhood, you're going to see all these restaurants, you're going to see Denny's, you're going to see McDonald's, you're going to see an Arby's,

227
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,500
 and then you're going to see Waterfront Tavern.

228
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,500
 And that place speaks to the evil inside of you.

229
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:04,500
 I'm not saying the owners there are evil, I don't even think they can do serial killing or just regular killing, and I don't even think it's their fault.

230
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:14,500
 It could have been something that happened on that land way before the Waterfront Tavern was even built, that just acts like a beacon towards the worst of humanity.

231
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:21,500
 So the next time you're driving through Bellingham, Washington, if you want to sit in a seat formally occupied by a lunatic,

232
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:30,500
 take a seat at the Waterfront Tavern, or Arby's, or Arby's too, they both attract the most desperate of all humans.

233
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:39,500
 Take a seat at the Waterfront Tavern, you may find yourself enjoying great set of fish and chips, or you may feel right at home.

234
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:50,500
 You feel recharged, refreshed, and if you do, well then, you're probably, if you go there and enjoy the food, you're probably a bad person.

235
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,500
 You're probably an evil person, you just don't know yet.

236
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,500
 And as you're driving away, you look up in the rear of your mirror and your eyes are yellow, and it freeze frames.

237
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:06,500
 And then credits roll. And you're still trying to drive, there's much credits in your way, you're like, "Ah, Alex, go ahead and call in that carpenter copter,

238
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:11,500
 we're going to get away from this menacing man who can't drive when there's a bunch of letters and words in front of his face."

239
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:24,500
 Call in that carpenter copter, we are headed out to a small house in America. Alex is looking around, he's like, "There's like 300 million of these."

240
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,500
 I'm like, "I know, I know, there's a lot of small houses in America."

241
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,500
 Where we're going is to a particular man's house.

242
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,500
 He's like, "That doesn't help me, Alex, that doesn't help me at all."

243
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,500
 I'm like, "Shh, just fly, Alex, just fly."

244
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:42,500
 This was sent to me by Fabio Nurbon. Send me a ton of stuff. Really, really good guy.

245
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,500
 He's sending me a lot of great stories, I really appreciate that.

246
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:50,500
 This one he sent to me, he found this one on Craigslist. He actually said, you know, "Listen to your show all the time."

247
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:56,500
 And you talk about Craigslist every once in a while, and he's from another country. He goes, "I'm not going to dox him."

248
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,500
 But Fabio, I always get it mispronounced, I'm probably mispronouncing it again.

249
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:04,500
 Fabio said, "You talk about Craigslist from time to time, I went to check it out. I wanted to see what Craigslist was all about."

250
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,500
 And he stumbled across a supervillain.

251
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:14,500
 Lightning is striking all around the Carbenter Copter.

252
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:21,500
 Alex is starting to get a little sweaty, a little bit of sweat on his forehead, and I turn to him and I go, "No."

253
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500
 This means we're on the right path.

254
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:35,500
 Scott Patnode is one of those really weird, complicated characters that's hard to draw a through line to form some sort of narrative.

255
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:40,500
 So I'm going to try my best, that is my job, after all, is to figure out a way to tell these stories.

256
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,500
 But Scott Patnode, I guess the best way to sum it up is this.

257
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,500
 Scott Patnode is a supervillain.

258
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,500
 But like all supervillains, he had a noble beginning. He wanted to do something good.

259
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:57,500
 He invented this machine that would be able to clean up radioactivity.

260
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:04,500
 So we see a young Scott Patnode working on this device in his garage, and he has these special science goggles on and a lab coat.

261
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:13,500
 "Eat, eat, eat!" He's looking at it and he's like, "This is perfect! Some day, if there's any sort of nuclear disaster, all the world has to do is turn on my device.

262
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,500
 Everything will be saved, and I, Scott Patnode, will be remembered as a hero.

263
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,500
 Eat, eat, eat!" He's putting his little finishing touches on it.

264
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,500
 But then Fukushima happened.

265
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,500
 [Groan]

266
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,500
 The cookie monster showed up. Now that's supposed to be an earthquake.

267
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,500
 [Groan]

268
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:35,500
 Fukushima, the Japanese nuclear reactor, started to leak into the ocean.

269
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,500
 And Scott Patnode realizes this is the perfect time, guys.

270
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,500
 This world may die unless my invention is used.

271
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
 So let me go to the garage.

272
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,500
 What? Huh?

273
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,500
 He's not a very good actor. He's not a very good actor.

274
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,500
 He opens the garage door and his device is gone. All of his blueprints are gone.

275
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,500
 Everything about this device is gone.

276
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,500
 You see, the governments of the world knew what Scott Patnode were up to.

277
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,500
 So they broke into his house, stole everything, and left him with nothing.

278
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:10,500
 Now that narrative I just told you is more concise than like 50 of his videos.

279
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,500
 The gist is, the government sold his device.

280
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,500
 So he now no longer has the ability to save the world.

281
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,500
 Somebody does, but he's saying that they're not using it.

282
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,500
 Like, they took it from him so he couldn't save the world, but they're not using it either.

283
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,500
 And Fukushima is slowly seeping into the ocean. We're all gonna die soon.

284
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,500
 Soon being here 2015, but somehow we're still here.

285
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,500
 So what would you do if the government stole the invention you've been working on all this time?

286
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,500
 Most people would probably get really depressed.

287
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,500
 So a lot of people would make a stink on the media.

288
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,500
 Scott developed superpowers.

289
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,500
 So that's something you can put on your to-do list.

290
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,500
 Next time someone wrongs you just go...

291
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,500
 [imitates sound effect]

292
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:59,500
 You remember this stuff back a couple years ago?

293
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,500
 The Middle East got electrified. Do you remember that?

294
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,500
 You remember that in the news?

295
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,500
 Everyone in Syria?

296
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,500
 Everyone in Saudi Arabia?

297
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,500
 You do remember that? You do remember that event that never happened?

298
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,500
 You go to the doctor? Or that was Scott.

299
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,500
 Scott electrified the Middle East.

300
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,500
 Also, back in 2014, he sent out a message.

301
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,500
 He told everybody to put your beds on the second floor.

302
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,500
 You remember that? I remember that.

303
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,500
 I actually do remember that. I was reading in the New York Times one day.

304
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,500
 Headline.

305
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,500
 Man says beds on the second floor.

306
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,500
 That was it. There was no article just the headline.

307
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,500
 He told us. He warned us back in 2014 to put our beds on the second floor.

308
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,500
 And guess what? Guess what?

309
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,500
 That tsunami hit Turkey.

310
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,500
 That super famous tsunami that wiped out the country.

311
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,500
 But it didn't. There was a tsunami, but no one died.

312
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,500
 It was just like a gentle wave.

313
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,500
 The earthquake killed a bunch of people.

314
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,500
 But if your bed was on the second story of your house,

315
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:02,500
 it's probably not a good place to be in an earthquake on the second story.

316
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,500
 So he's developed these superpowers. You ask how? Why?

317
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:11,500
 He has made an alliance. This is actually pretty smart.

318
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,500
 I hadn't thought of this.

319
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,500
 The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

320
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,500
 Who's a human's biggest enemies?

321
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,500
 Not the radiation that's seeping into the ocean due to Fukushima.

322
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,500
 It's the Draconians.

323
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,500
 You see, the reptilians actually came to Earth millions and millions of years ago.

324
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,500
 And star seeded our planet.

325
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,500
 And we didn't evolve from monkeys, man. What are you talking about?

326
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,500
 God didn't create us out of clay.

327
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,500
 No, the Draconians came down and made us out of ants.

328
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,500
 Took a little ants, right? And turned them into us.

329
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,500
 Which makes a lot of sense, because I was always wondering where my extra arms came from.

330
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,500
 I hide them in my live streams, but I have several arms,

331
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,500
 and I do have an addiction to sugar, so that makes so much sense.

332
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,500
 They are actually eating us. They've always been eating us,

333
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,500
 and now they're helping out Scott take his revenge.

334
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
 So he has lightning powers, which is pretty cool.

335
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,500
 If I had any set of powers, they would be lightning powers.

336
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,500
 So Scott, I've got him in. I'm a little jealous of them.

337
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500
 But I'm just a little jealous.

338
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,500
 President Obama is more than jealous.

339
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,500
 President Obama is threatened by Scott Pattonode.

340
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,500
 Not only did President Obama send three different assassination teams

341
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,500
 against the man who could wield electricity,

342
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,500
 a man who is the highest form of ant on the planet,

343
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,500
 and of course, they couldn't kill him.

344
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,500
 He sent a couple of hit teams against Scott Pattonode.

345
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,500
 They totally lost.

346
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:38,500
 Scott Pattonode retaliates by punching politicians.

347
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,500
 Punching them. Remember that in the news?

348
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,500
 Actually, this is crazy, because you do remember this in the news.

349
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,500
 Scott Pattonode was punching people in the face,

350
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,500
 but he was doing it psychically.

351
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,500
 So you know there's that big Adrenochrome conspiracy theory

352
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,500
 about all the celebrities having black eyes.

353
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,500
 About having black eyes?

354
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,500
 Because either, depending on the theory,

355
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,500
 that's where they inject the Adrenochrome,

356
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,500
 or it's a side effect of getting the Adrenochrome?

357
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,500
 No! You're wrong! You're wrong!

358
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,500
 Scott Pattonode is sitting in his house,

359
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,500
 and he imagines Dolly Parton walking on the street,

360
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,500
 and he's like...

361
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,500
 He's making race car noises.

362
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,500
 And then Dolly Parton's like...

363
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,500
 Ow! My eye!

364
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,500
 And she moves her hand away in this big black eye.

365
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,500
 That's Scott Pattonode. He's punching these people in the eye.

366
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,500
 So that's pretty dope. That's a dope superpower, right?

367
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
 Even if I didn't have the electricity thing,

368
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
 I could just psychically punch people in the eye.

369
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,500
 That'd be awesome.

370
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,500
 But Obama's not gonna stand for that.

371
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,500
 Obama's not gonna stand for all of his Illuminati buddies

372
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,500
 getting punched in the eye.

373
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:49,500
 So Obama killed all of Scott Pattonode's favorite celebrities.

374
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,500
 Scott Pattonode's at a graveyard,

375
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
 and he's looking at all these gravestones.

376
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,500
 Water...

377
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,500
 Rain... What's supposed to be?

378
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,500
 Coming down from the sky. No lightning, though.

379
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,500
 Scott Pattonode is not in good mood.

380
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,500
 He's not making lightning appear.

381
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,500
 He's looking at all these gravestones.

382
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,500
 Paul Walker. Great actor.

383
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,500
 Leonard Nimoy.

384
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
 Obama killed Leonard Nimoy.

385
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,500
 Oh, Obama!

386
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,500
 Tom Clancy.

387
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,500
 Hmm. Heard of him.

388
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,500
 What am I doing next video game?

389
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,500
 This is a big video game developer.

390
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,500
 Roger Moore. One of the best James Bond's out there.

391
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,500
 No...

392
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,500
 Prince? Did you know that?

393
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,500
 Obama killed Prince.

394
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,500
 I don't know if the theory is that Obama had Prince killed,

395
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,500
 but I want to imagine that Obama did it himself.

396
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
 He's like the final hitman in Scarface.

397
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,500
 And he's wearing the sunglasses,

398
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,500
 and he's got on the cool suit,

399
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,500
 and he has the slot-off shotgun,

400
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,500
 and Prince is in there making music.

401
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,500
 Da-da-da-da-da! Oh, yeah, this sounds so much better

402
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,500
 if it took my pants off. He's dancing all naked.

403
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,500
 And then behind him Obama.

404
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,500
 Obama has his slot-off shotgun.

405
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,500
 That'd be dope!

406
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,500
 But I don't know.

407
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,500
 So, Prince. Good. I'm not a huge Prince fan,

408
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,500
 but I respect his contributions to music.

409
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,500
 I think he's a musical genius. I just don't like that music.

410
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,500
 I'm a Michael Jackson fan myself.

411
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,500
 Paul Walker is amazing.

412
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,500
 All these guys. Tom Clancy. World's famous novelist.

413
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,500
 And then the last gravestone.

414
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,500
 One of his favorite celebrities.

415
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
 This is nobody's favorite celebrity.

416
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,500
 This is not a single, if you ever asked any person,

417
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,500
 name seven of your favorite celebrities.

418
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,500
 Name 50 of your famous celebrities.

419
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,500
 Nobody names this one.

420
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,500
 Joan Rivers.

421
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,500
 I don't even think my grandma would have named Joan Rivers.

422
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,500
 Nobody says that.

423
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,500
 What's funny though,

424
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,500
 is that there is a conspiracy theory

425
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,500
 that outside of Scott Pattonode,

426
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,500
 there is a conspiracy theory

427
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,500
 that Obama killed Joan Rivers.

428
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,500
 I don't want to say that's a real conspiracy theory,

429
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,500
 because it makes it sound like it's real.

430
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,500
 But that one's been going around for years,

431
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,500
 because like two nights before Joan Rivers died,

432
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,500
 I think she had a botched plastic surgery operation.

433
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
 She said that Michelle Obama was a dude.

434
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,500
 And so Obama was like,

435
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,500
 Obama's eating dinner and he's like,

436
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,500
 What?

437
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,500
 And he's like, that's it.

438
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,500
 Go take her out. That's an old conspiracy theory.

439
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,500
 One, that Joan Rivers was killed

440
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,500
 because she made that joke to like TMZ.

441
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,500
 Two, that's a conspiracy theory.

442
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,500
 And she said,

443
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,500
 that's a joke to like TMZ.

444
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,500
 Two, that's a long-running conspiracy theory

445
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,500
 that Michelle Obama is really a dude.

446
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,500
 Like I was just looking at that conspiracy theory

447
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,500
 last night. I'm like, has this not gone away yet?

448
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,500
 He hasn't been president

449
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,500
 for five years now

450
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,500
 and this is still a conspiracy theory.

451
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,500
 So the birther thing is gone away

452
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,500
 quicker than Michelle Obama being a man

453
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,500
 conspiracy theory.

454
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,500
 So that conspiracy theory,

455
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,500
 I've seen other places.

456
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
 Both the Joan Rivers was killed

457
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,500
 and Michelle Obama is a dude.

458
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,500
 And the kids were adopted and all sorts of nonsense.

459
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,500
 But so that does exist

460
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,500
 outside of Scott Pattonode.

461
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,500
 But anyway, so these are the people

462
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,500
 that Obama took out

463
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,500
 to really piss off Scott Pattonode.

464
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,500
 Scott makes claims he's an avatar of Jesus.

465
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,500
 His dad is Zeus.

466
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,500
 So that explains the lightning powers.

467
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,500
 I don't know what his dad's relationship is

468
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,500
 with the Draconians.

469
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,500
 I don't know if...

470
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,500
 I have anything about it.

471
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,500
 He actually came down to Earth 40-some-odd years ago

472
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,500
 and impregnated his mom.

473
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,500
 Or is that he's like from a lineage

474
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,500
 of Jesus?

475
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,500
 Or is Zeus literally like, hey dad can I borrow some money?

476
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,500
 And Jesus is like, you're a demigod

477
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,500
 you don't need money. Here's a cloud you can float around on.

478
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,500
 Scott's like, oh yeah.

479
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,500
 Another power that Scott Pattonode has,

480
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,500
 probably the most devious one, because it truly

481
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,500
 targets the innocent,

482
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,500
 not Obama's inchmen.

483
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,500
 He can watch television.

484
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,500
 Everyone can do that. That's not a superpower.

485
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,500
 He'll watch game shows and he'll think

486
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,500
 you're wrong. Get it wrong.

487
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,500
 You don't know the answer. You don't know the answer.

488
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,500
 And as the dude is trying to figure out five things

489
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,500
 you do with buttermilk other than drink it

490
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,500
 on an episode of Family Feud and they're trying to hit the buzzer,

491
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,500
 he, Scott Pattonode, is like,

492
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,500
 "N-n-n-n-nope.

493
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,500
 You don't know the answer."

494
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,500
 There's only one thing you use buttermilk for.

495
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,500
 But the people who are puzzled, Scott Pattonode

496
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,500
 can actually make you lose at game shows.

497
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,500
 Family Feud, Wheel of Fortune,

498
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,500
 those are the two he lists.

499
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,500
 But I'm sure it goes on and on.

500
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,500
 $10,000 pyramid.

501
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,500
 Tic-Tac-Toe.

502
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,500
 People. Hollywood Squares.

503
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,500
 All of them. All the hits. All the great ones.

504
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,500
 Innocent people just trying to

505
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,500
 earn money.

506
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,500
 This is their only job.

507
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,500
 The only skill that they have is being on Wheel of Fortune.

508
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,500
 And you're taking the money

509
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,500
 out of their hands. How are they supposed to feed their kids?

510
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,500
 With the showcase?

511
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,500
 They don't ever have bread.

512
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,500
 It's always just trips to like Brazil

513
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,500
 and stuff like that. I need to put food on the table, Scott.

514
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,500
 Please don't let me

515
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,500
 get the whammy, Scott.

516
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,500
 I beg of you. No whammies.

517
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,500
 But that's a lot of his craziness

518
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,500
 trying to compress that in

519
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,500
 to just a few minutes

520
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,500
 because he has 220 videos on this.

521
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,500
 I want to step back for a second

522
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,500
 and take a look at a more personal side

523
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,500
 of Scott Pattonode.

524
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,500
 Because this is where I think it gets interesting.

525
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,500
 People make crazy claims on the line all the time,

526
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,500
 but I think this is where it gets really, really interesting.

527
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,500
 I might go a little long on this one.

528
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,500
 Let me read you this comment that he left

529
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,500
 on one of his many blogs,

530
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,500
 many write-ups.

531
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,500
 I was all over Facebook and Twitter and stuff like that.

532
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,500
 Again, Fabio, thanks for sending this over.

533
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,500
 Let me read you this. We are going to go a little long here.

534
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,500
 I remember a few years back

535
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,500
 when I had a rat in the attic running around

536
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,500
 or a mouse or something and it was

537
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,500
 the winter time. And I was getting mad at it

538
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,500
 running around the attic, so I began to wish death on it.

539
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,500
 And sure enough,

540
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,500
 one day it was running around the attic

541
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,500
 and it landed on a nail

542
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,500
 and got stuck

543
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,500
 and died.

544
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,500
 So therefore, I got the death I wished on it.

545
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,500
 Just like

546
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,500
 20 years ago

547
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,500
 so he can kill rats with his mind,

548
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,500
 okay?

549
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,500
 That thought ends.

550
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,500
 That was basically one long sentence

551
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,500
 and then we move right into this next example.

552
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,500
 Just like 20 years ago, the Kirby Vacuum Cleaner

553
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,500
 managers were yelling at me

554
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,500
 for not being able to sell a vacuum.

555
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,500
 So I sat there

556
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,500
 and was

557
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,500
 he just killed a rat, right?

558
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,500
 And now some guys are like, "Damn it, Scott!

559
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,500
 Can't you just sell at least one vacuum?

560
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,500
 How hard is it to sell vacuums door to door

561
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,500
 to people who don't need vacuums and people

562
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,500
 don't want to be disturbed in the middle of the afternoon?

563
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,500
 How hard is that?" Just like 20 years ago,

564
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,500
 the Kirby Vacuum Cleaner managers were yelling

565
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,500
 at me for not being able to sell a vacuum.

566
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,500
 So I sat there

567
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,500
 and was wishing death on them. And sure enough,

568
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,500
 later on

569
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,500
 that afternoon, they ran a yellow light

570
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,500
 and had an oncoming old lady

571
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,500
 in the oncoming lane

572
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,500
 turning that turned when they didn't stop

573
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,500
 for the yellow light and we ripped through

574
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,500
 her car and then hit a concrete telephone

575
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,500
 pole and

576
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,500
 well, the airbags blew

577
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,500
 when they hit the car. Sorry, I'm trying to keep the grammar

578
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,500
 right here.

579
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,500
 But there is none. And we ripped through the car

580
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,500
 and then hit a concrete telephone pole

581
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,500
 and well, the airbags blew

582
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,500
 when they hit the car, but they didn't blow again

583
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,500
 when they hit the concrete telephone pole.

584
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,500
 I never saw

585
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,500
 those managers get out of the truck at all

586
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,500
 when the ambulance came. The two people

587
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,500
 next to me went in ambulances.

588
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,500
 I was really the only person

589
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,500
 in the accident that walked away.

590
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,500
 We were standing

591
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,500
 on the street corner, we were looking at this car accident

592
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,500
 and you look over at me and I was like, "Dude, I don't

593
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,500
 first off, airbags don't

594
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,500
 keep deploying. They're not bumper cars.

595
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,500
 It's not like every time you hit something, airbags keep

596
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,500
 boop boop boop."

597
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,500
 So the airbags will only deploy once.

598
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,500
 The idea that

599
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,500
 the people that he worked for

600
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,500
 got in a car accident and then

601
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,500
 apparently vanished

602
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,500
 they never left the... To this day

603
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,500
 they've never left that vehicle. They're in a

604
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,500
 5th dimensional Toyota Subaru

605
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,500
 that he never saw them again.

606
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,500
 I'm assuming he didn't go back to work.

607
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,500
 But he's sitting in this car

608
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,500
 the people who are driving

609
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,500
 the car, he wishes that they die.

610
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,500
 It's not a smart maneuver. Then he mentions

611
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,500
 two other people in the back seat with him.

612
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,500
 So...

613
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,500
 he's basically turned the entire car

614
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,500
 into an unguided missile.

615
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,500
 He knows what's gonna happen. He says

616
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,500
 "But I never saw the people who were in the

617
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,500
 front seat never saw him again.

618
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,500
 They ceased to exist.

619
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,500
 I tried to find the birth certificates next to

620
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,500
 Obama's. None of them existed.

621
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,500
 Actually now that we do have to go along

622
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,500
 in this episode because I missed the whole thing

623
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,500
 he's trying to kill everyone on the planet.

624
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,500
 It's not only enough that he's going after

625
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,500
 Obama for killing Joan Rivers.

626
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,500
 He actually wants to kill all human life on the

627
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,500
 planet. I don't know how I spaced on that.

628
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,500
 He wants to kill all of us.

629
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,500
 You can't be an ally to Scott.

630
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,500
 He's trying to warn us that he's

631
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,500
 going to murder us.

632
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,500
 So the fact that he would turn the vehicle into

633
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,500
 this and not care about anyone in it

634
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,500
 even the two people who weren't yelling at him

635
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,500
 he doesn't care. He wants everyone to die

636
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,500
 because this invention was stolen.

637
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,500
 He's not just punching

638
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,500
 you might be like "Oh yeah dude I hate the rich

639
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,500
 and the powerful. I wish I could psychically punch him in the eye."

640
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,500
 But then he turns on

641
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,500
 you and his eyes are glowing red and he

642
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,500
 electrocutes you. He wants to eliminate

643
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,500
 all humans on the planet.

644
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,500
 That's his goal. So he went from being

645
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,500
 an inventor to wanting revenge

646
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,500
 so bad that he's

647
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,500
 willing to destroy the human race.

648
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,500
 He envisions a future

649
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,500
 where there's nothing but him,

650
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,500
 the Draconians,

651
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,500
 and a Joan Rivers clone

652
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,500
 next to him to tell him jokes.

653
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,500
 I don't even know what Joan Rivers did.

654
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,500
 But

655
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,500
 anyway, she'll do that for the rest of time.

656
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,500
 But let's step back here

657
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,500
 because I do want to talk a little bit about

658
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,500
 him personally. We have these grandiose

659
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,500
 visions but then we find out

660
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,500
 he's a Kirby vacuum salesman.

661
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,500
 He makes a lot of odd decisions in his YouTube videos.

662
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,500
 Some videos he's talking to the camera.

663
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,500
 Some videos it's slide shows

664
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,500
 which is a fair format but

665
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,500
 each slide is like

666
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,500
 10 different photos

667
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,500
 from like a photo from his Facebook,

668
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,500
 a photo from his MySpace,

669
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,500
 if he has one. But you know what I mean, just for an example

670
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,500
 a photo from this, that, and the other thing,

671
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,500
 there are these big mosaics photos

672
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,500
 he's taken of UFOs

673
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,500
 and chemtrails and things like that.

674
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,500
 It's very, very bizarre.

675
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,500
 He goes out of his way

676
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,500
 to lie about his location

677
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,500
 which is fine. Again, you're on the internet, you're lying about your location.

678
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,500
 But then in one,

679
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,500
 I just happened to be watching this one

680
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,500
 YouTube video,

681
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,500
 he showed a

682
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,500
 screenshot of what appeared to be his cell phone

683
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,500
 that had his contact list on it.

684
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,500
 So I

685
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,500
 immediately curious, I found the company

686
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,500
 whose number is listed

687
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,500
 that I found his address. I found his address

688
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,500
 in a matter of like 20 minutes

689
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,500
 and I'm thinking he's put,

690
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,500
 and I'm not going to reveal it obviously, but

691
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,500
 he's put out 220 videos, he's trying to say

692
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,500
 he lives in the southwest

693
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,500
 because he was afraid

694
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,500
 that ISIS was in Mexico, so he was trying to tell

695
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,500
 even

696
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,500
 some of the parts don't make sense,

697
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,500
 but he said that he lived

698
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,500
 in this specific southwest state

699
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,500
 and then he said he was going to go to Mexico

700
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,500
 and then Obama moved to ISIS to Mexico

701
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,500
 and he said he tricked everyone, but then I found out

702
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,500
 he doesn't live anywhere in that region at all.

703
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,500
 He lives much,

704
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,500
 I'm not going to reveal his address, but I thought that was weird.

705
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,500
 I thought that was really weird

706
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,500
 and then I was able to actually match up

707
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,500
 photos

708
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,500
 of that area to photos he was taking.

709
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,500
 So it's interesting to see someone who goes

710
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,500
 out of their way to create

711
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,500
 fake profiles showing they live in one location

712
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,500
 and then goof up

713
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,500
 so, so battling

714
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,500
 so consistently that you can read street signs

715
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,500
 when he's taking photos going,

716
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,500
 I took this photo outside of my house of a UFO

717
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,500
 and it's a clear shot of a street sign

718
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,500
 that's only in that neighborhood.

719
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,500
 Very, very weird thing.

720
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,500
 You're like Jason, that's the weird thing?

721
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,500
 The guy says that he's going to destroy all humanity

722
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,500
 and worry about trimmance. It is weird

723
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,500
 because it's a bit of a sidestep. We cover people

724
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,500
 who have wacky beliefs

725
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,500
 all the time on this show, but when we

726
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,500
 start to look into the real life of them

727
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,500
 it becomes more fascinating

728
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,500
 I think and actually becomes more real.

729
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,500
 He's also trying to give away a boat

730
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,500
 trailer. He has a video

731
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,500
 entitled, tell me if this isn't the deal of a century.

732
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,500
 It's a video.

733
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,500
 Again, this is so, so if you

734
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,500
 happen to be one of Obama's agents

735
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,500
 but you needed a new boat trailer, you just

736
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,500
 say, "Hey, I want your boat trailer" and you could walk up to this dude's house.

737
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,500
 Here's this

738
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,500
 YouTube video.

739
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,500
 Free Burnt Bint Trailer Frame.

740
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,500
 Right there, it's a deal.

741
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,500
 Free Burnt Bint Trailer Frame

742
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,500
 Back to Original Condition.

743
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,500
 I don't know, I'll go there.

744
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,500
 I'm like, "What? You promised me Burnt."

745
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,500
 This is the original condition.

746
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,500
 Free Burnt Bint Trailer Frame

747
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,500
 Back to Original Condition, along with

748
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:23,500
 Deal of a Century, guys.

749
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,500
 Not only do you get a Burnt Bint

750
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,500
 boat trailer, you also get

751
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,500
 one fourth of a boat.

752
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,500
 You get one fourth of a boat

753
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,500
 hole. It's free, though.

754
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,500
 If you've ever wanted 25% of a boat,

755
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,500
 this is the YouTube video you want to watch.

756
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,500
 She actually has a couple boats in his backyard.

757
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,500
 That was an, I was like, "Dude, you keep

758
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,500
 showing me these boats."

759
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,500
 At a certain point, I was like, "I just need to know

760
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,500
 like how much I can find out about this guy.

761
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,500
 I can looking at these boats

762
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,500
 and then I'm looking at the satellite

763
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,500
 footage of a bunch of boats in a backyard.

764
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,500
 I'm trying to do you a favor

765
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,500
 by saying this. I'm not trying to

766
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,500
 like, dox you. I'm saying

767
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,500
 if you want to hide your

768
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,500
 identity, don't

769
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,500
 show your backyard constantly.

770
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,500
 Don't take photos

771
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,500
 in your neighborhood at all.

772
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,500
 If you want to

773
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,500
 keep your location secret,

774
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,500
 you're doing it wrong. So, Scott, if you're listening

775
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,500
 to this, you know, there, don't

776
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,500
 don't be putting your stuff out there.

777
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,500
 It's funny because I kind of feel bad for Scott.

778
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,500
 I think the real reason why I get a little

779
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,500
 bit of tug of the heart strings on Scott,

780
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,500
 I actually, I feel like I've gone really easy

781
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,500
 on him compared to, I've covered

782
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,500
 a lot of other people, because in the end,

783
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,500
 he's just giving people black eyes and

784
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,500
 electrifying the Middle East and

785
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,500
 telling people to move their bets.

786
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,500
 But let's wrap it up like this. This is where I was kind of like,

787
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,500
 "Aww."

788
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,500
 Not only did his invention get stolen,

789
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,500
 he also says that he wrote a comic book

790
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,500
 which, oh man, I'd love to

791
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,500
 get my hands on that. I wouldn't love to steal it.

792
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,500
 I'd love to read it. But he said a woman

793
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,500
 stole his comic book.

794
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,500
 He wrote this comic book out and he stole it.

795
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,500
 He has some copies though. He really should sell it.

796
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,500
 He has some copies and they did have

797
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,500
 drawings from his comic

798
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,500
 book. It looks more like a story, like a

799
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,500
 children's storybook. There's a lot of like

800
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,500
 full-page illustrations, at least the ones that I saw.

801
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,500
 They're drawn in a very Chris Chan

802
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,500
-esque way. You can tell it's an adult

803
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,500
 drawing in a very childlike style.

804
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,500
 But the comic book actually predicted

805
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,500
 a lot of stuff. He wrote it a long time

806
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,500
 ago, and this was before he knew his journey.

807
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,500
 It said that he

808
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,500
 predicted that he was the son of Zeus.

809
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,500
 He didn't know he was the son of Zeus until

810
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,500
 he created this comic book. He predicted that.

811
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,500
 It also predicted that he would have owned

812
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,500
 a motorcycle someday.

813
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,500
 And now, all of us who have ever owned a

814
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,500
 motor vehicle, right? It was because of the

815
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,500
 comic book we wrote. It's like, "Oh man,

816
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,500
 I never drew a comic book. That's why

817
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,500
 I walk everywhere. That's why I don't have a car."

818
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,500
 The comic book predicted he would own a motorcycle someday.

819
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,500
 And you don't just get a motorcycle.

820
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,500
 You just can't buy one of those things. It has to be

821
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,500
 gifted to you from the gods.

822
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,500
 And you're Dad's Zeus, so you're definitely

823
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,500
 going to get one.

824
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,500
 But as I'm looking through a couple pages of this comic

825
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,500
 book, he posted it. It might have been in a

826
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,500
 YouTube video I was watching. Everything started

827
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,500
 to blur together at this point.

828
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,500
 In the comic book, that's the story of him.

829
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,500
 One of the pages, it shows

830
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,500
 a little Scott Patnode.

831
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,500
 It shows that Scott is a little boy.

832
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,500
 Or his self-insert. It's a little boy.

833
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,500
 A little Scott-shaped boy

834
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,500
 laying in bed at night.

835
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,500
 He's holding a little teddy bear.

836
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,500
 A little moon coming in through the window.

837
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,500
 And he's dreaming

838
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,500
 of being

839
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,500
 a motocross star. No, not just a motocross

840
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,500
 star. He's dreaming of being like an evil

841
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,500
 Keneval.

842
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,500
 His little outfit on. I think he had a little cape.

843
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,500
 Little boy has a smile on his face.

844
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,500
 Dreaming of motorcycle adventures.

845
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,500
 I saw that panel

846
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,500
 and I thought,

847
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,500
 "Poor Scott."

848
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,500
 Poor Scott. He probably doesn't need my pity.

849
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,500
 He probably doesn't want it.

850
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,500
 And it's not necessarily pity.

851
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,500
 But in that panel, I saw

852
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,500
 the alternate Scott.

853
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,500
 He had dreams.

854
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,500
 He had dreams. Maybe they're

855
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,500
 unrealistic dreams. I don't know how hard it is

856
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,500
 to become evil Keneval.

857
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,500
 I don't know if it's an easy industry to get into.

858
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,500
 Or if it's very hard considering there's not

859
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,500
 you know, circus shows

860
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,500
 going on all the time anymore. I don't know.

861
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,500
 But in that one panel, I saw

862
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,500
 a story of a boy who wanted

863
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,500
 an exciting life.

864
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,500
 But somewhere between that little boy

865
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,500
 and Scott of today

866
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,500
 something

867
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,500
 changed. And I'm not talking about his invention

868
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,500
 got stolen. I don't even know if the invention existed.

869
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,500
 But maybe

870
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,500
 maybe he was about to go

871
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,500
 for his first evil Keneval ride.

872
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,500
 He just needed to drop this invention off

873
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,500
 the pan office. Obama broke into his house

874
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,500
 and took it. I think obviously that something

875
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
 else

876
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,500
 Scott is obviously struggling with something.

877
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,500
 And I think this is where

878
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,500
 we see that

879
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,500
 split in

880
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,500
 the timeline.

881
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,500
 We've covered a lot of people on this

882
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,500
 show and they're actually really well

883
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,500
 put together people

884
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,500
 who have bizarre beliefs. Really bizarre

885
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,500
 theories. The guy who believes

886
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,500
 he has the hat that can cure autism.

887
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,500
 The vampire lord Kevin

888
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,500
 even Hans. I don't think Hans

889
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,500
 has any sort of mental issues.

890
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,500
 I think he just has a bizarre way of looking

891
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,500
 at the world.

892
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,500
 I think when we look at people like Scott

893
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,500
 I'm not going to diagnose him over the podcast

894
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,500
 but he's definitely struggling with something.

895
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,500
 And I think the fact that he goes through such

896
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,500
 lengths to hide his location

897
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,500
 and at the same time reveals it at every possible chance

898
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,500
 shows that.

899
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,500
 And I think the fact that he wants to wish

900
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,500
 violence on the world over and over and over again

901
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,500
 shows that. Hans doesn't

902
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,500
 want to blow up a continent.

903
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,500
 But I feel like at some point

904
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,500
 Scott had these dreams of an exciting

905
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,500
 and bold life

906
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,500
 and then something changed

907
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,500
 whether that was a mental thing, whether that

908
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,500
 was a situational thing,

909
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,500
 someone broke his heart, someone

910
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,500
 turned their back on him.

911
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,500
 Who knows.

912
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,500
 But Scott, if you are listening to this

913
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,500
 and really to everyone who's listening to this

914
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,500
 we've had some good fun this episode

915
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,500
 I'm not making fun of you as a person.

916
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,500
 You can have those childlike dreams again.

917
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,500
 I guarantee it.

918
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,500
 Life is long and it can be hard.

919
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,500
 But you can't stop

920
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,500
 working towards what you truly want.

921
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,500
 If you want to be a motocross

922
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,500
 rider, jumping through flaming hoops

923
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,500
 do it.

924
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,500
 You may suck at it, you may only do it

925
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,500
 a single time, but do it.

926
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,500
 Because even if you do that

927
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,500
 and fail, even if you take that one

928
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,500
 childlike dream of yours

929
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,500
 that you look back on and go "I was dumb for believing that."

930
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,500
 Even if you try it just once, even if you fail

931
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,500
 that act of trying

932
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,500
 has more impact on your soul

933
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,500
 than a billion lightning bolts

934
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,500
 flying through the universe.

935
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,500
 Scott

936
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,500
 and all of you

937
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,500
 don't let hate

938
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,500
 and revenge

939
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,500
 cloud your true

940
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,500
 dreams.
