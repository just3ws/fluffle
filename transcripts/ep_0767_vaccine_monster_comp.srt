1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,160
 A prophecy comes and goes and the world barely notices.

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,420
 And then we take a look at a brand new conspiracy.

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,920
 We're gonna meet a man who believes that cryptids are not born.

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,760
 They're made today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:25,440
 [music]

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,040
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,040
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,540
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,540
 Hope you guys are having lots of fun out there.

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,240
 [music]

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,040
 That's a real rough day. Real rough week, honestly.

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,040
 And I guess I did just tell you guys that I was having a great day, but...

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,340
 [music]

14
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:48,040
 Out of sorts. Out of sorts. Things just have been weird this week.

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,840
 [music]

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,840
 Smoking a clove for energy.

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,840
 You don't know what that is. I didn't chase down a leprechaun

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,340
 and start smoking his suit. Cloves. You know those old cigarettes

19
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,340
 that those girls in college used to smoke so their kisses tasted good?

20
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:07,840
 I had them for Halloween. Girls love cloves.

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,340
 So if you love girls and you're gonna go out partying, it's good to have a pack of cloves on you.

22
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,840
 Let's go ahead and get the episode started here.

23
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,840
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command with my newest supply of cloves.

24
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,340
 It's a long time listener of the show, but new to the Patreon. Give it up for Sean.

25
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,340
 Everyone give a round of applause to Sean walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

26
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,840
 Thank you. Thank you so much for supporting the show. Sean, you're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode.

27
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,340
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

28
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,340
 Just help spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

29
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,340
 Word of mouth helps the show grow.

30
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,840
 Sean, we got a lot of stuff to cover, so no time to dilly-dally.

31
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,340
 I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jollopy.

32
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,340
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We're going all the way out to the corner of the liquor store.

33
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,840
 We're buying more cloves. But then, we're headed all the way out to Dallas, Texas.

34
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,840
 (imitates car engine)

35
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,340
 This was weird. This is a really, really weird story. And I found out about this maybe an hour ago.

36
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,340
 I was actually just reading the news, looking at stuff, and this popped up.

37
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,340
 It was an article on The Daily Beast that I said, "This is what is wrong."

38
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,840
 Or right, depending on the way of looking at things with conspiracy culture.

39
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,840
 I did not know this happened. Now, if this event had come out a year ago,

40
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,840
 we totally would have covered it on the-- we would have known about this event before it happened.

41
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,340
 We would have been able to make fun of it as it was coming up.

42
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:37,340
 But we've entered a new level of conspiracy theory content coverage,

43
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,340
 where stories are no longer getting out there.

44
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,340
 I mean, you guys know the reason why. Stuff's getting demonetized.

45
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,840
 And there are certain conspiracy theories you just can't talk about anymore.

46
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,840
 They'll shut down your Twitter, they'll shut down your YouTube, shut down your podcast.

47
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,840
 Now, some people say that it's a necessary evil. Some people say it's a necessary good.

48
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,840
 Some people don't like it at all. But let's take a look and see what's going on in Dallas, Texas.

49
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:09,840
 November 2nd, 2021, Sean is driving the Jason Jalopy down the streets of Dallas, Texas.

50
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,840
 And you start to realize something. This path he's driving on looks quite familiar.

51
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:21,840
 It's almost as if I've seen it in a 16-millimeter short film a long time ago.

52
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,840
 What's that place called? Healy Plaza? Dealey Plaza?

53
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,840
 It's where John F. Kennedy, President John F. Kennedy, was assassinated.

54
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,840
 [imitates explosion]

55
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:39,340
 Brains everywhere. You-- I mean, it's a iconic-- it's disturbing, but it's an iconic part of American history.

56
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,340
 We're watching as a president.

57
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,840
 It's his brains blowing out. There's no other way around it. Like, he didn't die there.

58
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,840
 It wasn't a peaceful thing. You died on an operating table.

59
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,840
 You guys might think it's unsensitive. [laughs]

60
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,840
 And I keep saying his brains get blown out, but that's what happened.

61
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,840
 We saw this.

62
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,840
 Now, there's been tons of conspiracy theories about who shot him.

63
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,340
 But there's not-- there's very few conspiracy theories that say he was never shot.

64
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,840
 Because we saw that.

65
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,340
 We did a whole episode that JFK may have shot himself. We covered all these different conspiracy theories.

66
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,340
 I'll put that in the show notes. That's an old one.

67
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:22,340
 But very rarely do you hear a conspiracy theory saying he didn't get shot.

68
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:27,340
 Because we saw that. So, I did not know that this-- I knew that conspiracy theory was out there,

69
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:34,340
 but I didn't know it was so popular that on November 2nd, 2021, hundreds--

70
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:39,840
 hundreds of people from across the country showed up to-- I think it's Dealey Plaza.

71
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,840
 I didn't write it in my notes, but--

72
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,340
 They showed up to where John F. Kennedy died on November 2nd, 2021.

73
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,340
 They showed up to that place by the Grassy Knoll. You guys know all that stuff.

74
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,840
 Better than I do. I don't even know the name of the place.

75
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,840
 Why were they there? Were they there sightseeing when they were on the most depressing tour ever?

76
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:08,340
 No. These are-- This is what's described as a splinter faction of a splinter faction of QAnon.

77
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:14,340
 Which has been completely driven off mainstream sites.

78
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,340
 But on Telegram-- Which is another social network, apparently. I've never used it.

79
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:25,340
 But on Telegram, apparently they've been organizing this for a while.

80
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,840
 There are these channels on Telegram that have like 98,000 subscribers.

81
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,840
 And using numerology, they were able to predict on November 2nd, 2021.

82
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,340
 If you stood-- If you stood at the Grassy Knoll right at noon-- Actually, I was about to make a joke,

83
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:45,840
 but that's literally what they were saying. If you go to this area at 12.30 p.m.

84
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,840
 A parade was going to start. This is-- This is absolutely insane.

85
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,340
 And even other people were pointing out being like, "Well, there's no permits filed with the city of Dallas for a parade."

86
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:03,340
 But that didn't stop these people because it's so insane you don't need a permit.

87
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,340
 It's so insane. So when people were trying to be logical, like, "I don't think this is actually going to happen."

88
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,840
 People were like, "No, honey, we're packing our bags. We're leaving behind New York. We're flying out to Dallas.

89
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,340
 We have to be there at 12.30 on November 2nd, 2021."

90
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:21,840
 Hundreds of people showed up because at 12.30 p.m. a parade was going to start.

91
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,840
 And the leader of this parade was going to be John F. Kennedy,

92
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,840
 which I might be considered tasteless for saying his brains got blown out constantly,

93
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:38,840
 but he's pretty tasteless if he's actually holding a parade where he faked his death.

94
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:45,840
 It's him. It's supposed to be his son, John F. Kennedy Jr., who was a big character in the QAnon mythos.

95
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,340
 He died in a plane crash in 1999.

96
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:53,840
 And that part of the QAnon-- I've said that enough to completely get this podcast shut down, but we're just going to keep going here.

97
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:00,340
 That part of the QAnon mythos is he faked his death and teamed up with Donald Trump.

98
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,340
 And he's going to be the vice president.

99
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,840
 Like, this has been an ongoing thing that Trump's going to show up.

100
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,340
 And John F. Kennedy Jr. is going to show up and it's going to, like, unite people,

101
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:18,340
 because people love people who faked their death and something Americans just can't stop voting for.

102
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,340
 They're going to have this parade.

103
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,840
 John F. Kennedy and John F. Kennedy Jr. walking down the street.

104
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,340
 And, I mean, that doesn't need a parade!

105
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:31,840
 If they literally showed up out of the blue, even if one of them--

106
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,840
 Like, John F. Kennedy, if John F. Kennedy showed up, he'd be like, what, like 90 now?

107
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,340
 He'd be like this old-- look at me, look at me.

108
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,840
 My brain's intact.

109
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,340
 Like, it would be impressive, but it wouldn't be-- like, you wouldn't recognize him, right?

110
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,340
 You wouldn't really recognize old John F. Kennedy.

111
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,340
 But if you saw-- actually, nothing about it.

112
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:55,340
 I wouldn't recognize John F. Kennedy Jr. if he walked in my apartment right now.

113
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,840
 He was a good-looking guy in 1999.

114
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,340
 I'm sure he's still, like, ruggedly handsome, but I don't know.

115
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,840
 But if you have this going on, this conspiracy theory that they're going to show up,

116
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,840
 there's going to be this big parade.

117
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:12,840
 The parade is made up of dead celebrities.

118
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,840
 These dead celebrities are also people who faked their death.

119
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,840
 So, in this parade-- this sounds like the most--

120
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,840
 This would make me not want to vote for these guys, right?

121
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,840
 I don't care what their platform is.

122
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,840
 John F. Kennedy and John F. Kennedy Jr. walking down the street.

123
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,840
 The other people behind them is Debbie Reynolds.

124
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,840
 You know, Debbie Reynolds from "Singin' in the Rain."

125
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,840
 Her. That one thing that she did.

126
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,840
 And I think she was Princess Leia's mom.

127
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,840
 Richard Pryor.

128
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,840
 Richard Pryor, world-famous comedian.

129
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,840
 Hey, Richard Pryor.

130
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,840
 Dale Earnhardt. That's dope, right?

131
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,340
 I might get a vote for that, dude.

132
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,340
 And Robin Williams.

133
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,340
 So, you're walking down the-- that's not even a parade, by the way.

134
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,840
 That's totally five or six people.

135
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,840
 John, here's the thing.

136
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,840
 It didn't happen.

137
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,840
 If you're scrambling to the news, if you're turning on CNN, Fox News right now,

138
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,840
 to find out what Robin Williams is alive, it didn't happen.

139
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,340
 They waited there and waited there and waited there.

140
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,840
 1230 goes by.

141
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,840
 No parade.

142
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,840
 And then the person who made the prediction apparently was there, and he goes,

143
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,840
 "Oh, oh, there's actually a Rolling Stones concert in town today,

144
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,840
 and I bet you anything, they're all gonna come out to see the Rolling Stones."

145
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,840
 And everyone's like, "Ah!"

146
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,840
 So they went to the Rolling Stones concert,

147
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:39,840
 which now makes me think that it was just this entire marketing scheme for the Rolling Stones concert.

148
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,840
 They didn't all go to the Rolling Stones concert.

149
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:47,840
 Some of them said, "Oh, we've been bamboozled," which is the hardest thing to do.

150
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,840
 And I know how the mindset is of a conspiracy theorist, because I'm a conspiracy theorist.

151
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,840
 And I used to believe a lot of this stuff, a lot of this stuff,

152
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,840
 and you're sitting there, they're telling their friends in New York for months, for a year.

153
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:06,840
 They've been trying to convince their friends and their family that QAnon, this whole thing, is real.

154
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,840
 Trust the plan, two more weeks, and then they get a prophecy.

155
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,840
 And their friends humor them, right?

156
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,840
 The family probably takes them to task, and it makes you double down.

157
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,840
 It really makes you double down.

158
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,840
 And so when the prophecy comes up and someone that you admire is on the internet saying,

159
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,840
 "At this point in time, John F. Kennedy Jr. and John F. Kennedy is going to be walking down the street."

160
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,840
 You know, pack your bags, guys. Let's come on down here.

161
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:42,840
 You'll be one of the first people to see John F. Kennedy alive again.

162
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:48,840
 And really what they're saying is, "You will be one of the first people to be able to say, 'I told you so.'"

163
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:55,840
 All those months that I was talking about this conspiracy theory stuff, and all those months you humored me,

164
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:03,840
 or you ignored me, or you called me a loony bird, I will be right on November 2, 2021.

165
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:14,840
 So they pack their bags, they travel from all over the United States, and they're wrong.

166
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:19,840
 What does that do, right? What does that do to you?

167
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,840
 Because now you've got to go, you've told your friends and your family, "Oh, no, this is it. This is it."

168
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,840
 I know I said two more weeks for the past 52 weeks, but this is it.

169
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:34,840
 And you have to go back home, and you have to admit you were wrong.

170
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,840
 Conspiracy theories always seem to work better when they're very open-ended.

171
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:43,840
 Like 9/11 truth, could you imagine if when the 9/11 truth or conspiracy theory started,

172
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,840
 the main thing was we'll know the truth by 2003. By 2003, he'll be impeached.

173
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,840
 George Bush will be impeached, this all come out.

174
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:56,840
 If they put a time limit on it like that, it would have died out after that time limit.

175
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,840
 But they didn't, which was smart.

176
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,840
 It's just fat, but what's fat? So we can keep breaking it down like that, but what's really fascinating is,

177
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,840
 I did not even know this happened.

178
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:13,840
 I spend a good chunk of my day reading this stuff, and what's happened is we've pushed this underground.

179
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,840
 We've pushed these conspiracy theories underground.

180
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,840
 When a year ago, we totally would have seen this on the export, right?

181
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,840
 So it's, people aren't talking about it. People are afraid to get demonetized, which, fine, I get it.

182
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,840
 The networks don't want this stuff on there. They're taking it off.

183
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:33,840
 They're demonetizing it. They're removing it. They're deleting channels. I get that.

184
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:42,840
 But the blowback from that is this movement grew to the point that hundreds of people traveled from across the country to go to this thing.

185
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:49,840
 This was not a small movement. Getting hundreds of people to do anything is hard.

186
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:54,840
 I think the more you push it underneath, the bigger it's going to get.

187
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:01,840
 And not only will it get bigger, you won't know what's going on until something really, really bad happens.

188
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,840
 That's actually a perfect segue for our next story.

189
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,840
 Sean, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the carpenter copter.

190
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:15,840
 We are leaving behind Dallas. We are headed all the way out to a laboratory in the middle of nowhere.

191
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,840
 [imitates carpenters]

192
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:26,840
 Sean is flying this carpenter copter nice and low over the forest and reaching down and grabbing berries as we're going by.

193
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:36,840
 We're flying to a little research center in the middle of nowhere because this truly is a scientific experiment you would never want the world to know about.

194
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,840
 We walk into this research center. We got on our lap coats and our little ID badges.

195
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:47,840
 We're walking around. We're happy. This was our first day of work starting at starting work at the remote research center incorporated.

196
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,840
 We're walking around and people are like, "Oh, you are the new cadets."

197
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,840
 That's a word to use in science, right?

198
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,840
 We're going to lead you into this room and you'd start doing work.

199
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,840
 We hope you're qualified for whatever we've hired you for.

200
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:08,840
 So we go in this room and we see all these cages, a bunch of cages.

201
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:15,840
 We go, "That's weird. I was expecting this to be a free roaming scientific lab. Pigs and possums everywhere."

202
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,840
 Whatever we experiment on.

203
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:25,840
 But when we go and we see these cages and we're walking by, we hear someone go, "Help me."

204
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,840
 Look down. What? Where'd that come from?

205
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,840
 We look towards the cage. Like this theater of the month. There's people in the cages, okay?

206
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,840
 I'm just going to cut to the chase. There's people in the cages.

207
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,840
 We see. We don't know why we didn't notice this at first. We were too busy looking for possums.

208
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,840
 Row after row after row of humans and cages and we're like, "What is going on here?"

209
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:52,840
 The head scientist walks in and he goes, "Hello, cadets. It is your job now to put the vaccine on YouTube."

210
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,840
 Hold on, YouTube. Hold on to Spotify. Before you remove the podcast, please let me explain.

211
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:03,840
 I do not believe any of this, okay? This is a conspiracy theory that people actually believe

212
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,840
 and we do have to expose this stuff because this one's dangerous.

213
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:16,840
 This guy's a newcomer to the conspiracy theory scene and he is off the charts already.

214
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:22,840
 Back to the narrative. You have seen those vaccines over there, guys?

215
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:28,840
 We need you to inject those vaccines into those people in cages and we're like, "Well, why are they in cages, right?

216
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:33,840
 Can't they just get the vaccine if they want? Why do we got to give these guys the vaccine against their will?

217
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,840
 Like they can just go to Rite Aid or something like that."

218
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,840
 And that's when the scientist, he laughs, he rubs his belly.

219
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,840
 He didn't know, he didn't picture him as a big fat guy.

220
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:40,840
 "Oh, oh, oh, oh, it's chocolate." "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

221
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:55,840
 Oh, you foolish mortals. Did you get the vaccine yourself? Maybe we should have hired someone else, someone who wasn't...

222
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,840
 ...accripted.

223
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,840
 And like what?

224
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:03,840
 And that's when we... that's when he directs us all to look in a giant mirror.

225
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:07,840
 We are monsters.

226
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,840
 Ahhhh!

227
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,840
 That's as much scream as I can muster.

228
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:19,840
 Okay, so this is a conspiracy theory and I got to tell you, man, this guy's science is... it's legit.

229
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:27,840
 I mean, who out... would you take scientific advice from someone who wasn't named Juicin and Raw Foods Sun Boy?

230
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:34,840
 Not Sun Man! He still knows he has a long journey, but Juicin and Raw Foods Sun Boy.

231
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:39,840
 You know that this man, sorry, this boy, spends a lot of time being healthy.

232
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:47,840
 Juicin stuff, you know, Juicin carrots and celery and milk, and he eats Raw Foods.

233
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,840
 Like those three things I just named.

234
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,840
 And I'm assuming he gets a lot of sun.

235
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:59,840
 Although I do have a sneaking suspicion that when he says "Sun Boy", I can't prove this.

236
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,840
 So if I'm in court right now trying to defend this...

237
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,840
 I'm not guilty, Your Honor.

238
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,840
 I think he might be a Sun Starer.

239
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,840
 We've talked about those guys before, you can't understand.

240
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:16,840
 If you can't understand my speech impediment, someone who stares into the sun, a Sun Starer.

241
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,840
 Stargazing? No, that's a legit thing.

242
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,840
 Sungazing.

243
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,840
 I'll put an episode on the show notes. We covered it a long time ago, but it's people who believe you can get healthy.

244
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,840
 The longer you stare at the sun, your retinas open up and it...

245
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:36,840
 I mean, this is lunatic... Okay, to be fair, I don't know if Juicin Sun Boy does this, but the Sungazing, again, is just lunacy.

246
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,840
 Lunacy.

247
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,840
 But I don't know if he does that.

248
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,840
 This guy's real name, I didn't dox him.

249
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,840
 He posts it on his website all over the place.

250
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,840
 It's Don Bradley.

251
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,840
 And he says he's been fighting the good fight for two decades.

252
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:55,840
 And so when I say he's new to the cause, he might have been doing the conspiracy stuff for decades.

253
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,840
 But his website is popping up all over the place.

254
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,840
 I have all sorts of ways of finding stories.

255
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:09,840
 I'm constantly looking for stuff, and his website is getting referenced constantly by a bunch of different sources that I check out.

256
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,840
 So this guy's becoming a major player in the game.

257
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,840
 If you go to his website, it says he has 19 followers, but I think that's because it's Blogger.

258
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,840
 And nobody uses Blogger, and I think you have to have a Blogger account.

259
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,840
 But his page reads, I imagine, is much higher than 19.

260
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,840
 This guy's an up and comer.

261
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,840
 This is what he believes.

262
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,840
 He has videos about this, too.

263
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,840
 This is very into the rumble community.

264
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:41,840
 When you get the vaccine, it allows a demon to enter your body.

265
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:49,840
 And this will slowly turn you into a skinwalker, or crawler, or rake.

266
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,840
 It's the term that he commonly uses as rake, but it's all kind of mushed together.

267
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:59,840
 It's these very large, gangly creatures, and they're just gross looking, right?

268
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,840
 They do look pretty disgusting.

269
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,840
 I wouldn't want to become one.

270
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:08,840
 And you become this, and then you have an insatiable need to feast on human flesh.

271
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,840
 What's interesting about the skinwalker is that I did an episode on this.

272
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,840
 I saw a crawler.

273
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,840
 I didn't know what it was.

274
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,840
 I figured it was something weird.

275
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,840
 I didn't know what it was, if it was a ghost or like a bear with mange.

276
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,840
 A lot of people think it's that, which is equally terrifying.

277
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,840
 I've seen him twice.

278
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,840
 So I'm twice, and it was maybe in a matter of like a week.

279
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,840
 So it could have been a big giant wolf with mange walking around, right?

280
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,840
 But I saw it, and I didn't really know what it was.

281
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,840
 I didn't really know how to classify it.

282
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,840
 I mentioned it on the episode almost offhandedly.

283
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,840
 I was like, "Oh yeah, one day I saw this thing.

284
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,840
 I think I told the story a little more passionately than that."

285
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,840
 But it wasn't the main thrust of the episode.

286
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,840
 And then after that I found out that this was something called a crawler.

287
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,840
 There's sightings of them all over.

288
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,840
 I was aware of the term rake.

289
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,840
 I was aware of the creepypasta, but I never put the two and two together.

290
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:04,840
 And as far as skinwalkers go, I just figured they were some sort of nature beast

291
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,840
 that can mimic people's voices, smell like wet pennies, all this stuff.

292
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,840
 So now we're having this combination of all these things.

293
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,840
 And I think that's fair.

294
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,840
 I think you could combine them in a sense.

295
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:22,840
 But Sunboy is saying that when you get the vaccine, you become a skinwalker.

296
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,840
 And you have this insatiable need for flesh.

297
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,840
 And I know what you're thinking when somebody tells you this.

298
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,840
 Your first thing is, "Can I get a booster shot?

299
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,840
 Can I get the vaccine right now so I can quickly turn into this monster

300
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,840
 who feeds on flesh?"

301
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,840
 Well, you can't get those things.

302
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,840
 I don't think it's actually going to...

303
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,840
 Well, let me phrase that.

304
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,840
 It's not going to do those things.

305
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,840
 But I think your second question is, "What would be the point?

306
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,840
 What would be the point of turning 90% of the world's population

307
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,840
 into bloody monsters running around, aim people?"

308
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,840
 And that's always the thing that's missing in these conspiracy theories.

309
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,840
 The idea of the Illuminati taking over the planet and culling the population.

310
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,840
 There's only 3 million people left on the planet.

311
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,840
 And now they rule.

312
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,840
 And then the question I was asking, "Then what?"

313
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,840
 Think about it, this is what I've always thought was so weird.

314
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,840
 You have the Illuminati, this conspiracy theory.

315
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,840
 And they're trying to depopulate the planet.

316
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,840
 They're trying to cut it down to 11 million people

317
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,840
 or whatever was written on the Georgia Guidestones.

318
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,840
 And then what is always my question?

319
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:28,840
 Because the only people left out of that 11 million would be the most insufferable, manipulative people ever

320
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:34,840
 because they killed off 6.9 billion other people.

321
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,840
 You wouldn't want to hang out with those maniacs.

322
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,840
 The second the Illuminati plan goes into action, they're slitting each other's throats.

323
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,840
 And they know it.

324
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,840
 But the problem is that the conspiracy theorists are like,

325
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,840
 "Oh no, they should be afraid of these groups, right?

326
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,840
 Trying to take over the world and things like that."

327
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,840
 But it's never gonna work.

328
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,840
 And we all, if you put any sort of thought into it, the second they went into motion,

329
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,840
 you think Bill Gates is gonna be have one arm around George Soros

330
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,840
 and the other around the Koch brothers and be like,

331
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,840
 "It's finally happening, we're finally released this virus that's gonna kill everyone."

332
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,840
 And now we're in chart--

333
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,840
 No, no, those guys hate each other.

334
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:18,840
 Did you imagine being on a planet the only people left are the richest, most manipulative, evil people ever?

335
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,840
 You want to rule over sheep.

336
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,840
 You don't want to spend the last days of humanity

337
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,840
 tearing at wolf flesh as they tear at yours.

338
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,840
 So that's the thing that always when you take, go keep going steps forward.

339
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,840
 That's when the conspiracy theories fall apart.

340
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,840
 So imagine if 80% of the population of America became flesh-eating ghouls

341
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,840
 that had the powers of skinwalkers.

342
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,840
 They can mimic, they can crawl up walls, they're really fast.

343
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,840
 Okay, then what?

344
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,840
 Then what?

345
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,840
 Are those ghouls gonna be electing people?

346
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,840
 Or are those ghouls gonna be paying taxes?

347
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,840
 It doesn't make any sense.

348
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,840
 Why Bill Gates would want to turn the world into ghouls, into flesh-eating ghouls.

349
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:02,840
 Unless he just wants more friends, because Jeffrey Epstein's dead and he misses them.

350
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:08,840
 This conspiracy theory as goofy as it is is super, super dangerous.

351
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,840
 And it's not dangerous in the way that you're thinking.

352
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,840
 I don't think--

353
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,840
 I'm sure there are people who hear something like this and go, "I'm not getting vaccinated."

354
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,840
 I'm sure there are people who go, "What? I don't want to become a skinwalker.

355
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,840
 If I became Bigfoot, I might do it, but I don't want to become a skinwalker.

356
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,840
 I'm not getting vaccinated."

357
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,840
 That's not why I think it's dangerous.

358
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,840
 I think it's dangerous because this guy who's really, I think, starting to blow up in the community,

359
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,840
 the reason why it's dangerous is because he states that once this process begins,

360
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,840
 once you've gotten the injection and you start to become the crawler or the skinwalker,

361
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,840
 it's too late.

362
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:49,840
 The only thing you can do is kill them.

363
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,840
 And this is such a weird, weird addition to that.

364
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,840
 And any future victims it wants to eat.

365
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,840
 What?

366
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,840
 Not currently eating, not putting them out of their misery.

367
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,840
 If someone already has the vaccine, you have to terminate him.

368
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,840
 That's the terminology you use, terminate.

369
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,840
 And any future victims it wants to eat.

370
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,840
 Bizarre conspiracy theory.

371
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,840
 That's the dangerous part.

372
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:24,840
 People can disagree, but imagine just clapping someone in the back of the head, J.F.K. style,

373
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:29,840
 because you're afraid he's going to become a skinwalker because he got the vaccine.

374
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:35,840
 Well, that might sound absurd, but as I'm reading this guy's rants,

375
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,840
 I'm remembering very clearly a story that just happened not too long ago.

376
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,840
 Not too long ago, September 30th, 2021, Howard County, Maryland.

377
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,840
 Jeffrey Burnham, 46-year-old man, this is all a legend.

378
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,840
 Jeffrey Burnham, 46-year-old man.

379
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,840
 His brother was a pharmacist who was giving out the vaccine.

380
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,840
 And he was arguing with his brother and he was telling his mom,

381
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,840
 "I know there's something in the vaccine and Brian knows there's something in the vaccine,"

382
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,840
 and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

383
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,840
 And he needed to get to the bottom of it.

384
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,840
 And he needed to solve this problem.

385
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,840
 Not just for himself, but for the rest of us.

386
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,840
 He murdered an old lady, an 86-year-old woman,

387
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:27,840
 stole her car, drove to his brother's house, and murdered his brother and his brother's wife.

388
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,840
 See, that's not someone who disagrees with vaccine mandates.

389
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,840
 That's not someone who is anti-vax.

390
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,840
 I mean, he's probably those things as well.

391
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,840
 His issue wasn't simply the vaccine mandate.

392
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,840
 His issue simply wasn't personal choice. I don't want to get the vaccine.

393
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,840
 His issue was some bizarre conspiracy theory

394
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,840
 that his brother was doing untold damage to civilization so he executed three people.

395
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,840
 It's not that we agree to disagree situation.

396
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,840
 Not a personal choice type of thing.

397
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,840
 He believed in conspiracy theory so much that he killed three people.

398
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,840
 And how many times have we covered people like this on the show?

399
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,840
 We had the guy who wanted the AIG report released.

400
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,840
 That's an old episode.

401
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:19,840
 There he was supposed to be that AIG report released that would exonerate Trump and get Hillary arrested.

402
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,840
 And this was like way early on in Trump's presidency.

403
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:29,840
 He took an armored car and blocked the road to the Hudson Dam, I think it was.

404
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,840
 And we had the guy who during the coronavirus panic when it first started wanted to expose the secret.

405
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,840
 Everyone Trump ordered those boats off the coasts because we didn't know how bad it was going to get.

406
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,840
 We didn't need them but we didn't know at the time.

407
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:45,840
 We ordered those boats off to the coasts and he took a train he was driving.

408
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,840
 You remember this? We did this episode.

409
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:54,840
 He drove a train off the tracks hoping to run it into a navy vessel.

410
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,840
 And when he crashed into it, it would expose the truth.

411
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:03,840
 It would expose to the world that they were lying about COVID.

412
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,840
 Now the armored car guy I think he ended up getting like 15 years in prison.

413
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,840
 He's done. I don't remember off the top of my head.

414
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,840
 And the train guy I think that trial is still going on.

415
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:21,840
 But that's the thing. Conspiracy theories are fun. Some of them are true.

416
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,840
 A lot of them aren't but they're fun to talk about or they're fun to daydream about.

417
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,840
 That'd be cool.

418
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,840
 If 80% of the world became ghouls as long as I'm not one of the ghouls

419
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,840
 and I get to fight the ghouls, however, if I be, I'm gonna say this.

420
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,840
 If I ever become a zombie or a ghoul and I don't get to eat at least one person,

421
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,840
 I'm gonna be super disappointed.

422
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,840
 I hope it's not someone close to me. I hope it's not like I dine my sleep

423
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,840
 and then I wake up and I go "Argh!" and I bite the survivor next to me.

424
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,840
 But John F. Kennedy Jr. he was so handsome I couldn't resist.

425
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,840
 I hope it's not that but if I become a zombie,

426
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,840
 I hope I'm allowed to just wander the wilderness for a while

427
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,840
 and kind of like look up at the stars a bit and chase a couple squirrels

428
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,840
 and then maybe attack a bad guy right before he's about to do a bad thing.

429
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,840
 He has the gun and he's doing the monologue and I sneak up and I take a bite out of his neck.

430
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,840
 I'm down. I want to, if I'm gonna become a zombie, I don't want to be a zombie or a ghoul.

431
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,840
 But if I have to be one, I want to eat at least one person.

432
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,840
 Because that's part of the experience, right?

433
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,840
 If you don't, that's like going to Paris and not seeing the Eiffel Tower.

434
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,840
 It's fun to explore conspiracy theories but just some people take these so seriously

435
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,840
 and some people just throw gas on that fire constantly.

436
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,840
 This guy has post after he's really putting out a lot of content.

437
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,840
 He has this thing called Black-Eyed Babies.

438
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,840
 You thought Black-Eyed Children were a problem.

439
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,840
 Get ready for the new version. It's Black-Eyed Babies.

440
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:48,840
 They grow four times as fast and they can talk by four months or something like that.

441
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,840
 I don't know anything about babies.

442
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,840
 For all I know that's normal but they have Black-Eyes, right?

443
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,840
 That's not normal. Black-Eyed Babies.

444
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,840
 Do you know Dibbock in reverse is phonetically COVID?

445
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,840
 So like a Dibbock box? I don't even know where he was going with that.

446
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:09,840
 I don't even think that's true but Dibbock in reverse phonetically is COVID.

447
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,840
 So he's attaching the COVID virus to the Dibbock box which is actually something

448
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,840
 we totally debunked for that episode in the show notes.

449
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:24,840
 It's this box that's supposed to hold a Jewish demon so make of that what you will.

450
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,840
 And then he has a video. I haven't watched it yet.

451
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,840
 This is a bit of a cliffhanger. I'll watch it tomorrow and get back to you maybe.

452
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,840
 He has a video. I never mind. I'm just gonna watch it right now.

453
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,840
 Let's see how, let's see what it's got.

454
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,840
 Because I'm so curious about this video. This is the description.

455
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,840
 Chef Goonter who was happy to feed you the dead.

456
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,840
 I'm like yummy, yummy, yummy. I just became a skinwalker.

457
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:51,840
 Chef Goonter who was happy to feed you the dead is having a special today.

458
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,840
 This is so bizarre. I think I'm gonna be going to this guy's website a lot.

459
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,840
 He's having a special today. Braised?

460
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,840
 I think that's like when you put sauce on them.

461
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,840
 Braised white girl in a sphincter sauce.

462
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,840
 You're like Jason, please don't watch this video bro.

463
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,840
 Please don't watch this video. Here, I gotta.

464
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,840
 Because I don't think it's anything grow.

465
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,840
 I mean I don't know. It's on rumble. Who knows what it could be.

466
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,840
 It's all go to LiveLeak to check this out.

467
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,840
 Let's see what this is and then we'll wrap the episode up.

468
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:31,840
 That was a prank show actually. I just watched the clip so.

469
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:37,840
 I know you guys are all hoping that I had stumbled across a real life footage of cannibalism.

470
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,840
 So I would no longer want to eat people as a zombie.

471
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,840
 Yeah, it was a prank show. I don't know why conspiracy theorists have the worst sense of humor.

472
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:49,840
 Have you guys noticed that? They cannot take a joke at all.

473
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,840
 Every joke is some sort of coded message.

474
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:57,840
 So it makes sense that this is a David Spade show and he watches it and he thinks,

475
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,840
 "Wow, this is real." This is real. He says it's normalizing it.

476
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,840
 It's normalizing. But whatever dude.

477
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:12,840
 Just get a sense of humor. This stuff isn't real and I'm just really really afraid

478
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:18,840
 that his teachings are gonna end really badly for a lot of innocent people.

479
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,840
 Or maybe just even one, right?

480
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,840
 I'm not the thought police. I can't tell him to stop writing this stuff.

481
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,840
 But there's... I'm just afraid that someone is truly going to believe

482
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,840
 that if you do this, if you get this vaccine, you're gonna become a demon

483
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:41,840
 and the only way to stop it is to kill the person who took the vaccine.

484
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:46,840
 That's a dangerous conspiracy theory and it's dangerous on a very personal level.

485
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:51,840
 Government did 9/11. You can not pay your taxes. You can hate the government.

486
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,840
 You can vote for someone different.

487
00:31:53,840 --> 00:32:02,840
 This conspiracy theory is if you know someone who got vaccinated, only you know what to do about it.

488
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:10,840
 That is a terrifying message to spread to people who already have a hard time telling the difference

489
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:18,840
 between truth and fiction, between a prank show and real life.
