1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
 A bizarre series of reviews appear on the internet movie database.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,360
 Are they the rantteens of a lunatic?

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,560
 Or the ravings of a madman?

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:15,080
 And then we blast off and join the astronaut John Smith in outer space.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,600
 Some people say he never existed.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,720
 Some people say there's two of him.

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,160
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:30,000
 [Music]

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,880
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,880
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,880
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,080
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,840
 I hope you guys have some awesome plans for this weekend.

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,680
 First off, I want to give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Lawrence Herbert.

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,880
 Everyone give a round of applause.

16
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,880
 He's walking in.

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,880
 Fireworks are going off.

18
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,880
 He didn't expect that.

19
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,880
 It's kind of scaring him.

20
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,880
 But it's okay.

21
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,880
 He remains his composure.

22
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,960
 Lawrence, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,400
 If you can't deploy the Patreon, that's fine too.

24
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,960
 Just help get the word out about the show.

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,000
 That also really helps out a lot.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,600
 Also today is the first time we are doing Fan Art Friday.

27
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,800
 Today's Fan Art was provided by Paulie Heikilla.

28
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,120
 Paulie Heikilla from Finland.

29
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,600
 So everyone, tip of your hat.

30
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,400
 Or what else do you do?

31
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,400
 Kicking your shoes?

32
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,600
 To Paulie, thank you so much for providing this artwork.

33
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,600
 It's kind of spooky.

34
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,200
 It looks a little punk rock.

35
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
 I love it.

36
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,640
 If you want to have your artwork sent in for Fan Art Friday, just go ahead and email it

37
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,600
 to me or post it on Instagram or whatever.

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,320
 However, you get in contact with me, Weegeeboard.

39
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,840
 You send spirits after me.

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,080
 And just say I have permission to use your artwork and I will go ahead and get it posted

41
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,760
 for Fan Art Friday.

42
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,080
 So Lawrence, I'm actually going to give you the keys to a new vehicle.

43
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,760
 We're using this for the first time.

44
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,560
 The Dead Rabbit Data Disk.

45
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,800
 Actually, I guess it's more like one of those Frisbees from Tron.

46
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,560
 So all of a sudden Lawrence is wearing a Tron suit.

47
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,760
 He's like, "Oh, man, I paid too much for those other clothes.

48
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,760
 Am I going to get them back?"

49
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,760
 I'm like, "No.

50
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,120
 They've been digitized and they're gone forever.

51
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,040
 Now you look like Tron."

52
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:08,600
 And he pulls the Frisbee off of his back and he beams us into the internet.

53
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
 We're flying.

54
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,200
 A bunch of graphics or a bunch of clip art.

55
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,600
 We're flying through a tunnel of clip art.

56
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,020
 We see like a little cat dancing.

57
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:22,480
 He takes us into the internet and then finally we land in the internet movie database.

58
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,520
 It's just hundreds of thousands of films all playing at the same time and we're just kind

59
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,360
 of walking through the void watching them.

60
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,120
 We start to see a movie review pop up on 171 different films.

61
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:40,000
 They're all the same review, regardless of the film, regardless of the genre, horror,

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,680
 sci-fi, action.

63
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,680
 They're all exactly the same.

64
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,820
 They're all posted by a guy named Bob Piano Snailcat Dog, a Gave ant bat.

65
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,260
 So that should kind of show you his mental state.

66
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,740
 That's the name he prefers to go by.

67
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,020
 "Oh, but you can call me ant bat."

68
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,380
 He says he pops out of the void.

69
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,620
 We didn't know he had a data disk as well.

70
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:06,260
 And so he's standing there now, a little ant bat, a little tiny ant sized bat, and he

71
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,860
 begins to tell us the reviews of his movies.

72
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,980
 Here they all are exactly the same.

73
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,520
 They're like, "How can you review 171 different movies with the exact same--?"

74
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,600
 Because they're not reviews.

75
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,240
 They're a diatribe, a rant, really.

76
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,320
 Imagine you're looking at the movie Troll's World Tour.

77
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,560
 This is one of the reviews you see.

78
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,760
 Four out of ten stars, by the way.

79
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:36,960
 Any contact with females is the dystopian road to babies, guys.

80
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,360
 I'm gonna say there's no grammar in this, so technically he's saying it's the road

81
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,700
 to baby guys, which is kind of adorable.

82
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:51,480
 But he's trying to warn us guys that women are the road to babies, which I think anyone

83
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,900
 over the age of 12 knows.

84
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,820
 But anyways, I will disagree, right?

85
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,780
 I mean, yeah, you can have babies with women.

86
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:05,200
 But any contact, like a fly lands on me and then a fly takes a little bit of my DNA and

87
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,660
 lands on a woman and then babies are made.

88
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,460
 And if so, I got a lot of kids out there.

89
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,960
 But what does this have to do with movies?

90
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,960
 Well, I'm not finished.

91
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,160
 That's not the whole review.

92
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,680
 He's trying to warn us, see, that women are the road to babies, guys.

93
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,400
 So what does this have to do with movies?

94
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:29,720
 Movies actually have subliminal messages in them to make us want to get with women.

95
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:35,120
 So if you had never seen a movie or a television show before, you would never want baby guys.

96
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,920
 But then, like a true maniac, he shifts gears, right?

97
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,180
 And we're like, okay, he's one of those guys.

98
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,680
 He shifts gears.

99
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,220
 Andrew Jackson was the greatest president behind Lincoln?

100
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,220
 Question mark.

101
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,620
 So even he's unsure about this.

102
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,140
 I don't know much about the legacy of Andrew Jackson, but President Lincoln's kind of hard

103
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,140
 to top.

104
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,100
 Andrew Jackson was the greatest president behind Lincoln.

105
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,740
 The only one, I'm really fixing, really fixing the grammar on this.

106
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:09,160
 The only one to return banks from shadowy organizations to American hands?

107
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,160
 Question mark.

108
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,080
 So either he did it or he didn't.

109
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,080
 I don't know.

110
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,080
 Right?

111
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,080
 Maybe he did.

112
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,440
 Maybe that's why he's on the $20 bill.

113
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,720
 Andrew Jackson was the greatest president behind Lincoln.

114
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,720
 Only one to return banks from shadowy organizations to American hands?

115
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,720
 Next sentence.

116
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,320
 Literally the next sentence.

117
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,240
 Mystery Science Theater 3000.

118
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,920
 New Seasons released.

119
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,780
 Truly extraordinary my moon rakers of this achievement of men.

120
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:41,220
 Listen, man, I know guys who are Migtow, Tupac was always MOB.

121
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,540
 That was always his catchphrase, which is basically the same thing as Migtow, except

122
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,140
 he expressed it as "money over bitches."

123
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,020
 But it's this idea of, and I know there's offshoots of it and you get into incel-cool,

124
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,980
 churn things like that, but basically this idea of focus on yourself.

125
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,740
 I think that's probably where it started, Migtow.

126
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:03,240
 Focus on internal development before you focus on women or don't focus on women at

127
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,240
 all.

128
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,240
 Like, whatever.

129
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,960
 However you want to put it, or you could just be like Tupac and say "money over bitches,"

130
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,720
 but what does Andrew Jackson have to do with any of this?

131
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,200
 Or Mystery Science Theater 3000.

132
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:19,960
 But apparently it does, because while he's still formulating his thesis that any contact

133
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,740
 with women is the road to baby guys, all of a sudden this pops in here.

134
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,680
 But then, I think, probably he got hit in the head with a football.

135
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,720
 While he was typing this out and he goes "oh, oh, thanks for jarring back my insane stream

136
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,560
 of consciousness football."

137
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,560
 He goes back into it.

138
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:41,240
 He explains that creativity and comedy is something that only men can do.

139
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,160
 And women suck the energy away from men.

140
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,120
 So when you have sex with a woman, let me state this, in case you didn't get to this

141
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,960
 already, I don't believe in this.

142
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,920
 I don't believe in this.

143
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:57,580
 But when a man has sex with a woman, because a man is so creative he can make these movies.

144
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,540
 See women can't make movies.

145
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,540
 All women can do is make babies.

146
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,180
 So a woman is jealous of the man's creativity.

147
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:11,020
 She's looking at Quentin Tarantino and she's like "ah no, no, he has ugly feet too so

148
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,140
 she'll never be in a Quentin Tarantino movie."

149
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,460
 And she's like "no, I must destroy Quentin Tarantino."

150
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,020
 So she knows she can't make a better movie than him.

151
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,180
 Maybe better than Jackie Brown.

152
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,160
 But she knows she can't make a movie better than him.

153
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
 Probably a better actor.

154
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,800
 But she knows she can't make a movie better than him.

155
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,840
 So she tries to suck his energy out by getting impregnated by him.

156
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,920
 Could you imagine having Quentin Tarantino as a dad?

157
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:40,040
 That would be the most horrifying experience ever.

158
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,800
 Eli Roth is your godfather.

159
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,040
 Oh my god, that would be horrible.

160
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,680
 Just fake blood everywhere.

161
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,880
 Or real blood, probably.

162
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,380
 But why is he posting this on the movie website now?

163
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:57,180
 Because he's saying that even though we all know these facts, that Andrew Jackson was

164
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:02,340
 the greatest president, maybe behind Abraham Lincoln, we know that Mr. Science Theater

165
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,740
 3000 is doing some sort of re-release.

166
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,820
 We know that women are second to creativity out of men.

167
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,500
 And the movies are the reason, guys.

168
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,980
 The movies are the reason.

169
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:18,560
 This is his quote, "Movies with humans have the hero and the girl trying to get with each

170
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,800
 other."

171
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,000
 They even include animals, which is a totally different movie.

172
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,320
 Those movies come out of Sweden.

173
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,360
 Movies with humans have the hero and girl trying to get with each other.

174
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,080
 They even include animals assuming human characteristics of that man-woman nonsense.

175
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,720
 So you see, the only reason why you're attracted, only reason you're interested in women is

176
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,060
 because you watched The Smurfs.

177
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,980
 Or The Smurfs 2, Lost in Manhattan.

178
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,980
 Any movie.

179
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,180
 There's only two movies that ever came out.

180
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:54,420
 I don't know how he figures out what happened before 1910.

181
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,460
 Before movies existed.

182
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,460
 We wrap it up.

183
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,260
 It should be fair.

184
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,020
 This guy has jumped all over the place.

185
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,220
 He starts going off on Spider-Man Far From Home.

186
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:08,300
 Again, these reviews are on The Queen or Troll's World Tour.

187
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,720
 These are all sorts of movies.

188
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,880
 But he says, "Even Spider-Man Far From Home had this romantic subplot which didn't really."

189
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,880
 I mean, there were women in it, but I guess that's enough for him.

190
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,680
 They did have the phallic imagery of Spider-Man crawling up the obelisk.

191
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,680
 What's that called?

192
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,680
 That's not the Lincoln Memorial.

193
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,680
 It's the Washington Monument.

194
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,680
 I'm such a bad American.

195
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,320
 You know, the giant penis looking thing in the middle of Washington, D.C.

196
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,840
 You did have Spider-Man clinging onto that and saving a woman inside, though I believe

197
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,260
 it's the Washington Monument.

198
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,980
 So I don't know, maybe that's phallic.

199
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:47,180
 Maybe the people in the elevator are supposed to represent the repressed semen.

200
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,340
 And Spider-Man was supposed to represent Mystery Science Theater 3000.

201
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:55,540
 And he's trying to pull those rereleases out, give them relief.

202
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,220
 But he says all this insane stuff, but he does wrap it up.

203
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,220
 He does.

204
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,020
 He is able to make a concise statement at the end.

205
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,020
 Here we go.

206
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,820
 "They," which I'm assuming is women in this case, "they want to grumble."

207
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,360
 "They want to grind up men, but it is I."

208
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,720
 This is also where it gets creepy, by the way.

209
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,000
 Like at first, you're just like this guy's a lunatic, but now you can imagine him sitting

210
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 in his bunker.

211
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,320
 Watch, cut.

212
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,480
 But now he gets a little more sinister.

213
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,880
 So they want to grind up men, but it is I who grind them into fine dust.

214
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,160
 Wear pink to take their power away.

215
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,160
 Question mark?

216
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,160
 Okay, anyways.

217
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,140
 Also, he's not done.

218
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:43,220
 He ends it like this, so now we know that he's a budding serial killer.

219
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,100
 His weapon of choice is a grindstone.

220
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,100
 He's just pushing around this giant stone.

221
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,180
 He's like, "Come here, ladies!"

222
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,180
 He's rolling down the street.

223
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:53,180
 Because the police are very slowly catching him, because they don't have to speed up.

224
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,940
 And he's wearing all pink, so that makes him very, very easy to catch.

225
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,180
 But he wraps it up with one of the most immortal sentences I think you could come across in

226
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:07,400
 a diatribe where he threatens to wear pink, grind women to dust while watching Mystery

227
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,920
 Science Theater 3000.

228
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,080
 Nintendo Mother Earthbound textbook to be released.

229
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,120
 Weeeeee, Bop piano.

230
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,120
 It's like on the one hand.

231
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,960
 On the one hand.

232
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:26,600
 I find it fascinating that this thought process exists.

233
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,560
 It doesn't actually shock me.

234
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,140
 Like I said, I know people who are not male supremacists, but I know people who are just

235
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,740
 like, "I don't like to date women."

236
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,900
 Like I'm not gay, I'm not bi, I just don't like to date women.

237
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,340
 I know people who don't like women.

238
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,820
 They just don't want to be around them at all.

239
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,260
 That's a little odd to me.

240
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,540
 And someone says, "Hey, I don't want to date.

241
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,660
 I want to focus on myself."

242
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,820
 I'm like, "Hey, that's totally fine."

243
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,300
 I actually suggest people, especially when they've gotten out of long relationships.

244
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,780
 I go, "Don't date anyone for like a year or two."

245
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,780
 No dates at all.

246
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,760
 They really use this time to focus and find out who you are.

247
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,240
 When you're a pair, you don't really figure out who you are.

248
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,400
 When you're part of a couple, you don't get to figure out who the single is.

249
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
 So I think that's important.

250
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,400
 And then there are some people who just expand that throughout their life and they go, "I

251
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,320
 just never had an interest."

252
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,440
 They may classify themselves as asexual.

253
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,000
 They just don't have an interest in any sexual relations with anybody.

254
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,740
 But they don't normally or ever really threaten to grind women up and to find

255
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,060
 dust.

256
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,480
 So that in and of itself is odd.

257
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,500
 But I mean, it's not shocking.

258
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:39,080
 The fact that he's posting these things on an internet movie database, I find interesting.

259
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,020
 And on the one hand, they've all been deleted at this point.

260
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:47,180
 I think I'm the only one who, me and Bob Piano are the only ones who have copies of this

261
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,740
 at this point.

262
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:53,940
 But I find it fascinating that he thought that this would be a good venue for it.

263
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,060
 Someone else is like, "Oh, I wonder if Mystery Science Theater 1000 ever did that re-release."

264
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,860
 They Google it and they're like, "Whoa, man.

265
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,980
 I totally agree with this stuff.

266
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,460
 I'd love to subscribe to your newsletter."

267
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,740
 I find that interesting that he thinks that this is like a legit argument.

268
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,260
 But let's put on our conspiracy caps for a moment, because this isn't just me reading

269
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,620
 the ramblings of a madman.

270
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,300
 This might be a coded message.

271
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,660
 And we've talked about this before.

272
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,500
 I've talked about this several times on the show.

273
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,540
 Let me explain how this would work.

274
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,500
 You have all of this nonsense.

275
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,140
 You have all of this stuff that's completely meaningless.

276
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:32,020
 You would have maybe three or four sentences that actually contain the code.

277
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,660
 Nintendo Mother Earthbound textbook to be released.

278
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,660
 Whee!

279
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,260
 Bob Piano.

280
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,620
 That could be part of the code.

281
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,780
 And then we have Mystery Science Theater 3000, New Seasons Released.

282
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,660
 Truly extraordinary, my moon rakers of this achievement of men.

283
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:52,220
 What's interesting is those phrases are so poorly written.

284
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:58,060
 And everything else, as insane as it is, is fairly grammatically correct.

285
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,220
 I'd say 90% grammatically correct.

286
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,420
 Those two sentences are meaningless.

287
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:07,020
 If you just put those two sentences in an internet movie database post, it's most likely

288
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:11,500
 just going to get flagged as spam and instantly deleted.

289
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:16,260
 He posted all of these reviews to 171 reviews over the matter of about two days.

290
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,420
 It was in August of this year, and they're gone now.

291
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,620
 But it'd be the perfect way to send a message to someone.

292
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:27,100
 So if you're a CIA agent in Istanbul, I always use Istanbul for a point of reference.

293
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,300
 I don't know why, but if you're a CIA agent in Istanbul, you're trying to communicate

294
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,060
 with someone else, Slovakia.

295
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,500
 And you know that person's a huge fan of the English patient.

296
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,100
 Throw this review on there.

297
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,980
 It seems like a coded message.

298
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:45,660
 So the perfect place to hide codes is in the ramblings of a madman, because they look like

299
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,660
 the ramblings of a madman.

300
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,500
 But if you know what the code is, it totally makes sense.

301
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,180
 So Lawrence, take us out of the digital world.

302
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,180
 We're leaving behind Bopianos.

303
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,020
 We're leaving these hot digital chicks walking up to him.

304
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,500
 He's like, no, no, can't resist the temptation.

305
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,500
 A bunch of babies appear.

306
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,980
 And we're like, oh no, he was right.

307
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,500
 The babies are forming a giant mountain to try to get us.

308
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,260
 We are back in the world of reality.

309
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,700
 Lawrence, call in that carboner copter.

310
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:16,940
 We're headed out to a secret NASA facility.

311
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,260
 Helicopters flying over the landscape.

312
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,260
 Lawrence is looking.

313
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:24,260
 He's like, oh no, I don't know if I'm going to be able to find it if it's secret.

314
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,380
 But he's keeping his doubts to himself.

315
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,860
 He just keeps giving us a thumbs up.

316
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,860
 We're almost there.

317
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,820
 And I'm like, all right, awesome.

318
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:37,260
 As he's flying us out, I bring up an old film projector.

319
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,460
 I'm showing you this old film strip.

320
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:45,540
 In October 1973, NASA wanted to steady orbital space.

321
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,220
 It was old, old timey special effects.

322
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,380
 It was just like a little moon held by a string.

323
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:57,100
 They decided to put astronaut John Smith inside a satellite.

324
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,300
 And everyone's like, look inside the satellite.

325
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,620
 And they're like, wait, what?

326
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,580
 Aren't satellites built to stay up there for a long time?

327
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,580
 I'm like, class, hold your questions till the end.

328
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,040
 NASA wanted a steady orbital space.

329
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,860
 So they wanted to put astronaut John Smith inside a satellite.

330
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:18,260
 Now it was actually a spaceship disguised as a satellite.

331
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:25,260
 The idea was to have John Smith pretend he was a satellite and just kind of float around

332
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,780
 for a while with a notebook writing down stuff about space.

333
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:34,700
 And the film strip, the film strip ends and you're like, I'm even more confused than you

334
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,260
 were before you started the film strip.

335
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,260
 I know.

336
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,700
 There's this conspiracy theory.

337
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:45,100
 It's from the website which has been a gold mine recently.

338
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,420
 It's called howanwise.com.

339
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:56,860
 What's interesting about this website is it looks like a legit nerd news science website.

340
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:02,420
 It looks like it's laid out to look like space.com or I never would have thought that.com or

341
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,140
 whatever those types of websites are.

342
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:13,940
 So they'll have articles like could a dinosaur breathe oxygen today or how much does something

343
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,580
 weigh when put on Mars or whatever.

344
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,940
 It's like science stuff that you would read while you're drinking your coffee so you could

345
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,420
 go to work and be like, hey, did you know a dinosaur couldn't breathe today?

346
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,700
 What are you talking about?

347
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,020
 That was a weird topic to bring up.

348
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,540
 It's one of those types of websites.

349
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,780
 Half of it, maybe one third of it is quirky fun facts.

350
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,260
 The dinosaur one wasn't one of them.

351
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:39,220
 Now that I'm thinking about it, now I'm thinking about it.

352
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:44,820
 If you took a dinosaur, it's totally become a different episode, if you took a T-Rex,

353
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,500
 because you know the carbon dioxide levels were different, that's why the plants were

354
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,620
 so big.

355
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:53,740
 If you took a T-Rex from the past and put him in the middle of Manhattan today, would

356
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,140
 he just have a heart attack?

357
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,500
 Everyone around him would have a heart attack because they didn't expect a T-Rex to just

358
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,500
 appear.

359
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:05,260
 But if you took a dinosaur and you dropped him into today's times, would he be able to

360
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,260
 breathe the oxygen?

361
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,660
 Jamie, look that up.

362
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,660
 Look that up.

363
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,140
 But while he's looking that up, and I'm sure you guys are going to look that up now, I'll

364
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,060
 check it out after the episode.

365
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,420
 But it has stuff like that.

366
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,460
 It has interesting science facts.

367
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:27,660
 But then a huge chunk of it is stories of, from saying in a play way, a dubious nature,

368
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,020
 unsourced stuff.

369
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:33,860
 Now actually, the story I did recently about the boy being reincarnated from Mars, I got

370
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,860
 from this website.

371
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,980
 So not all of it is nonsense.

372
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,860
 That one I was able to find other articles on.

373
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,020
 But I'm just giving you a little bit of a setup here.

374
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:48,660
 We may have found a new backpacker verse in howandwise.com, but the verdict is still out

375
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,660
 on that.

376
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:54,900
 But anyways, so they tell this story about astronaut John Smith being put into a spaceship

377
00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:03,180
 or rocket disguised as a satellite to run a scientific study on low orbit space.

378
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:07,020
 So just that part doesn't really make sense.

379
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,380
 Why doesn't he just fly around in a rocket ship or whatever is going on.

380
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,380
 But anyways, they put him in a satellite, I guess so he could maintain orbit for a while.

381
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:19,220
 But the problem is, is that he's up in that satellite and he's radio down to Earth.

382
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,220
 He's like, "Okay guys, this is awesome.

383
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,220
 I'm in the satellite.

384
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,220
 The mission was a success.

385
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,220
 I should have brought a coat."

386
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:28,180
 See, we're cold over here, but everything seems to be going A-okay.

387
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,980
 Let me just turn the ship a little bit to the left here.

388
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:39,180
 Hey guys, hey, did you guys test this thing out before you launched it, me and it?

389
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,180
 Before you launched me in this space coffin?

390
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,540
 And they go, "Yeah, yeah, we tested it out.

391
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,540
 Why what's going on?"

392
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,540
 He can't control it.

393
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,540
 He's like, "Oh no."

394
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,100
 He probably said a little more than that.

395
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,820
 He wasn't like, "Aw shucks.

396
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,820
 I want to starve to death in deep space."

397
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:59,820
 But the point is, is that they basically put him in a metal sphere to pretend he was a

398
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,100
 satellite and it didn't work.

399
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,820
 So he's just floating up there and NASA all of a sudden calls an emergency meeting and

400
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,620
 they're looking at everything.

401
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:12,020
 In 1973 technology, I guess you couldn't just fly around in a rocket.

402
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,020
 I mean, it's not Flash Gordon.

403
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,020
 It's not like you could be like, "Wee!"

404
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,980
 It's like if you wanted to stay up there for any amount of time, they didn't have a

405
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,460
 space shuttle, they didn't have a space station.

406
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:25,420
 You wouldn't need to put someone in a satellite or you know just the satellite without a dude

407
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,300
 in it.

408
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,060
 But they realize there's no way we can rescue him.

409
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:34,940
 If the controls aren't working, we don't have a plan B. Probably should have, but we

410
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,940
 don't.

411
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,980
 So he's just floating around in a little satellite and NASA goes, "There's nothing we

412
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,980
 can do for you, bro."

413
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:45,020
 And they shut off the radio because they don't want to listen to that Debbie Downer complaining

414
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,740
 about freezing to death.

415
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:51,340
 And he gets lost amongst all the satellites up in space.

416
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,340
 Late 2000.

417
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,660
 Okay, so now we're in the year 2000.

418
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,860
 It's the fall of 2000.

419
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,340
 There's an amateur astronomer in Fiji and he's looking through his telescope and he's

420
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,220
 like, "Hmm, yes.

421
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,220
 Hmm, interesting.

422
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,220
 Hmm."

423
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:10,660
 And then he stops flying on a sexy neighbor and he's like, "Oh yeah, I forgot.

424
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,260
 I'm an amateur astronomer, not just this stalker."

425
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,380
 Then he points it up in the sky and he's looking and he's like, "Hmm, that's a little less

426
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,940
 interesting than what I was looking at."

427
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,900
 But that's not supposed to be there.

428
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:25,340
 And he ends up calling up NASA and he goes, "Hey guys, I'm picking up something.

429
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,900
 You guys should be an amateur astronomer from Fiji."

430
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,540
 They're like, "Hey, what's up, Barry?"

431
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,900
 He's like, "Yeah, yeah.

432
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,980
 So I think I detected something that shouldn't be up there."

433
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:40,420
 NASA verifies the claims and realizes this is John Smith's satellite ship.

434
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:45,420
 Because they can't figure out what else it could be and it's getting closer into Earth

435
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,260
 orbit.

436
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:50,620
 So in the year 2000, we had the technology to rescue John Smith.

437
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,460
 We have the technology to rescue John Smith, but it takes him a year.

438
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,460
 It takes him till 2001.

439
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,940
 They're able to retrieve the satellite.

440
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,140
 They bring it down.

441
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,180
 They open it up.

442
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,340
 John Smith is dead.

443
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:09,300
 He froze to death, which is what you would imagine would happen to somebody who's left

444
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,300
 in space.

445
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,700
 I think that's kind of the one thing you know is going to happen.

446
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,780
 But then, "Sir, sir, he's not dead.

447
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:20,220
 He's just breathing super slowly.

448
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,940
 He's all icy and stuff.

449
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,540
 But if we start brushing away the ice and we put this stethoscope to his heart, which

450
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:38,860
 we probably should have done before we said he was dead, boom, boom, boom."

451
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,540
 That's a super slow heartbeat.

452
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,860
 In a way to just waste more time in this already long episode.

453
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,140
 John Smith is alive.

454
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,140
 He was frozen.

455
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:49,340
 He's cryogenically frozen in this satellite.

456
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,020
 So they unfreeze him.

457
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:55,340
 They slowly warm his body temperature up and then they flip him over.

458
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,620
 They use a giant wooden paddle and they put him in an oven and then they flip him over.

459
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,860
 Bring him out and he's all crispy and new.

460
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,660
 So he's alive.

461
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,820
 He's alive.

462
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,980
 He was cryogenically frozen.

463
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,780
 The aging process had stopped and he's totally fine.

464
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:13,140
 And as they begin to run medical experiments on him though, because that's what you would

465
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,140
 do, right?

466
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,740
 A man's been up in space for almost 30 years.

467
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,100
 You'd want to know if anything happened.

468
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,860
 Any side effects have been freezing to death.

469
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,460
 They're like, "Hmm, that's the first side effect."

470
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,220
 He's like, "Yeah, thanks a lot, Jerks.

471
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:29,140
 Maybe next time build a satellite ship that I can actually fly."

472
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,380
 So they sit him down.

473
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:34,180
 They're running tests on him and they go, "So they go, John, we've completed all your

474
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,180
 tests.

475
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,180
 We have a couple of questions for you."

476
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,220
 And he's like, "Yeah, sure anything."

477
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,300
 When you left Earth, you were alive.

478
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,340
 He's like, "Yes, I was alive when I left Earth."

479
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,780
 And they're like, "Okay, that solves the first three questions."

480
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,780
 Okay.

481
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,100
 When you were a kid, you broke one of your ribs, right?

482
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,780
 And he's like, "Yeah, yeah, it was horrible.

483
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,020
 I remember it breaking."

484
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:59,940
 And they go, "Well, that's weird because we did a couple x-rays on you and we see that

485
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,500
 you don't have a broken rib."

486
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,500
 Like it was never broken.

487
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,900
 There was no fracture at any point and they're showing them x-rays.

488
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,460
 And he's like, "Hmm, that is interesting.

489
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,780
 I do remember breaking my rib."

490
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:15,540
 And scientists are like, "And they're like, "That is very, very curious."

491
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:19,460
 We also contacted some people you knew growing up.

492
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,860
 And he's like, "What is kind of weird?"

493
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,300
 It was a medical exam.

494
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,020
 And they go, "We've noticed something.

495
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:29,100
 Since you've been in this lab, you've been really good at math because we noticed like

496
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,980
 when you're not hanging out with us, when you're not hooked up to all these diodes because

497
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,420
 you are a space mutant, you're always doing math problems.

498
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,740
 Now, John, we called up some people you used to hang out with when you were a kid and they

499
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,460
 said you didn't know anything about math.

500
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,300
 You were really, really bad at math.

501
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:50,060
 But now you can do all sorts of like quadratic equations and stuff like that.

502
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,060
 How is that possible?"

503
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,300
 And John Smith goes, "Hmm, I don't remember.

504
00:24:54,300 --> 00:25:00,060
 I just know that I am really good at that thing you said that it's shockingly you pronounced

505
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,300
 correctly on your first try."

506
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,780
 Scientists is like, "It is a hard word to pronounce."

507
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:09,500
 And then the scientists are looking at their sheet and they're like, "Hmm, that's really

508
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,500
 interesting."

509
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:15,340
 Now, the way that this article was laid out about John Smith was exactly this order.

510
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:19,620
 They said, "John Smith had a broken rib, but now his rib is healed."

511
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:24,380
 And then it also said that he used to be really bad at math, but now he can do high level

512
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,260
 math, which I'll tell you right now.

513
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:31,300
 You're not an astronaut if you can't do high level math.

514
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:37,100
 Some of the smartest people you will ever meet in your life, and I've met a few of them,

515
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,260
 are fighter pilots.

516
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:44,620
 And you can't be an astronaut, especially if you're putting you in a satellite unless

517
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,340
 you can fly an F-15.

518
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:52,780
 They do have astronauts that aren't Air Force pilots, but if you're going to pilot the vehicle,

519
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:56,140
 you are almost always a fighter pilot.

520
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:00,900
 And again, I've had the pleasure of knowing some fighter pilots, some that you may know

521
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,900
 actually.

522
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:06,300
 And there's a little bit of flex on you guys, but it's top secret.

523
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,980
 I can't tell you their names.

524
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:13,380
 They're geniuses, right?

525
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:18,100
 If you can't do high level math, you're most likely not piloting experimental.

526
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,420
 Maybe that's why it wasn't working.

527
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:25,500
 They're like, "Sir, the equipment works just fine, but you have to do basic algebra to

528
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,300
 be able to figure out where to go."

529
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,300
 And he's like, "Gulp."

530
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:32,060
 Anyways, the article says he had a broken rib, it was now healed.

531
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:37,740
 The article says some people, some acquaintances from the old neighborhood, from the Bronx,

532
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,580
 happened to also be walking through 111 Nasa Court that day.

533
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,420
 And someone's like, "Hey, you know John Smith, how good was he in math?"

534
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,780
 And they're like, "He sucked."

535
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,420
 And so it turns out he can do good math.

536
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,180
 So this is the way this article is laying this stuff out.

537
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:55,660
 The first thing I have to just hammer this out, the first example, healed rib.

538
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:58,140
 Second example, good at math.

539
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:04,740
 Third example of why he may not be the same John Smith as he went into space.

540
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:09,140
 His heart is in a different location in his body.

541
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:13,060
 So that should have been your first giveaway.

542
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:18,020
 If you ever send a guy to the liquor store and he comes back and he's like, "That's

543
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,020
 weird.

544
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,460
 My heart is in a different location in my body."

545
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:24,700
 You're not going to be like, "So what are your elementary school friends say about your

546
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,060
 math skills?"

547
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:30,060
 That should have been the number one and really the only piece of evidence.

548
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:35,580
 Man goes up into space, he comes back down, his heart has moved inside of his body.

549
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:39,060
 The scientists aren't going to be like, "Hmm, that's interesting, but let's take a look

550
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,140
 at his ribs again."

551
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:46,780
 So here's a man who went to space, was up there for almost 30 years.

552
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:49,260
 Froze came back to life.

553
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,820
 His heart was in a different location in his body.

554
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:57,020
 He moved from the left side of his body to the right side of his body and then other

555
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,700
 things were different.

556
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,700
 That's weird.

557
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,700
 His shoes are different.

558
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,300
 He was wearing different shoes this morning.

559
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,740
 Let's run another test on that.

560
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:10,300
 So the scientists are saying this isn't John Smith.

561
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:16,820
 I mean, technically it is on a cellular level it is, but so much stuff has changed.

562
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,300
 He's better at math.

563
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,300
 He's much better at math.

564
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,140
 No one ever gets better at math as they get older.

565
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,820
 He's better at math, his rib fixed, and his heart's in different locations.

566
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,900
 And the general's like, "I'm sorry, who was that last one?"

567
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:32,300
 And they're like, "Oh, oh, his heart is in a different location in his body, so we don't

568
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,060
 think this is John Smith."

569
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:37,580
 But then they go, "Let's go talk to this man.

570
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:40,620
 Let's go talk to John Smith and find out exactly what's going on."

571
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:44,620
 If he has been up to no good, he's been fiddling around with his own chest cavity moving his

572
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,740
 heart.

573
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:50,900
 When they go into the room to talk to Mr. Smith, he's gone.

574
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,660
 Some say that the story's completely made up.

575
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,060
 Some people say that the story never existed.

576
00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:01,620
 I actually couldn't find proof of this story outside of howandwise.com, so they could have

577
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,500
 completely made it up.

578
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:07,300
 But again, there are other stories we'll be covering in the coming weeks where I was

579
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,180
 able to find other information.

580
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,860
 So it's possible they made it up.

581
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:11,980
 It's possible.

582
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:15,260
 With a name like John Smith, it's really hard to pull up.

583
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:21,340
 I actually did find two astronauts that was close to that name, and that actually opened

584
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,580
 up a whole other weird conspiracy.

585
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,740
 We'll get into that in a second.

586
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,980
 But some people say, "The story never existed."

587
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,260
 I might be one of those people.

588
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:34,940
 Other people say that he escaped from the lab.

589
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,740
 Like he basically is like, "Uh-oh, they found out my heart's in the wrong location.

590
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,060
 This disguise didn't work.

591
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,460
 That it really wasn't John Smith.

592
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,500
 It was some sort of alien interloper or intruder."

593
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,740
 He escaped.

594
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,220
 Some people say that he didn't escape.

595
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,720
 He did disappear.

596
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,660
 The military came back into the room and they said, "Hey, would you like a tour of our secret

597
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:59,140
 facility that's underneath this secret facility to where we keep all the cool kids?"

598
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,620
 And John Smith is like, "Yeah, awesome."

599
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:04,940
 And he's in some sort of holding area where they're doing tests on him.

600
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:09,340
 Because if the story's true and he went up to space and came down and it's an intruder,

601
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,860
 you'd want to keep him under observation.

602
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,460
 But he has some sort of bizarre healing factor.

603
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,460
 You'd want to steady him.

604
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,460
 Is he a clone?

605
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,580
 We don't know any of this stuff.

606
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:21,940
 They did also, I should add this detail too, apparently, because he was up there taking

607
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,940
 notes.

608
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,780
 They didn't have like a laptop.

609
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:28,180
 So we basically went up there with a notepad when I was making jokes about that.

610
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:31,420
 They gave him a hundred page notepad, which I think they'd want to give him a couple of

611
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,420
 those.

612
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:37,100
 You can get a spiral notebook with more than a hundred pages in it, but 50 of those pages

613
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,140
 were filled up with weird glyphs, weird images.

614
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,780
 And they said, "Some of those were never seen on Earth.

615
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:47,020
 I can scribble out stuff you've never seen before either, but I'm not an astronaut in

616
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,020
 deep space.

617
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,020
 I don't know why I'm trying to flex on that dude."

618
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,620
 But you know, just to add in that detail, so there is that alien thing where did he

619
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,980
 start to go crazy, which you would expect as you were freezing to death in space with

620
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,500
 no hope of rescue.

621
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,300
 But anyway, so that's kind of where we stand with that story now.

622
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:06,980
 Clone, alien, healing factor, we don't know.

623
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,140
 We'll say the story's real just for entertainment value.

624
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,620
 It could be totally fake.

625
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,620
 Could be real.

626
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,860
 We've never been able to find much else on it.

627
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:18,460
 Escaped on his own to live his life among us as an alien intruder, or maybe he realized

628
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,780
 he is John Smith, but they were going to do experiments on him.

629
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:24,580
 Or is he in a secret laboratory to this day being experimented on?

630
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,580
 Nobody knows.

631
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:28,300
 But here's an interesting twist to this story.

632
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:34,020
 When I was looking for John Smith astronaut, I found two.

633
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,020
 Kind of.

634
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,700
 You had John Michael Smith.

635
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,020
 He was a NASA technician.

636
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,060
 He was born in 1938.

637
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,620
 He's actually still alive today.

638
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,300
 Very, very long-lived man.

639
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,300
 That's awesome.

640
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,140
 John Michael Smith was born in 1938.

641
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,620
 He was a NASA technician.

642
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,300
 Then we have Michael J. Smith.

643
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,300
 Weird.

644
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:57,340
 I mean, yeah, people can have multiple initials and stuff like that.

645
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:01,260
 You have John Michael Smith, and then you have Michael J. Smith.

646
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,140
 He was an astronaut, a pilot.

647
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,460
 He died on January 20th, 1986.

648
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,820
 He was the pilot of the Challenger.

649
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:14,500
 I know there's that big conspiracy theory going around that the people in the shuttle,

650
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,900
 the Challenger shuttle didn't actually die, and they'll show a photo of this guy, and

651
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:23,140
 then they'll show a photo of another guy, and they have the same skin tone, and the

652
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:27,060
 same nose, and half the ears the same, but something's different.

653
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:30,020
 So they're trying to say the Challenger shuttle didn't really blow up.

654
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,140
 I see that conspiracy pop up.

655
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,140
 That's one of those conspiracy theories always ago.

656
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,420
 What's the end game with that, though?

657
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:43,180
 Okay, if they faked it, and what was the point?

658
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:47,380
 Why was faking it so important?

659
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,380
 People do look similar.

660
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:51,740
 I've run into a couple people that are identical to me.

661
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,180
 I've ran into them in real life.

662
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,820
 They look identical to me.

663
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:58,580
 So people will look alike, especially when you're looking all over the internet.

664
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:04,300
 But that conspiracy theory aside, I'm going to introduce a new one, John Michael Smith

665
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:13,460
 and Michael J. Smith, and then we have a guy who was possibly a clone alien named John Smith.

666
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,660
 Very very generic name.

667
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:18,500
 It's quite possible that these three people all had the exact same name.

668
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:24,420
 I do find it a little coincidental that we have two people named kind of the same.

669
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,980
 I guess I'm really stretching.

670
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,780
 Two people named kind of the same.

671
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,780
 One of them is dead.

672
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,780
 Never mind.

673
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:37,140
 I might as well say Michael W. Smith, Christian singer, as part of this conspiracy theory

674
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,140
 as well.

675
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:41,380
 He actually came from outer space before he wrote "Go West, Young Man."

676
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,780
 "Go Space, Young Man."

677
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,780
 I don't know.

678
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:48,620
 I'm realizing that this is a Friday episode, and I'm just reaching now.

679
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,820
 However, let's wrap it up like this.

680
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:56,180
 Somewhere out there right now, there may be a man walking amongst us.

681
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:04,900
 He spent 30 years off planet in a tomb built by his coworkers.

682
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:08,780
 And when they finally retrieved him, he never forgave them.

683
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:15,340
 He is still walking amongst our civilization, waiting to take revenge against NASA.

684
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,500
 No.

685
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,620
 Against all of us.

686
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:23,180
 He's out there watching, waiting for his moment.

687
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,180
 Waiting.

688
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:28,260
 Doing high level math until the numbers fit.

689
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:34,900
 Because once he comes up with a perfect plan, he will enact it, and he will destroy us all.

690
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:40,260
 It doesn't matter what side of the chest your heart is on, if the blood it's pumping is

691
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:44,540
 full of ice cold vengeance.

692
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:50,780
