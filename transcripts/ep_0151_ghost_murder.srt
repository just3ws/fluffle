1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
 A journalist who always has a little too much information.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:13,520
 And then we take a look at a murderer who was caught via the testimony of his victim's

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,520
 ghost.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,080
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:25,760
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,960
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,960
 I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,160
 I hope you're having a great day too.

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,160
 It's getting cold.

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,160
 Getting cold.

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,160
 But there's no snow.

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,160
 I'll accept that compromise.

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,600
 I'll take cold as long as there's no snow involved.

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,320
 So nature, shake on it.

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,560
 I'm shaking hand with air and technically air is nature.

16
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,560
 There we go.

17
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,560
 Deal.

18
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,560
 No more snow.

19
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,560
 You heard it here first, Dead Rabbit Radio.

20
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,760
 Gotta find my notes here.

21
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,760
 Oh here we go.

22
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,160
 They're on my computer where they always are.

23
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,160
 Okay.

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,760
 Let's go ahead and take a look at our first story now.

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,160
 This one we are going to Macedonia.

26
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,600
 Let's go ahead and hop in the carbonicopter simply because I have no idea where Macedonia

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,000
 is.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,920
 I think it's somewhere around Greece.

29
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,280
 But I don't know where that is either.

30
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,440
 Which, okay, Greece I guess is near Italy because that's where Rome was.

31
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,080
 The Greeks were like the islands, right?

32
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,280
 Like Mamma Mia.

33
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,920
 So we're going, we're first off we're just going to fly around until we see a bunch

34
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,120
 of people singing and dancing to Abba songs and we're like okay there's Greece.

35
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,960
 And then we're going to keep heading east.

36
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,200
 East is the least.

37
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,200
 West is the best.

38
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,760
 Has anyone ever figured that out before?

39
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,840
 Did I just come up with the best slogan ever?

40
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,240
 East is the least.

41
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,240
 West is the best.

42
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,800
 And before I get accused of racism you can also use it for high schools.

43
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,680
 Like east side wildcats and their rivals the west side wildcats.

44
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,480
 But anyways, okay east is the least.

45
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,840
 I've never heard that before.

46
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,040
 It's awesome.

47
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,600
 You heard that first again on Dead Rava Radio.

48
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,040
 We're going to Macedonia.

49
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,560
 The early 2000s.

50
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,800
 And there's a young reporter there named Vlado Tansky.

51
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,720
 Vlado Tansky.

52
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,400
 Now Vlado had been a journalist for 20 years and he was really well known in the city.

53
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,800
 I mean it wasn't like they weren't paparazzi chasing him.

54
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,160
 Technically the paparazzi would just be the cameraman who worked for the newspaper walking

55
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,920
 by him on the way to work.

56
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,920
 Hey Vlado.

57
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,600
 Vlado what a name.

58
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
 Vlado.

59
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,320
 Anyways, I want to pick on this guy for that name.

60
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,160
 Vlado worked for the newspaper for about 20 years.

61
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,480
 He was very well connected to people who knew who he was.

62
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,840
 He was a hard hitting journalist.

63
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:45,400
 And a string of murders began happening in the city of Kikvo.

64
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,400
 No Kik-Kik-Evo.

65
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,400
 Kik-Evo.

66
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,800
 We'll call it Kik-Evo.

67
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,840
 There's some weird little thing above the eye.

68
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,840
 Not the dot.

69
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,040
 It's like a little line or maybe it's above the sea.

70
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,040
 I don't know.

71
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,960
 But anyways we're going to call it Kik-Evo.

72
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,360
 Sounds like a Snuggles character.

73
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,360
 It sounds like a popple I mean.

74
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,800
 It sounds like in 1980s I want to hug Kik-Evo.

75
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
 Kik-Evo.

76
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,960
 Anyways we're going to talk and so the city is called Kik-Evo.

77
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,200
 It's not called Kik-Evo but we're going to call it Kik-Evo.

78
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:20,200
 Volado works in Kik-Evo in the early 2000s because it kind of spans this time period.

79
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,760
 Sixty four year old woman is...

80
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,040
 Trigger warning I guess.

81
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,960
 Sixty four year old woman is raped, beaten and strangled.

82
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,200
 A horrible crime.

83
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,400
 Absolutely horrible crime.

84
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,440
 Everyone's like "huh" but two guys are found guilty because they had previously been charged

85
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,200
 or found guilty of a previous murder.

86
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,600
 Two guys are found guilty of this and Volado goes to the trial.

87
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,000
 Volado attends the trial and reports on it the whole time.

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,640
 So a short time later a 56 year old woman, her body parts are found in various dumping

89
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,240
 sites like garbage dumps.

90
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:03,200
 Everyone's like "oh my god" but the people who killed the other old chick they're in

91
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,640
 jail so this must just be something totally random.

92
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:13,360
 A short time after that a 65 year old woman raped and stabbed to death a bunch of times

93
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:21,200
 in the head and at this point Volado starts calling for an investigation into a serial

94
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,440
 killer that he dubs the Kik-Evo monster.

95
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,520
 Kik-Evo monster.

96
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,320
 And he...no one had thought it was a serial killer at this point.

97
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,120
 People thought the first one was the two dudes and the other two were completely unrelated

98
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,960
 but Volado is like "no".

99
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,040
 There's a serial killer on the loose of the streets of Kik-Evo and everyone giggles.

100
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,120
 He's like "I know the name's stupid, just go with me".

101
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,960
 The mayor of Kik-Evo can't even keep a straight face.

102
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,240
 He's like "there is a murderer on the streets of Kik-Evo.

103
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,280
 We gotta figure out what's going on".

104
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:58,000
 The police start to think "hmm this is kinda weird because we didn't think there was a

105
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,420
 serial killer, this guy might be right, this journalist might be right".

106
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:07,400
 But the Volado starts like talking trash about the police in the newspaper saying "they

107
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,400
 don't know what they're looking for, they don't know there's a serial killer".

108
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,880
 He also would go to the victims' families and ask them detailed questions about the

109
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,880
 victim.

110
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,240
 Now both of those things are not suspicious in and of themselves.

111
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,480
 The media tends to kinda look down on law enforcement or organize government in whatever

112
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,200
 fashion that's never good enough or that's outright corrupt.

113
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,700
 And I'm not saying either of those are true or false, but they tend to have a bias towards

114
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,700
 that.

115
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,820
 The idea of going to a victim's family and trying to figure out who the victim is, that's

116
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,060
 kinda what journalists do.

117
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,140
 So the cops are like "well yeah, he's kinda asking like shhh, the questions are a little

118
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,460
 more detailed than you would think".

119
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,260
 But that's not what made the cops suspicious.

120
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:53,100
 What made the cops suspicious was that Volado began reporting stuff in his articles that

121
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,260
 the police had not released to the public.

122
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:02,320
 Volado was putting stuff in his articles that only the killer would know.

123
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,360
 So it wasn't just that he's like "oh, the police smelled like rotten eggs", the cops

124
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,960
 are like "how did he know that?"

125
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,560
 One of the lines that he put in one of his articles was "this woman who had been strangled",

126
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,440
 the body had been tied up with a piece of phone cable with which the woman had clearly been

127
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,640
 previously strangled.

128
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:27,760
 The cops are like "how in the world would the reporter know that?"

129
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,880
 We don't even think we knew that.

130
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,080
 We hadn't made that connection yet.

131
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,520
 And he reports that.

132
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,320
 So they go and they get a DNA sample from him.

133
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,540
 They say "hey, you know, can we get a DNA sample from you?"

134
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:44,180
 Now he says "yes", which is weird because he shouldn't have because the DNA sample

135
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,580
 came back that he was the killer.

136
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:52,600
 He was in jail for a few days and he drowned himself in a bucket of water.

137
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:57,280
 And they show a photo of the bucket of water on the website and he leaves a note that says

138
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,160
 "I did not commit these murders".

139
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,520
 Was he framed by the police?

140
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,520
 Most likely not.

141
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,040
 It seems like it might be all coincidental information.

142
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,240
 I mean, circumstantial evidence that he had this, like he's the one who named the serial

143
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,460
 killer, he's the one who connected the serial killings, the killings together in the first

144
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,460
 place.

145
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,260
 He knew details about the crimes, his DNA match.

146
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:26,300
 Technically, you could say a lot of that stuff was, so maybe someone in the police was

147
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,620
 giving him that information to kind of set him up.

148
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,740
 But there's nothing really in his 20 years of writing that would suggest that someone

149
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,740
 would want to set him up.

150
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,020
 And I guess the murder stopped when he died.

151
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,660
 So it is funny now that I think about it, I wonder what happened to those two guys who

152
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,420
 got convicted of that first woman's murder.

153
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,360
 Because you know what, they were probably still in jail because again, he didn't confess

154
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
 to any of it.

155
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,360
 He never like got them, he never said "I did that".

156
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:59,360
 So he got the scoop of a lifetime, the bath of a death time, oh that was terrible.

157
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,280
 Two people are still in prison for a crime he probably committed.

158
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,360
 Weird.

159
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,840
 Weird story.

160
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,160
 And it's almost something that you would see in a movie.

161
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,780
 And there have been movies about, not him in particular, but about a journalist or painter.

162
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,420
 I've seen pictures about painters.

163
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,660
 I mean, I've seen movies about painters who are like "I need to have inspiration so they

164
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,660
 start chopping people up".

165
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:26,580
 I think it's a pretty normal story about like a guy who, a nightcrawler was kind of like

166
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,660
 that, a guy being pushed to the edge.

167
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,660
 What's weird though is that this guy seemed pretty normal throughout his career until

168
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,660
 this happened.

169
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,660
 So that makes me even think a little more.

170
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,080
 Was he set up by somebody else?

171
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:46,520
 Or was this guy a killer for longer and was never discovered and finally wanted to get

172
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:51,080
 recognition not just on the front page but in the courthouse?

173
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,840
 But that's Washita because he killed himself.

174
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,840
 I don't know.

175
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,840
 It's a weird setup.

176
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,280
 It's a weird story.

177
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,280
 And that's it.

178
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,280
 No one's looking into it now.

179
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,960
 They just go "Ah, he did it and he drowned".

180
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,960
 Maybe it was a setup.

181
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,960
 I don't know.

182
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,960
 I probably have to look into it a little more.

183
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,960
 I didn't think about that.

184
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,140
 Anyway, if I find out anything more about this guy as far as some sort of conspiracy,

185
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,140
 I'll jump back on it.

186
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,620
 But for right now though, we are going to jump into our next story.

187
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:19,560
 Now our next story is kind of one of the same lines because it involves a murder, but this

188
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,480
 one also involves spooky.

189
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,640
 Actually it's not a spooky ghost.

190
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,280
 It's quite friendly.

191
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,800
 The year is 1977.

192
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,460
 A year after I was born, imagine me as a one year old baby with my first microphone in

193
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,460
 my crib.

194
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,560
 That's what those things are called.

195
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,440
 Sometimes I feel like an alien that I can't pronounce normal words and forget what...

196
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,840
 Anyways.

197
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,920
 The year is 1977.

198
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,760
 It's a chilly February in the city of Chicago.

199
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,760
 Chicago.

200
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,760
 Illinois.

201
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,360
 I guess you didn't know that.

202
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,560
 We are going to join a middle-aged woman.

203
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,560
 I...

204
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,960
 Damn, this episode is full of old women.

205
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,160
 We're going to join this woman.

206
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:08,460
 She's in her... I guess I should have written it down, but she's like in her late 50s,

207
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,660
 early 60s.

208
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,460
 Her name is Theresa Bossa.

209
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,340
 She works at a hospital.

210
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,540
 Now she was talking to one of her friends and they're like, "Hey, what are you doing

211
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,540
 tonight?"

212
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,700
 And she's like, "I'm having a friend over tonight.

213
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,860
 We're just going to kind of chill."

214
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,860
 Ooh, is it a romance?

215
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:29,220
 No, silly word chest friends.

216
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,240
 And so, I don't know where that came from.

217
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,760
 Anyways, Theresa said goodbye to her friend.

218
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,760
 Goodbye!

219
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,960
 And her friend's like, "Bye."

220
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,960
 And they just kind of wave at each other for a while.

221
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,280
 Theresa Bossa goes on.

222
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,280
 Later that night.

223
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,400
 So it's not a flood or an explosion.

224
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
 Well, kind of.

225
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,760
 It's a fire in her apartment.

226
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,280
 Firefighters rush to the scene.

227
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,320
 Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo.

228
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,320
 Pull out their hose.

229
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,760
 Okay, anyways.

230
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,380
 This episode's totally gone off the rails.

231
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,700
 Sweep, sweep left to right, left to right.

232
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,700
 Aim for the base.

233
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,700
 I know how to put out a fire.

234
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,700
 That goes on.

235
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,620
 That goes on for longer than it's supposed to.

236
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,620
 Put the fire out.

237
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,460
 And they're like, "Ooh, we did our job.

238
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,980
 Us firemen fought another fire."

239
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,820
 And then they notice something weird in the burned out apartment.

240
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,820
 They're like, "That's weird.

241
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,420
 That mattress looks kind of lumpy."

242
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,860
 They flip the mattress off.

243
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,340
 There is a woman, a dead naked woman.

244
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,340
 I think she was naked.

245
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,340
 That's just my imagination.

246
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:37,080
 But anyways, this dead woman has a butcher knife plunged through her chest.

247
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,520
 The firefighter goes, "Dum dum."

248
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,080
 Then they cut into credit scene.

249
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,800
 And now we're back to Teresa Teresita.

250
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,800
 What's her name?

251
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,240
 I don't know if we answered right earlier.

252
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,200
 This episode's totally gone.

253
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
 Teresita knife in her chest.

254
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,400
 The police come.

255
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,880
 They're like, "Firefighters are all grossed out because there's this dead woman there.

256
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,880
 We show up."

257
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,460
 They find a note among her room or apartment that didn't burn very cryptically.

258
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,740
 Just says, "Get ticket for AS."

259
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,380
 No idea what that means.

260
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,020
 They think maybe it's for the ticket.

261
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,020
 So maybe it's for a concert.

262
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,380
 Maybe they're going to go see Alvin and Simon, but Theodore isn't going to be there.

263
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,340
 And the cops are like, "No!"

264
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,580
 Jim Monks played last month.

265
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,820
 He's like, "Oh yeah, yeah, yeah."

266
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,820
 And Theodore was there.

267
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,820
 He's like, "Yeah."

268
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,820
 Two months pass.

269
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,820
 Wait, no.

270
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,080
 Oh, Jesus Christ.

271
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:34,560
 February, March, April, May, June, July.

272
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,060
 Eight months pass.

273
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,520
 Eight months pass.

274
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:46,320
 And the detective who's working on the murder case of Teresita gets a phone call from Evansten

275
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,640
 Police Department, which is another nearby town in Illinois.

276
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,560
 And the Evansten police go, "Hey, you guys are working at Teresita murder, right?"

277
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,560
 Yeah.

278
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,940
 Any leads yet now?

279
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,940
 We just have a note.

280
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,860
 You haven't seen the chipmunks lately, have you?

281
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,180
 And the other cops like, "Well, I saw them when they were here a couple months ago."

282
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,980
 And he's like, "Yeah, yeah, but I mean, you haven't seen them around town."

283
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,220
 No, no, no.

284
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:13,060
 But what do you know about Alan Shorie?

285
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,500
 And the lead homicide detective goes, "I have not heard that name.

286
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,680
 Those initials seem very suspicious.

287
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,680
 Tell me more."

288
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,100
 And that's when the Evansten police goes, "Mmm.

289
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,780
 I can tell you more, but you're not going to believe me."

290
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,300
 What was going on?

291
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:34,520
 So what was going on is there was a woman in Evansten who used to work in the same hospital

292
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,600
 where Teresita worked, who she would be sitting at home with her husband.

293
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,220
 And I don't know if these two things connected, but both these women are Filipina.

294
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,960
 So I don't know if that's a connection.

295
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,800
 The articles kind of said, "Well, maybe it, but I don't think so."

296
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,520
 Because otherwise, if this was the case, these people would be talking to each other all

297
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,520
 the time.

298
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,460
 They do talk to each other all the time.

299
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,860
 I mean, when they're dead.

300
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:02,980
 So this other woman would be sitting at home with her husband, and all of a sudden she

301
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,900
 went into a trance and she's like, "Eww.

302
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,780
 I'm Teresita.

303
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,980
 I'm Teresita Bassa, and I was murdered.

304
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,580
 I was murdered by Alan Shorie."

305
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:18,700
 And she explained how she was killed through this other woman.

306
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,100
 She explained how she was killed.

307
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,400
 And she said that Alan stole her jewelry.

308
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:30,280
 And you will find him, and you'll find proof of it, because my jewelry is there, and it

309
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,720
 kind of described the jewelry.

310
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,560
 Now we're going to get back to that in a second, because that's kind of an important detail

311
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,560
 for the way the story develops.

312
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,360
 But at that point, the homicide detective was like, "That's stupid.

313
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,520
 That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard of, but I have nothing else to go off of."

314
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:53,220
 Alan Shorie's initials match the note, and Alan Shorie also worked at the same hospital

315
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:58,220
 as Teresita and this other woman, whose name I didn't write down.

316
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:03,060
 So the detective was like, "We'll bring him in for questioning, because we can do that.

317
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,700
 It may not be anything, but we'll go check it out."

318
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,700
 They go to Alan's house.

319
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,020
 They say, "Hey, I just want to ask you a couple questions."

320
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,020
 Okay.

321
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:17,380
 As the cops are looking around, they see that Alan's girlfriend, living girlfriend, was

322
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:23,480
 wearing jewelry similar to the jewelry that was described by the ghost.

323
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,440
 So we'll put a pin in that for a second.

324
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,060
 The cops are like, "Hmm, that's weird.

325
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,000
 She seems to be wearing some sort of gold band on her finger with some sort of gem on

326
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 it."

327
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,160
 And that's what the ghost said.

328
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:40,320
 She seems to be wearing a chain of some sort of metallic substance around her neck, just

329
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,220
 like the ghost predicted.

330
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:46,260
 But anyways, so the police start asking, that's not why he gets convicted, or that's not

331
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:51,300
 why he gets arrested, but the cops start talking to Alan, and they're like, "Did you ever go

332
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,300
 to Teresita's house?"

333
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,260
 And Alan's like, "No.

334
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,060
 Never been to Teresita's house, never been there."

335
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:00,140
 And as the investigation progresses, the questions progress.

336
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:04,220
 Alan eventually did admit, "Yes, he had been to her house, but just to fix her television

337
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,220
 set."

338
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,500
 So at that point, the cops are like, "Now we know he's hiding something."

339
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,760
 He should have just said, "Yeah, I've been to her house once or twice, so I went there

340
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,600
 to fix her television set, and that was it, and it's tragic what happened."

341
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,440
 But once you lie and then get caught in the lie, now it's super, super suspicious.

342
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,160
 So they end up arresting him.

343
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,720
 Now I don't know if they arrested him because he lied to them, or if they're like, they

344
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,400
 put in the arrest warrant, they're like, "Well, he lied to us, plus his wife was wearing

345
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:36,840
 vaguely described jewelry to us via a ghost, but anyways they do arrest him.

346
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,840
 He goes to trial."

347
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,540
 Now I think they probably had a little more evidence.

348
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,380
 I think he didn't have an alibi and stuff like that.

349
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,860
 I don't think just the ghost saying this, but he did go to trial.

350
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,420
 It was declared a hung jury.

351
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,140
 They couldn't come to a rescission.

352
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:54,020
 And then before he could go back to trial, he pled guilty.

353
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:59,340
 He pled guilty and got like, he pled guilty to the murder so he didn't get life.

354
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,620
 He got to reduce sentence and stuff like that.

355
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:08,240
 Because that way the legend goes that in his cell the ghost of Teresita showed up and was

356
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:14,160
 like, "Confess, confess, get all of this off of your hearts and everything will be better."

357
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,600
 Or that his lawyer was just like, "You'll get a better plea deal."

358
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:21,720
 I think it was most likely the lawyer saying, "If you plea out, you'll have at least a chance

359
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,680
 of getting out at some point."

360
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:28,040
 Now there's two things to think about when we discuss this story.

361
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,880
 One is the jewelry thing.

362
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,380
 If the ghost just says, "I was killed by this person and the cops just went there and talked

363
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,380
 to him and he lied," that's a little weird coincidence.

364
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:45,180
 The jewelry, I mean, okay, when you have a jewelry stolen from you, you just can't go

365
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:49,340
 to the cops and say, "Yeah, someone stole my diamond ring."

366
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,940
 You need to give a pretty good description of it.

367
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,320
 Are there any inscriptions on it?

368
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,420
 What's the cut of the diamond?

369
00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:02,720
 I mean, they're not expecting you to know the 4Ks and have the little monocular magnifying

370
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,840
 jewelry, eyepiece is what it's called, something like that.

371
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,680
 They're not expecting you to know that, but you should know if it's a diamond shaped diamond

372
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,560
 or a square cut diamond or something like that.

373
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,960
 You just can't go in and go, "I lost a diamond ring."

374
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,960
 What did the band look like?

375
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,960
 I don't know.

376
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,960
 It was a ring.

377
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,560
 Do you have any diamond rings sitting around?

378
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,560
 It's probably mine.

379
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,560
 You can't do that.

380
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:25,320
 If you lose your phone, the first thing the person behind the counter is going to ask is,

381
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,320
 "What brand?"

382
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,440
 Now, I don't think that this ghost was describing it being like, "She had a pearl necklace with

383
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,860
 nine pearls, but one was slightly askew.

384
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,620
 It had a gold silver band."

385
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:40,680
 It never really gives us that information for what the jewelry looked like.

386
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,240
 It just seemed vague.

387
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:51,060
 I would assume based on Teresita and the other woman's nationality that it was probably traditional-esque

388
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,620
 jewelry.

389
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,780
 It wasn't K-Jewler's stuff.

390
00:18:54,780 --> 00:19:03,040
 It was probably more ornamental for that region of the planet, Philippines.

391
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:07,120
 But there was one article I read which was so funny because I had already read two articles

392
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,120
 about this.

393
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,960
 I always read the one to take the notes and the other one to back up what I'm looking

394
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,960
 at.

395
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,800
 Sometimes I'll look deeper into it.

396
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,080
 This was one of those ones because I was like, "This is really like..."

397
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,040
 They have chord transcripts and stuff like that.

398
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,960
 This really happened, but I was like, "It's some weird stuff to it."

399
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:29,940
 I found a third article and they were saying, "Oh yeah, the ghost not only said Alan Showery

400
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:35,940
 did it and that he did it for robbery, but that he gave the jewelry to the wife.

401
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,500
 It described the jewelry.

402
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,980
 It even gave the cops the phone numbers and addresses of the people involved."

403
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,580
 I was like, "That's ridiculous.

404
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,420
 That 100% did not happen at all."

405
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,460
 Because one, I didn't see it in any other article and that information is so sensational

406
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,200
 you would definitely put it in there.

407
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:59,240
 And two, if the ghost knows where you live, why isn't it just trash in your place?

408
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,280
 Why doesn't it possess his girlfriend and strangle him?

409
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,120
 Or possess his girlfriend and jump out of a window and he's like, "Oh my God, my wife

410
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,560
 or my living girlfriend jumped out of the window and I just gave her all that new jewelry

411
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,640
 and he's taking it off."

412
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,520
 And that's the thing.

413
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,720
 This story is weird enough.

414
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,440
 You don't have to be super sensational about it.

415
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,620
 I just thought that was a weird way to kind of go about it.

416
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,420
 Again, I always say, "Don't lie to me.

417
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:29,860
 I'm reading this stuff to be entertained and to be kind of like, "Woo, intrigued and creeped

418
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,780
 out and stuff like that.

419
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,940
 Don't just make stuff.

420
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,100
 Don't make stuff up.

421
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,100
 You should be like me and just get your facts wrong because that's totally okay."

422
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:45,500
 Do you think that it would stand up in court that a ghost could testify against somebody?

423
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,940
 Before this case, I would think no.

424
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,140
 It was a hung jury.

425
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,680
 It didn't really work.

426
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,320
 It's not like they could bring her on.

427
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:00,560
 They didn't have the other woman at the trial channeling her for the testimony.

428
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:10,720
 But as a juror, if you were sitting on that trial and you found out through discovery,

429
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,200
 like the defense lawyer is saying that the only reason why they focused on this guy is

430
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,860
 because a woman said she was possessed by a ghost and named him?

431
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,680
 That's why they went to his apartment in the first place?

432
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,420
 Forget the fact that they worked together.

433
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,600
 Forget the fact that he had been to her apartment before.

434
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:34,620
 The only reason why he came up on their radar was because a ghost possessed a woman and told

435
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,420
 that woman's husband.

436
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,020
 Would you believe that evidence?

437
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:46,480
 That's an interesting question because you could say, "Well, I don't believe that, but

438
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,680
 I believe these other pieces of evidence against them, these other circumstantial pieces of

439
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,660
 evidence."

440
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:56,760
 But if the way they got that evidence was from the ghost story, I don't know what to

441
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,760
 believe.

442
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,760
 It's interesting.

443
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,280
 It's an interesting debate.

444
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:05,360
 You have to wonder if this happens more, not more often than not, but if this has happened

445
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,160
 other times and the cops just don't talk about it.

446
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,380
 Like the cops are doing an investigation and they get someone, some little girl being like,

447
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,620
 "I know who killed my daddy."

448
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,620
 The ghost in the closet told me.

449
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,260
 Cops like, "What?"

450
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:25,180
 The ghost never leaves my closet and he saw who killed my daddy.

451
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:29,260
 Okay, creepy sounding kid, what happened?

452
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:37,020
 Well, the ghost, the ghost man in the closet, the ghost man in the closet saw my uncle do

453
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,020
 it.

454
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,640
 I mean, would the cop, that cop's not going to put that in report.

455
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,480
 The cop's never going back to that house either.

456
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,400
 But it may steer the cop in the direction to start looking at that uncle.

457
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,400
 Who knows?

458
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,800
 Who knows?

459
00:22:50,800 --> 00:23:00,440
 Either way, it's creepy to think that this guy thought he got away with it, but for some

460
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:07,380
 reason or somehow his victims ghost possessed someone else and ended up pointing the finger

461
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:27,540
 at him from beyond the grave.

462
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:34,000
 Okay.

463
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,580
 (upbeat music)
