1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,080
 When a young boy is told not to play in his parents closet, he's gonna do it

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:14,880
 anyways. But what's waiting in that closet may have him questioning, what is reality?

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,880
 And then we meet a young couple starting off life together. While they currently

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,480
 live in a small town home, they've always been on the search for their dream

5
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:32,280
 house. Little do they know that their dream house is also searching for them.

6
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,400
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:46,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm here with

8
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,240
 Stays and Carvener. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day

9
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,200
 too. I hope you guys are having tons of fun doing whatever you're doing. We got a

10
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,480
 lot of stuff to cover sure we're gonna get started right away. First off, walking

11
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,760
 into Dead Rabbit Command right here is one of our legacy Patreons. Long time

12
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:06,200
 supporter of the show. Give it up for... I can't pronounce your name bro. You're gonna have to forgive me.

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:13,020
 Rolf! Woohoo! Yeah, Rolf! Come on, everyone's like, is he calling my name? I don't know. No one's walking in yet.

14
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,200
 Rolf. R-O-L-F. Rolf. You're gonna be our captain, our pilot this episode. If you

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,520
 guys can't support the Patreon, if you guys don't want to hear me totally butchering your name,

16
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,800
 that's fine too. Just help spread the word about the show. That really, really

17
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,640
 helps out a lot. Rolf, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit

18
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,760
 Durgible. We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We're gonna start our

19
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,880
 journey off by flying all the way out to a little house in suburban America.

20
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,600
 [Durgible sound]

21
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,200
 Also, while we're taking the journey out there, I want to tell you guys that this

22
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,560
 week drops a new episode of the Asylum Case Studies. It is a podcast hosted by

23
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:59,240
 my friend Tressa, where she invites people on to watch Really Bad or sometime I like.

24
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,760
 I don't know why she keeps having me back on. I was like, oh, that was a good show.

25
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,520
 That's a good one. She invites people on to watch Asylum Movies. Those are those

26
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:12,320
 sci-fi channel mockbusters like Transmorphers or Android Cop and things

27
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:18,000
 like that. We recently did Mega Piranha. Piranha is so big they eat a

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,440
 battleship. It's hilarious and grueling. It was one of the worst movies that I've

29
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,480
 watched. Definitely one of the worst movies I've watched on the Asylum Case

30
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,280
 Studies. So check out that episode. I'll have it in the show notes. The Asylum Case

31
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,440
 Studies. It is a great podcast. Rolf is flying us on out to this house. Now we

32
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,720
 don't have a lot of details. This story was posted anonymously recently on the

33
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,960
 export. Someone was asking for weird creature stories. He had some good ones.

34
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,560
 He had stuff about like reptilians or seeing like weird things in the forest

35
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,480
 and stuff like that. There's some good stuff. But again, the question always is,

36
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,240
 is it dead rabbit radio interesting? And as I'm scrolling through this thread, there's a

37
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,760
 lot of good stuff. But this was the one that I was like, wow, this is a crazy

38
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,160
 story. Crazy if true. Obviously whenever we come across stuff anywhere online,

39
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,240
 written in a book or a magazine, World of the Paranormal, a lot of people lie, make

40
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,840
 stuff up. But let's take a look at this story. Now we don't have this person's

41
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,080
 name, no date, anything like that. But I'm gonna call this guy Gary. We're gonna say

42
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,520
 that he lives somewhere in suburban America. Gary tells this story. He says,

43
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,000
 listen, when I was around five or six years old, this happened to me. I was a

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,880
 young little guy. His dad goes, hey, Gary, listen, don't ever go in my closet.

45
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:40,080
 Don't ever go in my closet. I don't know if he said it that ominously. I don't

46
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,120
 think if he hopped out every so often, like the little boys getting out of the

47
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,040
 shower, dad jumps out, don't go in the closet. Mow in the lawn, dad pops out of

48
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,240
 the weeds, don't go in the closet, he almost get ran over with lawnmower. I don't know if

49
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,320
 it was a constant refrain, but the dad was very clear, do not go into my closet,

50
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,360
 Gary. I'm assuming Gary was a little whippersnapper, a little Dennis the

51
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,400
 Menace-esque character constantly getting the escapades. He did almost run over his

52
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,720
 dad with a lawnmower that one day, but Gary goes, listen, my dad told me not to

53
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:14,040
 play in the closet and I knew why because he had a gun in the closet, but he

54
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,840
 told him not to go in the closet. So of course Gary's going to go in the closet.

55
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,360
 That's what kids do. And Gary said, sure enough, one day I was at home and I went

56
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,800
 into the closet. I went into my parents' closet and he goes, when I'm in the

57
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:36,440
 closet, I find this small, plain cardboard box. He's looking at this box and he said

58
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:42,040
 there were holes on the side where you could pick the box up. And he picked it

59
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:47,640
 up and it was empty. The box was completely empty. He said, okay. And then he flipped

60
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:54,320
 the box over to use as a table. So I don't know if he brought, I don't know if he

61
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,400
 brought in a spread of meat and cheeses and he's like, oh, this is the only place

62
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,280
 I can relax. The parents' closet. I got my little snack ready to go. My PSP. I'm just

63
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,840
 gonna sit here and play some video games and eat these snacks. I don't know why.

64
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,920
 I mean, I can understand one thing wanting to go into a closet if your parents say

65
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,600
 don't go in the closet, but I don't know why once he was in there he decided to

66
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,400
 turn it into a little living space. Brings in a beanbag chair. He flips the box

67
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,480
 over and he says I'm gonna use it as a table and he said, what happened was

68
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:28,800
 after flipping it over and setting it down on the ground hundreds of bugs

69
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:36,920
 began to crawl out of the holes on the side of the box. Now he shirks back in

70
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:42,240
 fear, but it's that type of paralysis fear. He can't do anything. He can't even

71
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:51,120
 scream as he sees an untold amount of beetles and cockroaches and ants and

72
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:58,560
 cinnapedes spill out of this box and he goes those cinnapedes were impossibly

73
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,360
 large. Like they were just the grossest biggest cinnapedes I'd ever seen in my

74
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,680
 life and he goes I'm just watching this ocean of insect life pour out of this

75
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,480
 empty box. He didn't pick it up and go huh this seems like it's holding an

76
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:19,560
 infinite number of bugs. He was empty, but when he flipped it over all of these

77
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,080
 bugs are pouring out of the box and he was freaking out and he's so scared he

78
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:31,040
 can't even scream. He goes I didn't move. I didn't say a word. I just sat there and

79
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:38,240
 stared at all of these bugs pouring out of the side of this box and then he goes

80
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,440
 I don't remember what happened next. He goes I was staring at this gross

81
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,840
 monstrosity. I was staring at all these disgusting bugs crawl out of this box

82
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:53,320
 and the next thing I know I'm not in the closet anymore. Like I just I don't

83
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:58,480
 really remember anything. I think I might have passed out. I don't know. I'm just a

84
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,840
 little tipped Gary. It's probably not good to pass out when there's a bunch of

85
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,640
 bugs around because they're gonna climb inside you right. They're gonna climb in

86
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,880
 your mouth and your nose and all that stuff. But assuming an insect, assuming a

87
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,400
 human controlled by insects didn't type out this post. He goes I don't even

88
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,720
 remember the end of the story. He goes here's the thing it could have been a

89
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,680
 dream. It could have been a dream because it just doesn't make sense and I don't

90
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,080
 remember it ever ending. He goes I could have hallucinated it but I never had a

91
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,960
 hallucination before or since. Nothing like that. I'd never seen anything

92
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,200
 like that before. He goes I don't know. I'm pretty sure that was a memory though.

93
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,040
 Like I remember it. And that was an interesting story. There right there is

94
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,640
 interesting story where he picks the box up and flips it over and a previously

95
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,240
 empty box. Again if he had picked it up and it was heavy, bunch of bucks poured

96
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,760
 out of it. That's just him releasing his dad's private insect collection. But the

97
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,280
 fact that the box was empty when he picked it up and when he set it down

98
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,800
 they crawled out. Interesting. Now assuming the story's not a hallucination or not a

99
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,960
 dream, there's an interesting spin on this. Another person posting on the

100
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,200
 X-board gave this theory. And to be fair even they said it's just a theory. This is

101
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:13,220
 just a theory but we talk about this a lot on the show. He said I think that when

102
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,760
 you went in that closet there was the box you found was the box with the gun. And

103
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:23,600
 you accidentally killed yourself. And as he was sitting there looking at all the

104
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:31,880
 bugs coming out he was watching the decay of his old body. Like the bugs and

105
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,240
 the centipedes and the cockroaches were all these things that were crawling

106
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:43,120
 around this dead boy's skin inside this coffin. It was a representation of that

107
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:51,620
 but he shifted into a universe where he was still alive. He still has the memory

108
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:57,540
 of the decay. He still has the memory of these horrible life forms crawling all

109
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:03,180
 over him. And the only way his mind can process a memory that happened after he

110
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:10,840
 died was in this sort of theatrical manner. But basically you accidentally

111
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,720
 killed yourself when you went to the closet. Your parents told you not to go

112
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,720
 in the closet. You accidentally shot yourself. You died. And then you have

113
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,800
 brief memories of being dead. And then you got slotted into a universe where

114
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,700
 you're still alive. Quantum immortality. We've talked a lot about it on this show.

115
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,660
 And I think I'll put a couple episodes in the show notes that talk about that. I

116
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:39,260
 think it's very fascinating. It's a theory I'm not 100% on. I don't I have

117
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,040
 some serious questions about that which I've talked about in past episodes so

118
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,360
 I'm not gonna reiterate it here. But this story also reminded me of the story

119
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,120
 it was about the wheel. This guy got in a horrible car accident and then a giant

120
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,320
 city-sized wheel like a water wheel showed up and scooped him up and we're

121
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,960
 trying to throw him into a random universe. What a fascinating story that was

122
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,200
 and that this is right like this is possible. It's possible the author

123
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,700
 totally made it up but it's also possible that it was a dream or

124
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,300
 hallucination but it could be again the fact of someone dying in one universe

125
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:18,580
 and shifting over to another one. And it kind of matches some of those details.

126
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:25,420
 Really really creepy story nonetheless though. Rolf let's go ahead and toss you

127
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:29,740
 the keys. I'm gonna put the keys for the carbonar copter in a box full of maggots.

128
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,980
 Rolf go ahead and reach your hand into this box of maggots and I don't know

129
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:39,280
 why I tormented my Beijing border so much. I'm so grateful for your assistance.

130
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,280
 I will reach in and grab it. That's the type of gentleman I am. I will squeeze the

131
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,720
 maggots for you. Rolf here's the keys to the carbonar copter. We're leaving

132
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,720
 behind this young boy's house. We're headed all the way out to another house.

133
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,160
 This is a lot of houses. This is a house themed episode.

134
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,120
 Before we move on I want to do real quick Dead Rabbit Recommends. It's called the

135
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,680
 Movie House. The Movie House. That was a creepy movie. I actually don't know if I'd

136
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,860
 say Dead Rabbit Recommends that but it was about like if I remember correctly

137
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:11,500
 John Goodman and Bill Maher they were fighting Vietnam veterans who were

138
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,100
 hunting a house or something like that. Maybe that movie was a dream actually

139
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:20,420
 and now that I think about it. Rolf fly this carbonar copter over to this town

140
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:24,260
 home. Now again this is a story. This wasn't posted on the export but it was

141
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:29,700
 posted anonymously and the person who posted. I had this story sitting in my

142
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,840
 file for a while. This was one of those stories where I wasn't for sure I was

143
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:39,160
 going to do it. Not because it's not cool but we'll get to that in a second and

144
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,160
 then in the meantime I found the story. I was prepping the story and the person

145
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,680
 deleted their account and deleted this post. Everything's disappeared but

146
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,800
 luckily I was able to find... I mean literally like as I was working on it

147
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,120
 this week I went to go double check something. They just canceled everything

148
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,260
 out. Luckily I was able to find it in the web archive so there is a way for you to

149
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:05,660
 read this story as well. But long time listeners of the show know that I'm not

150
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:11,780
 a huge fan of dreams. Not that I don't want you to have your own hopes and

151
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:16,860
 aspirations. Not that I don't enjoy my own sleepy time dreams. Dreams are so

152
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,860
 weird already. Sometimes there's a lot of symbolism. Sometimes it's just neurons

153
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:25,420
 firing that. I've never been a huge fan of telling people's dreams or

154
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,760
 interpreting dreams and things like that. However this story hits a certain bar

155
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,680
 because this story does something quite odd. So that's why I was kind of teetering

156
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,680
 like "Dude is this Dead Rabbit Radio interesting?" and I decided to go with it

157
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,680
 and let's go ahead and get this story started. This user they deleted their

158
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:49,000
 account but we're gonna go ahead and call her Monica. So Monica currently is

159
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,880
 engaged to a young man we'll call him Brad and Monica and Brad are living in

160
00:12:53,880 --> 00:13:00,060
 the small town home along with Brad's son. And she said you know this was a nice

161
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:04,620
 house but we were always looking for our forever home. We were looking for our

162
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:09,100
 dream house and we would often go through Zillow which is a real estate

163
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:14,220
 website looking at different houses and they'd watch all that HD TV do the home

164
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,180
 or blow the home and where you can either figure out if you want to live in it or

165
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:23,020
 set it on fire with a blow torch or the two brothers knock out your window in

166
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,380
 the show where they just walk around and kick windows out of random houses you

167
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:31,760
 know all those HD TV shows. Garden it or gallow it where you have 24 hours to

168
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,240
 make the perfect garden or you get hung all that stuff and they're looking

169
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,600
 through Zillow and they're constantly looking for their dream home. Now on

170
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,240
 this particular day apparently this is fairly recent she said the night before

171
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,520
 we had a big family dinner. So they're retired right they're all got the big

172
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,360
 bellies full of turkey and they had to prepare everything for all these people

173
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,900
 coming over and they probably stayed up too late and they're watching HD TV they're

174
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,380
 like oh no I hope that guy doesn't get home today I really like the way he

175
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,660
 planted those petunias. The next day they're still beat and they said how old

176
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:08,700
 are these people? Are these people like 65? What are you talking about? Anyways they

177
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:14,380
 don't they get tired if they stay up too late or something like that. So they take

178
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,180
 a nap in the middle of the day they take a nap they go you know what there sure

179
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:24,200
 was a lot of work last night let's both take a nap so Monica and Brad catch a

180
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:33,520
 couple snoozies. Monica is now walking through this big house and she's

181
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:40,440
 admiring it like it's large and it's old and it's everything her and Brad ever

182
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,720
 wanted in a home. She's looking around and she's like oh look at all these open

183
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,380
 windows look at how the sunlight comes into this room and I'll go in this room

184
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:53,580
 oh it's so beautiful they have like four walls and a ceiling and then look at

185
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:58,100
 look at stairs I can go down a floor and she's walking around this house they

186
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,140
 just purchased their dream home and as she's walking through this house she

187
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:10,420
 starts to realize that this house is not just big it's huge. She's checking out

188
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:14,860
 all the rooms and she's walking on the hallways which seem to be more like

189
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:25,000
 corridors that go on forever. The house seems infinitely large. Her and Brad meet

190
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,120
 again this house they're sending smoke signals to each other they're like I'm

191
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,280
 down here here they meet back up this is their new home they bought it they go to

192
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:42,760
 bed and Monica wakes up and something is not right. She goes this is a dream this

193
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:47,080
 is a dream I live in a town home like this is just a dream this house isn't

194
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:52,780
 real and Brad is like no honey this house is real trust me trust me when we get

195
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:56,580
 the first mortgage payment you realize how real it is and she's like no no no

196
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:02,420
 something's off like this isn't real I'm just dreaming. Monica would spend the day

197
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,660
 walking through the house looking at everything wow I can't believe we just

198
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:13,280
 bought this house so beautiful and then she'd wake up in the bed in the house

199
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:21,620
 this old house she'd wake up in a bed in this house and go this isn't real this

200
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:28,060
 is just a dream and her fiance would say honey no this is real trust me once you

201
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:32,780
 get the first mortgage payment you'll realize how real this no no no this

202
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:39,120
 isn't real something's wrong she'd be walking through the house during the

203
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,020
 day and she started having this thought in the back of her head this isn't real

204
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:49,980
 I'm gonna wake up tonight and I'm gonna know that this is a dream but right now

205
00:16:49,980 --> 00:17:00,060
 this feels real this is real is it and then she would wake up at night I knew

206
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:05,860
 I knew something's wrong I'm I can't get out of this dream like I've spent a

207
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:10,500
 couple days here and this is all a dream this is all one dream this isn't my real

208
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,180
 house and Brad is like no no this is a real house once you get the mortgage

209
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:21,140
 payment she's like shut up this is a this is a dream during the day she'd be

210
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:27,460
 walking around with Brad and she heard a voice off somewhere in the house can't

211
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,860
 make out what they're saying or who they are but someone's in this house with

212
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:41,740
 them and she tells Brad do you hear that and Brad's like what and how what are you

213
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:46,860
 talking about I don't hear anything Monica goes you don't hear that that's

214
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:52,180
 clearly people talking Brad's like no I don't know what you're talking about I

215
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,660
 know you keep trying to say that everything's a dream that this is a

216
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:59,980
 dream yeah it's a dream house that's why we bought it but this is reality and

217
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:07,220
 Monica is trying to ignore Brad because she's starting to recognize the voices

218
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:14,500
 in the distance she's hearing herself and Brad have a conversation somewhere in

219
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:21,380
 this house she wakes up in the middle of the night and she's sitting in this house

220
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:29,060
 and she goes what is going on I know this is a dream and I can't get out of it I

221
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:36,620
 know this is a dream it has to be a dream but Brad always reminds her it's not a

222
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:47,700
 dream then Monica begins to get a sensation a feeling a way out Monica

223
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:57,860
 starts to get this obsession with finding the mirror she doesn't know why

224
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:02,340
 it's a mirror she doesn't know where this mirror may be and if I'm mispronouncing

225
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:07,940
 that you know that's that thing that shows your reflection a mirror she begins

226
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:12,020
 to obsess somewhere in this house is a mirror and if I find the mirror and I

227
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:16,020
 look in the mirror I can escape from this dream now again the whole time her

228
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:22,580
 fiance is going what dream what are you talking about this is real and she

229
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:27,780
 spends her days looking in all the little rooms in this house trying to find

230
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:35,980
 the mirror she wakes up in the middle of the night this is a dream how can how am

231
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:45,420
 I waking up in a dream the bedroom door opens up and her fiance son walks into

232
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:52,100
 the room she can't see him really clearly in the dark but she recognizes his

233
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:57,980
 voice and this little boy crawls into bed with them crawls underneath the

234
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:03,820
 sheets and crawls into the bed with Brad and Monica and as he is moving his way

235
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:09,540
 up underneath the sheets in between the both of them she realizes this isn't his

236
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:15,180
 son she's looking at this form of moving under the sheets and she goes it's

237
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:21,660
 sounded like him but I knew it wasn't him the figure under the sheets was too

238
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:27,940
 long too big to be the boy

239
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:33,780
 Monica wakes up in the middle of the night she needs to get out of the dream

240
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:40,180
 striving her insane finally on one of these daily journeys when she's going

241
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:48,460
 room to room to room to room to room she finally finds the mirror and she turns

242
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:57,660
 and she looks into it and she sees herself as an old decrepit woman she

243
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:05,780
 wakes up she's in the bed in the town home laying next to Brad and she goes

244
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:10,460
 listen I had a really really hard time believing that this was this was real

245
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:17,060
 like when I woke up in the bed I went to sleep in just a couple hours ago I had

246
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:23,340
 been trapped in this unreal world that seemed so real for so long that when I

247
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:26,580
 woke up in the town home I couldn't believe that it was real I immediately

248
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,700
 woke up Brad I was like oh my god oh my god is this real is any of this stuff

249
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:35,340
 really what are you talking about it's gonna sound crazy but I can't figure out

250
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:43,300
 if this is real or not and Brad goes yeah I don't I mean he's just kind of

251
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:48,220
 flustered by this whole thing right like how do you respond when someone's

252
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,540
 yeah they wake you up they wake you up from a deep sleep and they're like am I

253
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:55,900
 real am I real Brad's like listen listen listen I mean like you just woke me up

254
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:00,220
 to have a really bad nightmare just let me catch my bearings before we have

255
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:04,180
 whatever conversation you want to have she goes you had a nightmare I had a

256
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:07,700
 nightmare was awful and Brad's like yeah dude I had like one of the worst dreams I

257
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:13,580
 was I dreamt we were in this giant house it's huge house and possibly large house

258
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:20,140
 and it was I don't I don't even know how to explain it the dream kept looping like

259
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:25,540
 I kept like doing stuff during the day and then I would fall asleep at night and

260
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:29,920
 the I mean that's what normal that's normally how the life works but what

261
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,500
 happens I started to realize that this was fake like this dream house was not

262
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:38,380
 real but you didn't believe me you kept saying no no Brad it's real it's real and

263
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:44,260
 then I started looking for a mirror it's just weird and you kept trying to

264
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:48,900
 convince me that I was way older than I actually am but you kept saying I was like

265
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:53,180
 in my 50s and I was like no I'm not like I'm in my 30s and I could play a young

266
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:58,660
 20 it was super weird you were constantly trying to convince me I was older and

267
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:03,620
 then I was running around the house and I knew that I needed to find a mirror I

268
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:07,420
 was looking all over for this mirror and then I would wake up in bed and the whole

269
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,740
 loop would start over again and then I'm looking for the mirror and then the next

270
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:16,860
 thing I know you're shaking me and you woke me up now what's interesting is she

271
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:23,700
 wrote this post like the same day it happened she was posting this on the

272
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,660
 high strangeness subreddit which is a great subreddit they have a lot of really

273
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:30,900
 cool stuff high strangeness is a term a catch-all term for just the world of

274
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:36,060
 her normal really really good subreddit she posted this on the high strangeness

275
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:42,420
 subreddit and she posted it that day and she goes I don't know what to think she

276
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,460
 goes I believe that I'm back in the real world and I do believe it was a weird

277
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:51,460
 dream but how could my fiance have had the same dream like how does this work and

278
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:56,860
 she goes he went back to sleep and she hasn't been able to fall asleep she

279
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,780
 hasn't been able to fall asleep like which would make sense because he didn't

280
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:04,780
 see the mirror right his dream didn't come to an end he didn't see the mirror

281
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:10,820
 she saw the conclusion of it as this old decrepit person in his dream she was

282
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,660
 just trying to convince him that he was old which 50 is not that old but when

283
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:18,220
 you're in your 30s it might seem old so that could be why he that's could be why

284
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:22,020
 he went back to sleep because he wasn't confronted with that horror of his own

285
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:26,740
 mortality it's interesting she does say she goes listen I'll be honest like

286
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:32,180
 in the past I've had issues with dreams that I kind of have a loop where I fall

287
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,620
 asleep and wake up she goes that has happened to me in the past she goes I

288
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:41,100
 used to have severe insomnia so I'd have things like sleep paralysis I would

289
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:47,260
 have lucid dreaming but she goes even with those experiences one it's never

290
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:51,980
 been like this before she goes even when I was suffering through severe insomnia

291
00:24:51,980 --> 00:25:02,780
 I've never had a dream quite like this ever never felt the same it didn't play

292
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:09,580
 out the same and she goes how is it that he had the same dream like the exact

293
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:13,140
 same dream and that's really why I wanted to cover it because that goes

294
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:19,340
 against everything we know about dreams when I have a dream that's super creepy

295
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:23,220
 like I famously I've told this dream a couple times on the show it's really

296
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,940
 only two or three sentences I don't remember what the dream was about but

297
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:30,180
 at the ending it had something to do with Jesus and the devil and all this

298
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:34,900
 stuff because at the ending there was a knock on the door of my door and I

299
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:42,820
 opened it and standing outside my door were these two big bodyguards and then

300
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:46,580
 there was Satan standing there they're all wearing like little business suits

301
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:53,980
 Satan and he had cut off Jesus's face he like tore the skin from Jesus's face

302
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:58,460
 and was wearing it it was like stapled to his face and the devil did this little

303
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:02,820
 dance like this little like da da da da da da want want type of dance and I

304
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:07,700
 screamed so loud in the dream I woke up I was screaming in real life like it was

305
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:12,700
 such a shocking image to see Jesus his face ripped off and stapled to the

306
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:17,060
 devil's face and he was doing this little jig the jig isn't what scared me

307
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:21,500
 the dances I'm scared I remember I screamed so loud I woke up that's a

308
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,940
 weird dream right do I think it symbolized anything not necessarily

309
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:29,420
 it's weird it's not paranormal it's just a dream but when you have two people

310
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:33,820
 sharing the dream that is paranormal that's not possible in what we know

311
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:39,220
 about dreams and that's what she's saying in the high strangeness subreddit she

312
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:43,700
 ends it like that is there a term for this like the dream sharing has anyone

313
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:47,980
 else experienced this before why were we in the same house in both of our dreams

314
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:55,580
 why were we both looking for a mirror why did we both age in our dreams all

315
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:00,300
 really good questions and you could do dream analysis on some of them the

316
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:05,060
 aging the mirrors I'm sure there's reasoning behind that but again that's

317
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:09,060
 just dreams how are they both in the same house how are they both even having

318
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:13,660
 the same dream those are the important ones I think you can analyze dreams all

319
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:18,300
 you want but how are they in the same house how do they share a dream and

320
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:23,620
 that really led me to this and this is how I want to wrap it up we all know

321
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:28,100
 that when we're sleeping we're at our most vulnerable that's why animals in

322
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:33,220
 general don't sleep out in the open right but that's we're talking about

323
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:39,180
 physically physically vulnerable when we talk about a subconscious right you're

324
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:43,740
 incredibly vulnerable when you're sleeping because you unless you're a very

325
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:48,580
 experienced lucid dreamer you just kind of go where your subconscious takes you

326
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:55,780
 and we talk about being in haunted houses or we talk about having experiences

327
00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:01,500
 with ghosts but remember they're in our world there they have to follow certain

328
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,060
 rules that we have I mean of course they can float through walls they can be

329
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:10,140
 invisible and all this stuff but you very very rarely there's only a few

330
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:16,620
 counts of ghosts flying we've covered stories of like there was a three-story

331
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:20,700
 building the third story was haunted when they knocked down the third story they

332
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,300
 put up a new building you can still hear the haunting like 20 feet above the

333
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:30,500
 roof there are examples like that for the most part ghosts walk on boats they can

334
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,140
 actually stand on the deck of a boat if you're in a two-story apartment in your

335
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:38,260
 apartment's haunted the ghosts isn't constantly floating floating through

336
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:42,980
 your floor hunting the downstairs neighbor like ghosts do have to walk on

337
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:49,820
 floors does that make sense like ghosts have a set of physics that they follow

338
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:55,860
 but in the dream world there there is zero physics the only reason why people

339
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:59,300
 walk on the ground in your dreams is because people walk on the ground in

340
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:05,900
 real life there is no fit there's no actual gravity in a dream digital clocks

341
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,500
 and digital devices do not work in dreams this is something they've studied

342
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:14,900
 if you have an analog clock that goes tick tick tick tick tick and if you look

343
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:18,300
 at that clock in a dream and it says 302 and then you look away and then you

344
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:23,580
 turn back and look at that clock again it'll say 302 and 33 seconds if there

345
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:27,020
 is a digital clock there that says 302 and you look away in the dream and you

346
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:34,220
 look back it'll say 2704 it's a weird quirk of dreaming digital devices do not

347
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:39,980
 work in dreams why because they don't have to there's no physics see a clock

348
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:43,580
 that has actual mechanisms in it we understand how a clock works and it's

349
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,220
 little gears going click click click click you actually walk watching it

350
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:52,100
 click a digital device does not have those things it's just the display of

351
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:56,980
 something that it knows the time that we don't have any access to you take a

352
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:03,100
 bit apart but it's weird quirk it's a that's one of the tricks people who are

353
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:08,140
 interlucid dreaming use to tell whether or not they're dreaming because dreams are

354
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:13,540
 so realistic a lot of times they're indistinguishable so there are no rules

355
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:20,620
 in dreams so imagine not being in a haunted house imagine being trapped in a

356
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:26,900
 haunted dream like if something wanted to get you that really would be the best

357
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:33,540
 place to haunt you that's terrifying I mean we did an episode of you know

358
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:37,180
 Freddy Krueger was based on a true story I know that sounds like the dumbest

359
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:40,940
 thing I've ever said on this show I will put it in the show notes Nightmare in Elm

360
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:46,740
 Street is in fact based on a series of articles written in the LA Times kids

361
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:51,780
 were really dying kids were really dying because of this phenomenon so it's a

362
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:57,940
 real phenomenon but two people having the same dream of being trapped in this

363
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:05,620
 it really seems like this is a serious issue but what's causing it where is it

364
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:13,740
 coming from and more importantly how do you stop it do you find a dream priest

365
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:19,220
 like if you're in the dream itself and you think you're being haunted would you

366
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:25,620
 then go to a church in the dream to have the demon be exercised or have the

367
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:30,740
 ghosts be banished in the dream like all bets are off this is so fascinating to

368
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:37,460
 me how do you stop it do you wake up and consult a religious leader do you try to

369
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:41,540
 handle it in the dream I don't know like my advice to this person I don't really

370
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:48,780
 have answers to any of their questions which makes it even more terrifying

371
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:58,900
 because you have to sleep you have to sleep but if when you fall asleep you

372
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,500
 live three years four years five years however long you're trapped in this loop

373
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:09,340
 and the whole time there's something in that dream with you eating your fear

374
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:16,940
 devouring your loose your emotional energy that powers it I mean you could

375
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:23,900
 produce more psychic agony in a single night of a ever looping nightmare then

376
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:28,180
 you couldn't an entire life because you can fit 15 20 an infinite a number of

377
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:33,940
 lifetimes into a dream and they could become more terrifying than anything you

378
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:37,860
 could possibly imagine because it doesn't have to follow any sort of

379
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:42,100
 consistent guidelines it doesn't have to follow any rules it's just the sub

380
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:47,820
 conscious making it up as it goes along a terrifying story a terrifying

381
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:52,260
 phenomenon if this is true what are these people in for this is a new story

382
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:56,820
 this popped up maybe like two or three months ago and now we'll never know the

383
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,420
 ending to it right anyone can pop up and say oh I was that person I posted that

384
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:04,460
 but we'll never know was this a continuous haunting was this something

385
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:11,540
 they were able to get rid of or no it's a terrifying story and it used what they

386
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:18,860
 wanted to invite them in during the day during reality they would watch shows

387
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:24,140
 about new homes and designing new homes and decorating new homes and they would

388
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:28,860
 go on Zillow and look for listings of new homes this is what this couple wanted

389
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:35,300
 they wanted their forever home and that's exactly what the darkness gave

390
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:41,860
 them a home they would be trapped in forever
