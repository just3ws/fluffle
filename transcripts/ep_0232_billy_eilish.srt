00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Pop culture and conspiracies, I'd say for probably the past 50 years have been pretty intertwined,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 but we're seeing an uptick. It used to just be, "Paul is dead."

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 And now it's stuff like music is signaling the end of the world.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Or any of these conspiracies, real? Is predictive programming actually true?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 And does Fortnite prepare us for the ultimate slaughter today on the Pop Culture special of Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 [Music]

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Hey everyone. Welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 We got a lot to talk about, but I have to say this real quick guys.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 This has been driving me up the wall for weeks now, and I really want to do the story,

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 but I want to make sure the right person gets credit for it.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Tokaloshis? Tikaloshis? This little African monster man who runs, he's like, "This high is your knee?"

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 He's attacking a bunch of people in Africa. Who sent me that story?

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Someone sent me that story on YouTube. I have the note saying, "Request on YouTube."

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 If you guys knew what it was like behind the scenes here, I think you guys would...

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Oh jeez, I think you would probably think an AI must be running this show. The amount of the volume of stuff I get and have to deal with.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 One man show, remember? One man show. Having to try to compile all of these stories and do all this research and record it and edit it and all that stuff.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 It's quite crazy. And actually the past two days, I just kind of sat on my chair.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 I was just kind of like, "Ugh, I've been starving for two days and I'm so hungry. No matter what I eat, I'm so hungry."

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 But let's go ahead and get... If you're the guy who recommended on YouTube the little African monster demon, please hit me up.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 I plan on running the story in a couple of days, so if I don't hear anything, I got to get the story out, because it's a really interesting one.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 But hopefully you'll be able to hit me up. Let's go ahead and talk about today's episode.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Today's episode actually is about two requests as well. Two stories that were requested recently.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 I have a lot of requests I need to get through. It's not like it's a chore. There are a lot of great requests out there.

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 They just tend to take a little more time to research, because you guys will have questions.

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 You guys are a little more involved than, "What happened when this UFO landed in Colbert County, Wisconsin?"

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 You guys are like, "Hey, can you look into this issue?" I'm like, "Yes, I can. Thank you for your request."

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 So the first one we're going to look at, and it kind of falls into this pop culture theme.

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 So Alucard, via Gmail, sent me a story request. He wanted me to look at something, basically.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 He goes, "Here is Madonna's final performance at the Eurovision 2019."

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 It's like an American Idol, but it's every country in Europe.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Or something they send like, "I guess I should have researched it a little more."

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 But I guess every country sends some dude or some girl or whatever to one particular...

34
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 It's a talent show. Let me just say that. It's a talent show involving different countries. It's the Olympics of talent show.

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 So yes, I probably should have researched that. I'm aware of it in passing, because every so often it's controversial.

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 One year, Israel was about to win, and it was being broadcast in Saudi Arabia or some other Middle Eastern country.

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 And before they won, they just switched the show to something else. People were like, "What? I guess Israel won, because otherwise we would know who the winner was."

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 But this year it was in Israel. This year the closing act was Madonna, America's sexiest grandma.

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Now, Madonna... You know what's funny? I have a love-hate relationship. I have a more love relationship with Madonna.

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Her last couple albums haven't been that good. I did have to do a bunch of listening to music for this segment.

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 And her new stuff's not bad. It's probably her best stuff since music, which I think was probably one of her best albums in a long time.

42
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Anyway, so she's doing this show. Now, Alucard says, "I want you to take a look at this video." And thank you for the recommendation.

43
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 I want you to take a look at this video. I want you to see all of the Illuminati Masonic. He may not use those exact terms, but all of the subtext and all of the occultic symbols in this video.

44
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 So I watched it, and this is the thing. We've done episodes on predictive programming, and that is the theory that the Illuminati, or the powers that be, or whatever controlling group you want to believe in, is secretly leaving messages in the media to warn us,

45
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 or it's part of their spiritual law. They have to show us what they're going to do before they do it, or it is some sort of hyper-sigil, where they're basically, it's part of their magic working.

46
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 They have to show you the disasters that are about to come. Really, the only example that anyone can ever really point to in any of this is 9/11. They can go, "Look, here's a coloring book of Cookie Monster taking a bite out of the Twin Towers."

47
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Yes, that's an actual example people use. This happened in 1980. This book was published in the 80s. It was predictive programming. That's always what they go back to. I never see predictive programming for, I don't know, the Hindenburg, or I never see predictive programming for the Rise of Hitler, or predictive programming for Vietnam War.

48
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 In the 1940s, there weren't film reels about soldiers getting lost in the jungle and having to fight their way out of the jungle. They always point to the most recognized symbol in New York City being destroyed somehow as predictive programming.

49
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 When we've seen the White House flow multiple times, we've seen the Statue of Liberty get vaporized or taken over by monkeys, we've seen the gold, the magneto rip the Golden Gate Bridge up. We've seen all that stuff. None of that's ever happened.

50
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 But we keep seeing this particular set of towers destroyed in New York. It must be the Illuminati warning. So they always go back to that example. They may be able to pick one or two other, be like, "Oh no, the bombing in Kuwait was also in this stupid showtime movie where they blew up something in Kuwait."

51
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 So I'm kind of, that's always my feeling on predictive programming. But the question is this, Ali Kaur sent me this video of the Eurovision thing and I watched it. Does it have Illuminati/Masonic/Akultic symbols in it? Absolutely. Absolutely.

52
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 I would be a shill if I sat here and expected you not to watch the video and say, "I don't know what he's talking about. This video is totally normal. Everything's on the up and up. Everything's fine." It is 100% chock full of Illuminati/Masonic/Akultic symbolism.

53
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Now, like I said, I used to believe a lot more in this stuff than I do now. I'm far more skeptical about this stuff. But it does have images that you often see in these types of Akultic imagery.

54
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Checkered floors, white and black checkered floors. Pyramids, of course, are fairly popular. You make the pyramid sign. It's the Illuminati sign, so there's a lot of pyramids in it.

55
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 There is a portion where the dancers are dancing around in gas masks and then Madonna walks from one to another and is snapping their necks and killing them.

56
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 At one point, she starts singing one of her new songs. It's actually kind of cool jam. It's kind of like a reggae-inspired jam.

57
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 The lyrics, the choruses, not everyone's going to make it into the future. And while she's doing that, the Statue of Liberty is on flames and broken apart in the background.

58
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 They have this huge projection screen. You keep projecting stuff on. Before that happens, they show just a bunch of people screaming.

59
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 And you think this is a Madonna performance in a talent show? Yes. And that's why it sets people off. She actually shows up dressed up as a monk while other monks go, "Madonna, Madonna."

60
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 And actually creepier than that. And she shows up. She starts singing like a prayer and then a bunch of people run out in gas masks and she snaps all their necks.

61
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 And she's doing this whole thing. The world's on fire and then they just show cities and destruction. As she's singing this song, there's, again, a catchy little song.

62
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 And then everyone jumps off a building or the staircase, I guess, is more literal. And two people have, which I personally thought was a -- it was a controversial move, but it was sweet.

63
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 The last two dancers, one of them has the Palestinian flag. One of them has the Israeli flag on their back. They're supposed to be, like, coming together.

64
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 But if they don't work together, they also fall off of the staircase as well. And then Madonna goes, "Wake up!" And "Wake up!" appears on the big screen in the background.

65
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 It's super bizarre and you're watching it and there's two ways to interpret it. One is, I have secret knowledge. I know what these symbols are, but all the sheeple in the audience there who are zombies to their iPhones and their Twitter and their Facebook,

66
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 they don't understand the symbolism, but I do. It's the Illuminati warning me. That's one way to look at it. The other way to look at it is this.

67
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 First off, I can tell you everyone in that theater who was not high thought that was a weird performance. Everyone -- and this is the thing. I heard about it because it was so weird.

68
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 I heard about it mostly because the Palestinian and Israeli flag moment and people were like, "Why is she doing that? Why is she making this political?" And at a certain point it's not political. It's just kind of like, "Hey, let's kind of be nice to each other.

69
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Otherwise, we're all going to walk off the precipice together. The world will be destroyed in flames. If we don't start working together -- and this is a good place to start since I'm in Israel -- but the one way to look at it is that it's the predictive program.

70
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 And again, it is a cultic symbolism. It is symbolism that is associated with the occult. You'd have to watch the video. I think I've given a pretty good example, but it is weird video.

71
00:09:49,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 When's the last time you saw Madonna snap at people's necks? So the way, though, that I think it is -- and I was actually thinking about this in the shower when I was thinking about this Madonna segment -- the only time -- and someone might be able to prove me wrong on this.

72
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Someone might be able to prove me wrong on this. But the only time we really see Illuminati symbolism in music is a new artist or an artist trying to make their comeback. That's it.

73
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 You never see Shania Twain in her fourth album start doing the Illuminati hand signal. And we'll get to that in a second, because you might be like, "Well, that's a different type of genre of music," but we'll get to that in a second.

74
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 You never seen Celine Dion dancing around an occultic symbol. You know, Tupac, his last album, his last album recorded when he was alive, was called "The Kill Illuminati," where he's like, "I'm gonna kill all the Illuminati," and people have always thought that that may have gotten him killed.

75
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 But that may be an exception to that. I don't want to get too off on the subject, because I still got a bunch of other stuff to talk about, but rap music's association with the Illuminati is very, very long.

76
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 We talked about this in an early episode. In the black community, they are very, very into conspiracy theories, and obviously not all. I'm not trying to make a blanket statement. I guess that was a blanket statement.

77
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 But when you listen, nowadays they're like, "Oh, XXX Centation was sold to the devil," and all this Illuminati symbolism in these Kanye West videos.

78
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 If you look at rap in the 80s and the 90s and early 2000s, you'll be listening to a Dr. Dre song, and he'll be like, "What's his actual line?"

79
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 He talks about buying an island so the Illuminati can't find him, and it's like in track 10 of an Ice Cube album, and you're like, "What? That was bizarre."

80
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 Tupac made a lot of references to the Illuminati on Kill Illuminati about how he's gonna put holes in their body, stuff like that.

81
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Scarface, just on a random song, just was like, "Yeah, the Illuminati sucks," and you look, it's kind of steeped in that culture because they don't trust outsiders.

82
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 And the Illuminati is the ultimate outsider. It's basically this group that's not only an outsider, but it's trying to control every element of their life.

83
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 So you go back, you can listen to old rap music, and you'll hear every show often, you'll hear an anti-illuminati lyric.

84
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 It's quite odd, even when that terminology wasn't very pre-internet. They were talking about this, so it wasn't very well-known stuff in the general population.

85
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 And you'd be like, "Who is the Illuminati, and why does Dr. Dre trying to hide from him?"

86
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 The movie Belly. The movie Belly, I think that came out in 1999, 2000. It is a street thug gritty crime drama.

87
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 And in the last 20 minutes, the Illuminati shows up. It's super bizarre, and you're like, "What is going on?"

88
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Directed by the dude who did all of Puff Daddy's videos that starred DMX and, what's his face, Nas and Method Man's in it.

89
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 And then in the last 20 minutes, the Illuminati shows up. I think they say they're like the FBI or the CIA, but it's hinted they're like this global group.

90
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 They want him to kill this black man out of the blue. The whole movie is like Goodfellas, and the last 20 minutes becomes a political thriller.

91
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 Will or will not DMX kill this black man before the dawn of the new millennium is becoming the year 2000.

92
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 It's super weird, and you're like, "But in that culture that's like, 'Oh yeah, that could happen.' Totally. Totally happened."

93
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 I was intrigued, because I followed all that Illuminati stuff. I was like, "Whoa, this is really cool."

94
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 But I think the average moviegoer would be like, "What?" It would be like if you're watching the born supremacy, and then the last 20 minutes became a romantic comedy.

95
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 It just totally shifts. You're like, "What is, what, I was watching this dude just blow people away at dinner, and now he's trying to save this."

96
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 He was like this. It was so weird. But anyway, so you have that, you have all that stuff. Where was I going with this?

97
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 Oh yeah, so you have this symbolism, and it's either in young new artists or artists trying to make it come back.

98
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 So the question you have to ask is, one, either the theory is true in that the Illuminati control the music industry.

99
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 They control every facet of it. They actually control every facet of life. If you say that is true, which a lot of people do,

100
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 because they'll go, "I was watching a video before I sat down ahead of this. The song 'Let It Go' on the Disney movie 'Frozen' is an Illuminati occultic song.

101
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 It's everywhere. They control Madonna, they control 'Frozen', they control these mumblecore rappers that are just coming up, they control everyone.

102
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 Why isn't Garth Brooks in Illuminati symbolized videos? Why isn't Shania Twain? Why isn't Amy Grant? Why isn't some 41?

103
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 Why isn't Meatloaf? Why isn't every-- and people could go, "Well, one of those examples has one of the--"

104
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 If the Illuminati's goal was to push this predictive programming and to put this symbolism, they would put it everywhere.

105
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 Every song would have it. You wouldn't be able to avoid it. Because if you want to-- a lot of times they talk about MK Ultra and stuff like that.

106
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 If you want to do it, it has to be constant. If you're trying to split someone's personality or make--

107
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 Imagine there was a dictator who just popped up every five years and said, "Do what I say." You'd be like, "No."

108
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Because you know he's eventually going to disappear for another five years.

109
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 If in every music video there was a triangle in the background like 'Hipnoted', you would always associate the triangle with a good feeling of listening to music.

110
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 Therefore, you would worship the triangle. But it's not. So, either if the Illuminati controls everything, it should be in every facet of every song ever.

111
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Let alone all media. Predictive programming should have started with the very first silent film. It should have ended with just a triangle.

112
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Some sort of occultic symbol. And then we would be so used to it that it would be the ultimate hyper-sigil.

113
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 But either they control all of music or my theory is this.

114
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Billy-- what is it? Billy Ellish? Billy-- Billy Eilish? Eilish? Billy Eilish.

115
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 As a new artist, she started-- maybe not totally new. She was 15. I had to do much research on her too.

116
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 Because I was going to do a separate segment on her and this kind of all goes together.

117
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 The Billy Eilish is a 17-year-old singer. She just came out with an album called "When We Sleep, Where Do We Go?"

118
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 "Where Do We Go When We Sleep?" or whatever. Good music. I listened to it.

119
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Watched a bunch of her videos. Getting ready for this. Took a bunch of notes. Read a bunch of articles.

120
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 She's a young girl and the first time I ever heard of her was, "Oh my God, this girl's album is so creepy. Should kids listen to it?"

121
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 It's a marketing gimmick. If she was Meghan Trainor, it would wanna-- I would not have heard of her at all.

122
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 The only reason I know who Meghan Trainor is is because I had to-- I had to work-- where I worked only had a radio.

123
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 And so I heard all about my bae, or what is it? All about the bass a billion times.

124
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 To the point that I am almost like a Pavlovian dog where if that song's playing, I want to attack.

125
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 Because this song, I hate it. I hate that song.

126
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 Anyways, all about the bass and what-- and I was like this poor-- when I heard that song, I thought, "This poor girl, no matter what she does for the rest of her life,

127
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 she'll always be the fat girl who's saying the fat song."

128
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 It doesn't matter what else she does. I remember thinking that. And then her next album, my man says, "No, I gotta say no."

129
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 "You know, gotta say no, no, no, no, no, no." And I'm listening to that song and I'm like, "My prediction was correct."

130
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Because when I saw the video, she was wearing a corset to kind of like squeeze her in a bit.

131
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 And she was doing this like Janet Jackson type dance number and I saw, "Oh my God, like, this is the problem."

132
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 She made her first song about how being overweight and curvy was awesome.

133
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 And that won't last long in the music industry. It just won't.

134
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 And I was like, "This poor girl, she's a chubby girl doing a song about how awesome it is to be chubby."

135
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 And if she loses any weight or tries to change her body in any sort of way, it's a betrayal of what made her famous.

136
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 Anyways, my point of that being that had I not-- because I don't listen to the radio nowadays--

137
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 I would have never, ever known who Billie Elish was.

138
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 I wouldn't have known if she was a model because she's a model now.

139
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 I wouldn't have known if she was just some Instagram influencer because she has like 6 million followers.

140
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 I would have thought she was like a Logan Paul type character.

141
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 I would have had no idea who she was. I would have seen her in an ad somewhere,

142
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 but I would have never associated her with her music.

143
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 I might have heard a clip of her song and never--

144
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 But because her videos are so creepy and weird, they're basically short horror movies.

145
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 Not incredibly good short horror movies. They're not like scary, but they're definitely disturbing.

146
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 She has a song called "Bury Your Friend" where she talks about "Deal With The Devil."

147
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 She talks-- where she's basically-- the video is "She's The Monster Under Your Bed."

148
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 We'll get back to that in a second.

149
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 She has a video where there's just her singing and there's like a glass of black liquid in front of her.

150
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 And halfway through the song-- very minimalist videos a lot of times.

151
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 Halfway through the video, she picks up the glass and she drinks the black liquid,

152
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 and then it begins pouring out of her eyelids and a very good special effect.

153
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 And she continues to sing as her face is just becoming covered in this--

154
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 A lot of times she has bloody noses scraped up knees, stuff like that in this video.

155
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Good-- and I do like the music.

156
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 It's very catchy. It's kind of like this pop, syntho, pop, rap.

157
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 She was basically like Lord's daughter.

158
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 And here's a conspiracy theory for you that I believe.

159
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 There is no way Lord started off as a teenager.

160
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 She was 28 if I'm 42.

161
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 When I saw Lord, I was like, "Oh, cool.

162
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Some college graduate starting off her music career."

163
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 And then people are like, "This 17-year-old knows how to rock."

164
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 And I'm like, "There's no way. There's no way she's 17."

165
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 That's my conspiracy theory.

166
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 And a lot of people believe that too. Lord is actually a lot older than she says she is,

167
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 because being young is more hip in music.

168
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 And I guess there's an interview too where she was talking about what's that movie

169
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Sophia Coppola did, Virgin Suicides, and she goes, "Yeah, I loved that movie when I was a teenager."

170
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 I mean, I still am a teenager.

171
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Like, that's an actual quote.

172
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 And it's funny, it's-- I've pretty much-- I haven't looked at my notes a single time this episode.

173
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 I'm actually surprised. I guess not having that much nicotine in me

174
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 is actually improving my memory recall.

175
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 But let me wrap this up.

176
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 We're gonna have to save the Fortnite thing for tomorrow.

177
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Sorry, Jean-Luc. He recommended this Fortnite story. We'll get to that tomorrow.

178
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 But this is my ending here.

179
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 This symbolism stuff is used for new artists and used for comeback artists.

180
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 This Madonna performance, if she was just walking around on stage

181
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 and it wasn't controversial at all, and it had clips of her early videos

182
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 or clips of like, you just have these hunky dudes dancing, nobody would have talked about it.

183
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 Alucard never would have sent me the video. I never would have watched the video.

184
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 They wouldn't have gotten those two additional hits.

185
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 Plus, the hundreds of thousands of hits, maybe millions of hits,

186
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 of people who get the message in their email, "Look how weird this performance is."

187
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 The article's the next day. Look how groundbreaking and/or weird this performance is.

188
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 It's never people who are already established in their career.

189
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 It's people looking to make a comeback.

190
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 The one argument I'll say to that is Taylor Swift's "Look what me made you cut."

191
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 Taylor Swift's "Look what you made me do" video had elements of like,

192
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 her different personas and the white and black checkered floor and all that stuff.

193
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 Fine. But to my point, that was her first full pop album.

194
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 That was her first album where she's like, "I'm not doing country anymore.

195
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 I'm going full whatever I'm doing now."

196
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Well, I don't even remember the name of that album, but...

197
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 Oh, "Reputation." Yeah, she's like, "This is my first...

198
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 There's no country stuff on this whatsoever."

199
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 So, her last album was kind of a mix.

200
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 So again, it was a reinvention. It gave her a little, you know, made her a little more noticeable

201
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 by having this symbolism in it.

202
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 What do these symbols mean?

203
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 Now, there's a lot of conspiracy theories, obviously, about the Eurovision performance

204
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 that it is predictive programming for the end of the world.

205
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 There's a lot of symbolism.

206
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 There was an odd article I read on "Vigilant Citizen."

207
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 I could do 100 episodes on "Vigilant Citizen," but...

208
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 "Vigilant Citizen" had an article about Billy Eilish's song "Bury a Friend"

209
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 or "Bury your friend," whatever it was,

210
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 that her and XXXTentacion were very good friends,

211
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 and in the video, there is a young black man with similar hair, I guess?

212
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 I mean, I don't know.

213
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 And Billy Eilish is the monster under his bed.

214
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 And there's a theory that she is...

215
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 She sacrificed him for her own career.

216
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 Like, that was her soul sacrifice.

217
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Is the song about selling your soul?

218
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Absolutely.

219
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 All of her songs, for the most part, I should say all of them,

220
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 but a lot of the songs have self-harmoned them, suicidal thoughts in them,

221
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 satanic imagery, demonic imagery,

222
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 and you're like, "Jason, if she's saying this stuff, then how can you just be like,

223
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 'Ah, it's nothing.'"

224
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 Here's the thing, then.

225
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 Here's the thing.

226
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 It's a genre I call "kid sister music," because I have a kid sister.

227
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 And when we were 12, and well, she was 12, I was older,

228
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 but when she was 12, you know what I've talked about this, the Boo pill, too.

229
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 Chicks dig dark stuff.

230
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 So, it just is.

231
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 You can listen to the episode on the Boo pill, it seems like a thousand years ago,

232
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 I recorded that one, but Chicks dig ghost and darkness and scary stuff and all that stuff.

233
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 Makes them feel alive.

234
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 They love going to horror movies.

235
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 They love getting scared.

236
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 So my sister, she'd make her own Ouija boards, and she was like wicking,

237
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 and she was like reading these books and drawing pentagrams and all this stuff.

238
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 And if Billie Eilish existed when my sister, she's still alive,

239
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 but if she existed when the 12-year-old version of my sister existed,

240
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 she would have bought into it lock, stock, and barrel.

241
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 She is a pop musician who they have packaged to be this dark edgy kid.

242
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 Now, I don't know if she packaged herself like that, or if her family packaged her like that,

243
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 or the studio packaged her like that, or all together, but that's her packaging.

244
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Lord was like this young rebellious, well young, she was like this rebellious singer

245
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 who wasn't going to play by the industry rules, and that was kind of her gimmick.

246
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Meghan Trainor was the chubby chick.

247
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 Like that is how they packaged her.

248
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 And look at this voluptuous young girl.

249
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Don't tell her she's not healthy.

250
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 The problem is that you can't ever break out of those molds,

251
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 and really everyone has them for the most part.

252
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 What's Maroon's Five gimmick that they just recorded a different song,

253
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 each single sounds like a different band?

254
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 But like Ace, like if you have a band that's all, we're bunch of drinkers,

255
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 and we're partying and stuff like that, if you ever go out of that,

256
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 you fall out of favor for the most part.

257
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 So I think they packaged her as this dark edgy kid.

258
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 And it will last for a couple years.

259
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 I don't think you can pull off this type of thing for long.

260
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Your fan base will grow out of it.

261
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 Eventually they'll stop cutting themselves in their arms and go out and get married,

262
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 or go get jobs in a particular field or whatever.

263
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 But I don't know how long this gimmick can actually last for her,

264
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 but it's working for her now.

265
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Because not only is it attracting a bunch of girls, a bunch of young girls,

266
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 you're like, "Look how different I am. I'm so rebellious.

267
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 I'm rebellious, just like Billie Eilish."

268
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 They're buying into the fashion, they're buying into the music.

269
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 But also it's weird enough to get normal people,

270
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 well I wouldn't say I'm normal,

271
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 but it's different enough to get people who normally wouldn't listen to that,

272
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 to go, "Oh, this is a thing."

273
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 And I'll check it out. And I checked it out and I'm like, "Oh, this is pretty decent."

274
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 So it's a gimmick. It's a gimmick.

275
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 I think that it's all a marketing gimmick.

276
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 It is designed to get people to pay attention.

277
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 If Billie Eilish was just like Lord, I never would have...

278
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 Not only would I not have known who she was,

279
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 if I found out who she was, I would have not listened to her music just out of principle,

280
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 because I dislike Lord's music.

281
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 She's probably a lovely person, probably a lovely person,

282
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 but I just didn't like it. I don't go for that, "Look how rebellious and cool I am."

283
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 I don't like that. And what's funny is Billie Eilish's stuff is kind of the same thing,

284
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 but with a supernatural edge, it's just enough to kind of fool me into liking it,

285
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 but it's still that kind of like, "Look how cool I am."

286
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 So the thing with predictive programming is the world has so many symbols in it,

287
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 and so much content, entertainment content, literature content, scholarly content, whatever,

288
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 that if you...it's like the Bible code.

289
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 If you cross-reference any event, I believe if you cross-reference any event,

290
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 and then went through literature and made up your own code of what to look for,

291
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 everything can be predicted.

292
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 You could grab an encyclopedia from 1966 and find out who will win the World Series two years from now.

293
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 The catch is you're going to have to wait until after the World Series from two years from now,

294
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 but once you know the answer, you can then go back and look for the code that proves that answer right.

295
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 I believe, totally believe you can do that.

296
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 The question is, is that what's going on here?

297
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 Is there really a secret cabal that is going around Hollywood in these musical sets

298
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 and talking to musicians and saying, "I will make you famous if you let me hide a 10 triangles in your video?"

299
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 And the Don is like, "Done."

300
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 Very unlikely.

301
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 Very, very, very unlikely.

302
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 I won't say it's absolutely impossible, but it's extremely unlikely.

303
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 What I think is more likely is what I've...the argument I've stated the rest of this episode,

304
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 and yeah, Fortnite will come tomorrow. I think that they're doing it to be edgy.

305
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 However, however, I will give them this.

306
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 I do find it a little odd that the edginess is so uniform.

307
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 The edginess is steeped in occultic symbols.

308
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 She could have been edgy, Billy Eilish could have been edgy,

309
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 by presenting herself as a firm Catholic.

310
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 She's this rebellious teen, but all of her videos full of staunch family values.

311
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 That would be edgy, especially today.

312
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 That would be very controversial.

313
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 Exact same songs, but in the videos it's her, her husband, and her kids having a happy life in this home together.

314
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 It would be very controversial, right?

315
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 People would be like, "What? Is she promoting like father and a mother and they have these kids and they vote?"

316
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 And they...so.

317
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Could have been edgy in the sense that it wasn't supernatural edgy.

318
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 It could have been edgy in the sense that it was just violent.

319
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 Her in a war uniform, charging over a hill.

320
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 She and a bunch of people from a different nation.

321
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 That would have been edgy. That would have been weird, right?

322
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 So you can do edgy multiple ways.

323
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 The nirvana's edginess was, "We're just not going to wash our clothes,

324
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 and we're going to like kind of sing into this mic and just play our guitars really weird."

325
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 They didn't have any of this imagery.

326
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 They were edgy because it was so different from what we've seen.

327
00:29:52,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 So I do think it's weird that throughout the music industry, the edginess does seem to be uniform.

328
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 It does seem to be, "My career's just starting off. Let's throw a couple triangles in one hand over my eye imagery."

329
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 Or, "I need a career to come back. Let's just throw a couple triangles in one hand over my eye imagery."

330
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 Madonna has a patch now.

331
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 That is weird.

332
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 I will say this though.

333
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Watching both the Billy Eilish's videos for this, and watching even the Eurovision thing,

334
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 they were creepy. They were disturbing.

335
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 So either the edginess works, or there is some group behind the scenes.

336
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 And not only are they all powerful, but they know how to make us squirm.

337
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 And if they know how to scare us, know how to worry us, know how to make us go, "Ugh, that's not right."

338
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 They can dig that deep into our soul already.

339
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 If there's a war coming, they've already won.
