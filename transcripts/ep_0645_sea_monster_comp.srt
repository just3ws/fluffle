1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,340
 A bizarre, controversy rocks.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,340
 Australia's parliament.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,340
 And then we go back in time to take a look at the story of Captain Jason Seabury.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:15,840
 Historical reports say that his ship mysteriously vanished off the coast of Alaska.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:21,540
 But when you dig deeper into the reports, his death may have not been mysterious after all.

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,540
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,540
 I don't know if I'm a big gal, actually I'm a rock big gal.

8
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:34,180
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

9
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,020
 Carpenter. I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too. Hey, I'm recording

10
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,900
 this in a totally new location. You know what, before I go into that, I want to get your

11
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,820
 feedback on the sound quality. But before I go into that, let's introduce our Patreon

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,820
 supporter, our legacy Patreon supporter, coming into Dead Rabbit Command floating around.

13
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,380
 He's a ghost. He's a piece of toast. Hopefully, oh my god that's in bad taste. Hopefully, he's

14
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:01,380
 still alive. But for this introduction, give a round of applause to Joel Gonzalez. He's

15
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,420
 like, has a little Casper. Casper has regular legs. He has a little slimer legs. Like they

16
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,420
 just come a little wiggle at the bottom. He's floating around. He's alive in real life.

17
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:14,620
 Hopefully, but right now he's a ghost. Joel, you're going to be our captain, our pilot's

18
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:19,180
 episode. If you guys can't support the Patreon, or if you are still alive, again hopefully,

19
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,780
 that's fine too. That's actually amazing if you're still alive. Just helps spread the

20
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,180
 word about the show. Really, really helps out a lot.

21
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,540
 So the reason why Joel is a ghost, and the reason why I might sound differently, is

22
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:35,100
 man, yesterday's episode took forever to record. I had it start taking a lot of breaks because

23
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,380
 it's getting so noisy in the neighborhood. It's spring. People are out talking to their

24
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,540
 friends, building bonds with fellow humans and things like that. I'm not going to rain

25
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,340
 on their parade. I have no right to anyways. But it was getting too noisy to record, and

26
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,420
 I've noticed that trend coming on for a while. So thanks to Patreons like Joel, I've actually

27
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:59,660
 started to invest in some acoustic sound dampening foam for the microphone. I'm really going

28
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:04,820
 to really pimp out this studio. And right now I have moved the studio out of my living

29
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:12,140
 room into my haunted closet. I am recording this in my haunted closet. It actually is

30
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,660
 dead quiet in here. The second I go in my living room, I hear a bunch of people laughing.

31
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,780
 So we're going to see, you guys let me know, email me, because we don't have the YouTube

32
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,140
 thing anymore. Email me and let me know how the sound quality is here. Is it better? Is

33
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,700
 it noticeably better? Do you not notice a difference? Anything like that. But Joel is

34
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,900
 a ghost in case, I'm pretty sure the ghost in my closet is chill at this point. I say

35
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:37,260
 as I've invaded his home to yell for 35, 40 minutes about random stuff. But Joel, let's

36
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,740
 go ahead, take a corporeal form, and I'm going to hand you the hair hang glider. Let's get

37
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:46,580
 our journey started. We're leaving behind Jason's haunted closet. I'm stuck here. You

38
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,460
 guys are leaving the closet. I'm there with you in spirit. We're leaving behind my haunted

39
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:58,180
 closet and Dead Ravac Man. We're headed out to Australia. Joel is so used to flying in

40
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:02,580
 his ghost form. He gets us there in no time. Specifically, we're headed to Capitol Hill.

41
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,500
 That's in Canberra in Australia. And most of this information, I just saw this article

42
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,580
 the other day. Most of this information I got from an article written for the Daily Beast

43
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,460
 by Jamie Ross. So thank you, Jamie, for putting this all together. We walk into the House of

44
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:21,300
 Parliament in Australia. And we go and we sit down. We're disguised as Australians. We're

45
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,220
 just kind of sitting there. And we all look like the sniper from Team Fortress 2. And

46
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,660
 we're watching this investigation unfold. These police are walking up to a desk and

47
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:34,140
 they're like dusting it. And then they're like, mmm. And then they put on gloves and

48
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,900
 then they're still like, hmm, hmm. And they're like, you're the rookie, right? And the rookie's

49
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,980
 like, uh, yeah. And they go, you, you do this, you touch the desk, you do all the investigative

50
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,700
 stuff. The rookie's like, dang it. So he puts on like three pairs of gloves and he's like

51
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:53,700
 touching the desk and he's like, crikey, mate. The legends are true. So that's a really long

52
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:59,180
 introduction to basically say people, people in Australia. Sorry, wait, wait, wait, before

53
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,140
 I go any further, if you have any kids listening to this podcast, usher them out, put them

54
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:08,620
 in their own haunted closets for the first segment. It turns out that what is going on,

55
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:15,020
 that long introduction was leading to this, a bunch of dudes have been jacking off on women's

56
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:21,420
 desks at the House of Parliament. So I know there was kind of a rush of information. So

57
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:28,740
 let me break that down for you again. Men are videotaping themselves, masturbating and ejaculating,

58
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:35,620
 not just pretending to like hump the desk. Me like, look at me ejaculating on members

59
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:41,660
 of parliament's desks who are women. Because they want to do a man's desk, right? That's

60
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:48,020
 a little gay. It's all grow. Let me start breaking this down here. A desk is a desk,

61
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:55,020
 right? A man's desk is a woman's desk. The fact that they're targeting the women's desk,

62
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,060
 it's almost like sexual revenge, you know what I mean? If they were just masturbating

63
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:03,020
 on everyone's desk, they'd be like, okay, they have a problem. They just left a masturbate

64
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,660
 they're doing it in public, which that's not a problem, it's a crime. That's one thing,

65
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:12,700
 but the fact that they're specifically targeting women's desks, it adds a little more malice

66
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,180
 to it. You know what I mean? If you found out that someone jacked off in your drink,

67
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:22,060
 you'd get really really upset. You'd probably get violently upset. But if you found out

68
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:28,100
 that he ejaculated in everybody's drink, he'd be like, oh, Barry, he's all blushing.

69
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:34,700
 Yeah, right. I mean, it's still disgusting, but it's less targeted. So this has been going

70
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:41,580
 on for a while. But luckily we have a whistleblower going by the name of Tom. Whistleblower Tom

71
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,100
 has come forward and his job is to expose the pervert parties of parliament. Like I

72
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,260
 said, there is a video of a man, he's all pixelated. There was a horrible birth defect.

73
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:56,700
 He was born pixelated, but he's pixelated and he's masturbating at a female parliament

74
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:02,420
 member's desk. So we have that. And then Tom has this quote in this Daily Beast article,

75
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:08,220
 quote, "The fact that it is a female MP, a minister of parliament, only adds to the

76
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:14,020
 disgrace that it is." Unquote. I fully, fully agree with you, Tom. Like again, if you're

77
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,780
 doing it to everyone's desk, that's gross, but the fact that they're targeting a particular

78
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,180
 group. If they were just doing it on men's desks and not women's desks, I wouldn't be

79
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:27,380
 like progressive. I would still be like they're obviously targeting for some reason. So Tom

80
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:32,560
 has exposed this thing. Tom, I really want to thank you. And then I read the very next

81
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,620
 sentence of the Daily Beast article, quote, "The whistleblower, who was identified only

82
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:45,220
 as Tom in the report, admitted to taking part in some of the misconduct, but said he decided

83
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:52,140
 that the time is right to expose what's been going on." Unquote. So Tom, Tom wasn't Batman's

84
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,660
 sending in the rafters. He's like, "Ah, the day of justice will come. I just need more

85
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:01,460
 evidence. I just need more evidence of these men masturbating other than this video footage."

86
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:06,180
 He was doing it too. He's like standing next to two guys and they're all playing soggy

87
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:11,660
 cracker with people's desks. And then he feels guilty and he's like, "Oh, I must expose

88
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:16,140
 these villains. I must expose these villains now that I'm done. I'm not going to wait five

89
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:20,700
 minutes for everyone else to finish." No, I must expose them. And so on the one hand,

90
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,460
 it's good that he's exposing them, but on the other hand, he was doing it too. He was

91
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,540
 jacking off on these people's desks. He said there's a little room in the parliament building

92
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,100
 that people go to for prayer or meditation. And Tom's like, "You won't believe what happens

93
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:39,180
 in there. You won't believe the one time I went in there." He's shifting from side

94
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,660
 to side. He goes, "Listen, people have sex in there. People go in that room and have

95
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,260
 sex in there." So it's not just that they're masturbating on desks. They're also having

96
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:53,900
 sex in the prayer room. If I had a choice between walking by a room and I heard two

97
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:59,980
 people having sex or sitting down on my desk and going to get a post-it note and noticing

98
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:04,100
 they're a little more sticky than normal, I would much rather walk by. Much rather walk

99
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:10,020
 by the door with the "Ah, ooh, ah." Make sure your kids are still in the haunted closet.

100
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:16,020
 This segment's not done yet. We got another quote from Tom. Quote, "Now is the time to

101
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:22,380
 speak up. Now is the time to put it on the record. It is a culture of men thinking that

102
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:29,180
 they can do whatever they want." I like to imagine that Tom, after saying that quote,

103
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,860
 continued, "Including me. Including me. I belong to a culture of men given all the

104
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,420
 do-types, given the male reporter a high-five because I don't want to touch your hand."

105
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:41,740
 He's like, "Yeah, up until five minutes ago, I thought that I could do whatever I want.

106
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:46,820
 But now, I was totally wrong. I was totally wrong the multiple times I masturbated on

107
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:52,900
 women's desks. No more! I'm gonna rat everyone else out." And again, I want to say I'm glad

108
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:57,260
 that he's ratting people out. I'm glad that he exposed this. But I don't think we can

109
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,940
 whitewash this guy. There's no pun intended. I don't think we can whitewash this dude's

110
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,980
 involvement. He was part of it and we'll get to why, not why he was doing it. That's just

111
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:12,200
 being a pervert, but why he exposed it at the end, which I think is very, very telling.

112
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:18,500
 It wasn't... He saw a culture of men thinking whatever they could do. There's a little...

113
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:25,100
 I don't know what the libel laws are in Australia. But my hypothesis, my theory, I can imagine

114
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,620
 Tom coming into my haunted closet right now and he goes, "You know what, Jason? I had

115
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:34,340
 the courage to stand up and expose myself. I mean, expose the truth. Why are you making

116
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,820
 fun of me?" Well, Tom, let's take a closer look at this article. It does say in the

117
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:45,060
 article that Tom is afraid that he may be fired for leaking the story, not leaking on

118
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:52,180
 people's desks, but now he's afraid that because he leaked the truth about himself and other

119
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:57,420
 people committing inappropriate acts in a government building, that that's why he'll

120
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:02,700
 be fired. Not because they'll dig up something or find his DNA all over the place. Here we

121
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:08,780
 have this... This is a powerful quote. Quote. "It needs to start with the removal of this

122
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:16,340
 toxic, powerful, privileged boys club that does what it wants, when it wants, where it

123
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:22,940
 wants." To which I imagine Tom added onto that quote. And again, that's what I was doing

124
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:28,860
 five minutes ago. I did what I wanted, when I wanted, and where I wanted was on that desk.

125
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:33,620
 That chair you're sitting on, reporter. You might want to take pregnancy tests when you

126
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:38,740
 get home. Reporters are like, "I'm a dude." He's like, "My jizz is that powerful." So

127
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:44,700
 what prompted this? Did he really have a change of heart? I think this is really interesting.

128
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,820
 And this is where the joke's in. This is also where the joke's in. Just recently, there

129
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:56,500
 was a young woman, Brittany Higgins, 26-year-old worker at the House of Parliament. She filed

130
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:03,860
 a report that she had been raped by a co-worker. And the federal police have started investigating

131
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,700
 this. They're coming down to the House of Parliament. They're interviewing people. And

132
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:15,380
 the idea was that this rape, this... No joke, not funny part. This rape of this young woman

133
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:20,860
 was sparking conversations about the whole culture of the House of Parliament and the

134
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:26,940
 way that sex was viewed in this place, these very powerful people, preying on vulnerable

135
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:32,820
 people. You have powerful senior politicians preying on interns. The oldest story in the

136
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:38,140
 book. And now this story gets exposed. This isn't the oldest story in the book. This normally

137
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:44,380
 doesn't happen. But I'm wondering, put on our conspiracy caps, we're in Australia, so

138
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:49,860
 put them on upside down. My theory is, and I have nothing to back this up. My theory

139
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,140
 is, and I won't even say Tom was doing it just for illegal reasons, but my theory is

140
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:58,820
 certain people may have been scared knowing that there is now federal police investigation

141
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:05,740
 looking into sex crimes in the building and somebody said, "We're all gonna get caught,

142
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:13,940
 so I'm gonna be the hero you guys can get caught." The difference is, and this is always

143
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:18,860
 the thing about snitches and rats and stuff like that, I think the easiest way to kind...

144
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:25,540
 If you view a horrible crime and you're not a participant in it, you should say something.

145
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,460
 I have a little asterisk, if it involves gangs you have to really weigh your family safety

146
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:34,100
 if it involves a street gang or something like that. But for the most part, if you see

147
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:39,260
 a crime and you have nothing to do with it, I think you have a moral right to say... I

148
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:44,700
 think you have a moral duty to say something about it. But if you're a participant in said

149
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:50,380
 crime and you feel like everyone's gonna get wrapped up super fast, so you start spilling

150
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:58,460
 the beans, that's when you're basically a snitch. Now you can be a snitch and do good,

151
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:03,140
 do a net good for society like exposing this perversion. I'm not saying that you should

152
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:08,900
 have kept his mouth shut. Snitches get stitches, or in this case snitches get sticky, but...

153
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:13,620
 Because they're masturbating on him. The haunted closet, I don't know if my jokes are landing

154
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:18,540
 in the haunted closet. My point is that it was a net good for society to expose these

155
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:23,380
 people, but the article made it seem like Tom was this noble figure and maybe he is.

156
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:27,860
 It doesn't say exactly what he was doing, it just said he participated in the activities.

157
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:33,460
 I can't imagine a time I'd be hanging out with my friends, my coworkers and they're

158
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,900
 like "hey man what's up?" I was like "hey dude what's going on man, did you guys watch

159
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:40,140
 Justice League, Zack Snyder Cut?" They're like "yeah, it took me two days to watch

160
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,820
 it, it was pretty good, yeah I really really enjoyed it. Flash is my favorite character

161
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:47,140
 out of the movie, yeah it's pretty cool. Hey uh do you want to masturbate on this desk?"

162
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:52,860
 What? What did you just say? Hey man you want to come over here and masturbate on this

163
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,780
 desk? We all have. I look over, I'm like "oh dang it." Like I don't know, that was my

164
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:02,340
 desk, that was my desk getting ready to clock in to work. I can't imagine myself getting

165
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:06,260
 talked into that. And again there's so many layers to that, I can't imagine myself getting

166
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:11,500
 talked into that. I definitely couldn't imagine myself targeting people like as a prank. I'm

167
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,500
 not saying I would do it, but I could see people just randomly jacking off on desks,

168
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:22,820
 that is, I'm digging myself into a hole. That is more, that's a little more, I don't want

169
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,820
 to say tasteful because that's what we're talking about. You know what I mean, it's

170
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,140
 a difference between, imagine if I was walking down the street and I was bashing people,

171
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,860
 this is something I can do, it's something I can relate to. I'm walking on the street

172
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:37,860
 bashing in car windows with a baseball bat and I'm just doing it randomly. Versus me

173
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,900
 going "I don't like that type of person and I'm targeting the cars that have bumper stickers

174
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,660
 that make me think it's that person." That's the difference to me, that's the difference

175
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:50,980
 to me. You may not care when you're, you may not care when you're windows busted, but

176
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:55,100
 you know if you look down the street and you saw people of all religions and colors and

177
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:00,660
 creeds and ethnicities and all their windows are busted, you will say "whoever did this,

178
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:06,780
 whoever did this, may be a jerk." But he is not a racist, he is definitely not a racist,

179
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:11,380
 he just loves smashing windows. That's the difference between people like me and people

180
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:17,460
 like the members of parliament, the masturbating ones, not the other politicians.

181
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:22,620
 After that incredibly uncomfortable story, let's talk about a movie called Happily, new

182
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:27,700
 today on Digital and On Demand. Joel McCaill and Carrie Bache lead an all-star cast in

183
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:33,340
 a dark romantic comedy, Happily. The film centers around a couple who, after 14 years

184
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:39,340
 of marriage, discover their friends are resentful of their constant public displays of affection.

185
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:43,100
 When a visit from a mysterious stranger leads to a dead body, they begin to question the

186
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:49,540
 loyalty of their so-called friends. Buy or rent Happily today on Digital and On Demand,

187
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:53,580
 rated R, from Paramount Pictures. Dude, I really want to watch this movie. I actually went

188
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:57,620
 to go get it loaded up, but my internet was acting kinda goofy. I'll probably watch it

189
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:03,380
 tonight. I really want to watch it. Joel Gonzalez. Here comes the tickle monster. He's

190
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,860
 like "what?" Where'd this come from? I'm tickling Joel Gonzalez, I don't know. Just popped

191
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,860
 in my head. I'm tickling, tickling, everyone get a good tickle on Joel Gonzalez. Joel,

192
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:16,460
 let's put you in the Carbinder copter. He's like "this is humiliating man. This is totally

193
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,740
 humiliating. You haven't tickled any of your other Patreon supporters, so then you should

194
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:23,340
 feel special." Joel, let's put you in the Carbinder copter. We are leaving behind all

195
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:30,820
 of Australia and we are headed on out to the Pacific Ocean. And hit that little button

196
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:40,780
 right there. We're going back in time to January 18th, 1852. Carbinder copter's flying over

197
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:48,060
 an empty Pacific Ocean. This wind is still, we're just cruising baby. We're just cruising

198
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:55,780
 over the ocean. We hear Joel go "man why are the controls for the Carbinder copters so

199
00:16:55,780 --> 00:17:02,140
 sticky?" Jason and I'm all "ooh" and I'm all blushing. Joel Gonzalez takes me, wash

200
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:06,580
 off the controls and fly us on out through the middle of the Pacific Ocean. I love this

201
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:11,180
 story. This is part two of our Sea Monster Week Sea Serpent Week. You guys know long

202
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,740
 time listeners of the show know I really don't like Sea Monsters Sea Serpents because

203
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:19,820
 it's the same thing over and over again, but this story. This story is actually reported

204
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:24,780
 in the Maritime Heritage Project. You can tell from the name, it's a pretty snooty

205
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,980
 organization. They talk about ropes and coils and what type of wood was on what type of

206
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:35,100
 boat. It's basically a cumulation of all sorts of historical facts that if it did

207
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:40,740
 not involve the subject of this story, I would be super bored. There are also documents

208
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:45,820
 if you look at the Wailing Museum in New Bedford. They have the papers of the family

209
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:51,540
 of the main character of this story. So this is not some flight of fancy. Or is it? Let's

210
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:57,260
 take a look at it. Let's take a look at the story. I love the story. It's January 18th,

211
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:07,060
 1852. And Captain Jason Seabury is on the deck of the Manga Hela. Manga Hela. Splash!

212
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:14,140
 The boat is moving over the waves. We're dressed up like old time pirates. We're walking around.

213
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,860
 We all look like Snead or whatever his name was from Peter Pan. Captain Jason Seabury

214
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:23,340
 turns around and goes, "How do these pirates get on my ship?" Immediately we change clothes.

215
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:28,180
 Now we're wearing American naval clothes or whatever. Just American clothes, Swabby clothes,

216
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:32,460
 whatever. Probably going to research it, but I'm stuck in a haunted closet. So I can't.

217
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:37,460
 The Manga Hela, Captain by Jason Seabury, I'm going to keep saying his first name because

218
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:42,620
 it's the best name ever, is floating alongside the Rebecca Sims. Now they're both wailing

219
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:49,420
 vessels and the Rebecca Sims is Captain by Captain Gavit. The Rebecca Sims is actually

220
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:55,060
 coming back from its wailing journey and the Manga Hela is just getting started. Their

221
00:18:55,060 --> 00:19:01,220
 headquarters is New Bedford and where they're headed is Alaska. Get some whales, chop them

222
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,260
 up. I don't know what they do with them. Cook them. I don't think they cook them on the boat.

223
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:10,300
 They're like the whole boat is super smoky. They're trying to throw two tons of meat into

224
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,660
 the boiler. But you know they get whale and whale fat and whale skin and whale eyeballs

225
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:18,500
 for witches and stuff like that. These boats though are kind of stuck in the Pacific Ocean

226
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,020
 at this point because there's no wind. There's just a little bit of wind, but not a lot.

227
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,860
 But you know what are you going to do? You're just kind of hanging out and boats are just

228
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,460
 kind of sitting there just going with the motion of the ocean. It's all you can do.

229
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:35,620
 And then we hear "Captain! Captain!" and we look up and there's a dude in the little

230
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:40,940
 crow's nest and he has like a telescope and he's like "Captain! That thing! There's something

231
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:45,300
 over there! Look! Look!" and the captain pulls out his own telescope and he looks and he

232
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:52,100
 sees this large shape in the water and he's like "Hmm, interesting. It must be a whale

233
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:56,780
 that was hit with a harpoon but it didn't die. So, men, let's go put it out of its

234
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:01,500
 misery. Let the feast begin! Let's eat this whale right now!" He orders three long boats

235
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,860
 to approach the wounded whale and put it out of its misery. So Captain Gavitt's on his

236
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:12,260
 boat, he's a bit farther off, and then Captain Jason Seabury's on his boat and they're watching

237
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,940
 these three long boats go towards this shape. Now they're not really expecting anything.

238
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:20,500
 They just expect like to see a bunch of blood. They're super blood thirsty captains. They're

239
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,940
 all blood, blood, blood. They're never really expecting anything. They're just keeping an

240
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:29,180
 eye on what's going on. The long boats get to the shape and they get a harpoon ready

241
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:36,500
 and they launch it into the water and the second the harpoon pierces the skin of this

242
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:43,820
 lump, it rises up out of the water. Now these three long boats are very, very close to this

243
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:52,860
 thing and all they see is a giant head up here. It's about ten feet long and it looks

244
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:59,420
 like a crocodile's head. And it thrashes the water so much two of the long boats get instantly

245
00:20:59,420 --> 00:20:59,420
 capsized. "Overboard! Oh, matey! Look out! A land ho! Other pirate stuff! Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

246
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:10,060
 capsized. The guys on the long boat that hasn't been tipped over, they're like "We're not pirates

247
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:15,380
 you idiots quitsane pirate stuff." But the creature is still there, a fresh harpoon in

248
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:20,540
 its body. The Rebecca Sims and the Manga Hela start moving to the long boats. They gotta

249
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:23,980
 rescue these guys. They don't know what it is, but remember there's not a lot of wind

250
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:28,900
 so it's a slow journey but they're able to muster just enough wind to get to the long

251
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:33,940
 boats, they rescue all the sailors. The boats pull alongside each other and Captain Jason

252
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:38,780
 Seabaring and Captain Gavid are talking about what was that. They didn't get a great look

253
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,620
 at it but it didn't look like a whale and the men were like "That was no whale sir."

254
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:48,140
 But there's no wind, they're still stuck on there, they can't make any formatable change

255
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:58,180
 of movement. By the next morning they look and the creature is now dead.

256
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:04,020
 When they stuck with the harpoon it thrashed about and went underwater but now it has risen

257
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:12,740
 to the top. And it is huge. It's 100 feet long and 10 feet of that is just its head.

258
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:18,500
 From nose to the tip of the tail it's 100 feet long. It's a brownish grey color with

259
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:26,460
 a white stripe 3 feet thick running along its side. You're like "Crap the stripe is

260
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:31,580
 3 feet thick, how big is the thing?" It's 100 feet long, how thick is it? It's 50 feet

261
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:39,540
 in diameter. So what's that like 5 stories of a building? That's how thick it is. Captain

262
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:45,860
 Jason Seabaring is looking down at this thing and he goes "I..." He's got the pirate infection

263
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,260
 as well. He got bit by a pirate in the middle of the night. He's looking at this thing and

264
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:53,340
 he goes "I've heard the stories." We've all heard the stories of sea monsters. And people

265
00:22:53,340 --> 00:23:00,220
 come back to port. And they're laughed, they're ridiculed. But we have proof ladies and gent...

266
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:05,420
 There's no ladies here, we have proof gentlemen. Now obviously they can't carry a 100 foot

267
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:10,340
 long creature that's 50 feet in diameter. It won't fit on the ship. And then they're

268
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:15,020
 thinking "Well we can't drag it." Actually that's not the story I'm adding that part.

269
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:18,420
 But I was thinking they can't drag it because it would start to decompose and little fishies

270
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,820
 would be eating it and eventually they'd be like "Here's our prize!" And it's just

271
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:27,580
 like "Well that's still a giant skeleton but you couldn't drag it." So he orders its head

272
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:31,740
 chopped off. He goes "If anything we can keep this head." So they chop the head off, they

273
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:37,020
 bring that on board. That's only 10 feet long. And like I said it was in the shape of a crocodile's

274
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:46,340
 head. It had teeth like a serpent where they were like angled. Like that sound effect doesn't

275
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:50,020
 help. You know what I mean? Like a snake's teeth how it's like the hook. It has the hook

276
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:57,900
 teeth. Each tooth is 3 inches long. There's 94 of them. Captain Jason Seabury goes "Good

277
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,700
 we got this head. We got this head. Now we gotta preserve it so they pickle it." They

278
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:07,580
 put in a giant jar of pickles. They're like "Okay everyone eat all the pickles today

279
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,940
 because we need this giant jar, this giant jar of plastic pickles that my mom sent us

280
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:17,740
 with." Let's empty it out. They put the head and they pickle it to preserve it. And he

281
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:21,740
 goes "We're gonna bring this back." But he also writes up a very detailed report about

282
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:26,860
 what happened. Now remember the Rebecca Sims is headed back to New Bedford in Massachusetts.

283
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:33,140
 And that is where the Manga Hela launched from. Captain Jason Seabury he wants this as proof

284
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:38,260
 that sea monsters exist. But also I think part of him wanted the glory of bringing it back.

285
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,980
 And at the end of the day this was a commercial fishing vessel. They needed to get these whales.

286
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:46,380
 So he told Captain Gavity says "I'm gonna give you this detailed report all these findings

287
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:51,660
 that we have. You take this back to New Bedford and then I will return to New Bedford in a

288
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:54,960
 couple months after we're done whaling and the world will finally have proof that sea

289
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:03,460
 monsters really do exist." Now obviously we know in the future, in the year 2021, this

290
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:09,660
 head doesn't exist. It's not in a museum anywhere. There was never any papers written

291
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:14,860
 about this head showing up and what a huge psychological thing it was when the world

292
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:19,740
 realized that there be monsters is actually true. It was actually a true warning. The

293
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,300
 Rebecca Sims came back to New Bedford and they turned in the paperwork and people were

294
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:28,180
 excited to see this head. It was reported in newspapers all around the world that this

295
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:35,260
 head was going to show up, that this sea monster had actually been captured. But the ship,

296
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:42,780
 the Manga Hela, captained by Jason Seabury, never returned to New Bedford. Years later.

297
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:51,420
 On Umnock Island off the coast of Alaska, a piece of debris is found washed up on the

298
00:25:51,420 --> 00:26:00,140
 beach. It is weathered by the waves. It is weathered by time. But it is still quite clear

299
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:09,380
 what name is written on this name board from a boat. Manga Hela. Manga Hela. Or the correct

300
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:16,100
 pronunciation of that word. So the boat was never found. The name plate was found off

301
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:19,780
 the coast of Alaska. And at that point that kind of solved the mystery. The boat never

302
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:23,700
 showed up. You assumed it was lost at sea but when the name plate shows up washed up

303
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:28,980
 on a beach in the location that it would have been going to, it definitely seals the deal.

304
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,700
 They didn't go to Bahama and become pirates because they all got bit by pirates, caught

305
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:37,100
 the pirate disease and eventually succumbed to it. This is really interesting story because

306
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:42,620
 what we know is real is. The captain is real. The story is supposedly real. Supposedly there

307
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:48,740
 are documents based on this. Based on this story. You have to want, this is where you

308
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:54,740
 start to get fishy, no pun intended. Was it a story Captain Jason Seabury made up? Or

309
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:59,940
 a story that Captain Gavitt made up for whatever reason. He goes, "Ah, that Captain, Captain

310
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,460
 Jason Seabury is totally going to wreck that ship in Alaska. I'm going to write this crazy

311
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:11,780
 tale and he'll never be around to expose it anyway." So the names are real. The boat

312
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:19,020
 names are real. The Manga Hela was lost at sea in 1853. It was considered, it was never

313
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:25,020
 seen again. All these details are real. The only thing we can't verify is because everyone

314
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:30,420
 who witnessed it is dead is the monster's head. But these documents do exist. And again

315
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:36,260
 if I was reading this on a French website, no offense. I love ThinkAboutDocs.com, Mysterious

316
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:40,500
 Universe, Anom, Alien, all this stuff. I love this. But if this story appeared on those

317
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,380
 sites, I would be a little more suspicious due to the documents actually exist, that

318
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:49,660
 those boats actually exist. But because this is coming from the MaritimeHeritage.org

319
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:56,340
 website and the Wadley Museum.org website, to be fair the Wadley Museum.org website only

320
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:01,900
 verifies that Captain Jason Seabury is real and that he has papers in the New Bedford

321
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:06,660
 Wailing Museum. They don't specifically say there's the monster head as part of those

322
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:12,780
 papers. But they do confirm basic facts about the story. Is the story actually real we don't

323
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:16,060
 know and we never know with these type of stories because they're so long ago. But

324
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:20,540
 let's put on our conspiracy caps here and say that it's real because that's the world

325
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:24,860
 we want to live in where ghosts and ghouls and haunted closets actually exist. And I

326
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:29,820
 think for a huge portion of it, it is real. I think for a huge portion of it, it is real.

327
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:37,100
 I... conspiracy caps fully on. What if Captain Jason Seabury's boat wasn't lost at sea,

328
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:43,740
 it wasn't a storm, they didn't run out of provisions, the boat just didn't take on

329
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:52,740
 too much water. What if they traveled with the head of a nearly extinct species? But

330
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:58,300
 for a species to live that long to get that big to continue to exist, it would have to

331
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:06,140
 have a mate. Was it the last of its kind or was there a second one or a family of them?

332
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:12,980
 In the ocean as well. And while the first creature was sick or wounded in some way, they

333
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:22,020
 saw it get finished off and chopped up by this Captain. And so they followed it. They didn't

334
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:27,860
 understand what these giant wooden monsters that barely floated on the surface of their

335
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:33,780
 environment were. They couldn't make sense of all the noises that they heard as they

336
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:41,380
 swam silently underneath it, stalking this vessel. They didn't know what they were following

337
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:51,380
 other than the murderer of one of their family. And so these creatures silently stalked

338
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:59,300
 this boat. And while the men on board slept, when the men on board worked, when the men

339
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:04,740
 on board played their accordions with parrots on their shoulders, these creatures simply

340
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:13,060
 watched them. Until eventually, it was time to strike. I would like to hope that Captain

341
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:21,380
 Jason Seabury and the good crew of the Manga Hela fought valiantly as a hundred foot serpent

342
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:29,340
 wrapped itself around the boat and began to coil itself tight, smashing timber and destroying

343
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:37,180
 the vessel. I like to think that swords were drawn, serpent flesh was cut, harpoons were

344
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:45,860
 closed, torches were lit and held against its scaly skin. And in the darkness of night,

345
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:56,420
 they saw two more serpents rise from the water surrounding the Manga Hela. I like to think

346
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:04,100
 they fought valiantly that night. I like to think they died bravely. But whether they

347
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:13,500
 did or not, we don't know. We just know the only piece of that entire boat left was its

348
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:21,340
 nameplate. Man still builds bigger and stronger and faster boats and claims the globe is their

349
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:29,620
 own. Land, water and air are the dominion of humanity. But is it really? We don't know

350
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:36,060
 what lurks in the depths of the ocean, but the depths of the ocean knows what sails on

351
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:44,900
 their waters. We only exist on the ocean because they allow us that right. Because at any point

352
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:52,340
 they could decide to rise up and take back the waters. They could turn the beautiful

353
00:31:52,340 --> 00:32:14,420
 blue oceans blood red.
