1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 One of Russia's biggest cults requires the ultimate sacrifice.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 And then we take a trip to Italy, where a small fire reveals a burned skeleton.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 That's only the start of the mystery. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Hi, I'm Jose Sincarvenor. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 I'm shaking my head. I'm not having a great day.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 I just said that for the meme. Oh dude, today has sucked.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Sucked. Listen man, if you guys know me, you guys know me.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 I am not a hand man. I am not. I think the term actually is handy man, but I'm not that either.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 And so recently I've been tasked. I've been given the mission to install a window air conditioner into my apartment.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Now behind the scenes, this has taken up quite a lot of my time.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 And I hate it. I hate doing it.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 And so finally, there's no joke there. It's just me hating it.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Finally today, I was like buying this stuff and then having to return it. I had to get a power drill because I'm not a handy man.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 I don't own none of that stuff. I had to buy screwdrivers. I had those, but I had to buy some other screwdrivers.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 And wood and get it cut and then it wasn't cut right and then it turns out I didn't even need the wood in the first place.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 So now, yesterday I finally figured it out after honestly a week of this, okay?

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Honestly a week of... You're like get to the ghost. Hold on, I'll get to the ghost. I'll get to the ghost.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 There's a ghost floating around in the background, okay? There you go.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 While I'm trying to install this air conditioner, there's a ghost shaking its head going "Uh-uh."

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 I'm a better handyman than you and I've been dead for a hundred years.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 I finally get the air conditioner safely mounted.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 [Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 I said "Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 The power cord, the power cord, do not use an extension cord, but they sell extension cords for air conditioners. So I've spent the past half hour trying to make sense of that, right?

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 I mean, come on, universe, what are you doing?

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 It's literally maybe three inches short because there's a plug on the other side of the wall.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Oh, and there's a ghost, okay? There's a ghost and there was a member of the Illuminati standing in the background and a serial killer and they were all just shaking their head.

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 There you go. It's on topic. It's on topic. I don't want to get any complaints saying, "Tristan talks about stupid stuff for the first three minutes before he gets to the ghost."

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 There was a ghost helping me install it, okay?

31
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 So anyways, I'm gonna get, I have to go get some super heavy duty 10 gauge extension cord. I don't like none of that stuff, bro.

32
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 That's the reason why I have a podcast about ghosts.

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Because I don't do none of this handyman stuff.

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 I got, ugh, whatever. Okay, let's go ahead and get started with you.

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 This is a good episode too. It's so funny because I was like, "We got some really good topics and I should have recorded it."

36
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 But I came home from lunch and I go, "I'm gonna install that air conditioner first." I plan on moving my whole studio in there.

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 You're like, "Jason, get to the ghost. We're getting to the ghost. We're getting to the ghost. We're getting to the ghosts right now."

38
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 First off, I gotta give a shout out to our newest Patreon. He's like, "I don't want to be introduced in this angry, angry episode."

39
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Steve Jones. Yeah, Steve. That sounds like a wrestler name. Maybe it's because I'm thinking of like, a stone called Steve Austin and then that other wrestler, Jonesy.

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 The Piledrive? Boy, I don't know. Anyways, Steve Jones, thank you so much. Please don't body slam me.

41
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Maybe you know how to install an air conditioner. You're welcome to come on over. You're gonna be our pilot for this episode.

42
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's okay. Help get the word out about the show. That really, really helps out a lot as well, spreading the word.

43
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 And actually, Steve Jones, first off, let's hop in the carbonic copter. We are going to drive out to Bryan, Texas.

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Because yesterday's episode, we did a story about the scream noise, right? Remember that? Ahhhh!

45
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 This is what I love about you guys. This is what I absolutely love about you guys. Now, my thing was, I don't love the fact that you guys scream in the wilderness.

46
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 My suggestion was it was the YouTube sound clip. Someone was playing the YouTube sound clip very, very loudly.

47
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Last night, like maybe an hour after the episode went up, I got a tweet from the official George H.W. Bush Memorial account.

48
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 I don't know whether... I'm assuming this is not the actual official George H.W. Bush Memorial account, because they've been following the show for a long time.

49
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 If they are, I'm pleased. Your honor. Your majesty. But it's... or it might just be a meme name, I don't know.

50
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Or both. At this point, the internet just perplexes me. The official George H.W. Bush Memorial account said, "Here's the answer." Boop!

51
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 And so what it was was that Texas A&M said that it was a pressure release valve that was going off, and it was specifically at the Global Health Research Complex at Texas A&M.

52
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 And that was reported by @KBTXRusty, which is a news dude, Rusty Surrett. So thank you Rusty. Thank you official George H.W. Bush Memorial account.

53
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 So that's look... and I'll play the audio clip here.

54
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 That is so loud. What the heck? I think they're letting off something.

55
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 [sound of a machine]

56
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 [sound of a machine]

57
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 So that is taken basically at ground zero at Texas A&M, picking up that sound. So apparently it was the release valve.

58
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 So there we go. Some people still think it was a sky sound and the end of the world and all that stuff. So it wasn't my suggestion.

59
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 I'm gonna find with that. I didn't have money writing on it. I'm like, "Dagnav it!" But there we go.

60
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 So thank you George H.W. Bush for letting us know about that. Let's go ahead and hop back in the Carbentercopter.

61
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 And Steve, Mr. Jones, I want you to take us up, up and away. We're headed off for our first proper story today.

62
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 We are headed out to Mother Russia.

63
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 And we're technically going back in time to the year 1645.

64
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Helicopters flying over. Lush. I don't know what the... What's the biome in Russia? Snowy?

65
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Like, I'm sure there's grass and stuff. There's a bunch of wheat.

66
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Now in 1645, you had a splinter group of Christians appear.

67
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 We have the splinter group of Christians. Now these guys were called the Chylists.

68
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 And Chylist means, literally means whipped.

69
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 They whipped themselves. Which you guys have probably seen that. Not in real life, hopefully not.

70
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 But there was that movie. What was that movie with Tom Hanks running around stealing paintings?

71
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 And apparently I can't pronounce the word paintings.

72
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Da Vinci Code. Remember there was that bad guy who was whipping himself?

73
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Well these guys would do these guys at an entire religion based around a two minute scene in a thriller from the year 2002.

74
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 But anyways, they would whip themselves, they would whip each other, they'd get whipped up in a frenzy, and they would do it to repent.

75
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 They didn't just do it because they were bored on a Saturday. But they might have done that too.

76
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Now, sometimes though, you're like, why would anyone join that cult?

77
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 And the thing is, is like, you have cults called like the Sunshine Community and you go there and like,

78
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 you're getting your arm chopped off at the chainsaw.

79
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 This one is, they tell you exactly what you're getting into, right?

80
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 This is not a hidden cult. You know, it's called the whips.

81
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 So you know when you sign up for this group, you know what you're getting into.

82
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 But people are still like, give me some of that whipping.

83
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 And this is why though. One, because they thought it was real, path to salvation.

84
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 Other two, sometimes they'd be whipping each other so much, they'd start banging.

85
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 They'd have a big old orgy. At least that's the rumor.

86
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 That's the rumor. That would be really disappointing if you're like,

87
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 "Oh, I've been getting whipped for three months, but one of these days the orgy's coming right?"

88
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Right guys? As they're pulling out even bigger whips.

89
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Now, this is ridiculous, this is like a ridiculous cult, right?

90
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 I mean, again, some cults just take your money.

91
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 And some cults are physically abusive. If you have to choose between the two,

92
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 choose the money one, right?

93
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 These guys did it. 40,000 people signed up for this.

94
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 So we have the 1645, we have the cult called the Chylists.

95
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 But that's not the main group we're going to be talking about.

96
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 In the 1760s, there was a runaway peasant.

97
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 His name was Kondrati Avanovich Solanovo.

98
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 And he started his own breakaway group.

99
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Had a little bit of the Chylist, a little bit of that homegrown Christianity.

100
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 He starts a group, right? It's called the Skopsi.

101
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 The Skopsi. If there was a cult called the Chylist,

102
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 and they were based in your home country, assuming you're not Russian,

103
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 you would go, "Oh, maybe that means like summer sun."

104
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Right? Maybe that's a fun cult you go and you start getting whipped.

105
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Same thing with the Skopsi.

106
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 For us, for anyone who's not speaking Russian, you'd be like,

107
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 "Oh, maybe that's the name of the leader. Maybe that's the name of their God."

108
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 What Skopsi means is, it's literally means castrate.

109
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 So if you thought you had it bad, you're in the whipping cult and you're like,

110
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 "Oh, man, I'm getting out of this. My back hurts.

111
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 My skin's flayed open. I can't swim in salt water anymore."

112
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 I'm going to go join this other cult and then you go to the Skopsi,

113
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 because you didn't read the sign, or because the person is telling you about it

114
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 and doesn't know how to pronounce it, so you don't know what it means.

115
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 You go in there. Next thing you know, people are pulling out big old knives.

116
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 Actually, we'll get to that in a second.

117
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 So this was the people who were whipping each other.

118
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 Their thing was this is the path to repentance.

119
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Self-flagilation, flagellation? You see that in Catholicism too.

120
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 So people beat themselves up over sins they've committed.

121
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 All this is is a physical manifestation of that.

122
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 So you're feeling bad for what you do. Say, "Ten hail Mary's."

123
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 These guys are like, "You feel bad for what you did. Whip yourself. Whip it real good."

124
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Now these guys, though, the Skopsis have a different way of looking at it.

125
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 So what the Skopsis believed was that human genitals were the source of all human misery.

126
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 It was the mark of Cain. It was when you take the forbidden fruit,

127
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 when Eve ate that forbidden fruit and then gave it to Adam and he ate it too.

128
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 It was then split in half and grafted onto the human body.

129
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 So for the men, it was their testicles and their penis,

130
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 and for a woman, it became the boobs.

131
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 So these were the actual physical manifestations of sin.

132
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 And they believed that Jesus Christ, like you look for this secret hidden code,

133
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 and when he was talking about Jews and Gentiles, we got to treat him the same.

134
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Before you look at the sawdust in someone else's eye, look at the plank of wood in yours.

135
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 All of these great things he said. He was without sin, cast of her stone, all these great little parables.

136
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Him reckoning, bunching people in the temple. That was always my favorite Bible story.

137
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 He goes to church and a bunch of people are selling stuff there and he just starts laying waste.

138
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 That was always my favorite Bible story.

139
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 But you have that. He also, in between the lines, Jesus had castrated himself,

140
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 and all of his apostles had castrated himself.

141
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 Except for Judas. Judas was like, just pretending he's like talking, faking it really, eye voice.

142
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 "Yeah, guys, I'm totally castrated." He's like checking out some hot chick.

143
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 They believed that the apostles and Jesus were castrated as well.

144
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 So what do you have to be? The point of the Bible is to be Christ-like.

145
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 And if Christ had his genitals removed, so should you.

146
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Now, it's too late. You can't back out. You've already joined this cult.

147
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 You're like, "No, I didn't agree to this." It's just me and Steve Jones,

148
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 because he's the Patreon supporter for this episode. We're laughing. We're eating popcorn.

149
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Now, here's the thing. If you did have to join this cult, there's a couple different ways you could go about it.

150
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 And to be fair, not everyone in the cult got castrated.

151
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Some people were just looky-loose. Some people joined it and they walked-to-walk,

152
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 but they didn't talk-to-talk, or is it the opposite? They talked-to-talk, but they didn't walk-to-walk.

153
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 They got castrated, but they're like, "Oh, I don't believe it. I'm agnostic."

154
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 They had the lesser seal castration, which is the removal of the testicles.

155
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 And then they had the greater seal, which you also removed the penis,

156
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 and then you had to use-I don't understand how this works,

157
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 but apparently it says you had to use a goat horn to urinate. What?

158
00:13:32,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 I don't get it. Like, yeah, you-I don't-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I

159
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 The cult first started. They really weren't a castrating thing, but they didn't do much with like knives.

160
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 They would burn it off. They'd get like a red-hot iron.

161
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 [Swoosh]

162
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Steam shooting up. Remember that part in Return of the Jedi?

163
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 When that robot is trapped in Jabba's palace and he's upside down his little feet?

164
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 His little feet are moving, and then the thing came down and burned his feet?

165
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Imagine that scene, but it's not a sci-fi movie. It's not his feet, and it's you.

166
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 Okay? That's what was going on. And eventually, like after like years and years and years and years and years,

167
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 they started just cutting it off. I don't know why it took them so long.

168
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 Knives were-knives predated to this cult. And I was reading that, and I thought,

169
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 "Imagine you're like, "Okay, I'm finally going to get it done."

170
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 You go in, they break out the hot iron, and they just hold it on you until everything's burned off.

171
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 [Groan]

172
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 And then the next day, they're like, "Hey, we've decided to change our practices.

173
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 We have a new system set up. It's called the Scalpel."

174
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 Like somebody was that guy. Somebody was the last guy that they burned up.

175
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Because it's not-you're not made of clay. It's not like you can just press a hot iron on somebody,

176
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 and then everything just falls off. You'd have to hold it there for a while.

177
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 So anyways, this cult lasted until 1797. It actually-it actually lasts till today,

178
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 but what happened was in 1797, the dude was running some scam. He got thrown in jail.

179
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Eventually he gets out. He escapes from Siberia. All this stuff is going on.

180
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 The whole time people are cutting off their bowls. Eventually-eventually this gets to the point of Stalin's era, Russia,

181
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 and they just arrested everyone. To this day, there still are scops-y people,

182
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 but they no longer castrate themselves, as far as we know.

183
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Now it's just some bizarre cult religion, fringe religion in Russia.

184
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 But this story I wanted to give, because this is actually a springboard for a separate yet related story tomorrow.

185
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 I don't want to have them both in the same episode, because that's way too much-way too much castration,

186
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 but next episode we're going to go to Poland to look at a cult that exists today,

187
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 and have been connected with not only missing testicles, but missing people.

188
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 But that's a little teaser for tomorrow. So Steve, let's hop into Jason Jalopy.

189
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 Let's take a little road trip. We're going from Russia to Italy.

190
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 And we drive, we're like a little dotted line coming across the map.

191
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 We drive through Turkey and stuff, and then we're coming through the Mediterranean,

192
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 and we're out running Zeus and stuff like that. He's still around, right?

193
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 But he wasn't fast. He was an old man. Who's the fast dude? The Flash!

194
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 We're out running that Greek god, the Flash, driving past him.

195
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 And then we get to Italy. Now this story was a request from Fabian Nurbon.

196
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right. I probably should have checked.

197
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 But Fabian sent me a ton of stories the other day. Really, really appreciate it.

198
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 I had never heard of this story before. Here we go. This is really, really interesting.

199
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 So thank you, Fabian. I got all of my information from an Italian newspaper called Il Tempo,

200
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 and this was written by Angela Di Pietro. So I got to give credit to where credits do.

201
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Thank you so much, Angela, for this great investigative piece.

202
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 It's July 6th, 2007. So we're no longer in ancient Russia.

203
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Like, this is within our lifetime. We're in the Via del Pascalea.

204
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 It's the outskirts of Rome and Italy. We're driving along that Jason's lobby.

205
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 I'm like, "Steve, Steve, slow down, slow down." Starting to slow down.

206
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 I don't know why it got quieter. He turned the engine off, now we're just gliding down a hill.

207
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 And we see a field on fire. Now it's not a huge raging fire. It's just a little fire.

208
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Firefighter crews are already there, and they're spraying it down.

209
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 Now we got on our firefighter uniforms, guys. Let's go.

210
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 We're hopping out of the Jason's Loppy. We're blending in with the rest of the firefighters.

211
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 No, we're all wearing like one... You're on my shoulders, and we're wearing one fireman's outfit.

212
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 So we're like a little rascals. We're walking around in this giant fire.

213
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Now we're like eight feet tall. Hopefully we're taller. That would only make you two feet.

214
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Anyways, we're walking around. The fires put out, the firefighters are all walking around.

215
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 And in the middle of this little fire patch is a skeleton.

216
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 It's funny because on a recent episode, I made the comment,

217
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 "At what point does it go from a pile of bones to being a skeleton?"

218
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 And I said, "If they just find the rib cage and like half an arm bone and a skull,

219
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 do they consider that finding the skeleton? At what point?"

220
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 This, they find a full human skeleton, head to foot, laying there in this burned out field.

221
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 And they looked at it, and they go, "It's laying on its back."

222
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 It looks like somebody fell and died, or was just laying down and was looking up at the sky,

223
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 and then just kind of melted into a skeleton. It looked fairly peaceful.

224
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 But there's no meat, there's no flesh, there's no way to ID the body,

225
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 except for a little fanny pack sitting next to the body.

226
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 They go through the fanny pack and they find an ID card of a man named Libero Ricci.

227
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 Libero Ricci. They also find some keys,

228
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 and nearby they find a pile of clothes that had not been burned either.

229
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 Libero Ricci was a 77-year-old retiree.

230
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 In 1943, his mother, Rebecca Moscato, had to flee German persecution.

231
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 And I didn't know this, I saw that line and I was like, "I didn't know this."

232
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 I knew that the Germans were persecuting people in 1943,

233
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 but apparently after Italy, forgive me if my details are a little bit wrong,

234
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 but after Italy surrendered, I guess Germany moved troops into Italy?

235
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 I didn't know that, and then they were kind of wrecking stuff in northern Italy?

236
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Is that common knowledge? I didn't know that, so forgive my ignorance.

237
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 But apparently his family had to kind of go underground as German troops were moving in Italy.

238
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 I didn't know that had happened.

239
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 But anyways, I always thought that Italy just kind of...

240
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 I thought we were fighting in Italy for so long and we were fighting in Germany,

241
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 and eventually Italy gave up.

242
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 Anyway, so his family had... because they were Jewish, I forgot that detail.

243
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 He's Jewish. It wasn't just that his family owed Hitler money.

244
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 His family was Jewish, totally forgot that detail.

245
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 His family was Jewish. They're like, "Why are the Nazis picking on his family?"

246
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 That's why. So he was Jewish, his mother was Jewish,

247
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Nazis came in, they were persecuting him.

248
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Okay, he... after all that happens, after World War II happens,

249
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 he ends up getting a job with the Vatican and works his entire career in the Vatican

250
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 and retires from the Vatican. He's a very, very well-liked man.

251
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 On October 31st, 2003.

252
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 Bye, bye honey. He tells his wife he's going for a walk.

253
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 And he's never seen again, until four years later, when his skeleton is found in this field.

254
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 So a tragic story, right?

255
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 Who knows what happened to him. Was he kidnapped? Was it foul play? Did he run away?

256
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 Did he have some sort of mental breakdown? Who knows?

257
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 But on 2003, October 31st, the spookiest day of the year, he disappears and then he's found in 2007.

258
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 So the police, because the firefighters, they're not doing all this investigation.

259
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 They call them the police. The police show up and do all this stuff.

260
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 Now we're both wearing a giant cop uniform. You're on my shoulders.

261
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 And they go to the bureau's family and they go, "We found him.

262
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 We probably should have coached that better. Don't get excited.

263
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Don't get excited when I said we found him. We found his remains."

264
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 And they say we found a skeleton in this field and things like that.

265
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 They go, "Here's his ID card that we found and here's his keys."

266
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 And the family goes, "Oh, that is his stuff. That is his ID card."

267
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 And those are his keys. And then when the cops showed them the clothes found next to the body,

268
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 his wife goes, "Oh, those weren't the clothes he was wearing when he left.

269
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 Those weren't the clothes he was wearing. Those aren't his."

270
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Now, people change clothes over the course of four years.

271
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 So that's not what immediately made the cops suspicious.

272
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 But it wouldn't make it seem like if he did go missing that day,

273
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 that he must have been living a life doing something outside of just walking into a field

274
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 and falling down dead if he changed his clothes.

275
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 But that's not the key detail. What they do have to do, though, is identify the skeleton.

276
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 So they send the skeleton out to the Institute of Forensic Medicine and they take a look at it.

277
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Imagine getting this phone call. You're the lead investigator of this homicide-missing-person case.

278
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Who knows? Body thing. It's a phone call.

279
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 The skeleton is not of Libero Ricci. It's not.

280
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 It's actually the skeleton of five different people.

281
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Now, it's not minding morphine power rangers. It's not like five skeletons and they all morphed into one giant skeleton.

282
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 I'm the foot.

283
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 The skull was of a woman. These are all estimates.

284
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 But the skull was of a woman who was between the ages of 45 and 55, who died between 2002 and 2006.

285
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 There was bones of another woman between 20 to 35 years old who died between 92 and 98.

286
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 A third woman between 35 to 40 years old died between 1995 and 2002.

287
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 A man who was 40 to 50 years old and died between 2002 and 2006.

288
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 And another man between the ages of 25 and 40 years old who died between 1986 and 1989.

289
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 So you have a vast range of time.

290
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 I think the youngest one would be 1986 to the late two, possibly up to 2006.

291
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 You had this collection of body parts.

292
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 So even bones that may have been from someone who died just the year before the skeleton was found.

293
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 Five different people and none of the bones belonged to Libero. None of them.

294
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 The only thing that connects them to the scene is his ID and his keys.

295
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 But it gets even weirder because the skull is of a woman.

296
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 And they don't know who it belongs to. They don't know who any of these bones belong to.

297
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 These are just guesses. They said these aren't from graves because there's no zinc or wood tracing on any of the bones.

298
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 We do not believe that these were dug up.

299
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 We also don't believe that these bones were picked up by scavengers and brought into the area or anything like that.

300
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 There was no bite marks or signs of scavenger activity.

301
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 These bones were taken most likely from... they all come from previously living people, but they were most likely not from graveyards.

302
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 They were most likely from victims and they were not brought here by happenstance. It just happened to form a skeleton.

303
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 Somebody put them here on purpose. This is not just scavengers bringing a pile of bones.

304
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 That would be one set of organized dingoes to be able to do that.

305
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 The skull of... let me get back to this part because I got distracted.

306
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 The skull of the body was a woman who, based on genetic testing, is related to Libero Ricci.

307
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 So that is another bizarre connection to a man who still to this day has never been found.

308
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 Says goodbye to his wife to go for a walk on October 31st, 2003. Disappears off the face of the earth.

309
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Four years later, his ID is found next to a pile of bones assembled from the bones of five other people, one of them a female relative.

310
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 But they don't know which relative. They have no idea who this possibly could be. Only that genetically speaking, the skull and Libero are related.

311
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 And that's the end.

312
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 I talk about a mystery.

313
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 Fabian, thank you so much for this story. I mean, think about the implications of all of this.

314
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 In Italy, this case is known as the Bone Collector for obvious reasons, right?

315
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 So you think, is there a serial killer out there? Is Libero the serial killer? Is Fabian the serial killer?

316
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 He's like, yes, now my handiwork will get even more exposure.

317
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 We have possible Nazi, like, revenge. We have possible Vatican connections.

318
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 We have serial killer so crazy they're like building humans out of the bones of the victims.

319
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 And now that I think about it, he has skulls from these other four bodies.

320
00:26:51,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 There may be other undiscovered skeletons. And who set the fire? Did the killer set the fire so the body would be discovered?

321
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 Some of those victims, they could have died up until a year before this happened, like I was saying earlier.

322
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 So was the skeleton assembled that day and the fire set and the killer leave?

323
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 It would be weird if somebody built that skeleton and then there just happened to be a fire.

324
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 So why was the, why was attention brought to the body? Why was the ID left there?

325
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 Was it Libero trying to fake his own death? But if that's the case, he waited four years to do it.

326
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 The whole story is bizarre. But now that I think about it, there could be four more skeletons, complete skeletons out there somewhere,

327
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 arranged in a different way because you'd have still all those unused bones.

328
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 You could combine them whatever way you wanted to. Is Libero the perpetrator? Is he the victim?

329
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 Is he the victim of a conspiracy that was from the 1940s?

330
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 Was he a victim of a conspiracy that came out of one of the most powerful churches in the world?

331
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 Was he simply a victim of circumstance?

332
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 Was he walking down the street and got pulled into this bizarre, horrible world of murder and bone collecting?

333
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 We don't know. We may never know who did this. We may never know why.

334
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 We may never know if there are more skeletons out there, symboled from the body parts of these five people.

335
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 And we may never know if there are even more victims waiting to be discovered.

336
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 Because the one thing we know about collectors, their collection, is never truly complete.
