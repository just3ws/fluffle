1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
 In the year 1934, a young boy was playing with his kite.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,320
 When a UFO showed up, took him on board and stole his kite.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,960
 In exchange, he was given a box that made monkeys.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,400
 But when he disowned the box and buried it in the wilderness,

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,160
 he thought it was the end of the story. But then the aliens returned.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,680
 Then we travel to Russia to take a look at a bizarre story.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,960
 When a winter storm hit the residents of Pokrov

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,880
 thought they would just have to bundle up and throw some extra logs on the fire.

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,080
 But then insects from another world began falling from the sky.

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,680
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:50,240
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

12
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,160
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,680
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,800
 We got a ton of stuff to cover, sure we're gonna get started right away.

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,240
 First off, let's give a shout out to one of our newest Patreon supporters.

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,760
 Flying in on a bumblebee. A big giant bumblebee.

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,520
 It's all furry and we can pet the bumblebee.

18
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,080
 But first off, Christian. Christian is...

19
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,640
 We're giving more applaud to the bumblebee.

20
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,840
 Christian's like, "What about me?"

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,480
 Now we're applauding you Christian for supporting the show.

22
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,960
 But we do want to pet your big giant fuzzy bumblebee.

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,160
 And we'll give Christian a couple pets as well.

24
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,000
 Rebs the little hare, rebs the little hare.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,760
 Christian, thank you so much for supporting the show.

26
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,840
 You're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode.

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,040
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, or if you're not as fuzzy as a bee,

28
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,400
 or if you're deadly allergic to bees and you're just like out of the room right now,

29
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,800
 that's fine too. Just helps read the word about the show.

30
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,560
 Really, really helps out a lot.

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,280
 Christian is giving us all a bunch of honey we can eat.

32
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,360
 Let's go ahead and we're not gonna take the bee,

33
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,840
 but we'll shrink him down and put him in our pocket.

34
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,920
 All of our pockets. He's a quantum bee.

35
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,080
 Christian, I'm gonna give you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Dreadnaught.

36
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,600
 We're gonna give you the battleship.

37
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,600
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

38
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,400
 And we are headed out to the island nation.

39
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,440
 Is it a nation?

40
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,240
 Is it a state?

41
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,760
 Not for sure.

42
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,120
 I could have totally researched it.

43
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,880
 It has nothing to do with the story though.

44
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,760
 Puerto Rico.

45
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:11,520
 That's the Dreadnaught cresting through the sea over giant waves.

46
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,880
 This is part two to yesterday's episode.

47
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,880
 It was a story that was recommended to me by DragonboyJGH.

48
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,000
 Goes by the name Cthulhu on YouTube.

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,120
 Long time listener of the show.

50
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,040
 Thank you so much for recommending the story.

51
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,840
 If you didn't listen to yesterday's episode, that's fine.

52
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,560
 Brief overview.

53
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,280
 And it pretty much was summed up in the beginning.

54
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,720
 Boys flying as kite.

55
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,960
 Make this as brief as possible.

56
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,920
 Boy flies kite.

57
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,280
 Kite and boy get abducted by a UFO.

58
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,800
 On board the UFO, there's a six-year-old girl who's an alien.

59
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,400
 It's not like another abductee.

60
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,560
 And a man in a skin-tight green outfit.

61
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,200
 They trade.

62
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,640
 She actually steals the kite.

63
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,000
 She won't give it back, but they take the kite and in return,

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,960
 he gets a box that can make three-foot-tall monkeys appear.

65
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,040
 Which to me was a really, really good trade.

66
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,120
 But he gets so tired he can't make the monkeys go back into the box.

67
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,280
 Monkeys are taking over portions of Puerto Rico.

68
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,040
 He is going crazy from seeing monkeys all over his house.

69
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,160
 He buries the box.

70
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,600
 That is the end of the story.

71
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,600
 As far as most narratives go, Cthulhu actually found a book

72
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,120
 that continues the story.

73
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,600
 So thank you so much for doing additional research on this story.

74
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,040
 There's a book called UFOs in the E.T. Presence.

75
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,320
 It's by Fate Magazine.

76
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,600
 That's the publishing company.

77
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,000
 Fate Magazine's a very famous paranormal magazine.

78
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,720
 It's actually pretty good.

79
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,840
 They got some good articles in there.

80
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,880
 We've covered them before.

81
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,120
 But UFOs in the E.T. Presence is the book.

82
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,840
 It was edited by Rosemary Ellen Gully.

83
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,440
 I don't think that's how you pronounce it.

84
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,760
 She's actually a little creature living in a toilet.

85
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:51,920
 But that aside, in 1934, that's when the story happened with Juan Rivera-Fillip Burti.

86
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,520
 And he was in the town of Meagaze.

87
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,960
 But now we're going to flash forward.

88
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,240
 20, 30 years later, he's married with children.

89
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,360
 And he's living in Sabana Grande.

90
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,880
 So he's hanging out and he's like, "Oh man, it's such a relaxing day.

91
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,760
 I can move away."

92
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,600
 Because the monkeys took over that other town.

93
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,120
 And he's living.

94
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,520
 He wakes up, breathing in the beautiful Puerto Rican air.

95
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,440
 Smells so good.

96
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,040
 Not the whiff of a monkey in nose instead of in sight.

97
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,800
 But anyways, that's going to get edited out.

98
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:30,560
 He decides to take his family to the beach.

99
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,800
 So the mom and I don't know how many kids.

100
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,320
 We'll just assume two.

101
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,440
 It just says he had children.

102
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,520
 So we'll just assume he has two kids.

103
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,320
 Kelly and Bud.

104
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,080
 And he's married to Peg.

105
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,440
 And they're going to leave Sabana Grande.

106
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,800
 They're going to the beach.

107
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,200
 So when they get to the beach, the family kind of splits up.

108
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,120
 They don't let the kids spin for themselves.

109
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,800
 They're like, "You guys know how to swim, right?"

110
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,240
 They're like little toddlers.

111
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,040
 But I should say the family splits in two.

112
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,280
 The mother and the kids are together.

113
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,880
 And Juan goes, "You know what? I'm going to go fishing.

114
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,680
 I'm going to go do my thing.

115
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,040
 I'm going to go catch some fish."

116
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,800
 They're like, "We know what fishing is, Juan.

117
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
 You don't have to describe it to us."

118
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,760
 He's like, "Okay."

119
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,320
 So he goes to like a secluded part of the beach.

120
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:18,240
 And then he looks and appearing right in front of him is

121
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,280
 a beautiful woman.

122
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,680
 She's standing there in front of Juan.

123
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,520
 And he realizes, "Okay, this is an adult woman.

124
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,280
 But this used to be a little girl.

125
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,880
 That's how things work, right?

126
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,720
 Adult women used to be girls.

127
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,320
 But not just any girl.

128
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,480
 He doesn't see that every time he sees an adult woman,

129
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,360
 he's like, "Oh, you used to be a girl, didn't you?"

130
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,000
 And they're like, "Yeah."

131
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,440
 This was the girl he ran into on the UFO.

132
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,480
 He is now older and he's seeing this six-year-old girl

133
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,320
 aged as well.

134
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,960
 She's now a beautiful adult woman.

135
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,600
 And she's standing in front of him.

136
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,160
 And he's in the secluded part of the beach.

137
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,720
 He's shocked.

138
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,160
 He hadn't seen this woman in decades, like two of them,

139
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,520
 two at least two decades.

140
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,600
 And then appearing next to her are two dudes.

141
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,480
 And he's like, "Dang it.

142
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:08,800
 Dang it.

143
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,480
 I thought we were just going to have some alone time."

144
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,040
 These two dudes show up and they're wearing the same

145
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,640
 skin-tight green clothes that he remembers one of the men

146
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,440
 wearing on his first journey on the UFO.

147
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,120
 So they're in this secluded part of the beach

148
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,400
 and he's watching this beautiful woman

149
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,520
 materialize in front of him.

150
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,880
 And then he sees two dudes show up in green clothes.

151
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,840
 And he can't really process what's going on.

152
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,120
 Obviously he has a leg up because he knows these are aliens.

153
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,160
 He recognizes them.

154
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,320
 If this happened to us, it would be more shocking.

155
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,960
 But he's like, "Yah, I'm dealt with a space apes.

156
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,400
 This is nothing, guys."

157
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,160
 But still, he has to process this for a bit

158
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,280
 because he hasn't seen any of these weirdos for about 20 years.

159
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,040
 Then instantly, the woman is completely nude.

160
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,520
 So things just got real.

161
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,720
 Things just got real for one.

162
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,520
 He's kind of looking over.

163
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,760
 He's like making sure that no one else can see him.

164
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,000
 He's like, "Ugh, okay, this is weird."

165
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Now he said she didn't say anything at all.

166
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,520
 But I could tell she wanted to have sex.

167
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,360
 She was giving off this sexual energy that she wanted me

168
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,480
 right then and there.

169
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,160
 He said that she was actually different

170
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,000
 than normal human woman.

171
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,600
 He said that her boobs appeared lower on the body.

172
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,960
 So not like they were saggy,

173
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,200
 but they actually started lower down on the torso.

174
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,880
 And this is a change of times, right?

175
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,000
 Because this story, the first story happened in 1934.

176
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,800
 This is maybe like 20, 25 years later.

177
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,160
 So we're talking 1950s, 1960.

178
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,320
 He says there were two things that made him realize

179
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,240
 this wasn't a human woman.

180
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,360
 One, her boobs were farther down on her body.

181
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,360
 That's a pretty dead giveaway, right?

182
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,200
 The second one is she had no pubic hair.

183
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,080
 And he's like, "Oh, that's so disgusting.

184
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,520
 Where's your pubic hair?"

185
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,080
 Nowadays, it's like that is, you see that a lot.

186
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,520
 You see that a lot nowadays.

187
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,920
 But back then it was alien.

188
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,280
 Back then he would straight up be considered an alien

189
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,520
 if you were an adult woman with no pubic hair.

190
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,280
 Look if you didn't have a file and project blue book on you.

191
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,160
 So he's like, "This, this, this monstrosity, this alien being

192
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,800
 has no pubic hair. What's going on?"

193
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,440
 But she's absolutely stunning, right?

194
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,880
 She's super gorgeous.

195
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,080
 She's naked.

196
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,600
 And he's getting the sensation from her that they want to have sex.

197
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,320
 He's getting his own sensation that he wants to have sex.

198
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,640
 But he is married.

199
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,880
 And he's, it's funny because here's the thing.

200
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,560
 He's married, but he says, "I didn't want to get caught."

201
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,520
 Wasn't the fact that he didn't want to break his wedding vows?

202
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,840
 It was the fact that he was afraid that he was going to get caught.

203
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,560
 Because he wasn't, he wasn't an isolated part of the beach,

204
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,920
 but at any point someone's beach ball can come bouncing by

205
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,320
 and someone run in and go to grab it and he's banging this alien woman.

206
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,800
 So he resists.

207
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,120
 He resists because he doesn't want to get caught.

208
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,120
 But how much could you resist a beautiful alien babe?

209
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,760
 So he gives up halfway through and he does bang this chick.

210
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,000
 Now he says they had sex four times.

211
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,120
 Or as I like to call it, a typical Thursday night,

212
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,080
 they had sex four times and he said each time,

213
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,600
 not that I'm having sex with Juan,

214
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
 I'm not having sex with Juan,

215
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,240
 but I was supposed to joke about my own prowess.

216
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,880
 You can't, the wands like, "See you later Jason."

217
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,160
 I'm like, "See you next Thursday."

218
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:30,160
 He said that each time they had sex, his recovery time was quicker.

219
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,520
 So the first time they had sex, he was able to get it back up.

220
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,080
 And Christian's like, "Great, I'm glad I'm on this episode."

221
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,920
 Where you go into scientific descriptions about Juan's prowess

222
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,720
 and you made a bizarre joke about you banging him too.

223
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,160
 He said that the first time he had sex, he recovered pretty quickly.

224
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,440
 Each time he would recover quicker and each time he would have more energy.

225
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,040
 He'd like banger harder.

226
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,640
 It was like perpetual energy.

227
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,120
 The more he did it, the stronger he got.

228
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,560
 I don't know what perpetual, I don't know what perpetual energy is.

229
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,480
 But it might have something to do with banging aliens.

230
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,920
 After he had banged this chick four times, she disappeared.

231
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,640
 Which would be hilarious if he was in the middle of doing it the fourth time

232
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,600
 and she's fading away.

233
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,640
 He's like, "No, no, no. Please let me finish, let me finish."

234
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,040
 But they have sex four times and then she vanishes.

235
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,280
 I don't know if she like put her clothes back on and said,

236
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,800
 "Don't call me, I'll call you."

237
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,600
 If she dematerialized while he was trying to get one last time in, who knows.

238
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,720
 But she left.

239
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,640
 And then he just went back to the beach and sat down next to his wife and kids.

240
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,400
 And probably with so full of energy, he's like running around.

241
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,800
 He's like, "Come on kids, let's play Frisbee and Hacky's Hack at the same time."

242
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,880
 They're like, "Whoa, dad, chill out."

243
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,040
 But we don't know.

244
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,720
 We don't know if he gained superpowers.

245
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,000
 We do know this.

246
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,680
 He returned to that spot several times over the years.

247
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,440
 He tells his wife, "Hey, I'm going to go fishing.

248
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,960
 I'm totally not going to bang an alien."

249
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,480
 She's like, "What? You had that last part?"

250
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,280
 He's like, "I don't know."

251
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,440
 He would go out there and he would sit there for a while waiting for her to show back up.

252
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,360
 He never saw the woman again.

253
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,560
 But that's actually only half true.

254
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,640
 In 1995, so at this point he's probably like '67, '68.

255
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:14,800
 In 1995, Juan wakes up and he's walking around his house and it's three in the morning.

256
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,880
 There's a gentle Puerto Rican breeze outside the house.

257
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:27,760
 He looks out the window and he sees in the darkness of the morning the little girl.

258
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,320
 Who stole his kite.

259
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,200
 The six-year-old version of that alien.

260
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,760
 Standing outside in the darkness.

261
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,760
 Looking back at him.

262
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:46,160
 So that's kind of a creepy ending, honestly.

263
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,920
 And it makes you think clones?

264
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,960
 Is it time travel?

265
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,440
 Is the woman sometimes a little girl like traveling through time?

266
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,440
 Was it a hybrid?

267
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,880
 Was that like his child that his child looked just like the woman he had the child with?

268
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,160
 Because sometimes that happens, right?

269
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,640
 Sometimes you have kids with people and they look exactly like one of the parents

270
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,080
 and nothing like the other one.

271
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,440
 I don't know, I don't have kids.

272
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,040
 Or observe kids in any way.

273
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,480
 I've never seen one in real life.

274
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,560
 And also any kid standing outside your house at three in the morning is just spooky.

275
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,120
 They could be out there going, "Help! Help! I'm lost!"

276
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,240
 And that's spooky for them, but it's still spooky for me.

277
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,920
 And if I ever see a kid out at night, I will assume you are a ghost.

278
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,120
 You will get no help from me, young man or young woman.

279
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,480
 Christian, let's go ahead and give you the keys to the Carbenter copter.

280
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,920
 We are leaving behind Puerto Rico.

281
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,160
 There's a bunch of kids going, "Help! Help! We're lost!"

282
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,040
 We're like, "You're too spooky! We can't help you!"

283
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,360
 We're flying away in the Carbenter copter.

284
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,320
 Take us on out to Russia.

285
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,000
 Specifically, we're headed to a little town known as Pokrov.

286
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,640
 That's in Rzhev in Russia.

287
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,680
 It is October 17th, 1827.

288
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,360
 So super old-timey.

289
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,440
 So let's put on our old-timey clothes.

290
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,440
 I'm dressed up like Tom Sawyer.

291
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,000
 I know that.

292
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,560
 I meant to say, who's the kid?

293
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,600
 Oliver Twist.

294
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,320
 Oliver Twist.

295
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,600
 He's like the poor orphan boy.

296
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,320
 But I'm gonna be Gumball USA.

297
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,520
 USA Blowner cover.

298
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,600
 I'm dressed up as Tom Sawyer.

299
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,200
 We're walking around.

300
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,320
 And one's like, "What?"

301
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,400
 Or I'm like, "Who wants their fins painted?"

302
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,080
 And one's like shaking their head.

303
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,040
 That's the only thing.

304
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,840
 That's literally the only thing I know from that book.

305
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,120
 And that might even be in Huck Finn.

306
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,160
 I'm not entirely for sure.

307
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,360
 I never read either of them.

308
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,800
 But while we're in Pokrov,

309
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,360
 while I'm discussing American literature that I haven't read,

310
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,840
 we're in Pokrov, Russia.

311
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,680
 And all of a sudden it starts to snow.

312
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,040
 The snow is furious this time.

313
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,960
 So much snow.

314
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,280
 I had to stop and take a breath to make the sound effect.

315
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,000
 But you know, they're used to this type of snow in Pokrov.

316
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,520
 It's a little bit heavier than normal.

317
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,440
 But still, it's Russia.

318
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,160
 What are you gonna do?

319
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,560
 But then people started to notice something.

320
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:11,360
 Little insects are crawling across the snow.

321
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,440
 Hey, Joe, come here.

322
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:13,840
 Come here.

323
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,560
 Look at this.

324
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,920
 One of the Russian guys says,

325
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,040
 he goes, "Look, look at this."

326
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,280
 He's not eating it.

327
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,080
 He's not eating it.

328
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,040
 That's the sound of the bug.

329
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,560
 The bug is moving through the snow.

330
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,840
 And Joe's like, "What in the world is that?

331
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,600
 I've seen a lot of insects in my life.

332
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,000
 I've grown up here, so I know all the insects.

333
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,040
 I know all of them.

334
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,160
 I know all the insects around.

335
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,000
 I've never seen something like that."

336
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,800
 It was one and one-third inches long.

337
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,880
 It had a flat, shiny head.

338
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,520
 Had antennae and little whiskers.

339
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,480
 I don't know if they were breaking out their magnifying glasses.

340
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,720
 But you can see little whiskers on these bugs.

341
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,240
 Each side had three legs.

342
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,240
 And it was like crawling through the snow.

343
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,240
 And along their back, there was a stripe that looked like black velvet.

344
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,240
 Now, it wasn't just one.

345
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,200
 It wasn't just some guy found this, like the Fiji mermaid was like,

346
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,920
 "I found this."

347
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,760
 They're like, "You made it, didn't you?"

348
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,600
 And he's like, "Yes, what I meant to say, I made it."

349
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,080
 There were a ton of these bugs.

350
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,720
 And they came with that snowfall.

351
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,640
 And these bugs, no one recognized them in the area.

352
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,920
 So that's one tip off that maybe these got swirled up in some sort of whirlwind.

353
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,720
 Because we'll see that.

354
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,360
 We'll see whales appear in the middle of Brazil.

355
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,560
 Or we'll see fish rain down in the middle of Idaho.

356
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,720
 But people can't figure out what these bugs are.

357
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,120
 These insects loved the snow.

358
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:39,120
 Now, while there are bugs that do enjoy the snow, they're little bug snowmen.

359
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,960
 These aren't known to be one of those types of bugs.

360
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,960
 So there's not a lot of bugs that enjoy the snow, but there are some of them.

361
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,200
 But these bugs, people couldn't figure out what they were.

362
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,400
 They didn't recognize them.

363
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,080
 And the way they moved through the snow made you think they were actually

364
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,920
 acclimated to super cold weather.

365
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,880
 And we're talking below freezing.

366
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,440
 Some of these insects actually came down in chunks of ice.

367
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,600
 And when people in the area would pick them up, you could look inside this chunk of ice

368
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,600
 and you would see the bug inside of it.

369
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
 And so you figure, okay, that makes sense.

370
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,000
 A whirlwind will pick up a bunch of bugs someplace, take them up into the atmosphere,

371
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,160
 and drop them off in another location.

372
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,920
 And that's how you have rain of fish or rain of chunks of meat.

373
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,840
 But when they looked at these chunks of ice, the bug inside of it was moving.

374
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,720
 I'm like, how is that possible?

375
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,160
 It would have gotten frozen.

376
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:36,400
 And this bug was able, when ice froze around, it was able to dig a hole in the ice

377
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,600
 and would make a little home for it.

378
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,120
 It wouldn't try to break out of the ice.

379
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,000
 It would just kind of spin around in the ice itself.

380
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,680
 The world's original fidget spinner.

381
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,760
 So these were used to the ice.

382
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,440
 It wasn't a bug that got sucked up and turned into ice.

383
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,240
 And then froze.

384
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,080
 They liked the cold.

385
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,080
 Immediately when landing on the ground during the snowstorm,

386
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,080
 they would begin to look for plants or they would find nearby trees

387
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,040
 and hide in the holes and begin to nest in there.

388
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,160
 People began to take these bugs as samples because they were super curious about them.

389
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,920
 First off, it's going to interfere with the harvest.

390
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,600
 They are these things dangerous.

391
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,840
 So they began to take samples of them.

392
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,920
 Some of them scooped them up in a bucket of ice.

393
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,000
 And even though the temperatures dropped to eight below,

394
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,360
 they're still just hanging out there.

395
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,120
 These bugs are just crawling over this frozen bucket.

396
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,320
 But when these bugs were brought into a warm environment, they died within minutes.

397
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,240
 And that was the end of it.

398
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,120
 That's the end of the narrative of what's known as the Polk Roff Insects.

399
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,360
 But it's really just the beginning of the mystery.

400
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,520
 I found this story on the Forty-In map.

401
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,600
 But I actually found out who created the Forty-In map.

402
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,960
 It's a guy named Thomas Morgan.

403
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,600
 I was researching some other story and his name popped up.

404
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,320
 And he's just like us.

405
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,320
 He just really loves paranormal stuff.

406
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,000
 Just like we do with this show.

407
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,320
 He decided to create a map that catalogues all this stuff.

408
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,360
 Seems like a really cool guy.

409
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,360
 Actually, briefly talked to him through email.

410
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,400
 He's done guest appearances on podcasts, on a Bigfoot podcast.

411
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,080
 He just really loves this stuff.

412
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,920
 That map's been a really cool tool.

413
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,760
 So thank you, Thomas, if you're listening.

414
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,240
 So using that map, that's how I found out about this,

415
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,720
 I dug a little bit deeper into this.

416
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,080
 This is a legit story.

417
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,040
 This isn't a rumor.

418
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,880
 This isn't something that the people of Polk Roff just said that happened.

419
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,080
 This was actually catalogued in the Edinburgh Journal of Science.

420
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,520
 Volume 5.

421
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,360
 It was published in 1828.

422
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,080
 And they got it from the Journal de Saint Petersburg,

423
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,640
 number 141 that was published in November 14th, 1827.

424
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,600
 So these bugs were catalogued.

425
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:41,760
 The one of the Journal of Saint Petersburg was actually published a month after this event.

426
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,920
 So this isn't something like the man from Torred,

427
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:48,320
 where we have decades passing between the actual event and it being reported.

428
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,520
 It was reported almost immediately in scientific journals.

429
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,200
 Apparently some of these bugs were sent out to be analyzed

430
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,040
 and people could not identify the bug.

431
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,800
 So that doesn't necessarily mean, like I said in the intro,

432
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,640
 that the bug is from another world.

433
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,760
 We'll get to that in a second.

434
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,800
 But now just because they couldn't identify the bug in 1827, 1828,

435
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,160
 doesn't mean someone couldn't identify the bug now.

436
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,480
 Maybe deep in the snow bug archives,

437
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,080
 there's a photo of one of these guys and they can match it up to something

438
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,160
 from another part of Eurasia.

439
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,240
 They go, oh, this is a Mongolian snow bug.

440
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,600
 There's no way they would have known what this was in this part of Russia in this year.

441
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,520
 But as far as we can tell, this bug has not been identified even today.

442
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,640
 And it would be hard to identify it today unless you had an actual specimen of it.

443
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,480
 But if they were dying off so quickly,

444
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,600
 this is what almost 200 years old at this point, this story.

445
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:47,520
 The few bugs that were sent off to be analyzed are those little carcasses still around.

446
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,200
 Now that's the scientific questions we have about it,

447
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,360
 but let's put on our conspiracy caps for a second,

448
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,920
 because I find this story absolutely terrifying.

449
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,560
 The reason why the Poker of Insects story actually deserves me a little bit,

450
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:05,760
 the reason why I'm going to sleep, sleep with a nightlight tonight and a mosquito net over my bed,

451
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,160
 is because of the implications of the story.

452
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,680
 Let's break this down real quick.

453
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,360
 Conspiracy caps fully on.

454
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,400
 1. We talk a lot about portals on this show,

455
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,600
 gateways to alternate universes, parallel universes,

456
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,840
 and people disappearing into those.

457
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,760
 People go walking in the woods and never seen again.

458
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,240
 Did they get teleported to an alternate reality?

459
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,640
 We cover that a lot of times on this show.

460
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,920
 There's always that idea that if we're able to go through those portals,

461
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,320
 then shouldn't something else be able to come out?

462
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,040
 The answer I would assume is yes, but when we travel,

463
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,520
 for all we know when people go into these alternate realities,

464
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,640
 they go to a place where it's inhospitable to human life.

465
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,240
 They die almost instantly.

466
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,120
 They're either torched by intense heat, they suffocate,

467
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,440
 they drown in an endless ocean.

468
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,880
 And on the flip side, when these portals open up and something travels from that world into ours,

469
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,600
 it also dies almost instantly.

470
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,600
 But you have to imagine in these portals,

471
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:09,920
 there would be some that would allow a transfer that is able to make the person survive in the other reality.

472
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:16,480
 But even then, let's say that a portal opens up in a desert world that has oxygen,

473
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,960
 has the right amount of nutrients and things for a life to grow that would survive on Earth.

474
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,440
 But this desert creature finds itself at the bottom of the marinara trench.

475
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,920
 Mariana trench is what I meant to say.

476
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,560
 The marinara trench is delicious by the way.

477
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,960
 But this one, the Pokerhof insects, was the perfect match.

478
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:45,120
 These unidentified insects came from a dimension of ice and snow.

479
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,880
 And it fell into a region full of ice and snow.

480
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,360
 And so they survived their normal life cycle.

481
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,360
 They didn't have the food that they needed,

482
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,600
 but they were able to walk around long enough to be identified.

483
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,080
 That's terrifying to me, because you look at the story, it's very famous story.

484
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,240
 It's not even a story, it's actual fact, it's true.

485
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,520
 There was a farmer in Australia who wanted to just for fun hunt rabbits.

486
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,880
 So he had about 25, 30 rabbits sent over to his farm in Australia.

487
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,800
 Within 10 years, the population of rabbits became so large,

488
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,200
 you could kill 2 million of them in a year.

489
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,600
 And it wouldn't put any dents in the population explosion.

490
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,520
 They were just outbreeding everything.

491
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,800
 And they've become an invasive species in Australia.

492
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,840
 People hunt them now, and they actually, the fur trade,

493
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,800
 the rabbit fur trade is really booming in Australia.

494
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,520
 But environmentally it's an invasive species.

495
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,960
 What happens when an invasive species that can outbreed humans

496
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,720
 just drops into the middle of our cities?

497
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:50,320
 And I'm not even saying it has to be like giant man eating bugs from a sci-fi channel movie.

498
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,800
 I think it's even worse if they're not that.

499
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,120
 If they're just insects.

500
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,160
 They're these things that are about 2 inches long,

501
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:03,120
 they're flat, they're black, and they have a brown stripe going across the legs.

502
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,640
 That's it.

503
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,400
 It's this tiny little guy.

504
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,280
 They don't eat your flesh, they don't spew hot lava.

505
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,720
 They just exist.

506
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,760
 And they outbreed everything else.

507
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,680
 To me that's far more frightening than an alien fleet coming in.

508
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:22,080
 Because yeah, an alien fleet comes in, when that hammer drops and that war starts,

509
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,560
 it's going to be really rough for humanity.

510
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,720
 It's going to be a really, really rough time.

511
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,080
 Those first couple days are going to be atrocious,

512
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,160
 the amount of casualties that humans take.

513
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,000
 But we can fight back, we can outthink them.

514
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,920
 We can outgun them.

515
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,800
 We can convince some of them to join our side.

516
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,360
 We can steal their technology and use it against them.

517
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,800
 We can negotiate.

518
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,040
 At the very least we could sue for peace.

519
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,160
 But you can't do anything like that with insects.

520
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:56,560
 And these insects from another world, that eight of them came through some portal one day

521
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:02,080
 in the middle of Michigan, in a farmhouse, and just begin to lay eggs.

522
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,400
 You can't gas them.

523
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
 You step on them.

524
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,200
 They shrug it off.

525
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,040
 They're even stronger than a cockroach.

526
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,280
 They begin to eat cockroaches.

527
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,680
 They don't harm humans, but they begin to destroy our food systems.

528
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,720
 They don't pose any physical threat to us,

529
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,120
 but we start to see our farms getting devoured.

530
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,840
 And we start to see the spiders and the bees and the flies disappear

531
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,760
 as these insects devour all other insect life.

532
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:35,200
 That's far more terrifying to me than staring down a laser pistol of a gray alien.

533
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,120
 To look out my window and see nothing but scuttling shells

534
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:47,040
 crawling across what was once a city full of life.

535
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:52,320
 They didn't take an alien invasion planned from four star systems away.

536
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,160
 It just took a fluke.

537
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,880
 A fluke between worlds, a portal opening up.

538
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,600
 And enough of one species to fall through and land in a habitat

539
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,160
 where they could outbreed and outfeed all of its competitors.

540
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:14,560
 I would much rather spin my last moments as an alien slave

541
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,080
 and a starship floating around Rigel 7.

542
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,000
 I would rather that happen than to die in a mansion on Earth

543
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,400
 in a world that has been completely devoured by mindless insects.

544
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,720
 These insects completely destroyed the ecosystem.

545
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:40,720
 They devoured the bottom of the food chain to the point that nothing else on Earth has anything to eat.

546
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,680
 After all the livestock has been killed, after we have turned to our pets,

547
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,360
 after the jungles and the zoos have been emptied.

548
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,240
 All that's left is the humans and the bugs.

549
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,880
 We starve to death.

550
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,720
 The insects rule the planet.

551
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,480
 And until the insects themselves starve to death,

552
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,760
 the only sounds left on the planet Earth

553
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:16,240
 will be the sounds of scuttling insects searching for one final meal.

554
