1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 200 bodies found on the slope of an isolated mountain?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Is it possible that you are the star of a reality show and everyone else is watching you?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 And then we take a look at the mysterious story of a sphere found in a field.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Was it space junk, an alien artifact, or something far more dangerous?

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Today on Dead Ravverie.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Ravveradio.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, and I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 I hope you're having a great day too.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I better be having a great day because this is the third episode I recorded this day.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Monday and Tuesday's episode I just recorded a little bit earlier today,

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 and now I'm recording Wednesday's episode.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Now I've done that from time to time last week I did the first two episodes in a single sitting.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 I'm letting you guys know this now because I think I'm getting a sore throat.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 So I want to get my episodes out.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 I want to get my episodes recorded early just in case.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Because I got to talk a lot at my job and I can't just like point and grunt to them

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 and I can just pre-record stuff here.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 I wish I could pre-record my job too, but I noticed the first episode, Monday's episode,

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 I seemed a little like "Oh my throat hurts, but let's just get through this."

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Like yesterday's episode I seemed quite surly.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 I don't know how much of that is going to survive the editing process.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Because I haven't, I'll edit them the day of.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 I really enjoy editing.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 I enjoy all of this except the show notes.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 I hate writing those, but I haven't edited it yet.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 But if it comes off that I sound quite surly, it's simply because I don't feel that great.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 So that being said, I want to make a quick note.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Again, Sean, thank you for sending me the story about the man eating rock.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 I didn't want it to be like "Oh I can't be bothered with this stupid story."

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Because that wasn't the case.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 I researched it and I was researching it when Sean recommended it.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 And I was like "There's just not enough here."

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 There's not enough here and I kept trying to force it into a story and then finally I was like

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 "I'm just going to address it here."

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 But I want to let Sean know and I want to let everyone know.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 I really really enjoy it when you guys, I really really enjoy it when you guys send in recommendations.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 And sometimes, and this has happened a couple of times, where people have recommended a story to me

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 and it's been debunked.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 And I hope that does, I hope you don't think that that means that I didn't appreciate the story

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 or that I didn't enjoy researching it because I like debunking the stuff too when it can be debunked.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 So again, thanks everyone for people who've sent in stories.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Also a quick reminder, and also a quick reminder in the show notes for the episodes going forward

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 are going to be links to flyers to help advertise the show. That helps tremendously.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Word of mouth helps the show out a lot and we're seeing that growth.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 But also flyers, as old school as they are, does help advertise the show.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 So if you want to help out the show, that's a great way.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Oh, and also starting probably in February we will be having merch.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Maybe a little bit earlier. I'm getting the merch store set up now.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Stickers and t-shirts is what we're looking at.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Maybe a hat, I don't know.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 But definitely stickers and t-shirts.

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 You'll be able to buy it from the podcast show notes or on YouTube.

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 It'll be a little merch store right underneath the video.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Okay, let's go ahead and the stone story, the Man-eating Stone story was supposed to be in this episode.

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 And since I addressed it last time.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Okay, so first story we're going to talk about, speaking of stones, in the Himalayas back in 1942.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 There were some dudes walking around in the snow and they're sticking their sticks in

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 and with their snow shoes, dodging yetis.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 And they stumbled across a body.

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 And they're like, "Oh my, what's this body doing up here on this mountain?"

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 I mean, it just makes sense because a lot of people die on mountains.

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 But there's a body next to that and a body next to that and a body next to that.

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 And they ended up counting. I don't think they counted them all that day.

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 But eventually they discovered there was 200 bodies on the side of this mountain.

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 And they're like, "Oh, okay, well that would be scary."

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 It's kind of, just kind of scary because they're wearing old-timey clothes.

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 So it's not like what happened to them is what's going to happen to us.

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 And there was always this wonder of how they died.

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 People have thought that they were killed in battle. That was one of the theories.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 The other one was that it was a bunch of pilgrims from another area who died of hypothermia

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 because they weren't used to the environment.

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Illness, maybe some plague struck them.

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 The reason why they have the idea of the pilgrims is because they were taller and more thicker.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 They were taller and thicker than the indigenous people in this area.

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 So they figured they must have come from somewhere else.

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 They must have had like a better diet because they're so yoked.

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 These just a bunch of muscular men and women, little muscular babies in bambushkas.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 It's the bambushka, the thing that the baby rides on in the back or the front.

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 And they like have a little bow and arrow and they can like shoot at people.

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Anyways, they're using their milk accord as the bow.

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 So, whatever Jason. So anyways, they find all these bodies.

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Now what's happened is the ice has started to melt and the bodies are starting to,

83
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 some of them are starting to become disgorged from the mountain.

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 So it's allowed them to take a closer look because it's not the most,

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 it's not a place where you want to take your CSI team up.

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 It's the site of a mountain.

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 So the mountains are kind of melting a bit. They're able to take these bodies out.

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 One thing they've started to notice is that the bodies generally all have massive head wounds.

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 And they're like, "Well, that could make sense with the battle,

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 but why would everyone get hit in the head?

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 There's just a bad, how do you fight a battle on the site of a mountain either?"

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 And I wonder if they had weapons.

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 But anyways, so they had holes in their heads.

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 And what happened, and this is one of those interesting things where legends can meet up with reality.

95
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 We've talked about that a couple times on the show.

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 As anthropologists and other scientific people were looking at these bodies,

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 one of the stories that came out from the village below was this old legend about these outsiders.

98
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 It was actually this traditional song sung in this community.

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 A long time ago, there was a group of outsiders trying to enter their area,

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 and they were climbing up this forbidden mountain,

101
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 which just happened to be the mountain where all these bodies were,

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 and the goddess of the mountain got angry at them,

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 and she rained down hailstones as hard as iron and smashed all their heads in and killed them.

104
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 And the scientists started thinking that song, that old, old folk song, may actually be like a news event.

105
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 That lines up, because before they just found the bodies, they may have heard the song,

106
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 but it didn't match up, but once they started seeing all these bodies with holes in their heads,

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 they're like, "Maybe that is what happened.

108
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Maybe that was an actual event that that song was based on.

109
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 These people were from another area.

110
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 They were climbing up the mountain, and they all got laid out."

111
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 So that's the theory right now, that it was a massive, not the goddess part, but that there was a massive hailstorm

112
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 while they were on the side of the mountain and killed them.

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 And they were kind of chilling.

114
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 They said some of them may have been killed instantly by the hail,

115
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 and other ones may have just gotten knocked down or injured and then just died of hypothermia.

116
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 But there's another theory that the 200 bodies we see aren't all of them.

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 There's even more that we can't get access to.

118
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 They're like frozen deeper into the mountain.

119
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 So they go, "We can see count 200 bodies, but there could be more of the pilgrims that we can't find,

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 that are still just kind of stuck in the mountain."

121
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 I have another theory, though. Zombies.

122
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 It all matches up, dude.

123
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 If I'm being chased by zombies, I'm going to first try to get to like a higher elevation,

124
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 like it's like Fortnite, bro.

125
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 I'm gonna go up, I'm gonna build up, and so I have the height advantage, so I'm going up the mountain.

126
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Zombies can't move, it's scientifically proven.

127
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Zombies can't move as well in the snow, and they'll slip a lot.

128
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 It's like home alone, it's like nature, a mountain is nature's home alone trap.

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 So zombies are slipping and sliding.

130
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 And how do you kill a zombie?

131
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 Bam.

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Hit him in the brain, and that would explain why all of them got hit in the brain.

133
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Because if you figure if the hail stones are coming down, I don't know if they counted every head wound,

134
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 but let's just say they did, for the sake of my narrative.

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 If hail was coming down, some people are going to get broken legs,

136
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 and some people are going to get like, it's going to hit them in the heart,

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 and they're like, oh, my heart.

138
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Some of them are going to be like looking straight up and going like, what's that?

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 And like hail stones are going to go right in their mouth and choke them.

140
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 These guys all had head wounds.

141
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 The only reason why you would hit everyone in the head,

142
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 zombie.

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Himalayan zombies, dude.

144
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 I mean, why not?

145
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Why not?

146
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 It's theory.

147
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 It's a theory.

148
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 It works, right?

149
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 I should be a scientist.

150
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 I'll just posit everything as zombies.

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Is economics considered a science?

152
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 And if so, how would I fit zombies into that form of science?

153
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 The economics of being a zombie.

154
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 I guess it would be the economics of like energy.

155
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Like, no, I guess that's a different type of science.

156
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 What would be the economics of zombies?

157
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 Yeah, I don't know.

158
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Okay, so anyways, that was anti-climatic.

159
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Next story.

160
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Oh, oh, and I forgot to say that story, that huge hail storm story, was part of new news.

161
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 I know you guys are tired of that, but new news.

162
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 There's still a bunch of that stuff left.

163
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 Ton of stories from the year 2004.

164
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 So, oh, what was the next one?

165
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Oh, so this was a weird one.

166
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 This one is not part of new news.

167
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 Actually, it might have been at the time.

168
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 No, no, no.

169
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 So this is not part of new news, but it's an interesting story nonetheless,

170
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 that I didn't get from my folder that's 14 years old.

171
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 40 people in the world have been diagnosed with this,

172
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 and it's not even a real disease.

173
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Even the people who have coined the term said,

174
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 "Yeah, it's not real. It's not like a separate thing."

175
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 But it is called the Truman Show Delusion.

176
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 Now, when I say it's not real, it doesn't mean that it's completely made up.

177
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 What it means is that the DSM, the diagnostics, I don't know, service manual, whatever, for

178
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 the book that psychologists and psychiatrists look through to tell you how crazy you are,

179
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 that book does not include this.

180
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 It's included basically under another thing, and we'll get to that in a second.

181
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 But the Truman Show Delusion, or the Truman Show Syndrome, is a fairly recent thing,

182
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 and it really ties into the movie, the Truman Show.

183
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Now, if you don't know what that is, it was a movie that came out in the late '90s.

184
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 It was actually really good.

185
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 I'm not a big fan of dramas, but it was good.

186
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 It's about a man named, I don't know, John Truman, whatever.

187
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Anyway, so he has, since he was a baby, he's been on a reality show.

188
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 He lives on an island, and everyone else on the island is an actor,

189
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 and everywhere there's cameras.

190
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 It started off just as like a baby food commercial, and then people couldn't stop watching it,

191
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 and so they just let the cameras roll as he got older,

192
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 and I think in the movie he's probably in his late 20s or something like that.

193
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 And you have the director, who's basically God.

194
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 He sits in a studio, like a recording studio, in the moon,

195
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 so he's watching the island the whole time.

196
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 It's a really well-done movie.

197
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 It's kind of a drama comedy, but the Truman Show Delusion is kind of what you think it is.

198
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 It's people who think that they are the star of a reality show,

199
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 and that everybody they know is an actor,

200
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 and somewhere there are cameras, and if you're not on the show, you're watching them.

201
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 They believe they're the star of this reality show.

202
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 And it's manifested in a few weird ways.

203
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 One of the people suffering from it, after 9/11, he goes, "That's impossible. That didn't happen."

204
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 He thought it was just a twist in his reality show.

205
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 He thought like the producers were throwing him a curveball.

206
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 He thought the producers were just throwing him a curveball.

207
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 He drove all the way out to New York to see if the towers were really knocked down.

208
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 He shows up.

209
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Spoiler alert, they're not there anymore.

210
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Another guy went to an embassy.

211
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 I also believe it was in New York.

212
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 He went to an embassy and asked for diplomatic immunity,

213
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 and for a demand for the show to be ceased now.

214
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 They needed to cancel the show because it drives you nuts.

215
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 Imagine if you thought everyone around you was totally fake, and they were just actors.

216
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Every event that happened to you was being controlled by somebody.

217
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 There was one guy he was saying that he got the delusion that the end of the show,

218
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 the climax of the show, was he had to find his dad in this huge crowd of people.

219
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 And if he could find his dad and then his dad called him on the phone,

220
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 all of a sudden the producers of the show would come out on stage where there are a huge group of people.

221
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Give him a check for a million dollars and the show would be over.

222
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 But he couldn't find his dad that day.

223
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 His dad may not even been there because he's so delusional.

224
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 And therefore he didn't win the show and the show would keep going until the next big twist reveal,

225
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 you know, season finale, things like that.

226
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 So what's interesting about this story?

227
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 I mean, it's just, it's a bizarre delusion.

228
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 And people get caught up in stuff.

229
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 And I remember I was reading an interview with one of the guys who has it,

230
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 who suffers from it, and the interviewer says, "Have you ever seen The Matrix?"

231
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 And he's like, "Yeah, have I seen The Matrix?"

232
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 "Yeah, dude, I've watched The Matrix.

233
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 My kids hate it because I make them watch The Matrix with me all the time."

234
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 So it's, "The Matrix" kind of plays into that whole thing too, just like reality is not what you see.

235
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 But the reason why this isn't included as, if 40 people are diagnosed with it,

236
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 but the reason why it's not included in the, you know, psychologist's Bible

237
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 is because they basically, the psychology community sees it as another form of delusional behavior.

238
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 And I was reading these articles and they said,

239
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 "It's interesting because delusional behavior, delusions in general,

240
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 are formed by our cultural consciousness and our media."

241
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 So depending on the level of technology we are at, that is the delusion.

242
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 And they explained it that in the 40s and 50s, the delusion was radio waves

243
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 or being beamed into your head.

244
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 But by the time the 70s and 80s came around,

245
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 it came to microchips implanted in your teeth or your brain or under your skin.

246
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Nobody in the 1930s was like, "Oh no, I have this chip in my skin,"

247
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 because they didn't exist, people didn't know what to have a delusion about.

248
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 And I started to think about that more.

249
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 And this is really like we have these levels of delusions, early, early times,

250
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 like Paleolithic times or whatever, Greeks, Romans, all that stuff.

251
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 Demons and gods.

252
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 If you were being delusional, your delusion would be,

253
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 "I'm being persecuted by the gods themselves.

254
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 My crops are failing, that chicken's looking at me weird.

255
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 My wife is actually like half-spinach because the gods have cursed me."

256
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 And then in the medieval times, you had the evil eye.

257
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 You had somebody else cursing you, someone looks at you weird.

258
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 And I'm not saying that, like, those were, people did believe in the gods punishing people,

259
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 but I'm talking about if you suffered from a mental handicap,

260
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 if you were actually like a paranoid delusional person in 1440,

261
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 you wouldn't be thinking, "Am I on a reality show?

262
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Why is that corn stalk over there? Have a lens?"

263
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 You would think, if you were suffering from paranoid delusional thoughts,

264
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 you would think someone cast the evil eye on me.

265
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 But then we did go to the radio waves.

266
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 People who had these problems would complain about radio waves.

267
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 Then it moved on to the implanted chips, the reality shows.

268
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 Now we're out of the reality shows.

269
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 It's interesting to think what's next, what'll be the next delusional thing.

270
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 I think we're close to it with The Matrix,

271
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 and I think it'll be something related to video games.

272
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Okay, so let's go ahead and move on to our next and last topic.

273
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 This one was really weird. It was funny. I found the article.

274
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 I don't think it was recommended to me.

275
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 I think I stumbled across it, but if someone recommended this to me, I apologize.

276
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Because it kind of just appeared on my phone.

277
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 And I looked at the article and it was really long, and I was like,

278
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 and I kind of like read a bit of the beginning, and I was like,

279
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 and it took me quite a few days to really kind of settle down to read the article.

280
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 And it's weird. It's weird.

281
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 And there's one part in the article that straight up deceives you,

282
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 like straight up lies to you, and it made me kind of mad.

283
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 It made me a little surly, but I think overall the story has a lot of meat to it.

284
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 It's March, 1974.

285
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 And it's in Florida.

286
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 So let's hop in the Jason Jalopy, and we're driving from Hood River.

287
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 It's going to take us like three weeks to get there, but we finally get there.

288
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 We're now in back in time, so it doesn't matter how long it takes us to get there.

289
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 It's 1974. Everyone's wearing bell bottoms and big collars on their shirts.

290
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 And what other good stuff was in the 1970s?

291
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Yeah, I can't think of anything.

292
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Okay, so, oh wait, yeah, Star Wars hadn't even come out,

293
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 so there was my New York accent popping out the first second I was going to pick up on that.

294
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 The Betts family.

295
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 It's a mom and a dad and an adult son.

296
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 They had this property and there was this big fire in their area,

297
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 and they went out for a walk, and they were seeing, kind of, surveying the damage and stuff like that.

298
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 And in the field, kind of sitting there, and there was, you know,

299
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 the area was kind of scorched, but sitting there was this bowling-sized metal bowl.

300
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 The size of a bowling ball, which is generally what bowling-ball-sized means, but anyways.

301
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 And they had no markings on it except for a elongated triangle.

302
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 And they're like, "What? This is weird. This must have, like, maybe fallen from an airplane,

303
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 because it's just sitting in the middle of a field."

304
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 And they're like, "Well, that's weird. Let's take it home."

305
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 Weird artifact. You know, people take Knick-Knack's home. I do all the time.

306
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 And then I end up throwing them away.

307
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 But they take the ball home. Don't really think anything of it,

308
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 just like a weird artifact they found in their field.

309
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 And then one day, Daddy Betz is rocking out on his electric guitar,

310
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 because again, it's 1974.

311
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 [imitates electric guitar]

312
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 He's probably playing Smoke on the Water.

313
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 [imitates electric guitar]

314
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 And then the orb starts going...

315
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 [imitates electric guitar]

316
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 Like, what?

317
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 It's all playing the drums.

318
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 Anyways, that didn't start playing Smoke on the Water.

319
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 What he did was he realized when he played his electric guitar,

320
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 the ball started to resonate.

321
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 They're like, "That's weird. Why is it doing that?"

322
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 And then they had more questions, and they didn't just trail off like I did.

323
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 But then they had some other weird events.

324
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 One night, the Betz family is sleeping,

325
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 and they hear really loud organ music playing in their house.

326
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 [imitates organ music]

327
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Again, not the specific song it was playing, but it was organ music.

328
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 They'd also would hear doors banging and stuff like that.

329
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 So a lot of paranormal activity.

330
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Now, the family was like, "We've never had any of this stuff before."

331
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 The son was like in pre-med.

332
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 The mom and the dad were kind of like scientists,

333
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 not like lab coat scientists,

334
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 but I think the dad was an engineer or something like that.

335
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 And they go, "There has to be a rational explanation for this.

336
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 We don't believe in ghosts. Let's do some experiments on this big old orb."

337
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 One of the experiments they did was they would put it on the table,

338
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 and they would roll it, and it would roll to the edge of the table,

339
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 stop, and then roll back to where it was.

340
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 And they're like, "That's weird. Let's try it in the other direction."

341
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 It would roll, stop, and then roll back to where it was.

342
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 So obviously the dad's like, "The table must not be level.

343
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 He gets his bubble level. I think they even go to a different table.

344
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 Try it again. It does the same thing."

345
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 So at this point, they still don't have any answers to what this thing is.

346
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 And Mama Betz said, "We need to get more eyes looking at this thing."

347
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 So she contacts the newspaper and says, "Listen, I have this really weird artifact.

348
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 I'm not trying to get any money from my story or anything like that.

349
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 I just want to find out what it is."

350
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 So it gets in the newspaper, and that gets a public's attention.

351
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 So you did start to have lab coat wearin' scientists show up,

352
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 and they're doing the push test, and they're like, "That's weird.

353
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 It won't roll off the table."

354
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 And they also did it on the floor. It would kind of roll around the floor.

355
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 It seemed like it was navigating itself.

356
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 And then she took it to the military and said,

357
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 "If this is yours, you can have it back.

358
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 But if it's not, you can't damage it. I want it back."

359
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 And the military's like, "Okay, let's do that."

360
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 And they started running these tests. They had this big x-ray machine,

361
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 and they go, "This definitely, we didn't make this.

362
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 We didn't make this at all."

363
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 And based on our x-rays, there are these two cylinders inside.

364
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 There's a pole in the middle of it, and then these two elements surrounding it.

365
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 And we don't know what those elements are made out of.

366
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 We don't know what this is.

367
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 And the one guy at the Army basically goes, "Let's cut it open."

368
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 And she's like, "No, no, no, no, no. I don't want you to damage it.

369
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 It's not yours. It's mine." And they gave it back to her.

370
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 And then the Marines visited her house.

371
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 And was like, "Let us see if they..."

372
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Now, here's the point in the story where you're thinking,

373
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 "Wait a second, Jason. You're telling me she brought

374
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 an possible alien artifact to the Army, and they just gave it back to her?"

375
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 A lot of these little details we'll get to in a second.

376
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 But this is the narrative.

377
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 The Marines show up, and they look at it, and they're like,

378
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 "No, it's not ours either. We've never seen anything like this."

379
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 So the story gets out somewhere.

380
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 Someone makes the announcement that the sphere,

381
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 known as the "Bett's Sphere," after them, the people who found it,

382
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 was transmitting radio waves.

383
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 So now people are really, like, freaking out.

384
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 So the theories that were flown around at the time was that it was...

385
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 fell off an airplane, fell off of a satellite.

386
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 It was a satellite.

387
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 It was just a piece of junk.

388
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Or it was something alien.

389
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 And all those theories were kind of bouncing around.

390
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 You can find...

391
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 And what's interesting is, as I was reading this,

392
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 I've never heard of this story before,

393
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 but you can find the news articles.

394
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 You can find the news article, "Clip Beans," where they talk about this.

395
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 This happened.

396
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 We'll talk about the details in a second,

397
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 but this family existed, this sphere existed.

398
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 It was examined by the military.

399
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 It was examined by scientists and the media.

400
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 And it was surprising to me, too.

401
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 And a lot of you guys are going to be like,

402
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 "I've never heard of this story before."

403
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 And it's pretty intriguing.

404
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 I never heard of it before, either.

405
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 And, like I said, it just was on my phone.

406
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 Not because of, like, a magical ghost is on my phone,

407
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 but I think I just clicked on the link randomly.

408
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 And I was like, "This is actually a really intriguing story,"

409
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 except when it lies to me in a second.

410
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 But anyway, so we get to this point.

411
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 The Bets family, there is a blue ribbon panel assembled.

412
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 Blue ribbon panels, like the top scientists,

413
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 they're going to look at this orb.

414
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 They take it out.

415
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 And these are the -- you had a psychologist, a biologist,

416
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 a philosophy professor, a former Supreme Court justice,

417
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 a former attorney general of the United States,

418
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 a former New York of Appeals judge, and an astronomer.

419
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 And you're like, "That is quite the roster to look at this orb,

420
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 to look at the Bets sphere."

421
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 So they take it to this blue ribbon panel,

422
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 and they present it to them.

423
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 And the experts look at it and go,

424
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 "We don't know what it is."

425
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 They couldn't come to a definite conclusion.

426
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 And then here, I'm going to read this quote from this article.

427
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 So Dr. Alan Heineck was the astronomer,

428
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 and he said in this article,

429
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 "None will go so far as to say it's extraterrestrial.

430
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 They would be putting their scientific reputations on the line."

431
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 And that's two quotes, but separated.

432
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 So there might be something missing there.

433
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 We'll get to that in a second.

434
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 And then according to this article, Dr. James Harder --

435
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 that's a great poor name --

436
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 but Dr. James Harder, who was a civil and hydraulic engineering professor, said,

437
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 "This is definitely extraterrestrial.

438
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 I believe it's extraterrestrial.

439
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 And this guy also believes in UFOs."

440
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 So he obviously has a slate.

441
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 So I read that part of the article and just kept going.

442
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 I was like, "Okay, it was brought to this blue ribbon committee.

443
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 They must have set up the committee for the sphere,

444
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 because they just shot pop-up out of nowhere in the narrative."

445
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 And they took it to him and the experts go, "I don't know what this is.

446
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 I have no idea what this is."

447
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 Now, what happened was Dr. Harder, though,

448
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 when he examined the sphere, apparently --

449
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 and again, this is where he got a little weird right now,

450
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 because it says Dr. Harder was there at the blue ribbon committee,

451
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 but was he really listed in the group?

452
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 But anyway, so he looks at it and he goes,

453
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 "The elements inside of it -- those two little orbs,

454
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 those two little rings wrapped around the pole --

455
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 he said the heaviest element ever produced on Earth

456
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 in an atomic reactor had an atomic number of 105.

457
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 On Earth, the only naturally occurring high atomic number is 92.

458
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 He said, "But in the Bettsphere, the makeup of the little diodes

459
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 or whatever you want to call them, the little oval things in the Bettsphere

460
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 had an atomic number of 140.

461
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 He said, "If you drill into this, it could go critical,

462
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 and it would be the biggest nuclear blast on the planet.

463
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 It's a weapon."

464
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 So he made that statement to the press,

465
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 and the press went to the Betts family to get a comment from them.

466
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 But I'm going to back up to this quote where they go to the blue ribbon panel.

467
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 So the stories, they go to the blue ribbon panel to get it tested out,

468
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 and they go, "We don't know what it is."

469
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 I found another article, and I wasn't specifically looking for an article

470
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 that was skeptical.

471
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 I did find a skeptical article, but that's not where I found this information.

472
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 I was just looking for some more backup.

473
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 The blue ribbon panel was set up by the National Enquirer,

474
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 and it was a contest to anyone who could bring proof of alien or alien technology.

475
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 It won $50,000, and they took the orb to the National Enquirer's contest.

476
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 If you don't know, National Enquirer is a notorious tabloid in the United States.

477
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 A lot of their stuff is made up, and so it was a publicity stunt,

478
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 and they brought the orb there to win $50,000,

479
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 and the blue ribbon panel was like, "We don't know what this is,

480
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 but it's probably not alien. It's probably man-made."

481
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 And they didn't win the money.

482
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 And apparently it was there that James Harder lurking in the shadows was like,

483
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 "Hmm, that might be some sort of super weapon."

484
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 Don't lie to me.

485
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 The story's intriguing enough that if I had read that detail,

486
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 I would have not thought anything less of the story.

487
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 But when you omit it, and I find it later,

488
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 it makes me think less of you as a journalist or as a website.

489
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 All it does, all it did was add the National Enquirer,

490
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 and the rest of the story worked just fine.

491
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 But that really irritated me.

492
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 It didn't make me think anything less of the story,

493
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 but it made me think less, and I've talked about this before.

494
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 The paranormal and conspiracy community, you guys, us,

495
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 we have a high standard of proof,

496
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 because we're saying fantastical things.

497
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 Don't lie to people.

498
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 Drove me up the wall when I read that.

499
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 Absolutely up the wall.

500
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 And that's why the blue ribbon panel appeared out of nowhere in the original article.

501
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 And I'm not going to say with the original article where I got it from, whatever,

502
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 because, but just as a community, we can't be pulling these tricks.

503
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 You can't, because they need to lose all credibility.

504
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 Back to the narrative.

505
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 The harder says, "It's a weapon."

506
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 If you crack it open, it will go nuclear.

507
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 The media turns to the Betts family for comment.

508
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 The sphere and the family have been, according to all reports,

509
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 even skeptical ones, have been missing since the late 70s.

510
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 They're gone.

511
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 I went to Skeptoid, which is a skeptical website I go to a lot.

512
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 They don't have any answer for where the Betts went.

513
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 The conspiracy websites have no answer for where the Betts went.

514
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 It's just gone.

515
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 And it's such a little known conspiracy that there's not a ton of resources on it.

516
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 And I don't think it was ever an issue of they went missing as in missing people reports were filed.

517
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 It could have been, we just don't want the media anymore.

518
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 We don't want the publicity.

519
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 It could have been they went missing and someone said, "Yeah, they said they were moving to Michigan.

520
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 They don't want the publicity anymore."

521
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 And people went, "Oh, okay."

522
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 But by all accounts, they're gone, as far as I could tell.

523
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 Now, again, someone could find an article and say, "Oh, no, no, no, here they are.

524
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 And that'd be awesome."

525
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 But from the research I've done, this family and this sphere to this day are missing.

526
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 Fascinating.

527
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 What was the sphere?

528
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 The sphere of the item was, it was an art project.

529
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 A guy was working with those type of spheres.

530
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 And he was traveling through Florida and he thinks one fell off his truck.

531
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 Some people thought it was a ball bearing that fit into this giant pipe.

532
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 The story is about the military investigating them.

533
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 Skeptoid was the one looking into that.

534
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 And they found some stuff where people are like, "Yes, the military investigated the item."

535
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 But the story about using the giant X-ray, like, "I wasn't there when that happened.

536
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 I can't verify whether or not that happened.

537
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 I can only say that, yes, the military did look at it."

538
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 So some of the details match up.

539
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 Some of the details might be a little more elaborated.

540
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 But the overall thing, the Bets family did find a sphere.

541
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 They took it to the media and took it to these groups to be investigated.

542
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 And to this day, the sphere and the Bets family are missing.

543
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 That's all fairly undisputed.

544
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 Yeah, bizarre story.

545
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 Creepy story.

546
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 You think you stumble across this artifact and you're going to have a wonderful adventure or a mystery to solve

547
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 because there's organ music playing and it's rolling around on the floor and then you and your family go missing.

548
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Never to be seen again.

549
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 Okay, so an addendum.

550
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 Obviously, you can tell that this is being recorded a couple of days from where I originally recorded the podcast.

551
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 One, because the sound quality is probably a little different.

552
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 And then two, because the sound of my voice sounds much more sick and stuffy.

553
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 So both those things are true.

554
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 I am much sicker than when I originally recorded it three days ago.

555
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 But I did find some more info.

556
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 So the Bets sphere.

557
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 You know, it didn't sit right with me that the sphere, the sphere, whatever, not the chucking sphere, but a sphere, a circle.

558
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 I wonder how many times I mispronounced that in the episode now that I think about it.

559
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 Anyways, it didn't sit right with me that an entire family went missing and there was no police reports or anything like that.

560
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 Now, I started to look more into it.

561
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 Oh, also, if you notice weird clicking noises right now, it's because I have a lost inch in my mouth, a throat lost inch.

562
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 But anyways, so I kept looking and I can't really fault the other websites I looked at,

563
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 which was Atlantis Rising and Mysterious Universe was a website that I looked a lot at as opposed and other websites as well in the links.

564
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 At first, I was a little upset that they didn't find this information, but then I realized that, you know, when you're looking into the mysterious stuff, information is constantly evolving.

565
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 Now, the family didn't go missing.

566
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 And so I don't think a lot of people did a bunch of research on that.

567
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 They actually were up until the 80s still in that area, still in that house.

568
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 They just decided--their articles were saying they mysteriously vanished and they weren't.

569
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 I stopped taking phone calls, but then after like 1985, they did vanish. Nobody knew where they were at.

570
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 I found this website called jackscycogio.com and I still haven't made quite heads or tails of what the point of this website is.

571
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 It's well written, but I can't tell if it's like creepy stuff or weird stuff or just this guy's adventures.

572
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 But according to an article on that website, and this article is dated 2016, so just two years ago,

573
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 a college professor had one of the sons, one of the little Bets boys in his class,

574
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 and as the professor and the boy started talking, the boy gave some more background to the story.

575
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 They did end up leaving the area about 1985.

576
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 The woman I kept referring to is Mama Bets.

577
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 Her name--I think--what was her name here? Let me look this up here.

578
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 Jerry, Jerry Bets. She's actually a prominent businesswoman. They moved away.

579
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 So that part of the story is true. So part of the story is true.

580
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 They did get tired of all the publicity after it was outed as some sort of weapon.

581
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 They just said, "You know what? We're going to stop answering the phone."

582
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 So they could have had a bunch of coup callers and stuff like that.

583
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 They could have realized that maybe it was just a metal sphere, we don't know.

584
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 By all accounts, they ended up moving to another state where they still get phone calls.

585
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 People still track them down to find out about the sphere, and it's sitting in the closet.

586
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 It didn't mysteriously vanish. The family didn't mysteriously vanish.

587
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 They just kind of faded into obscurity.

588
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 And I think the websites that I was citing were like, they vanished.

589
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 And you know, I've noticed this with paranormal conspiracy stuff,

590
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 is that one website will do some in-depth reporting back in like 1982,

591
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 and then other people will report that, and they'll just report the original story.

592
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 And then time moves on, and then that becomes the official version.

593
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 So I'm sure a long time ago, someone's like, "They mysteriously vanished."

594
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 And then the articles that have come out since then, and because this hasn't been a big story

595
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 for the past 20-some-odd years, it wasn't like there was a lot of resources to go on.

596
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 I just happened to stumble across this Jack's Geo-Psycho, or sorry, Jack's Psycho-Geo website,

597
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 and it was like on the third page of Google Results, which...

598
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 And I had to type in specifically what happened to the Betz family, or where did the Betz family go

599
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 to locate this, because I didn't find it in any of my initial research, so...

600
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 But part of being a researcher, part of doing this, is having to find those things.

601
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 But again, I'm not gonna fall, especially these articles that I was citing were written before 2016.

602
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 But I hope this does... So if you... I'm adding this in for my own completion, and for yours as well.

603
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 I think that this is probably the first telling of the Betz story from beginning to end,

604
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 that finally has the end to it. No, the family didn't disappear, the sphere didn't mysteriously disappear,

605
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 it's just sitting in their closet, and they've simply moved away.

606
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 And they still get phone calls about it.

607
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 So this was it, the complete Betz fear story.

608
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 Thank you, Jack's Psycho-Geo, for giving us that last piece of information to that story,

609
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 and actually to the author of that particular article. His name is Tim Gilmore,

610
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 so again, it's just an ongoing thing.

611
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 Every so often you'll find an article that will add more information to the story of what happened

612
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 on Mili Earhart, or the science behind the Bermuda Triangle, and things like that.

613
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 And it's just nice to be able to have that extra info.

614
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 Quick note, from the sound of my voice, I think it's easy to tell.

615
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 I recorded the first three episodes on Sunday, and then I edited them through.

616
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 I've been getting sicker and sicker, I haven't had time to record the next couple episodes.

617
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 Tomorrow's episode most likely will not come out.

618
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 We will probably have a Friday episode, but at this point I don't think we're going to have a Thursday episode.

619
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 So I apologize for that.

620
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 I've done episodes while I've had, like, really bad diarrhea, and I've had episodes where I've had some sinus pain,

621
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 or really bad sinus pain, but when it's affecting my throat and my voice and my voice to scratch,

622
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 it's a bit harder to record.

623
