1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,360
 How does a young man go from being completely sane to a cold blooded murderer in only the

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,360
 matter of a few months?

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,040
 And then we travel to Jolly Old England to take a look at the story of a young girl hanging

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,920
 out in her garden.

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,880
 She was hoping to simply smell some flowers or sing along with a bluejay sitting in a

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,880
 tree.

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:33,640
 She found herself face to face with something that would change her life today on Dead Rabbit

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,640
 Radio.

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:45,640
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,840
 I'm your host, Jesus Carpenter.

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,840
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,400
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,920
 I'm a little sick.

14
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,080
 I'm a little under the weather.

15
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,160
 I think that's how most people get this time of year.

16
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,160
 But still I'm having a great day, right?

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,320
 Still, I'm going to talk about this guy brutally murdered somebody and then a girl who had a

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,720
 life-changing paranormal event.

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,520
 That's fun, despite the turmoil in my own tummy.

20
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,320
 But someone who never makes me sick to my stomach walking into Dead Rabbit Command is

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,440
 one of our Thanksgiving livestream contributors.

22
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,920
 Everyone give it up for Callum Frazier.

23
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,920
 Woohoo!

24
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,920
 Yeah, come on in.

25
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,000
 Callum is bringing in a bottle of Tums and a garbage can for me to throw up in.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,360
 Callum, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

27
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,920
 You guys can't support the show financially.

28
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,080
 I totally understand.

29
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,720
 Just help spread the word about Dead Rabbit Radio.

30
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,720
 That helps out so much.

31
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,800
 I just got all of my Spotify results.

32
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:45,600
 And you guys, you guys, this audience is in the top 5% of all podcast audiences as far

33
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,040
 as sharing the show with your friends.

34
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,520
 I got that statistic today.

35
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,760
 That's amazing.

36
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,720
 Top 5% of all podcasts on Spotify, you guys, share this show with others.

37
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,640
 And I really, really do appreciate that.

38
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,280
 I really, really do.

39
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,640
 Callum, I'm going to go ahead and hook you up to the hair hang glider.

40
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,840
 Everyone grab onto his ankles as he jumps off the highest point at Dead Rabbit Command.

41
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,440
 Let's glide all the way out to Italy.

42
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:23,360
 And first off, I want to give a shout out to Fabio Nurbon, a longtime supporter of the

43
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,840
 show, a longtime guy who's had his name mispronounced multiple times on the show.

44
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,120
 He sent the story over to me.

45
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,000
 It's a fascinating story, so I really, really appreciate it.

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,960
 Let's go back in time to summer of 2022.

47
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,320
 So not far at all, right?

48
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,020
 We're in June, July.

49
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,640
 This is what, four or five months ago?

50
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,040
 This story starts.

51
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,200
 We're in the town of Trevisio.

52
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,000
 We're in the town of Trevisio in Italy, and there's this young dude, this 24-year-old

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,880
 man named Ricardo Di Filiis.

54
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,600
 And Ricardo was just a normal guy.

55
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,080
 He was just a normal dude living in Trevisio.

56
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,440
 He lived with his mom and his dad.

57
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,740
 This younger brother had to move it away, but this was a good family unit for these

58
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,740
 guys.

59
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,940
 The news report describes this.

60
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,860
 This is how I would hope to be described as something tragic ever happened to me.

61
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:30,980
 They were described as, quote, "Good people with a passion for cats."

62
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:36,420
 Now I do realize that this was an Italian news article that I had to translate to English

63
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,580
 so it's possible there's a translation error in there.

64
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:46,760
 But I mean, listen, man, if the last thing you're remembered for is loving cats, that's

65
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,000
 dope, right?

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 That's pretty good.

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 You can chase it.

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,800
 I know there's way better things to be known for, helping orphans and building libraries,

69
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,440
 but loving cats is up there, guys.

70
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,680
 But anyways, Ricardo's living at home with his parents, hanging out with his friends.

71
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,720
 Life is good.

72
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:10,900
 But his best friend said, "The summer of 2022 is where everything changed."

73
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,040
 He goes, "Ricardo was a totally normal guy.

74
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,580
 You never would have thought anything weird about him."

75
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,620
 And I've known him since I was a kid.

76
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,260
 We grew up together.

77
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:25,020
 He was totally fine, but this summer, everything changed.

78
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,540
 He begins to exhibit mental problems.

79
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:37,480
 And by the time summer ended and fall began, Ricardo was convinced his life was a television

80
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,120
 show.

81
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,760
 He suffers what's known as the Truman Show delusion, or the Truman Delusion.

82
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,840
 We did an episode on it a long time ago, way long time ago.

83
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,520
 I'm gonna put it in the show notes.

84
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,000
 But it is, if you've seen the movie The Truman Show, Jim Carrey is a guy who is raised on

85
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,660
 the set of a television series, but he doesn't know he's in a television show.

86
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,620
 It seems like it would be a boring show with him as a baby, right?

87
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,580
 It would just be him pooping in his pants.

88
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:10,420
 But it would get compelling as he got older and he saw this little boy.

89
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,940
 It's the ultimate reality show, right?

90
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,220
 You're actually watching someone live their life.

91
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,300
 It's recorded 24 hours a day.

92
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,500
 The set is a whole town.

93
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,700
 Everyone else is an actor except for Truman, and he doesn't know that he's trapped in the

94
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,900
 show.

95
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:29,920
 And this movie has actually sparked the Truman Delusion, or Truman Show delusion.

96
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:35,600
 There are people who believe that they too are also trapped in a television show.

97
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,840
 Maybe I'm looking around for cameras and if they can't find them, that's just proof,

98
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,840
 right?

99
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,080
 That the cameras are so well hidden.

100
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,840
 In the Truman Show, he doesn't really know anything's up until the lighting fixture falls

101
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,480
 from the heavens and smashes into the ground in front of them.

102
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,260
 And even then they're like, "Oh, there was a satellite.

103
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,700
 That was a satellite that came down."

104
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,700
 But then he starts to kind of piece stuff together that he might not be living in the

105
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,460
 real world.

106
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:08,100
 And it's interesting because we do know that mental illness tends to track with the highest

107
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,340
 level of technology.

108
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:14,700
 In the 1950s, people believed that the Russians were beaming radio waves through metal fillings

109
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:19,620
 in people's teeth because the radio waves was the highest level of technology.

110
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:26,200
 Nowadays, the paranoid delusions involve things like miniaturized cameras, constant surveillance,

111
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,440
 being trapped in a reality show, being trapped in the matrix.

112
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,120
 And it's always interesting to think where will madness be in the next 100, 200 years

113
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,680
 as technology continues to grow.

114
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,920
 The delusions will change.

115
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,320
 If this guy had been born in medieval times, he probably would have thought that a local

116
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,760
 witch cast a curse on him.

117
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:53,300
 If he was born in the 1950s, he would have thought that he was being hunted by the KGB.

118
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,580
 But he's 24 years old, so he believes that he's trapped on the set of the Truman Show,

119
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:03,820
 or he is, basically he's not an extra in the Truman Show, that he is being surveilled.

120
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,020
 He's constantly being videotaped.

121
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,940
 Somebody else is watching his life unfold.

122
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:13,300
 He begins to become incredibly paranoid, which is what you would expect from somebody who

123
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,020
 thought there were hidden cameras everywhere.

124
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,440
 If you showed him and be like, "Hey, Ricardo, what's up?

125
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,200
 I bought you this zinger, this Hostess zinger.

126
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
 You want to eat it?"

127
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,560
 You would assume that your friend isn't actually giving you a delicious treat.

128
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,040
 You would assume your friend was doing product placement.

129
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,160
 You would assume your friend got some sort of ad deal from Hostess.

130
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,960
 "Hey, you want to try some Denison's chili?

131
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,680
 Or how about a diet sprite?"

132
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,480
 People don't normally talk in brand names like that.

133
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,080
 But you would think that, "Man, this guy must have a brand deal."

134
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,860
 He begins to become paranoid.

135
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,940
 He begins to become physically violent.

136
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,940
 He's attacking people.

137
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,700
 Now, I was like, "Oh, I don't want your zingers?

138
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,340
 I don't want your diet sprite?

139
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,340
 Get away from me.

140
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,820
 You're trying to sell me on that stuff."

141
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,780
 Okay, to be fair, there's nothing in his paper that said.

142
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,020
 He thought people were doing brand deals.

143
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,660
 I'm adding that as an example.

144
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:08,060
 I don't know why he was physically attacking these people, possibly because he was going

145
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,060
 mentally insane.

146
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,340
 He ends up becoming physically violent.

147
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:17,120
 He ends up fighting with his best friend, so they actually stop hanging out.

148
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,520
 It would be tragic, right?

149
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,520
 And you wouldn't know.

150
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,120
 I mean, me and you, we've done research on this stuff.

151
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,280
 We know about the world of the weird.

152
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,280
 If our friends started talking, they thought they were on a television show, we would know

153
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,240
 that this is a, while not common delusion, it's not rare either.

154
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:40,960
 But a normal person whose best friends start saying, "I think I'm trapped in a TV show."

155
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,420
 I don't think a normal person, it would freak you out.

156
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,580
 It would freak us out too, but it would freak you out.

157
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,680
 You would have no sense of context.

158
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,860
 We are explorers in the land of the strange.

159
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,060
 So we would be able to classify this as, oh yeah, this is actually documented mental illness.

160
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,260
 We may have been able to intervene.

161
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:01,220
 I'm not blaming, I'm not blaming this guy's friend because he doesn't listen to the podcast

162
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,500
 or spend all his days reading about weird stuff.

163
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,740
 But you know what I mean?

164
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,100
 What would you do if you had no context of listening?

165
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,520
 Your friend started saying that he was being filmed everywhere.

166
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,520
 You wouldn't know what to do.

167
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:20,000
 You'd just be like, "Bro, chill out with this ice cold classic Coke."

168
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,440
 Ah, refreshing.

169
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,680
 Summer turns to fall and he starts to go through this delusion that he is being filmed.

170
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:35,840
 He's the star of the reality show that no one else can see, but he knows that it's happening.

171
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,960
 He ends up losing his job.

172
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:45,300
 He ends up becoming suicidal.

173
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:53,820
 And by November of 2022, so really just a couple weeks ago is when this story hits the culmination,

174
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,460
 he finally decides it's time to see a psychologist.

175
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,740
 It's time to get this checked out.

176
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,980
 Something's not right.

177
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,060
 Something's not right.

178
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,620
 And I don't know how much of that was strictly Ricardo and how much of that was his parents

179
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,640
 and everyone else in the community.

180
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,600
 But he was the director of the show.

181
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,800
 He's like, "Oh, I got Fraser Crane lined up for a guest episode."

182
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,200
 He decides I need to go see a psychologist.

183
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,440
 The decision's been made to get him treatment.

184
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,960
 His behavior is still becoming very erratic.

185
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:31,160
 And on November 15th, 2022, so just a couple weeks ago from recording this episode, the

186
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,120
 family's getting ready to settle in for the night.

187
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,900
 Ricardo goes to his bedroom.

188
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:41,020
 His mom goes to her bedroom.

189
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:46,180
 And the father, who normally does sleep with the mom, decides to stay up late this night

190
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,220
 and watch some television set.

191
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:55,260
 His father, Francesco de Felice, a 56-year-old veteran, says, "I'm going to stay up, watch

192
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,780
 some television, and catch you later."

193
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:03,780
 What's about four in the morning?

194
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,360
 Now we're at December 15th.

195
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,840
 Ricardo runs into his parents' bedroom and his mom is deep asleep and he starts screaming

196
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,120
 out, "Dad's dead!

197
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,120
 Dad's dead!"

198
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,080
 That's going to get you up, right?

199
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,560
 That's how you don't care how deep of a sleeper you are.

200
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,720
 You're awake when someone runs in screaming that.

201
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,640
 The mom woke up and she sees her son standing there.

202
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,920
 Ricardo's just screaming up, "Dad's dead, dad's dead."

203
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,300
 And she gets out of bed to go check on him and Ricardo won't let her leave the room.

204
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:42,020
 I don't want you to see it, I don't want you to see it, but Dad's dead!

205
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,120
 And she wants to see it.

206
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,680
 She has no idea what's going on.

207
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,680
 Her son's nuts.

208
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,920
 Her son's nuts.

209
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,580
 So maybe he's hallucinating it or, you know, that'd be the best case scenario that you

210
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,620
 go down there and the dad's sitting on the couch watching Hogan's Heroes.

211
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:01,820
 And it was just all hallucination, but she wants to get out and she wants to go see her

212
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,820
 husband.

213
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,840
 Ricardo won't let her out of the room and Ricardo actually barricades her in the room.

214
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,420
 Now, at some point the police are called.

215
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,780
 I don't know if it doesn't specifically say that Ricardo called the police or the mom

216
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:21,060
 called the police or neighbors called the police because there's a guy next door screaming,

217
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,220
 "Dad's dead, dad's dead."

218
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:29,140
 The police show up and when they come into the house what they find is they find Francisco

219
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:39,500
 de Felice had been killed in a both savage and lightning fast attack.

220
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:49,500
 Ricardo had taken a weightlifting bar, like a dumbbell bar, a little handheld pipe, and

221
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,180
 while his father was sleeping on the couch he just fell asleep out there watching time.

222
00:12:53,180 --> 00:13:03,900
 He began beating his head in with this pipe and began stabbing his dad in the neck with

223
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,580
 a kitchen knife.

224
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:15,780
 And the attack was so fast Francisco didn't even wake up.

225
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:21,740
 He died in his sleep as his son was pummeling him with both a pipe and stabbing him with

226
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,580
 a knife in the neck.

227
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:30,460
 Now Ricardo has pretty much confessed to this crime.

228
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:36,780
 I don't know what libel laws are like in Italy, but he's pretty much confessed.

229
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:42,260
 He made a statement to the police saying that he didn't mean to do it.

230
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,260
 That he didn't mean to do it.

231
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:48,300
 He didn't mean to bash his dad's head in and stab him several times.

232
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,180
 He didn't mean to do it.

233
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,020
 But that would imply that he did confess to doing it.

234
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,580
 But then he changed his story.

235
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,140
 He goes, "I didn't mean to do it."

236
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:02,700
 And then later on he told the police, "Listen, my dad was trying to hurt me."

237
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:07,060
 "My dad was trying to hurt me."

238
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:11,700
 And then he added later on during this police investigation to ask him these questions.

239
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,980
 First off he said, "I didn't mean to do it."

240
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:16,060
 And then the second time he goes, "Well, he was trying to hurt me."

241
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:23,260
 And then later he added, "My mom was trying to hurt me too."

242
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:27,060
 And I don't think he meant in the sense that it was self-defense.

243
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,060
 I mean, his father was asleep.

244
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:34,580
 In the sense that he saw his father and his mother as part of this conspiracy, that they

245
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,380
 were part of this Truman show set up as well.

246
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,340
 And that's really chilling, right?

247
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:45,140
 Because obviously if it sounds like had the situation played out slightly differently,

248
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,500
 he would have killed his mother as well.

249
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:54,180
 Because he also saw her as part of this faceless organization that was trying to harm him.

250
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,180
 And it's terrifying.

251
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,900
 It's an absolutely terrifying story.

252
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:02,380
 Long time listeners of the podcast know people snapping, people going crazy, just out of the

253
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,580
 blue scares me.

254
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:10,460
 Now on a snapp-o-meter, this one's a little less scary because he went crazy over a matter

255
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,460
 of months.

256
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:16,540
 To me it's more spooky if you're sitting there and then your friend's totally normal

257
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,180
 and then he starts like stabbing you.

258
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:23,020
 I mean, listen, it's creepy if he threatens you for four years before he does it, or if

259
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,020
 he does it right away.

260
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,620
 I still don't want it to happen to anybody.

261
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:30,620
 But people who snap, people who seem completely normal up until that night and then they begin

262
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,540
 murdering their family, because that happens too.

263
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:40,340
 It's still, I'm not saying that the story isn't creepy or I don't find it tragic in any sort

264
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:45,420
 of way, but I think that most likely like mental illness for young men, this is the

265
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,220
 right age for it to start.

266
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:53,580
 It's like 19 to 30s when we see things like schizophrenia, things like these deep mental

267
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,540
 illnesses just pop up in young men.

268
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,460
 And it's awful.

269
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,740
 And I mean, obviously he's not trapped in the tournament show.

270
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,660
 Obviously that is just the delusion.

271
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,380
 It would have been great had he got some help early.

272
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:13,740
 But at the end of the day, like he didn't, and he murdered somebody and he was probably

273
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,460
 planning on murdering other people.

274
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,500
 There's another version of this story, right, where he didn't run into the bedroom screaming

275
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,780
 dad's dad, dad's dad.

276
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:28,380
 He ran into the bedroom and he killed his mother as well.

277
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:33,780
 But for whatever reason, luckily, right, for whatever reason, and we're glad that this

278
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,980
 happened, after he murdered his dad, that part we're not glad that it happened.

279
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:42,660
 But after he murdered his father, he had some sense of clarity.

280
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,940
 He became lucid.

281
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:49,340
 Whatever delusion he was going through for a moment in time, he realized what he did

282
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:54,260
 was so horrific he ran upstairs and told his mom.

283
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,220
 Like snapped out of it.

284
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,460
 And he didn't try to murder her as well.

285
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,260
 Terrifying story though, and it goes in, we talk about this a lot on the podcast too,

286
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,500
 these people who feel that the tournament show is kind of the offshoot of the gangstalking

287
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,900
 thing, that there's this huge conspiracy against them.

288
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:13,580
 I feel like, and we've been covering a lot of these, I don't want to just cover these,

289
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,900
 right, I tried to space them out.

290
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:20,460
 This one was just sent to me a couple days ago, but I think that the gangstalking conspiracy

291
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:25,460
 theory has the most potential to cause people to become violent.

292
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,980
 People are really going to blow up buildings because of flatter, they're not going to blow

293
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:35,180
 up buildings because 9/11 was an inside job unless they're testing out their theories.

294
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,820
 But you know what I mean, there's a lot of conspiracy theories out there that don't

295
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,620
 cause people to go nuts.

296
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:49,460
 I mean the conspiracy theory itself may be nuts, but I'd say most conspiracy theories,

297
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:54,700
 even if you thought space was fake and NASA was a satanic organization controlled by the

298
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:59,660
 Illuminati to make us not believe in God, that's a pretty popular conspiracy theory

299
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,660
 out there.

300
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,540
 Those people aren't out there blowing up space shuttles.

301
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:10,020
 Most people aren't out there shooting, assassinating NASA scientists.

302
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:14,220
 Gangstalking we are starting to see really story after story after story after story of

303
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,380
 people who believe this and taking action.

304
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:23,780
 The reptilian one we do get, that one gets kind of violent as well, but you know that

305
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:27,740
 reptilians are taking over the planet because the idea is well I can kill them, it's just

306
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,340
 a reptilian.

307
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,740
 That guy who killed his two daughters, what was it like two years ago because he thought

308
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:37,700
 they were reptilian foot soldiers.

309
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,540
 So yeah we do have that Chris cry.

310
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:44,480
 I think the Venn diagram between conspiracy theorists and violent people isn't that connected

311
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,180
 but there is a connection and unfortunately we get stories like this.

312
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:53,220
 Mental illness leading into the conspiracy theory, he thought he was on the Truman show

313
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,740
 and irony of all ironies he's going to be in the prison system where he will be monitored

314
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,980
 24 hours a day.

315
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,820
 So if he wasn't in the Truman show before he's definitely put himself in that position

316
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,820
 now.

317
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:10,340
 Calum, let's go ahead and touch the keys to the carboner copter.

318
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:22,180
 We are leaving behind Italy, fly us all the way out to jolly old England.

319
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,180
 There's this old saying, I don't even know if it's a saying, it might just been a movie

320
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,180
 quote.

321
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:32,620
 And the saying goes, they should have sent a poet.

322
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,900
 They should have sent a poet.

323
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:39,620
 I've heard it used in the conjunction with astronauts, right?

324
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:45,940
 Because astronauts listen man, like they're cool but an astronaut is if you took a joc

325
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:49,100
 and a nerd and they had a baby.

326
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,100
 And it's an astronaut.

327
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,100
 It's an astronaut.

328
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,100
 You didn't know that?

329
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,340
 That's what happens at the end of season all that.

330
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,340
 Little astronauts born.

331
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,700
 They have a joc and a nerd.

332
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,300
 You have someone who like Neil Armstrong, take him for example.

333
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,220
 I know he's a super old man who might not even be alive anymore.

334
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,860
 But you take like nowadays you look at him and you're like, dude, those people are neither

335
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,820
 jocks nor nerds.

336
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:14,420
 Generally though, you take some of their peak physical fitness because they make them spin

337
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:18,940
 around really fast in that cyclotron thing.

338
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,380
 And then they got to be smart.

339
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,820
 So as they're spinning around, they have to be like, if I throw up now the velocity will

340
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,180
 be eight times the center of gravity.

341
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:29,860
 I better hold it on my vomit until this stops.

342
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,220
 You got to be able to do like advanced math because it's not like you're just hitting

343
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,340
 buttons and flying around.

344
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,740
 You got to figure all this stuff out.

345
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,540
 But you also don't, you can't get like super nerd up there.

346
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:44,860
 You can't get some point dexter because then like if something goes wrong, if an alien attacks

347
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:50,940
 a space shuttle, you want them to be strong enough to punch them and go get out of here.

348
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,820
 So that's the type of people they send up there, right?

349
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:59,860
 Well, nowadays it seems like they are all a bunch of nerds, but I'm talking classic astronauts.

350
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:06,100
 I'm talking the square jawed dude who was like kicking the moon.

351
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,020
 They're like, Neil, stop that.

352
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,420
 You're sending it out of orbit.

353
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,420
 I don't care.

354
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,420
 I'm a jerk.

355
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:15,020
 What I'm saying is that we got nothing but nerds up there today.

356
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:20,540
 It used to be nerds at peak physical fitness, but there's no poets.

357
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:27,260
 And this idea that you can send someone up there who is able to triangulate a star moving

358
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:34,420
 past a meteor as an asteroid is jumping up and down and go, don't hit none of that stuff.

359
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:38,380
 But they can't write eloquently.

360
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,220
 They can't put down what they're seeing.

361
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:46,860
 They're viewing things that no human has ever viewed, right?

362
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:51,820
 How many, if you look at the total population of the world since the beginning of time,

363
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,900
 the amount of people who have been in space is what?

364
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,180
 Like at this point, maybe a couple hundred.

365
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:01,020
 That includes like just like people floating around the Russian space station.

366
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,020
 Let me in.

367
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,020
 Let me in.

368
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,380
 They're like, no, not until you finish your green beans.

369
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:09,420
 How am I supposed to finish my green beans if I'm floating outside?

370
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,420
 You know what I mean?

371
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:13,420
 It's been such a small percentage.

372
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:17,660
 And the idea is if you sent a poet up there, someone who could this is going somewhere.

373
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,420
 It's totally going somewhere.

374
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,860
 I feel this intro might be longer than the story.

375
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:27,140
 So when you take a poet, when you take a wordsmith, when you have someone who knows

376
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:34,500
 how to translate the unknowable and the unseeable into words that humans can understand and

377
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:39,740
 not only understand because when Neil Armstrong is up there and he goes, the moon is super

378
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,740
 dusty.

379
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,980
 I get what he's talking about.

380
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:49,940
 But if you put a poet up there, he could tell us exactly how dusty it is.

381
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:57,260
 Does the dust look like Gossamer Webb trailing across the Arabian Peninsula?

382
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:05,740
 Or is it the same dust I might find in the background of Aunt Matilda's house covering

383
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,740
 her precious moment figurines?

384
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:11,180
 Now those samples off the top of my head.

385
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,100
 I know I'm not a poet either.

386
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,900
 But you get what I mean.

387
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,540
 We sent scientists up there.

388
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:19,300
 We should have sent a poet.

389
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:23,900
 So let me tell you what the story is because this is fascinating to me because what we're

390
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:29,340
 going to do is we're going to take a look at the story of Hillary Mantell.

391
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,500
 She's an award winning author.

392
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,500
 She's passed away now.

393
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,340
 She passed away a couple of years ago.

394
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,980
 It's a shame, Hillary Mantell.

395
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,980
 She's been knighted by the Queen of England.

396
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,820
 Very very famous, very beloved author.

397
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:44,940
 She wrote historical fiction and short stories and articles and things like that.

398
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,900
 She's a wordsmith.

399
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:53,820
 And when you have someone who experiences a paranormal event, they can explain it in

400
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,820
 a certain way.

401
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,380
 But I want to read this to you.

402
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,380
 I very rarely read things verbatim.

403
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,380
 But this I think is awesome.

404
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:04,620
 Because we have someone who spent her entire life writing.

405
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:14,220
 And when it came time to write her memoirs, she explains the most life changing event

406
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,700
 that she had ever gone through.

407
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,420
 And it happened when she was seven years old.

408
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:23,260
 Let's take a look at this.

409
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:27,460
 She starts off by saying, let me give a little bit of context here too.

410
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,060
 She starts off mentioning the location Brosscroft.

411
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:35,460
 That is a residential neighborhood in Derbyshire, England.

412
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,460
 So let's take a look at this.

413
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:42,140
 "I am seven and I am in the yard at Brosscroft.

414
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:46,660
 I am playing near the house, near the back door.

415
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,740
 Something makes me look up.

416
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,080
 Some shift of the light.

417
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,020
 My eyes are drawn to a spot beyond the yard.

418
00:24:55,020 --> 00:25:00,940
 It's gates in the long garden.

419
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:12,460
 It is, let us say, some 50 yards away among coarse grass, weeds, and bracken.

420
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,100
 I can't see anything.

421
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:19,820
 Not exactly see.

422
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:28,020
 Not the faintest movement, a ripple, a disturbance of the air.

423
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:39,020
 I can sense a spiral, a lazy buzzing swirl like flies, but it is not flies.

424
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,860
 There is nothing to see.

425
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,380
 There is nothing to smell.

426
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,020
 There is nothing to hear.

427
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,380
 But it's motion.

428
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:55,340
 This insolent shift makes my stomach heave.

429
00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:01,820
 I can sense at the periphery the limit of all my senses.

430
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:05,500
 I can sense the dimensions of the creature.

431
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:09,180
 It is as high as a child of two.

432
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:14,300
 Its depth is a foot 15 inches.

433
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,900
 The air stirs around it invisibly.

434
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:25,020
 I am cold and rinsed by nausea.

435
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,220
 I cannot move.

436
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,820
 I am shaky as if pinned to the moment.

437
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:33,300
 I cannot wretch my gaze away.

438
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,940
 I am looking at a space occupied by nothing.

439
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:42,380
 It has no edges, no mass, no dimension, no shape except the formless.

440
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:46,140
 It moves.

441
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,700
 I beg it.

442
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,820
 Stay away.

443
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,020
 Stay away.

444
00:26:51,020 --> 00:27:00,340
 Within the space of a thought it is inside me and has set up a sick resonance within my

445
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,900
 bones and in all the cavities of my body.

446
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,740
 I pluck my eyes away.

447
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,940
 It is like plucking them out of my head.

448
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:14,860
 Grace runs away from me.

449
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:18,340
 Runs out of my body like liquid from a corpse.

450
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:21,700
 I move from the spot.

451
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,220
 My body weighs heavy.

452
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:30,220
 My feet have to be hauled up from the ground as if they were sticking in gore.

453
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:36,860
 I walk out of the sunlight through the glass place into the enclosed dimness of the cold

454
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,940
 kitchen.

455
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:44,460
 I say, "Mom, I want to come in now.

456
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:49,540
 Can I do some drawing?"

457
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,820
 I see myself through her eyes.

458
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,340
 Sweat running from me.

459
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,740
 My cheeks falling in.

460
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:01,820
 My chest heaving to control the thick taste of blood and sick that's in my mouth.

461
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:05,940
 I pray, let her not look at me.

462
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:10,260
 "Yes," she says sweetly, her back turned.

463
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:16,100
 "Of course you can."

464
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,220
 It is the best yes I have ever heard.

465
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:23,740
 It is the best yes I have ever heard in the course of my life.

466
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:32,260
 If I had been sent out again into the secret garden, I think I would have died.

467
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:42,820
 I think my heart would have stopped.

468
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,140
 She wraps this up.

469
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:50,780
 She talks about a, there's a old comic novel is what it's called back in the 1930s called

470
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,580
 Cold Comfort Farm.

471
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:56,220
 And one of the characters in it is called Ada Doom or Aunt Ada Doom.

472
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:02,140
 And she keeps going on and on in the book about how she saw something nasty in the woods

473
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,140
 shed.

474
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:07,860
 They never reveal what the nasty thing was, but Aunt Ada Doom says when she was a child

475
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,420
 she saw something nasty in the woods shed.

476
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,860
 This novel is a comedy, right?

477
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,300
 And so she does kind of laugh it off.

478
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:21,580
 She says, she finishes off by saying, "When I grow up I laugh at this.

479
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,420
 I say I'm like Aunt Ada Doom.

480
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:28,620
 I saw something nasty in the woods shed."

481
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:33,500
 She explains that when she's talking about this with other people, she has a laugh about

482
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,700
 it like, "What did I see?

483
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,260
 What did I see?"

484
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,940
 Just like Aunt Ada Doom.

485
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,660
 But she finishes this up.

486
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:45,980
 She goes, "And what was it anyway?

487
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,980
 I don't know.

488
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:51,820
 Something intangible had come for me to try its luck.

489
00:29:51,820 --> 00:30:00,380
 Some formless, borderless evil that came to try to make me despair.

490
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:11,820
 When I'm on my own and I think about it privately, then I scarcely laugh at all."

491
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:16,940
 It's a fascinating story.

492
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:24,380
 At the end of the day it's a story of this formless evil, this unknowable darkness that's

493
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:28,420
 in the light of day.

494
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:32,260
 It's standing first outside the garden and then it's in the garden.

495
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:36,300
 And she's describing, I just love the way that she describes this.

496
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:40,700
 And it's interesting because there is no description of it, right?

497
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:45,380
 She can't see it, she can't smell it, she can't touch it.

498
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,420
 But then you also have dimensions given, right?

499
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:53,540
 It was the size of a two-year-old child, it was about a foot and 15 inches, some 50 yards

500
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,540
 away.

501
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,900
 So it's just such a fascinating story.

502
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:01,900
 To have someone who can write so eloquently, explain something that is impossible, I wanted

503
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,980
 to share that with you.

504
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,780
 That's not the only reason why I wanted to share it with you because we're going to

505
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:09,860
 talk a little bit more about this next week.

506
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:14,620
 Hillary goes on to say, she writes, "The memoir is called 'Giving Up the Ghost.'

507
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:17,740
 It's not just writing about paranormal stuff.

508
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,900
 But she's open about this, which I love.

509
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:23,020
 I love it when people are open about these experiences."

510
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:29,820
 She'll talk about it in interviews and she said, "Had this not happened to me, had this

511
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:32,420
 afternoon, really only minutes had passed," right?

512
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,860
 She goes, "I think I would have been a different person.

513
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:40,660
 I think I would have been a much more rational person."

514
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:44,740
 And I could 100% see how that is, right?

515
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:50,780
 There is a large contention of us, and I definitely fell into it, that believed in the paranormal

516
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:53,140
 long before they had any paranormal events.

517
00:31:53,140 --> 00:32:00,980
 I was a child hearing about demonically possessed people and we lived in a haunted house.

518
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,980
 We lived in a haunted house.

519
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,500
 I'm not one of the fun haunted houses.

520
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,340
 It wasn't a spirit Halloween store.

521
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,900
 And then I would hear, my dad was a Southern Baptist minister.

522
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:13,100
 Everybody would hear from him and other ministers and deacons about demons that had been interacting

523
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,380
 in and around the church.

524
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,740
 But weird stuff happened.

525
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:21,980
 It wasn't until I was 18 when I actually heard a ghost.

526
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:27,060
 And then throughout my 20s, which again is the time when people, especially young men,

527
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:32,220
 have psychotic problems, I began to see, I thought I was going nuts when I started seeing

528
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,020
 ghosts everywhere and shadow men everywhere.

529
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,020
 I mean everywhere.

530
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,020
 But here I am.

531
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:41,140
 And I'm not nuts.

532
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:44,780
 So you have people who believe in the paranormal just because it's really cool, right?

533
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:47,220
 And then some of them never have a paranormal experience.

534
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:53,180
 I've had several throughout my life and continue to have them.

535
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:58,780
 But to have one at seven and to have one that's so frightening.

536
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:03,660
 My buddy Steve, when he was a little kid, he got chased down the hallway of his house

537
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,540
 by a ghost stagecoach.

538
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,300
 But I mean that's terrifying.

539
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,420
 Actually I was going to use it as an example.

540
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,860
 So that's not that bad.

541
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,860
 That's actually terrifying.

542
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,860
 That's a bad example.

543
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,580
 But my point being is let's say that you lived in a house.

544
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:20,420
 You were a seven-year-old kid and you were throwing toys down the hallway because your

545
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,180
 imaginary friend wanted to play with your toys.

546
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:25,060
 That's what we talked about in yesterday's episode.

547
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:31,300
 That's not as terrifying as standing out in your garden and seeing an unexplainable evil.

548
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,500
 And she didn't just see it.

549
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,900
 It entered her body.

550
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:38,860
 She saw it and then it was instantly on top of her or inside of her.

551
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,660
 That's another thing we see in the world of paranormal.

552
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,660
 These things don't move normally.

553
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:46,700
 Sure some of them walk down hallway or right ghost stagecoach is down a hallway.

554
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,620
 But a blink of the eye.

555
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,620
 I've seen that too.

556
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:54,660
 I mean you're looking at something from across the room and then it is on you.

557
00:33:54,660 --> 00:34:00,180
 It is the weirdest thing in the world because we don't measure distance and time like that.

558
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:05,060
 Even the fastest man, if you're standing there and Usain Bolt is running towards you, he

559
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,060
 will tackle you.

560
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,420
 He'll catch you before you can get out of the way.

561
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:13,140
 But you intrinsically know that he's moving according to the laws of physics.

562
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:16,220
 He's just moving faster than you can move out of the way.

563
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,300
 But that's not, I mean you're looking at something and then it's on top of you.

564
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,780
 And in this case inside of her.

565
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:28,140
 So I just think it's interesting when you do have such a traumatic metaphysical experience

566
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,140
 early in life.

567
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,980
 It would change the way you looked at things.

568
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:35,500
 And even you may not have, I think it's a jolly good time to sit around and talk about ghosts.

569
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,500
 Right?

570
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,340
 Because you've seen something beyond ghosts, beyond the paranormal.

571
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,340
 Something truly malignant.

572
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,660
 And I also wanted, because this is where we're going to talk about next week, I wanted to

573
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:46,500
 end it like this.

574
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,540
 Hillary never made this connection to be fair.

575
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,140
 Hillary never made this connection.

576
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:54,780
 But Hillary, she did have another paranormal experience.

577
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,140
 At least one other one that I saw.

578
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:59,380
 She saw her father's ghost walking down the stairs one day.

579
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:05,060
 And honestly I think that one predated the creature in the garden.

580
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:08,460
 But seeing her father walk down the stairs would give you comfort that there is life

581
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,460
 after death.

582
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,540
 What was this thing?

583
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,540
 And it changed her life.

584
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:14,580
 She goes, "Listen, I would have been a more rational person.

585
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:19,860
 I would have approached the world differently had I not gone out in the garden on this afternoon."

586
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,700
 It's that simple.

587
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:26,780
 She also had some pretty serious health problems.

588
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:30,320
 When she was in her 20s, she was sick all the time.

589
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,380
 She was sick constantly.

590
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:36,380
 And she was diagnosed with having a mental illness.

591
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,520
 But she wasn't mentally ill.

592
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:45,540
 She had what we know of today as endometriosis.

593
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,540
 Endometriosis.

594
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:49,380
 I have friends who have suffered from this.

595
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:55,740
 What it is, if I can describe it correctly, it's basically the uterine wall.

596
00:35:55,740 --> 00:36:02,900
 It's the material that's supposed to be inside the uterus is outside the uterus.

597
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,780
 And it's covering up the fallopian tubes and the eggs.

598
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,560
 It's extremely painful.

599
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,300
 You have very, very terrible periods.

600
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:17,180
 You're sick all the time.

601
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,100
 And it's something that can be diagnosed nowadays.

602
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,620
 It's something that can be corrected nowadays.

603
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:28,980
 But the way to fix it is to have your uterus removed.

604
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,820
 Have a hysterectomy.

605
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:37,100
 Well, Hillary, she was diagnosed as being mentally ill because she was complaining about

606
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,580
 an illness that they couldn't figure out what it was.

607
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:45,120
 They put her on antipsychotics because she wasn't psychotic and she's on antipsychotics.

608
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,060
 She became psychotic.

609
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,620
 She went nuts from the medication.

610
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:53,820
 She finally lost all faith in the medical profession.

611
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,380
 She's like, "You guys don't know what you're doing."

612
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,740
 She got off the medication and she just goes, "I guess I'm just going to be sick all the

613
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,740
 time."

614
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,020
 She ended up in Botswana.

615
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,460
 She seemed to be a pretty well-established traveler.

616
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,700
 She ended up in Botswana at one point.

617
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:11,100
 And there she was diagnosed with endometriosis.

618
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:16,660
 And they performed what she calls, and I think this is pretty apt, a medically induced menopause.

619
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:21,900
 So, when they corrected this, when they gave her hysterectomy, she was no longer able to

620
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,380
 have children after that.

621
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:26,660
 And that was something that she had wanted to have.

622
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:33,500
 Now, apparently, something that can help with this, we know this now, something that can

623
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:39,380
 help with this condition is giving birth, is getting pregnant and carrying a child, can

624
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:43,660
 actually help this.

625
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,940
 I don't know the science behind it.

626
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:49,140
 I guess I have a couple friends who have suffered from it.

627
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,420
 But it's a fascinating story.

628
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:58,700
 She never connected the ghost in the garden to her unknowable medical troubles.

629
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:04,540
 As far as I know, she at least never made that public, as far as I know.

630
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:09,100
 But was there a connection?

631
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:15,500
 And this is where we get into that really interesting/very, very controversial thing,

632
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,020
 like how much of illness is caused by spirits.

633
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:23,940
 I think, honestly, a very, very, very, very small amount are.

634
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,780
 I think I'm sick right now.

635
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:31,020
 I think my stomach hurts because, I don't know, but I don't think it's because I brought

636
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,220
 a cursed basketball home.

637
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:36,460
 We'll talk more about the cursed basketball later.

638
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:40,580
 I don't think it's cursed, but it's been weird since I brought that basketball home.

639
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:43,700
 But I don't think it's because of the basketball.

640
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,940
 But I couldn't say for sure that every, I couldn't say for sure out of every person

641
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:52,500
 who's sick, all 8 billion people at any given time, that at least 10 of them aren't caused

642
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,220
 by a ghost?

643
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,220
 Probably not.

644
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,220
 Probably not.

645
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,220
 Probably not.

646
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,220
 She probably had this.

647
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,660
 That was, I had to say all that stuff for the skeptics.

648
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:05,820
 But you and I know the reason why you have a runny nose is there's a ghost in your boogers

649
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,740
 right now.

650
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:12,260
 I don't think much illness, but it'd also be foolish for someone who believes in the

651
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:19,420
 paranormal to say it's none, to say that physical health and the spirit world are completely

652
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,420
 unrelated.

653
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:24,380
 Because we do know that mental health and the spirit world can be related.

654
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:28,260
 There's a lot of dark spirits out there that want to drive you mad, want to push you to

655
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:35,540
 the point of depression, want to have you walking around in a stupor.

656
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,140
 So it could be.

657
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,220
 And now we're getting a double-barreled attack.

658
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,540
 And her life would have been more rational.

659
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:45,820
 She would have approached the world with a different lens, a mentally different lens,

660
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,260
 had she not seen this thing in the garden.

661
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:53,980
 And there is a chance, however slight it is, that her ability to have a happy life physically

662
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:54,980
 as well.

663
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:59,620
 To not spend years and years and years sick and be put on anti-psychotics and all this

664
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,620
 stuff.

665
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:05,740
 That also could have been caused by the formless evil in the garden.

666
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:16,260
 And next week we're going to take a look at a story that takes this theory that the darkness

667
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:22,060
 that surrounds us can also be sometimes a cause of the illness.

668
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:29,140
 Because we're going to meet a family that is so tormented by a demon that peeks into

669
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:33,420
 the bedroom while they're deep asleep.

670
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:38,420
 You wake up and see this demon watching you from the darkness of the hallway.

671
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:51,180
 This demon is so powerful that its goal is to use physical sicknesses to turn the family

672
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:54,700
 into demons themselves.

673
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,700
 We'll cover that next week on Dead Rabbit Radio.

674
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,540
 DeadRabbitRadio@gmail.com is going to be our email address.

675
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,540
 You can also put us up at facebook.com/DeadRabbitRadio.

676
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,620
 Stick Talk is at DeadRabbitRadio.

677
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:07,940
 DeadRabbitRadio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

678
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,940
 You don't have to listen to it every day but I'm so glad you listened to it today.

679
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,420
 Have a great weekend guys.

680
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:19,420
 Bye.

681
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:41,420
 Bye.

682
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:44,000
 (upbeat music)
