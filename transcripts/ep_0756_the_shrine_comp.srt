1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,400
 Insanity. Everyone has a different definition of what insanity actually is, and today we're going to take a look at two people who many would consider absolutely insane.

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:20,200
 First off, a young woman believes that the universe has sent her a soulmate, but this one has a very dark secret.

3
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,700
 And then we take a look at someone else who has all the hallmarks of an insane person.

4
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,300
 Me.

5
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,900
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:36,600
 [Music]

7
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Jason Carbenter. I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,500
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. You're like, "Jason, didn't you just say you were insane? I don't know if I want to hang out with you this episode."

9
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,000
 Well, this person has no choice. They got to listen to it.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now is our newest Patreon supporter.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,100
 Coming in, it's Jacob Schlager. Everyone give a round of applause to Jacob Schlager. He's like, "My name's Slogger."

12
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:07,200
 Well, Jacob, sorry I didn't confirm how your name was pronounced, but you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

13
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,100
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, or if you don't want me to butcher your name on air, that's fine too.

14
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,900
 Just help spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

15
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,500
 Now, Jacob, let's go ahead and get this started. Oh, and let me say this too.

16
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:28,400
 I have gone 700 and what, what is it, 756 episodes at this point? And I very, I think I've cussed on two of them.

17
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,200
 Maybe, maybe more than that. This episode, this first story in particular, I'm going to have to say the F word multiple times.

18
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,400
 I tried figuring out a way to do it without it. And it's not like I think you guys are all perudes or anything like that, but...

19
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:47,400
 If you do listen to this at work, God save your soul, because how often I talk about horrible fetishes.

20
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,000
 This one I talk about a fetish as well, but...

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,500
 Or if you're listening around kids, or basically anyone, anyone who doesn't want to hear anything disgusting.

22
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,000
 If you do happen to listen to it around them, this one I'm going to be dropping the F bomb a lot.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,200
 So just a heads up. If you are listening to this at work, put some headphones on.

24
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,100
 You're operating heavy machinery. They're like, "Bill, Bill, you're about to crush your fingers."

25
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,700
 But you just can't wait to listen to this podcast. So fingers be damned.

26
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:18,000
 So Jacob, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,500
 We are headed out to Serbia.

28
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:28,000
 I've never really seen Serbia. I watched this documentary a long time ago called "Behind Enemy Lines."

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,900
 And it was about Owen Wilson got shot down in Serbia, and he made it.

30
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,600
 He got in front of enemy lines, thankfully, to tell us the story.

31
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,400
 But that's pretty much my only experience with Serbia.

32
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,200
 It's very great. Basically, the entire country looks like the first 20 minutes of saving Private Ryan.

33
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,300
 Now, I could be wrong. Could be a beautiful place.

34
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:53,700
 I've lost all my Serbian listeners. The Serbian tourist board has now banned this show.

35
00:02:53,700 --> 00:03:00,300
 But even according to this Serbian's account, it doesn't seem like the best place ever.

36
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,900
 It seems like I'm pretty accurate.

37
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,100
 So we're driving around Serbia and we're headed back to the year 2011.

38
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:12,300
 Now, we don't have an exact location, but again, the way she portrays this, it's just an endless wasteland.

39
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,100
 And we don't have a name for this young woman. We're going to call her Monique.

40
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,600
 Just a stab in the dark. If that's her real name, I'm just guessing.

41
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,900
 Monique is driving through Serbia. Her mom's actually driving.

42
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:29,100
 She's a 16-year-old girl and her mom's driving through Serbia and she says it's this long journey.

43
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,500
 They're just driving for hours and hours and hours.

44
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,500
 And she's looking out the window and she sees just dead grass.

45
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:42,300
 This is her story. Dead grass stretching for miles and miles all the way to the horizon.

46
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,700
 She just sees dead yellowed grass.

47
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:49,100
 That was that's the nice part of Serbia.

48
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:56,100
 And while she's riding in the car and she's staring out the window, she hears a voice in her head.

49
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,500
 But he fucks dead bodies.

50
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:09,500
 Now, Monique didn't identify this as a voice different than her normal imagination.

51
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,500
 If anything, it may be classified as an intrusive thought.

52
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,500
 We did an episode on intrusive thoughts before.

53
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,500
 Intrusive thoughts are absolutely fascinating.

54
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,500
 In a nutshell, your brain will get stuck in a loop.

55
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,500
 A lot of people think they're going crazy when they have intrusive thoughts.

56
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,500
 Intrusive thoughts can be really bad. They can actually be counter to what you normally would believe.

57
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,500
 So you may love your child, but every so often you get this thing stuck in your head being like,

58
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,500
 "I just want to smash him in the head with a hammer."

59
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,500
 And it terrifies you. You're like, "No, I don't want to smash him in the head with a hammer. I love this little dude."

60
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,500
 But an intrusive thought and the more you think about it, the more it gets in.

61
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,500
 It's the bear you feed. It's that whole analogy.

62
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,500
 Everyone has two wolves in them and the one that gets stronger is the one that you feed.

63
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,500
 So people have intrusive thoughts about all sorts of stuff.

64
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,500
 People have intrusive thoughts about their sexuality.

65
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,500
 It's absolutely fascinating. I did a whole episode on it.

66
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,500
 I'll put it in the show notes and it makes you question who you are.

67
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,500
 But that's all it is, an intrusive thought.

68
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,500
 It's just this weird thing that humans go through. You're not alone.

69
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,500
 So this may be classified as an intrusive thought.

70
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,500
 It doesn't necessarily come from the ether, but the way Monique sees it, though,

71
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:25,500
 is that the universe is telling her, "But he fucks dead bodies."

72
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,500
 She says the phrase just jumped in her head as she was staring off into the distance

73
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:45,500
 and then it began to repeat, "But he fucks dead bodies."

74
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:53,500
 And as this thought is rolling around in her head, she comes to this conclusion.

75
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,500
 "My soulmate was out there."

76
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,500
 That's her actual quote in this post. "My soulmate was out."

77
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
 That's how she, that's what she's getting from this thought.

78
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:11,500
 And you're thinking, "Wait, wait, what? How, how is any of this connected?"

79
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:20,500
 She thinks the universe is giving her a message, saying that the perfect man is out there for you,

80
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:26,500
 but you can never be with him because he fucks dead bodies.

81
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,500
 And she would never be with someone who engaged in that activity.

82
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,500
 To be fair, no one would, right?

83
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,500
 And she believes this person is her soulmate to such a point.

84
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,500
 Now Monique posted this online in 2020.

85
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,500
 Nine years after she had this experience, she's still thinking about it.

86
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,500
 And she says, "I have a boyfriend now and he doesn't fuck dead bodies."

87
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,500
 But I told him about this.

88
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,500
 This is such an important moment of her life.

89
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,500
 She told her current boyfriend about it and she's writing about it nine years later.

90
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:04,500
 And she says, "This person is my soulmate so much that if he saw me,

91
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,500
 he would instantly recognize me and never let me go.

92
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,500
 But he fucks dead bodies and I can't be with him."

93
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:22,500
 She now knows that she has a soulmate out there, but his crime is so heinous,

94
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,500
 she'll never be with him.

95
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,500
 And this is how she ends her post.

96
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,500
 "Please don't insult me.

97
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:34,500
 I'm a fragile, lonely soul and my life is heavy.

98
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,500
 Don't push me down.

99
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,500
 Love to the nice people on here?

100
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
 Please help me.

101
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
 Am I losing?

102
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
 Lost my mind?

103
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,500
 What are those thoughts?"

104
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,500
 Now she posted that back in 2020.

105
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,500
 She hasn't posted anything since.

106
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,500
 And she had a pretty active post.

107
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,500
 This was on Reddit.

108
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,500
 She had a pretty active posting history.

109
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,500
 And the one thing I like about Reddit is that I can track back stuff.

110
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:04,500
 She had been posting pretty much the entire year of 2020 in a bunch of different topics.

111
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
 And then her last series of posts was this.

112
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,500
 And they got deleted.

113
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,500
 She was posting them in subreddits like "The Truth Is Here" and "Paranormal",

114
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,500
 "Ghost Story", stuff like that.

115
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,500
 They got deleted from a few of them.

116
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,500
 She was reaching out for help.

117
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
 Now it's definitely possible that this is a creepypasta.

118
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,500
 This is an ARG that started up or anything like that.

119
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,500
 I haven't seen anything to prove that, but it's possible.

120
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,500
 And as far as the making fun of things, that's really not what I want to do here.

121
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:35,500
 But I thought this was so fascinating to look at because what we have here is a young woman who,

122
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,500
 most likely, there's two options here.

123
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,500
 There's a rational option and a paranormal option.

124
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,500
 The rational option is that she did have some sort of intrusive thought.

125
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:51,500
 And intrusive thoughts to the unknowing or untrained mind are absolutely terrifying.

126
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,500
 Absolutely horrific thoughts can pop up into your head.

127
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,500
 I know people who have a fear of holding babies because they're afraid they're going to smash them against the ground.

128
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,500
 And they would never do that.

129
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,500
 They wouldn't even drop a watermelon.

130
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,500
 But they had it for whatever reason that intrusive thought got into their head,

131
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,500
 and every so often it pops up, and they're afraid they'll actually throw a baby to the ground.

132
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,500
 And I've had people confide in me all sorts of intrusive thought.

133
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,500
 When I did the episode, I got a lot of emails and a lot of YouTube comments,

134
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,500
 mostly emails because people wanted to be private about intrusive thoughts they were having.

135
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,500
 And all of them I go, "Listen, it's just an intrusive thought."

136
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,500
 If you think it's something more serious, you may want to talk to someone,

137
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:36,500
 but most likely, follow the steps in the episode and basically like you have to...

138
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,500
 I actually don't remember how you got rid of them.

139
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,500
 I don't remember if you ignored them or if you just let it play out.

140
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
 I'm alive, don't smash the baby, but there is a trick.

141
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,500
 I don't remember it off the time I had, but...

142
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,500
 Go listen to that episode if you're holding a baby.

143
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,500
 But yeah, so intrusive thoughts, they are...

144
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
 It's just a weird quirk of biology.

145
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,500
 And now she could be having that and that, but he fucks dead bodies just popped in her head

146
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
 and she thought it was weird and then it started cycling through.

147
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
 This is nine years later.

148
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,500
 She's a grown woman.

149
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,500
 She was 16 when this happened.

150
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,500
 Now she's, what, 25?

151
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,500
 She's still worried about these.

152
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,500
 She finds it.

153
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,500
 What are those thoughts?

154
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,500
 Now, when I look at the comments to this Reddit,

155
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,500
 most of them were, "You're insane.

156
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,500
 You have some sort of mental problem."

157
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,500
 And an intrusive thought does not mean you're insane.

158
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,500
 But I thought it was interesting how everyone kind of defaulted to that.

159
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,500
 And to be honest, myself as well.

160
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,500
 I go, "This is... She's nuts."

161
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,500
 And I've set it aside.

162
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,500
 I said this, I came across this a while ago.

163
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,500
 I set it aside.

164
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,500
 And I was just going through my notes and I came back and I read it with a fresh set of eyes and I go,

165
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,500
 "She's nuts."

166
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,500
 I mean, I don't think she's legally insane by any means,

167
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,500
 but I don't think she is...

168
00:10:54,500 --> 00:11:00,500
 I think this is an intrusive thought playing in her head is what I'm saying.

169
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,500
 But we're so quick to judge her.

170
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,500
 Now, let's look at the paranormal aspect of this.

171
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:11,500
 Why couldn't the universe be telling her that there's a soulmate out there but he fucks dead bodies?

172
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,500
 We've covered way weirder things on this show.

173
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,500
 And it's so interesting what...

174
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,500
 Because we're... This is on paranormal subreddits.

175
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,500
 This post is on "The Truth Is Here."

176
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
 I think that's where I originally saw it.

177
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:29,500
 Oh, and I'm pretty sure it got deleted and I archived it, but I could be wrong on that.

178
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,500
 This was on "The Truth Is Here" subreddit.

179
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:37,500
 And they talk about UFOs and ghosts and Bigfoot and paranormal and dimensional rifts and...

180
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:44,500
 If she had said, "I was driving through Serbia and I think an alien named Voltar beamed a message into my head

181
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,500
 that soon the apocalypse will come and I have to repair,"

182
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,500
 this would have gotten way more traction, right?

183
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,500
 This might have gone viral.

184
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:58,500
 But because the voice was saying, "But he fucks dead bodies," we go, "That's insane."

185
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,500
 And I find that so fascinating. I don't want to get too much into the weeds in this,

186
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,500
 but I find it so fascinating what we as paranormal research and myself included in this

187
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,500
 decide what is insane and what is not.

188
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:15,500
 Travis Walton saying that he got sucked aboard a spaceship back in the early 80s, 70s, whatever that was,

189
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:21,500
 and got experimented on and broke free and all that stuff and then came back to Earth and did a movie and a book and all that stuff.

190
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
 We accept that.

191
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:30,500
 We accept that as part of UFO lore. She gets laughed off of Reddit. She's insane.

192
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:36,500
 And so I find that so... Why couldn't she have been relayed this information?

193
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:45,500
 But I wanted to include it in the Insanity episode because it does highlight what we would consider insane behavior.

194
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:50,500
 The universe saying, "But he fucks dead bodies," to you.

195
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:57,500
 And then making the leap to, "Oh, that must mean I have a soulmate out there, but he fucks dead bodies," and so on and so forth.

196
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:03,500
 Like, it almost feels like you have the intrusive thought and then you have the...

197
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,500
 That's it. It seems like such a conclusion to jump to.

198
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,500
 Now, she went to talk to any random person. This would be considered insane.

199
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:19,500
 Even in the fringe world we exist in, us, fans of the paranormal, this is considered an insane belief.

200
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,500
 But why? Why is this any weirder than someone saying that they woke up in the middle of the night,

201
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,500
 there was much alien standing around the bed or they were walking down a dark hallway, they saw a ghost,

202
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,500
 and the ghost delivered a message to them? Why would this be any different? I find that fascinating.

203
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,500
 But I didn't want to just... I don't think it was fair and I'm not picking on her either.

204
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:41,500
 I did want to make sure that we weren't saying, "Ha ha, let's look how crazy this woman is."

205
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:47,500
 We can look at the belief. And I hope she's found some peace. She hasn't posted since. I hope she's found some peace.

206
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:52,500
 But Jacob, let's go ahead and fire up the carbonar copter. We're leaving behind Serbia.

207
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:58,500
 Picture-esque Serbia. Let's go ahead and buy some postcards while we're here and send them off to our worst enemies.

208
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:05,500
 Jacob, let's go ahead and leave behind Serbia. We are headed all the way out to Hood River, Oregon.

209
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,500
 [Jakob's voice]

210
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:13,500
 Now, talking about insanity, let's shift attention to me.

211
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,500
 And I'm not talking about the fact that I believe in ghosts and aliens and Bigfoot and all this stuff,

212
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:25,500
 because that even that is fairly accepted. It's becoming more accepted in modern society.

213
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,500
 Like, if you walked up to your coworker and said you believed in Bigfoot, you wouldn't be fired.

214
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:35,500
 If you walked up to your coworker and said, "Man, I think I found my soulmate, but he fucks their bodies,"

215
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,500
 that might cause human resources to get involved.

216
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:44,500
 But generally, like, this was so fascinating to me. Why? Here's the thing.

217
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:49,500
 You have basic society that just thinks believing in any of it. It's dumb.

218
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,500
 They don't think it's rational, ghosts or Bigfoot or aliens and stuff like that.

219
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,500
 And they might think you're a kook. They might think you're a little weird.

220
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,500
 But they probably won't think you're certifiable. Certifiably insane.

221
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,500
 If you went to work and you started talking about flat earth, people would think you were more insane.

222
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:11,500
 But, like, you know what I mean? There's that hierarchy. It's almost like an iceberg.

223
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,500
 You can make an iceberg of what people find insane instead of obscure stuff.

224
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,500
 Like, at what point do people go, "No, no, no, no. You can't talk about that at work. Now you're nuts."

225
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:28,500
 And one thing that I believe in, which I think people believe, I believe in ghosts and I believe in aliens and I believe in...

226
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,500
 Bigfoot is always iffy on me. I believe there's something out there, but I just don't know how to classify it.

227
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,500
 Maybe he exists, but I believe there's something to the sightings. I just don't know how to classify it.

228
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,500
 But I'm open. I'm open to the Bigfoot thing.

229
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:48,500
 But if I told people about my experiences with the law of attraction, you would go, "You're nuts, dude."

230
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:55,500
 Like, you're nuts. If you actually believe what you're telling me, you're nuts.

231
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,500
 You're as nuts as the girl in the first story.

232
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,500
 We've talked a lot about the law of attraction on this show. I've done a couple episodes.

233
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,500
 I'll put them in the show notes and I'm not going to retread all that ground.

234
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,500
 But basically what the law... And this is why law of attraction at its core is insane.

235
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:18,500
 The law of attraction is seeing something and believing something different.

236
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,500
 That is the hardest part of the law of attraction.

237
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:34,500
 Wallace Waddles, who wrote the greatest book on the law of... The law of attraction basically is you can manipulate the universe by your own thoughts.

238
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,500
 You can manipulate fate by your belief. That's in a core.

239
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:44,500
 And Wallace Waddles wrote the greatest book on the law of attraction. Really the first modern book about it.

240
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:49,500
 I know Neville Goddard wrote it and I know the secret was written and I know you have all these other books.

241
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,500
 The science of getting rich is the earliest modern book on it.

242
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:58,500
 And he says in that you have to believe opposite of what you see.

243
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,500
 That makes you a mastermind.

244
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:14,500
 If you can live in a rat infested tenement and go, "I'm in a mansion. I can see the gilded works on the wall and I can see the clean floor and the fresh running water."

245
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:20,500
 As rust colored water is pouring out of your pipes, you are a mastermind.

246
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:26,500
 You are actually looking at reality and seeing something different and that is nearly impossible.

247
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,500
 But it works.

248
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,500
 It's funny. A long time ago I said, "I don't really like Post Malone's music."

249
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,500
 And I was doing an episode about Post Malone. I wasn't just talking about it.

250
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,500
 I was doing an episode about Post Malone. I said I didn't like his music.

251
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,500
 And then I started listening to his music and it turns out I'm a huge Post Malone fan.

252
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,500
 And I need to learn to shut my mouth about music I don't like.

253
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,500
 Because recently I made a comment about Little Nausex and I go, "Ah, the new Montero song."

254
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,500
 He's only popular now because that video was so controversial.

255
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:01,500
 I was listening to his new song, "Industry Baby."

256
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:07,500
 And it's a banger. I really like "Industry Baby." It's a really, really good song.

257
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,500
 And I was listening to it and immediately spoke to me.

258
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:16,500
 And I couldn't figure out why. It's like, "Oh dude, this beat's really good. I really like his flow."

259
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,500
 But it spoke to me on a different level.

260
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,500
 I was watching an interview with him on Genius. I'll put it in the show notes.

261
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,500
 And I recommend people watching this interview.

262
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,500
 He was being interviewed with the other person on the song, a young man named Jack Harlow.

263
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:35,500
 The song is about the law of attraction.

264
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:40,500
 I could barely understand parts of what he was saying, honestly. I had to look up the lyrics at one point.

265
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:47,500
 And in the interview, both of them are like, "Listen, when I was a young person, I knew I would be here.

266
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:53,500
 I knew it. Didn't doubt it at all. And here I am."

267
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:58,500
 And Little Nausex goes on to say, "Listen, I had the biggest song in the world. I shouldn't be here.

268
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:04,500
 I should just be a one-hit wonder. But I knew when I made my first mixtape,

269
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,500
 before I became famous, that I would become bigger than I am right now."

270
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,500
 So when I was big during my song, the Cowboy song, what was it, Old Town Road?

271
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:20,500
 He goes, "I knew that wasn't the end. I visualized past being the biggest song ever." Here he is!

272
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,500
 And Jack Harlow is saying the same thing. And it's so funny. They were talking to each other and they go,

273
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,500
 "Yeah, you know, Jack's like, I wanted to be on this song because I really agreed with the message."

274
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:35,500
 And I was like, "What's the message?" They started to begin an interview and as they were being interviewed,

275
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,500
 separate interviews, they both started talking about the law of attraction.

276
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:49,500
 You have to believe you have already won against all odds. And that's what makes it magical.

277
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:55,500
 You have to believe something that's not true. It's not faith. The law of attraction is the opposite.

278
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:03,500
 You have to see something and believe the opposite. Faith is not seeing something and believing it anyways.

279
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:09,500
 You know you're not going to see a physical manifestation of these things, but you believe them anyways.

280
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:16,500
 The law of attraction is seeing a physical manifestation and not believing it.

281
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:23,500
 And that's the hardest thing to do because I'm sitting in this closet and I'm dripping with sweat because it's so hot in here.

282
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:31,500
 And I have to visualize myself in a recording studio that I own in the basement of my house.

283
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:38,500
 Wood paneling and acoustic foam everywhere. I have to visualize success.

284
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:43,500
 And not visualize that I'll have it someday. I have to believe I have it now.

285
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:49,500
 And that is the hardest thing to do. And when you look at people like Lil Nas X and Jack Harlow,

286
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,500
 they did it and they're talking about it.

287
00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:02,500
 The law of attraction is so fascinating to me, but a normal person and I would argue, even a lot of people in the paranormal community,

288
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:10,500
 I would argue even a fair amount of this audience would believe I am insane to believe it and to preach it as much as I do.

289
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:17,500
 You go, "Jason, that's impossible. Like sure it might work, but I believe it.

290
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:24,500
 I believe it. And that to me is the key to magic.

291
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,500
 And that's where we're really going to get insane.

292
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,500
 I mentioned before on the show, it's funny, this is kind of becoming a clip show.

293
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:36,500
 I mentioned before on the show that back in college I used to...

294
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:43,500
 Steady magic. Steady the magical arts, right?

295
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:51,500
 And it's funny because it's one of those things I don't talk about a lot because it is insane.

296
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:59,500
 But it's funny, I'm cribbing it, right? I didn't just study magic, I practiced magic.

297
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:06,500
 And it's funny because I don't tell a lot of people that. I'll talk about ghosts and I'll talk about seeing angels and all sorts of weird stuff.

298
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:13,500
 But when I bring up this, even I know that's a bridge too far and it's funny because we cover magic all the time on this show.

299
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:22,500
 And I always make fun of witches and stuff like that. I really make fun of the witch culture, the way they cast their spells.

300
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:31,500
 But at the end of the day what it is, is you have to believe the spell works or it doesn't.

301
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,500
 And if you doubt it for a second, it doesn't.

302
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:47,500
 And Jason you're thinking, you truly are insane if you believe that you can cast a spell.

303
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,500
 I think Law of Attraction is the magic without the ritual.

304
00:22:51,500 --> 00:23:00,500
 The ritual helps you focus on what you want, not what you want, what you have already.

305
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,500
 You have to believe you already have the success and you're already grateful for getting it.

306
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,500
 You can't believe, you have to work really hard, that's a component of it.

307
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:21,500
 That's something a lot of people forget. They just visualize having the perfect romantic partner and yet they don't work on themselves to make themselves attractive to the ultimate romantic partner.

308
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,500
 Whether that's physical or mental or social, whatever. Like you have to do both.

309
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:33,500
 I want to have a successful podcast. I have to work. I haven't eaten today. I have not eaten today.

310
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,500
 I got off work and came here and I'm recording this.

311
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:43,500
 I'm like Jason you can eat. Law of Attraction does not say you can't eat.

312
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:48,500
 But I'm driven. Meal can wait. Food can wait.

313
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:53,500
 It's interesting because if someone was walking by they would think I was nuts just talking about this.

314
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,500
 And there's a segment of the paranormal community that thinks magic is nuts.

315
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:06,500
 Believes in ghosts, believes in bigfoot and UFO. I really don't think there's a huge crossover between people who believe in aliens and bigfoot and people who believe in magic.

316
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:12,500
 Ghosts and magic I think there's more of a crossover but if you had a Venn diagram of the different conspiracy theories.

317
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:17,500
 I think aliens are so tech based a lot of people go and they have these warp drives and stuff like that.

318
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:22,500
 And there's very science based and people who believe in magic that magic works.

319
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,500
 I think even they would be laughed at by those people right.

320
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,500
 So is that an insane belief that I believe magic works?

321
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:36,500
 The reason why I wanted to bring this up. The reason why I want to bring up this insanity thing.

322
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:45,500
 Now do I actually think I'm insane? No. Do I think that my beliefs of like the law of attraction and believing.

323
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:50,500
 And see believing is not even the word. It's knowing.

324
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:58,500
 I know I'm sitting in a folding chair that I got at Walmart while my microphone is attached to another folding chair.

325
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:07,500
 What I have to know and not doubt for a second that I'm sitting in a $50,000 studio with a Mahogany desk.

326
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:16,500
 Padded seat. You have to picture the seat. You have to picture how the wheels roll when you move.

327
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:26,500
 The smell of the studio. The reflection on the glass door. You have to picture it.

328
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:33,500
 And that's the difference between me and Lil Nas X. He's mastered that.

329
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:40,500
 I'm still an apprentice.

330
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:47,500
 The reason why I'm bringing this up now is that I, because I have a magic background, right?

331
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,500
 Because I have a background in that even though I'm working the law of attraction.

332
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,500
 And one thing Wallace Waddle says which is really interesting. He goes,

333
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,500
 "You are not to make a time of devotion to practice this."

334
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,500
 It's not like you can say, "Well every night before I go to bed I'm going to do this."

335
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,500
 Or, "Once a week I'm going to take an hour out of my day to do this."

336
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:11,500
 He goes, "It must be constant. You must constantly be living in the new reality."

337
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,500
 You're like, "Jayson that sounds incredibly dangerous. You're driving the car."

338
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:19,500
 You're like, "I'm in a self-driving car. I imagine myself in a self-driving Tesla."

339
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,500
 And you're just like kicking back. I mean you obviously like it's not that extreme.

340
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,500
 But he goes, "That's not how this works. You have to believe it constantly."

341
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:33,500
 But because I have a background in magic because that's kind of my original introduction to the law of attraction,

342
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:38,500
 this is so weird. And I think a more insane person, a more paranoid person,

343
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:45,500
 would have thought of this differently. But I had a location here in town that I used

344
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:50,500
 because I walked by it every single day. There was a crossroads.

345
00:26:50,500 --> 00:27:00,500
 Very, very powerful in magic dealings, crossroads. There was a crossroads with an island on it.

346
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,500
 I walked by it all the time. For the past ten years I've walked by this.

347
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,500
 Sometimes on that side of the road, sometimes on the other side of the road.

348
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:14,500
 And I... When I crossed the crossroads and stood on this island,

349
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:24,500
 I felt there was something there. Not good, not evil, just energy.

350
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:31,500
 There. Raw energy. This sounds absolutely insane.

351
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:39,500
 This sounds insane, right? College-educated man walking down the street over an island.

352
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,500
 What are you talking about, Jason? If a homeless man told you what I'm about to tell you,

353
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,500
 you would think he was insane. And you may think I'm insane.

354
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:53,500
 I would walk by this all the time.

355
00:27:53,500 --> 00:28:02,500
 And I decided to start to use this island as a focus point for my law of attraction.

356
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,500
 For the podcast, really. That's my big law of attraction.

357
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,500
 I want as many people as possible to listen to this podcast.

358
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,500
 I think it helps people. I think it entertains people.

359
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,500
 And I would love to do it full time. I've talked about this on the show.

360
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:20,500
 I would love to get to the point where we are traveling across the country or the world,

361
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:25,500
 visiting Hancheeville, talking to people who have experienced these events.

362
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:32,500
 That would be really cool. That is my vision of this show.

363
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:38,500
 So when I would cross this island, I would... See, it's not imaginary, but...

364
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,500
 I would see the show grow.

365
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:47,500
 I could feel it getting stronger.

366
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,500
 And I did that all the time.

367
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:57,500
 Now, I did it when I was at home, too, but I felt that this place was powerful.

368
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:01,500
 Hundred years ago, a church would have been built here.

369
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,500
 That's how I felt.

370
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:07,500
 Old missionaries would have walked by and they would have sensed that power.

371
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:13,500
 Maybe an angel would have guided them to build a location here.

372
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,500
 Maybe even farther back, it was a sacred spot.

373
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:25,500
 This 20-foot by 20-foot piece of land might have been a sacred spot to the natives who lived here.

374
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,500
 Thousands of years ago.

375
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,500
 But now it's part of a road.

376
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,500
 But there's that little island that you can walk on.

377
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:36,500
 And when you step onto that island, it felt powerful.

378
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,500
 And I used it all the time.

379
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,500
 And it worked.

380
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,500
 It worked.

381
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,500
 It's been destroyed.

382
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:52,500
 It's gone now.

383
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:58,500
 It's destroyed. This island is no longer there.

384
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:03,500
 Some construction crew came out and they tore it to pieces.

385
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,500
 And laid in these massive pipes.

386
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,500
 These pipes were bigger than the machinery they were using to put these pipes in.

387
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:18,500
 And the pipes were so big, I thought, "How are these even going to fit underground? What is going on here?"

388
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:22,500
 I mean, you could drive a tractor through this.

389
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:29,500
 I'm like, "Why are they putting such a giant pipe in here? Why are they putting such a giant pipe underground?"

390
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:34,500
 But while I was thinking about the physics of what this giant pipe would do,

391
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,500
 my island was gone. My shrine.

392
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,500
 Even though Wallace Watt will say, "You don't need one."

393
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,500
 I felt like this amplified things.

394
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:49,500
 And it's gone.

395
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:57,500
 The law of attraction is a crazy beast because I think in a way everyone's tried it, even if you didn't know what it was.

396
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,500
 Everyone's wished upon a star. Everyone's fantasized or daydreamed about something else.

397
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:07,500
 The law of attraction is a different beast. It's believing something that doesn't exist yet.

398
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,500
 You have to believe you already have it.

399
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,500
 You have to believe you already have it.

400
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:17,500
 And if you think that you don't, the universe will not provide it for you.

401
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,500
 Because you think that you don't. And so the universe goes, "I guess he doesn't need it."

402
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:26,500
 Then you get a young man like Lil Nas X who, again, put in the hard work.

403
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:36,500
 But also visualize this whole time that he would be past where he is now.

404
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:42,500
 You don't need a shrine. You don't need a location. You don't need a specific time of day to do this in.

405
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,500
 You just need to do it all the time.

406
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,500
 But let's put our conspiracy caps on and wrap it up like this.

407
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:52,500
 Conspiracy caps fully on.

408
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:57,500
 Let's say that I'm right about this.

409
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,500
 Let's say that not only am I right about the law of attraction, which I believe I am,

410
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:07,500
 you could argue the island, right? You go, "Jason, you love walking. It's a pretty scenic part of your walk."

411
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,500
 It's kind of in-between places.

412
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:14,500
 It's a crossroads. You know about how those exist in the paranormal world.

413
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:20,500
 Maybe you're just stepping up there. Maybe just daydreaming and stuff like that.

414
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,500
 Sure, sure, right?

415
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:29,500
 But conspiracy caps fully on. What if I was right?

416
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:36,500
 I had tapped into some place that was powerful.

417
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:40,500
 And that power was seen by others.

418
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:45,500
 This is my big issue about saging houses.

419
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,500
 I believe in ghosts and I believe in saging. You can smudge places.

420
00:32:48,500 --> 00:33:00,500
 But when you put a protection spell on something, you're basically letting the paranormal world, there's someone in there, worth getting at.

421
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:05,500
 You know what I mean? People have those little signs on their lawn saying we are protected by security.

422
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:13,500
 That lets me know that you have stuff in there that is worth securing.

423
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:24,500
 And so let's conspiracy cap fully on. I'm going there and I'm doing this, believing, doing the law of attraction thing in this spot.

424
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:33,500
 I'm focusing all my mental energy while I'm in this spot and over years it's building up and other forces see this.

425
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:39,500
 They're detecting all this emotional energy in what is otherwise an intersection.

426
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,500
 It's open to the public. So they destroyed it.

427
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:50,500
 Who is they? I don't know. Again, conspiracy caps fully on, but they destroy it.

428
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:55,500
 And I'm so curious about what those pipes are underneath.

429
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:03,500
 I mean, these are some of the biggest pipes I've ever seen in my life.

430
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:10,500
 What if it is a place of power?

431
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,500
 But people can't just do rituals. People can't do rituals in the middle of the road.

432
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:20,500
 So just like how you would build aqueducts to move water from one place to another.

433
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:28,500
 Just how you would create life in Southern California by diverting all these rivers and damming all of these lakes.

434
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:35,500
 So you can move water into Los Angeles and build a city where there shouldn't be one.

435
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:43,500
 What if they're doing the same thing with that raw power that I just stumbled upon?

436
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:48,500
 Some dumb kid throwing up images to the universe.

437
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:57,500
 And I'm standing on what could only be really classified as a stonehenge level location.

438
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:06,500
 And I'm lighting up the grid. And there are darker forces that have now located it.

439
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:12,500
 And they're funneling that energy to them.

440
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:18,500
 The beautiful thing about the conspiracy cap is we can say things that sound insane.

441
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:26,500
 Right? We're just kind of proposing this would be an interesting way to wrap up the mystery.

442
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:43,500
 But when you're dealing with the paranormal, there's such a thin, thin line between insanity and the secrets of the universe.

443
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,500
