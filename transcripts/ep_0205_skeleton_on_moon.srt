1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Three men faced decades in prison for crimes against nature.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 And then we take a look at an interesting story from the conspiracy theory iceberg.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Is it possible when Apollo 11 landed on the moon,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 someone had been there before,

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 and left a human skeleton today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 I'm a walking doll.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. This episode is coming out quite late.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I was trying a little bit of a different recording schedule since I'd come back from the break.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Obviously it's not working. This episode is coming out late.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 But today you're going to get two episodes. This technically is the Thursday episode,

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 and then later tonight you'll be able to download the Friday episode.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Apologize for that. Just a little bit of glitch in the system.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 I'm just trying to do a little work around, but it didn't work.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 That's just the part of it. Also, I think you can tell that I'm a little under the weather.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 But that didn't have anything to do with the delay. I was just trying to figure out something else.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 I'm recording it in the morning. I'm recording this in the morning.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 I actually have my sunglasses on because the sunlight is coming through my window.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 I feel kind of dope. I feel like an old 1970s radio DJ wearing sunglasses indoors.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Wearing sunglasses indoors is a lost art.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 It's probably lost because everyone who did it bumped into stuff fell down and died.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 So let's go ahead and get started with our first story. Our first story popped out here.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 It was really bizarre because I've never researched bestiality or bestiality laws.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 It's nothing that I've ever had to come across.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 I've had to research stuff like vandalism laws and be like, "Is what I'm doing like...

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 "If I go out and bash up someone's car hypothetically speaking, is that a felony or a misdemeanor?"

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Oh, is it just a misdemeanor? Okay. I've had to research stuff like that.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 And here's a pro tip if you want to be like a vandal. Never set anything on fire.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Never ever ever set anything on fire. Because if you go out and you smash up a car,

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 you smash it up real good with your bat, cops are going to be like, "Well, that sucks."

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 But if you go and you smash a car up with your bat and then throw some gasoline in it

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 and light it to really stick it to the dude who burns you on that weed deal,

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 people actually, it's so funny, that's such a dated reference to people still,

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 I guess in other countries and other states they still do drug, like still sell weed.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 But anyways, you throw some gasoline in there, throw in a match,

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 you will have a dedicated arson investigator looking for you.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Never set anything on fire. These are laws that I've had to research throughout my life.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 But I never had a research bcality loss. I never thought, "What's the penalty if I bang this dog?"

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 It's not an interest to me. And I guess I should say now this episode is not safe for work,

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 I guess this beginning part is. So, yeah.

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 What happened was this new story popped up the other day and it really caught me off guard

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 because I was like, "Really? That's the penalty for it? Ugh."

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 That's, that's, I mean, it, okay, so let's go ahead and get, again, I was shocked.

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Let's go ahead and get started with the story. This story starts like a fairy tale.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Once upon a time on a street called Mouse Lane in Munson, Pennsylvania,

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 there was a little farm. True story, by the way. I guess I should say it starts like a fairy tale,

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 but it's quite true. Just ended in the court system.

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 And on this makeshift farm were three men, Terry Wallace, Matthew Brubaker, and Mark Meskenoff.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Matthew was 33, Mark was 35, and Terry was 41, and those, and those ages will play in later, but

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 they're, they're, they should know better. They should definitely know better.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 But anyway, so they're, you know, in their 30s, 40s.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 But these three men found each other on Facebook where all great relationships are made,

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 and they had a dream. They saw that movie with Matt Damon called "We Bought a Zoo"

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 and they're like, "Hmm, that's, that was such a sexy, sexy movie."

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 But they can't buy a zoo, but they can build a farm.

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 So on this farm, they had nine female horses, female horses, don't, don't, they're not one of them gays.

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Nine female horses, a few dogs, they don't say the gender of that, so they could have been like a little experimental,

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 a cow, a goat, and a triangle shaped stall.

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 And what these three men would do is they would take the animals into the stall and have sex with them.

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 I don't need to get a graphic, just having sex with them. Not just having sex with them, it's gross, but they weren't like,

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 "Okay, so anyways, so, so I'm reading this article, these guys just pled guilty, they just got sentenced to the, to the, for these crimes."

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 And you're thinking, "Okay, nine, you're trying to do the math in your head, you're like, okay, nine horses, you know,

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 that's a couple counts, and then they got a dog and a goat, like, where are they being in a mall, we don't know.

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Who turned who, like, how did they figure this out? Was it some sort of internet thing?"

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 They all got minimum 20 year sentences and a maximum 40 year sentence.

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 So at the very least, the dude who's 33, which was Matthew, the very least he gets out when he's 53.

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Can you imagine just shaving 20 years right off your life?

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 I know a lot of my audience is younger than me, and imagine just going, "Shh!" and just taking 20.

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 It's funny because when I think about that, because I'm older, I go, "That would be like if I got arrested when I was 22 for something,

71
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 and I just got out today." Like, all of those experiences gone.

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 That's when you get older, when you're 18, you can't be like, "Well, if I didn't exist, like, when you're older, you can say, hey, like,

73
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 that would be like, if I got arrested while I was in college, and I just got out today.

74
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Everyone I met and everything I did and everything like that would just get wiped from existence."

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Oh, speaking of which, my little brother, I've talked about this quite a lot. He lives in China.

76
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 He saw Avengers Endgame. No spoilers.

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 But I probably won't go see it opening weekend. I may not even see it opening week.

78
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 So, yeah. That was basically my little brother's review. Quite odd.

79
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 He had a lot of odd things to say about it, but anyways, I'll leave it at that.

80
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 So, anyways, where was I? Oh yeah, bestiality.

81
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Anyways, so 20 to 40 years. Now, there's a lot of other really bizarre details with this.

82
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Now, the reason why their sentences were so high wasn't necessarily because of the animal sex.

83
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Now, they did get charged with like 1,400 counts of being in these animals.

84
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 It wasn't just a wild weekend. It was an ongoing thing. But still, that wasn't what put them until those almost life sentences.

85
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 What happened, what was really their fatal mistake was they involved a teenage boy to...

86
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 They didn't bang the boy. And the boy wasn't banging the animals.

87
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 But for whatever reason, they got a teenage boy to hold the animal still while they banged them.

88
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 So that was their big... Like, they got felony charges, like multiple felony charges for corruption of a minor.

89
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 For endangering the welfare of a minor. That's what really did them over.

90
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Because when the articles are basically saying these guys got sentenced to 20 years for sex with animals,

91
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 and I was like, I did not know the penalty could be that high for that.

92
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Even with the amount of animals, I didn't think it could be that high.

93
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 And then as you read the article, that's the clickbait.

94
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 But as you're reading the articles and you're laughing at these guys, these guys are hilarious.

95
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 They're Facebook pages. They're showing like, there's this website.

96
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 They're showing photos from their Instagram profile and their Facebook pages.

97
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 They're just pictures of horses. Pictures that you would see like an 11 year old girl put up on her Facebook page.

98
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Because they're these beautiful horses. And then you think this gross dude was looking at this and being like, oh yeah.

99
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 This is my swimsuit calendar. And one of the guys for his birthday, you know, on Facebook, you can do that.

100
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 I selected a donation. His donation was for a horse rescue sanctuary.

101
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 He's like, I love horses. And I hope everyone's able to donate money to these horses.

102
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 We'll get into that in a second because that's a whole other different issue of this.

103
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 But the kid, the teenager goes to the cops and is like, super grossed out.

104
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 And he's like, listen, man, I've had one hell of a weekend.

105
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 You won't believe what's going on at Mouse Lane.

106
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 And the cops are like, what's going on? Kid tells him everything.

107
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Now the kid's able to not only just say this is what's happening, but he also says they have everything on video.

108
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Everything on video.

109
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Now what's weird is that they did have, they had thousands of videos of them banging these animals.

110
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 And what's bizarre is they never said if they were showing them online, but if they're not like selling them,

111
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 which it didn't seem to be a financial thing, what were they doing with them?

112
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 I don't think I've never been in a situation where I've been having sex while one of my male friends is having sex in the same room.

113
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 And I've never done that.

114
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Like it's like a group thing or whatever. I've never done that.

115
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 But that would be awkward.

116
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 But I think almost, that would be awkward, but almost just as awkward would be watching porn of my buddy banging a chick.

117
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 And what would be 10 times more awkward than that would be watching my buddy banging an animal.

118
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Like what were these videos for if they weren't selling them?

119
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 They were just videotaping thousands of videos of them taking turns banging these animals.

120
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 You're basically just creating an evidence trail at this point.

121
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 So I don't know what that stuff was for.

122
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 But they're arrested 20 to 40 years in prison.

123
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 The kid's fine. The kid's fine.

124
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 So I saw that story. I laughed really, really hard the whole time I was reading it.

125
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 I was thinking, I was also just thinking, these guys throwing their life away.

126
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 For what? For making a thousand porn videos of them banging animals.

127
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Like, you know, what really was the end result?

128
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 And then I realized, I was doing more research on this, against my will almost at this point,

129
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 that bestiality for the longest time in history was death.

130
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 It was just death.

131
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 And like Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, you got killed and the animal got killed,

132
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 which you may think is horrible, but no one wants to eat that animal.

133
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 If a dude's banging a lamb, I'm not eating lamb.

134
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Like, it was just, maybe it was just the thing to put him out of its mercy,

135
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 or maybe it was just because it was unclean.

136
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 But anyways, for the longest time it was definitely.

137
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 And as the world started to become like more quote unquote enlightened,

138
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 they're like, "Ah, we don't need to kill people for banging animals," which is an overreaction.

139
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 But they decided to basically start not necessarily,

140
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 a lot of states and a lot of countries in the West started making it not illegal explicitly.

141
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Like, they would wrap it into animal abuse laws, or they would wrap it into just general sex laws.

142
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 There was no actual provisions saying bestiality was against law.

143
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 And you had a rise in bestiality.

144
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 People were like, "Oh, I can do this now?"

145
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 And I think it was in Denmark.

146
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 They basically made it legal.

147
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 And you had huge porn companies set up over there and farms built

148
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 where you could fly out to Denmark, bang a couple cows, go back home, run a business meeting,

149
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 probably work for Dunkin Donuts, or a chocolate milk company,

150
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 and you just really, really love those cows.

151
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 I don't know why Dunkin Donuts, the whole, maybe, I don't know.

152
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 But anyways, the point being is that it was legal,

153
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 and I don't know if it's still in Denmark now.

154
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 I think it is.

155
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 But Oregon had a recently repass, recriminalize bestiality, and it happened in 2013.

156
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 So they tried being like, "Ah, whatever people do in the comfort of their own barn is their own business,"

157
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 but it just was people were banging animals all the time.

158
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 They did a study, the Kinsey group, and that study's been kind of diminished,

159
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 and they did a study that involved mostly prisoners, and they said between 8% and 4--

160
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 between 8% of men and 4% of women have banged an animal.

161
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 And then later in 1974, the Kinsey study was like in the 40s, in 1974, they did another study,

162
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 outside of prison, said, "Do you want to bang out or do you bang animals?"

163
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 And the numbers were halved. They're still quite high.

164
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 4% of men and 2% of women have had sex with an animal.

165
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 So it's not, I mean, you figure that's not a high percentage,

166
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 but when you're talking about 7 billion people, and really that study was in America only,

167
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 so what, 350 million people, it's a sizable amount.

168
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 But of course, of course, of course, we live in a world where there is a group called Zeta.

169
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 It's the Zua files for the ethical treatment of animals.

170
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 Now these-- so these dudes, Zeta, believe that you can have sex with an animal

171
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 and still treat them right. You can still treat your lady right.

172
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 They actually are very, very vocal in that sense. It's a group that's based out of Germany.

173
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 They actually had a big march down the street, which was not a march.

174
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 I would stay at home just to make sure I wasn't confused with a Zeta member that day.

175
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 I would just be like, "Oh, you can just drink water today.

176
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 I don't have to go out and get any drinks. I'll just sit here."

177
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 They want you to know this. I went to Zeta's website. They want you to know this.

178
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 Female mammals-- this is why I think they're all dudes.

179
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Female mammals, did you know they're built for sex?

180
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Female mammals love sex. That's what keeps the species going.

181
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 It doesn't matter that the sex is coming from a different species.

182
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 They love sex. They were built for it.

183
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Which, when I read that, I thought,

184
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 "But I'm sure some people are like banging lizards and stuff, getting blowjobs from snakes.

185
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 I'm sure that you could say, 'Yes, female mammals technically are built to enjoy it.'

186
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 But have you ever heard two cats have sex? Doesn't sound enjoyable."

187
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 Also, they said, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. You say that I'm abusing animals because I'm having sex with them, but you.

188
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 Jason, you don't understand. They can have sex with you instead.

189
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 And you can be the receptive partner. And they, of course, would enjoy that."

190
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Now, the thing is, is like, yeah, I guess they would.

191
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 But you can groom anybody to enjoy anything.

192
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Yes, a dog will probably bang you if you're walking out to get the newspaper,

193
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 and you trip on the ground and your bathrobe flies open. A dog may have sex with you. Yes.

194
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 But that doesn't necessarily mean you go, "Hmm."

195
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 And then every day you just keep tripping. Like, you can get accidentally raped by a dog and then not go.

196
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 "Well, he liked it, so it's okay if I keep engaging in this behavior."

197
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Just like anybody, just like any adult that you're taking advantage of.

198
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 And this was probably the-- there's two gross facts coming up here.

199
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 So sorry, guys. One, they said, "Hey, man, listen, I know if I'm banging an animal, it could be considered cruel, right?

200
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 What if I let the animal bang me?" And you may go, "Well..."

201
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 And then they go, "Or I can master-- I could jack it off, right?

202
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Because that's what, like, trainers do. They'll masturbate the cows and stuff like that."

203
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 I guess, I'm assuming, so I haven't really verified this, but they'll, like, jack off horses to calm them down.

204
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 So professionals do that. At least I can do that. I'm semi-pro, and you're like, "I guess I might have to research that a little more."

205
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 Or I could just-- this is so--

206
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 Or this is on Zeta's website. Or I could just go down on him.

207
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 I could just go down on him. There's nothing but pleasure for both of them.

208
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Now, I cannot think of anything more disgusting than eating out a female horse. That sounds like the grossest or cow that is so--

209
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 That is so-- That's one of the grossest visuals I can think of right now.

210
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 But, yeah. I mean, if you're-- if you have the stomach for it, ugh.

211
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 But then I found out this additional detail, we're gonna end this story like this.

212
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 There was an article on a website called Broadly that was trying to find a female--

213
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 A female who loved banging animals, because they're out there.

214
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 And there's this one woman talking about how she loved-- how she loved pig semen on her face, because it, like, helped with her acne.

215
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 And, fun fact, again, to close this out before you go and eat your yolk-play yogurt,

216
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 or get another scoop of that soft-serve ice cream, apparently,

217
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 again, this is something I would have never known about, ever.

218
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Pig semen is so thick and clots so quickly that if you give a pig a blow job, you will suffocate and die.

219
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 But I'm sure it's a good source of probiotics, and I imagine it tastes like Oikos yogurt.

220
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 So if you're eating any of those products today, those products are sponsored by Dead Rabbit Radio.

221
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story here. It's so gross. So gross.

222
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Okay, our next story here is straight from the conspiracy theory iceberg.

223
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 Very, very simple story, but the ramifications of it are moon-shattering.

224
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 It's 2015. We're in Beijing, small city, small little town somewhere in China.

225
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 Don't know if you've ever heard of it. But anyways, we're in Beijing.

226
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Actually, my little brother lives in China. He just saw him finish war and now I'm just joking.

227
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 Okay, so we're in Beijing, bustling metropolis, and even though everyone's running around doing all their Beijing stuff,

228
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 in the center of the city, there is a press conference being given by a man on a mission,

229
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 a man who has the answers to everything.

230
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 His name is Dr. Kang Mao Peng. He's a Chinese astrophysicist.

231
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 He walks up to the lectern, adjusts the mic a little, looks out of the crowd in front of him and says,

232
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 "The Americans have conspired in a cover-up of monumental and possibly even criminal proportions.

233
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 They hid photos of bare human footprints on the moon for 20 years."

234
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Audience gasping, and, and, don't gasp yet, don't gasp yet, and,

235
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 manage to keep the human skeleton secret even longer.

236
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 The implications of what they found up there are staggering.

237
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 Everyone's like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

238
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 The astronauts themselves had not seen, I wonder if they'd gotten a fistfight up there. If I was in a zero gravity atmosphere for the first time, I would wrestle a guy.

239
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 Like, maybe they did that off-camera. Like, wouldn't you try to wrestle someone? Wouldn't you pick up another astronaut and see how far you can throw him?

240
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 You can't tell me they didn't do that. Everything else we've seen, they're like plain golf or something like that,

241
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 but dude, are you telling me that if we went to the moon, you would not try to pick me up and throw me as far as you could?

242
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 I don't believe they, they didn't do that. Golf, whatever dude.

243
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Anyways, so as the astronauts were tossing each other back and forth off-camera, this little camera's taking these pictures.

244
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 They come back to Earth, and then Mission Control's like, "Hey, uh, hey guys, why do you have all those bruises on you? They're like a bumpy re-entry."

245
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 But anyways, so they get back to Earth, and as scientists are going through the photographs, they find photographs of bare human footprints on the moon and a human skeleton.

246
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Now this human skeleton appears to be broken or dismembered in a way that it looks like it was possibly dissected or chopped in half while it still had flesh on.

247
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 But the scientists were looking at these photos and they can't figure it out because a human body wouldn't decay like that on the moon.

248
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 First off, they're shocked that there's a human skeleton on the moon and bare footprints, but secondly, they're thinking,

249
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 "How would a human body decay like this on the moon? There's no, like, microbes to eat away all the flesh. It should definitely be, like, more stuff to it."

250
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 And as they're looking through the photos, they notice something even more odd. It's wearing a pair of blue jeans.

251
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 Still wearing a pair of Levi's on the moon.

252
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 Now at this point in the story, you should think, "This story's ridiculous. This story is 100% made up."

253
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 But what's funny is that there's a lot of information. There's a lot, I shouldn't say a lot of information.

254
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 There's a lot of websites about this story because it's very, very evocative.

255
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 I had no trouble finding websites about the skeleton on the moon. It's all over the place. It's on the conspiracy theory iceberg.

256
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 People want to know about the skeleton on the moon.

257
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 And one intrepid journalist or a dude on Quora, on that website Quora, which I have a love-hate relationship with, did a lot of digging for me.

258
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Like, they actually, like, I found his article quite easily.

259
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 It wasn't super well-hidden, but a lot of people are missing this because a lot of people are still asking about the skeleton on the moon.

260
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 And he goes in and he's like, "Yeah, I probably don't think it happened, but..."

261
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 And then he did an update. He goes, "You know what? This was kind of bugging me, so I tried to find a little more information."

262
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 "Dr. K. Mao Peng..." And again, I'm getting this from this article, so Kudos goes to him, but I did verify his info.

263
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 "Dr. K..." So it's kind of like I did it right? I just followed his footsteps.

264
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 "Dr. K. Mao Peng, Chinese astrophysicist, is quoted in a newspaper giving this presentation."

265
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 That newspaper is the Weekly World News. That is the only reference to this astrophysicist.

266
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 The only reference to him giving a conference, talking about footprints on the moon, talking about skeleton on the moon.

267
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 It only appeared in the Weekly World News. If you don't know what the Weekly World News is, it's my favorite, or was my favorite, tabloid.

268
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 It was stories like Batboy found in Cave, Gateway to Hell opened up on Earth, all sorts of stuff. It was basically like the National Enquirer on steroids.

269
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 I mean, it's just kind of like a well-known tabloid. It's out of print now, but they were a tabloid that almost always did completely fictional things.

270
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 I always wanted to write for them, too. I thought that would be so much fun just making stuff up all the time.

271
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 You're like, "Great, just now I'm supposed to believe you when you do this podcast." It's basically a collection of short stories in journalist form.

272
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 So he doesn't exist. There may be a guy, I'm pretty sure there's a guy named K. Mao Peng. I'm sure statistically that guy exists.

273
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 But as far as being a doctor who's also a Chinese astrophysicist who also gave this, there's no proof of it.

274
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 The only mention of him online is this article in the Weekly World News. You could say maybe he did exist and the government killed him, but again, it's in the Weekly World News.

275
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 It's not if he was reported in some India Times or it was in some other kind of major reputable newspaper, like LA Times, whatever, anything with Times in it.

276
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 And then he disappeared? I could go with that, but the only time he's ever been referenced, the only time we have any knowledge of him is in the Weekly World News and people still are looking up info on the story.

277
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 I looked it up. I mean, I obviously was thinking, well, there's obviously, there was never a skeleton on the moon, but I thought maybe there was like a cosmonaut.

278
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Maybe they did find, like, Russia launched someone up there, but Blue Genes. I didn't have Blue Gene technology in Russia back then.

279
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 So it's interesting because it is a modern myth and it's easily found. It's easily found what the answer is. But if you just look at the first two results on Google, you're like, whoa, this is so crazy, who's this doctor?

280
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 You go down a result to the Cora article and even his, his first half is like, yeah, it's a weird story. And then the second half, the update is like, oh yeah, I found out. It's fake.

00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 But people are still looking for this. People think that the government took him out. People think that the doctor is in hiding or is paid off or dead or whatever, stuff like that.

282
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 But it's totally not true. But there's one last aspect to look at this with is that if you were trying to cover up the truth, if there was a secret that you know would eventually get out, there's no stopping it getting out.

283
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 It's just too big. Your best bet is to make it a mockery, is to put it into the National Enquirer, is to put it into the weekly world news.

284
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 So if someday some scientist comes running out of NASA, pulling his hair out, amazed at this discovery, horrified at the secrets that the government could keep from the world and tries to expose the plan,

285
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 the cover up will just be, pfft, skeleton on the moon. That was in the weekly world news. We know that was fake. That doctor never existed. Neither did the photographs.

286
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Anything you see is a complete fabrication based on an old article. The only people who would know the truth would be the government and the whistleblower.

287
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 Whistleblowers have very short lives. Governments can last as long as their secrets.
