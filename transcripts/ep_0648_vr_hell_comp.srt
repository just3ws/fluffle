00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
 When a mysterious true crime story appears online, people find it mildly interesting

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,960
 until they begin to look into the author who posted it.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,760
 And then we take a look at a virtual reality game that allows you to go into the fictional world of Twin Peaks.

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,740
 Seems quite benign unless you've watched that show and know how terrifying it is.

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:27,600
 But could this game actually be a harbinger for the terrifying future of virtual reality today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,600
 *Dead Rabbit Radio plays*

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,600
 *Dead Rabbit Radio plays*

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,600
 *Dead Rabbit Radio plays*

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,600
 *Dead Rabbit Radio plays*

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,600
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,600
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. Broadcast live from the haunted closet.

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,600
 I'm gonna start adding that to the intro of each episode as well.

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,600
 *Dead Rabbit Radio plays*

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,600
 And flying into Dead Rabbit Command right now on a paper airplane.

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
 I don't know why I'm starting making you guys so tiny.

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,600
 Maybe it's some weird fetish. Maybe I have like a miniaturized little's fetish.

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,600
 I want everyone to be an inch tall.

18
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,600
 Flying in on a paper airplane. It's orangutan banana.

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,600
 Everyone give a round of applause to orangutan banana.

20
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,600
 orangutan banana. I wish I could pronounce that right. At least I'm getting the banana part right.

21
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,600
 Is a Patreon supporter and is the person who set up the Dead Rabbit Radio subreddit.

22
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,600
 And this is the example of what I'm talking about getting the word out.

23
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,600
 This guy set up the subreddit spreading the word of Dead Rabbit Radio.

24
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:34,600
 If you guys can't support the Patreon or if you are not part of my miniaturization fetish, that's fine too.

25
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,600
 It's preferable. The second thing that you're not just helps read the word about the show really really really helps out a lot.

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,600
 It helps the show grow.

27
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,600
 A orangutan banana is now normal size, but it's still an orangutan.

28
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,600
 So he's like what four feet tall eating bananas.

29
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,600
 Orangutan, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the hair hang glider.

30
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,600
 We are going to fly. We're going to grab onto your furry little ankles.

31
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,600
 And we are going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command. We are headed out to China.

32
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,600
 [Exhales]

33
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,600
 Going over the high seas.

34
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,600
 So we get to China. Specifically we're in Jiangsu.

35
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,600
 That's in the Nanjing province in China.

36
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,600
 It's January 10th 1996.

37
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,600
 We're walking along the streets kind of hanging out.

38
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,600
 And we see a newspaper. It's like floating down the wind all dramatically and stuff.

39
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,600
 And we grab it. All of us grab it at the same time. We're reading it.

40
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,600
 The headline says college freshman missing.

41
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,600
 Not found yet. Says cop. This is one cop with pictures.

42
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,600
 It's a cop shrugging his shoulders. He's like I don't know where she's at.

43
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,600
 Dio Aichang is a college freshman from the Nanjing University.

44
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,600
 She goes missing. And the cops don't know where she's at.

45
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,600
 That's what the headline says.

46
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,600
 Now 10 days later this woman is walking down the street.

47
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,600
 She sees a little plastic bag sitting on the side of the road.

48
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,600
 And she goes I don't know what's in that. I'll take it home and figure it out.

49
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,600
 So she takes the bag and she takes it home.

50
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,600
 Now I don't know if this was like right outside of her house.

51
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,600
 So it's just like first nobody does that.

52
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,600
 I check bags when I'm walking on the street because I'm always assuming there's going to be like

53
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,600
 I don't know like a magic ring in it or money. Money is more realistic.

54
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,600
 It's something fun. But I've never like found a mystery bag and like golly.

55
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,600
 Can't wait to get this home. But I got a bunch of chores doing and I'm carrying around a bunch of cocaine

56
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,600
 that fell out of some drug dealers pocket. I'm like at Taco Bell.

57
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,600
 I'm like two tacos please. As like canines are coming up behind me.

58
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,600
 You check it there. But anyway she doesn't. She takes it home.

59
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,600
 She opens it up and she goes hmm this is interesting.

60
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,600
 It's chopped pork meat. That's weird. Right.

61
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,600
 I probably found that outside. I totally could figure that before I brought mystery meat into my house.

62
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,600
 She's looking at this sack of meat. I want you to remember these details too.

63
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,600
 Because this is a very this is a story that I'll probably forget to go back on the details.

64
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
 But you'll probably have questions about it.

65
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,600
 She's looking at this bag of chopped meat and then she looks a little bit closer and inside it

66
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,600
 she finds a human finger across town.

67
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,600
 It's like garbage day. Everyone's garbage is sitting out and some guy walks out and he sees some garbage

68
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,600
 sitting in a bag on the street and he goes hmm interesting.

69
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,600
 And he's smart. He opens it up right there and he goes gazzooks.

70
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,600
 He doesn't take it home. He realizes that this even if it is chopped pork meat it's pretty disgusting.

71
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,600
 But people start calling the cops because they start finding these bags of mystery meat all over town in all.

72
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:37,600
 When the police take all of these bags it equals up to two thousand pieces of meat one finger.

73
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,600
 And they all came from a person the same person and they're all cooked.

74
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:50,600
 It was like chopped up. They kept saying they were stacked like sushi in these bags just like little cubes.

75
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,600
 I know sushi circle but you know how they're stacked up little cubes.

76
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,600
 And when you collected all the bags it was the most grim version of Pokemon ever.

77
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,600
 When you collected them all together you could reassemble a human body.

78
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,600
 And that's what they did. They were able to reassemble the body of Dai Aichang in this fashion.

79
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:15,600
 Now you go Jason. You're cracking a bunch of jokes which is uncharacteristic for you for a true crime story.

80
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,600
 And that's true. Usually like all crack jokes and then I'll stop when it gets super serious and gross.

81
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,600
 You continue to crack jokes during this one. What is different about this story?

82
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,600
 Well the story itself as I told it parts of it seem to be true.

83
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:39,600
 We do know that a young woman went missing apparently in this time period and there is a photograph of this woman reassembled.

84
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,600
 I did not look at the photograph. I didn't want to go looking for the photograph.

85
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,600
 But apparently there is a photograph of these cubes.

86
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:53,600
 They reformed the human. Supposedly this picture is of her but in cube form.

87
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,600
 To the point that two friends of hers went into the autopsy room and one of them threw up.

88
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
 The other one recognized her.

89
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:06,600
 I came across this story months ago and I saw it and I put it in my bookmarks like "Normally do I go?"

90
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,600
 That's gruesome. That's an interesting story.

91
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,600
 Young woman goes missing, gets chopped up.

92
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,600
 And I remember reading the post and here's a quote from it.

93
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,600
 And this is where we start to get into the really bizarre stuff.

94
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,600
 Here's a quote from the Reddit post involving this story.

95
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,600
 "According to..." She said...

96
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,600
 The person who wrote this Reddit post will get into her name in a second but she said...

97
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
 "She heard about this story on a podcast."

98
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,600
 So just like this you've heard me tell this story on a podcast.

99
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,600
 This is her quote.

100
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:43,600
 "According to what I can recollect in the podcast, they said the murderer was most likely either a doctor, a cop or a medical scientist."

101
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:50,600
 No ordinary human has the ability to carry out such an intricate level of dismemberment under the extreme duress of killing another human being.

102
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,600
 The murderer has extraordinary psychological stability.

103
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,600
 All the flesh was meticulously severed, cooked and neatly stacked like sushi platters.

104
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:05,600
 He must have a competent knowledge of human anatomy and possibly has experienced dissecting human corpses.

105
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:15,600
 "If you heard a podcast and you go, 'From what I recollect and then have a word for word quote something's wrong.'"

106
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,600
 You would say, "Oh, I listen to that podcast all the time. Actually, I transcribe."

107
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:24,600
 You want to go, "Hmm, yes, if I remember correctly it said quote and then you go word for word."

108
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,600
 And all of that stuff meticulously severed, cooked and neatly stacked like sushi platters.

109
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,600
 You must have a competent knowledge.

110
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,600
 That doesn't jive right there.

111
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:41,600
 Odd detail and I thought, "That's interesting. How do you just go off the top of my head, remember this super detailed quote?"

112
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:48,600
 But I read so much stuff and I have this structure for research because I don't have time to research everything.

113
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:55,600
 There's a lot of stuff I come across and I go, "I might cover that someday, but I don't have time to research it this week or this month or whatever."

114
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,600
 So I put it in my bookmarks folder.

115
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:03,600
 This story stuck in my head for months, even though I was covering all this different stuff.

116
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,600
 But when I go back to the Reddit post, it was deleted.

117
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,600
 The person had deleted it, they closed their account, everything.

118
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:17,600
 Damn it, I've learned my lesson. I've started archiving stuff, Reddit post especially, but that happened with yesterday's story as well.

119
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,600
 I was discouraged. I was like, "Dang it, I really want to cover that story."

120
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:27,600
 And then I started looking at the comments because sometimes stuff gets deleted, but the person will say,

121
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:34,600
 "Hey, I moved it to another subreddit or something like that." I started looking through the comments and then things got even weirder.

122
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,600
 All over the comments, people were saying, "You sicko." Not to me, not to me.

123
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,600
 They're like, "Jason, I know you're eating this, you pervert."

124
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,600
 No, they're like, "You sicko. I can't believe that you would post this story."

125
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,600
 And other people are like, "Yeah, this is so gross. This gross anti-Asian fetish."

126
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,600
 And I was like, "What in the world?" I had read the post months ago, I didn't pick up any of that stuff, I thought it was a little suspicious.

127
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,600
 But people started talking about the user's blog.

128
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:08,600
 "We found your blog and blah blah blah. You're some disgusting, racist, misogynist, pervert."

129
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,600
 So I go, "I need to find this blog." I need to find this.

130
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,600
 Now luckily, this page automatically got archived.

131
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,600
 Let's take a look at the blog of Jennifer Suzuki.

132
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:32,600
 "A-ring-ting banana, let's digitize the Jason Jalopy. We're gonna drive into the internet to take a look at the blog of the Reddit user."

133
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:38,600
 The Reddit user's name that she goes by at least online. I don't know if it's really her name. I don't know if it's really a woman.

134
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,600
 There's a whole bunch of rabbit holes down this one.

135
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:49,600
 Let's digitize the Jason Jalopy. We're headed to the website of Jennifer Suzuki, inferiorasian.com.

136
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,600
 We have to drive past a bunch of other gross websites to get there. Just don't look out the side.

137
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,600
 Keep your hands inside the vehicle at all times. It's super gross, inferiorasian.com.

138
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,600
 Now Jennifer Suzuki, we're going to just have to assume a couple things about her.

139
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:13,600
 She says that she's half-white, her father was a US military man, and half-Japanese. I believe that she actually says that she's half-Japanese.

140
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:22,600
 She hates Asians. Maybe that's not fair. I mean, you have a website called inferiorasian.com.

141
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:30,600
 I would say she hates Asians, but specifically she seems to have a sexual fetish towards Asian women being abused by Caucasian men.

142
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:38,600
 She seems to be her main fetish. I spent more time than I ever could have wanted to on this website looking around at stuff.

143
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,600
 She talks trash about Asian men, but they're kind of invisible in her narratives.

144
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,600
 And what she does is she has a collection of true crime. She has a couple true crime stories.

145
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:54,600
 Then she'll have like weird, really poorly written erotica, but super gory.

146
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:01,600
 And I would even hate to use the term erotica because it's not erotic. Christian Grey would be like, "That's super gross."

147
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,600
 Christian Grey would be like, "Ugh, throwing up. You've gone too far. Really gross stuff."

148
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,600
 Let's look at some of the categories. Well, it's inferiorasian.com's the website.

149
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,600
 The tagline is "Submissive East Asian Woman's Dreams and Fantasies."

150
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:22,600
 She's like, "Jason, it's just her dreams and fantasies. You're defending her. You're going to have to be the straw man."

151
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,600
 You're like, "No, Jason, no, don't make me be the straw man."

152
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,600
 Here, this other person who's walking by will be the straw man.

153
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,600
 He's like, "But dude, it's just her dreams and fantasies."

154
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:39,600
 Sure, you can say that. But let's go into the stuff and at a certain point, your dreams and fantasies, could they be causing real world harm?

155
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,600
 That's kind of the thing. And I don't want to get all moral majority on this thing, but just kind of keep that in the back of your head.

156
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,600
 These are the categories of her website. We have a good Asian wife.

157
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,600
 You're like, "See, Jason, she likes to be a good Asian wife." Abused Asian wife is the next one.

158
00:11:52,600 --> 00:12:00,600
 Asian office lady, Kelly Wong. I really hope I looked into these ones, and it seemed to just be erotica about a woman named Kelly Wong.

159
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,600
 Asian real estate agent, Stephanie Kwan. It doesn't say "good Asian wife" when you give a name.

160
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,600
 I'm really, really suspicious that these are real people.

161
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,600
 And then, true crimes. She has a couple articles like true crimes.

162
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:19,600
 She finds articles about women in real life who have been brutalized and tells them in a way that it's supposed to turn you on.

163
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:27,600
 That's where the dreams and the fantasies keep that in the bedroom if you want to...it's so gross, but if you want to fantasize about being a beauty...

164
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,600
 And again, we're not talking like Christian Grey. We're not talking like, "Ooh, velvet cuffs."

165
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,600
 I'm like, "I got this guy, this little whip from Adam and Eve."

166
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,600
 These women are being murdered and turned into slices of meat.

167
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,600
 She has multiple stories about that, by the way. It's not just the one.

168
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,600
 Would you like a sample of one of her writings?

169
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:52,600
 "Blood splattered and flowed, as if her red nail polish became amoebas and multiplied."

170
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:58,600
 Nothing says "sexy like amoebas," right? I mean, nothing says "sexy like blood" either, but even if you have a blood fetish,

171
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,600
 I don't think you'd be like, "Oh, yeah, look at those delicious one-celled organisms. Oh, tell me more."

172
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:10,600
 Then he said, "From now on, you are my slave. You are to be naked. To serve me."

173
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,600
 "And if you try to escape, I will dismember you."

174
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,600
 "Cut you into five pieces." You didn't have to. If I'm tied up to a chair and someone's like,

175
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,600
 "I'm gonna dismember you, I will cut you into five pieces."

176
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,600
 I'd be like, "Dude, I know what dismember means."

177
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,600
 I only have five things you can cut off.

178
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,600
 "I will dismember you, cut you into five pieces."

179
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,600
 "You will be left with only a limbless torso, like a pumpkin."

180
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,600
 I've never seen a human look like a pumpkin. I've never seen a human resemble a pumpkin.

181
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,600
 If I'm only left with a limbless torso and you've cut five things off of me, I don't have a head.

182
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,600
 I'm not worried. Like, as my head is rolling off my body, I'm like, "Oh, no, my torso! I look terrible.

183
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,600
 I look like a pumpkin from this angle." My head is just rolling on the ground.

184
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:00,600
 Oh, no! If you've cut off five body parts, I'm not worried.

185
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,600
 Oh, no, look at those stretch marks. Oh, I need to get some cream for those.

186
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,600
 So, yeah, that's the level of writing expertise we get from Jennifer Zazuki.

187
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,600
 I love this. I love this. She also-- I've never seen this before.

188
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:24,600
 She posts a erotic resume, an erotic business resume, and it's titled "A Resume for Yuji Yasukuni."

189
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:30,600
 It's for personal assistance. So let's pretend you are a CEO and you get this.

190
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,600
 You're CEO of a powerful company. You get this resume across your desk and it says,

191
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,600
 "Graduated with an English degree with honors." You're like, "That's cool, I guess.

192
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,600
 I mean, I don't need any English majors with this high-tech company, but fine, whatever."

193
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,600
 "Fluent in Japanese, Mandarin Chinese in English." You're like, "Whoa, okay, you know.

194
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,600
 English degree, great. She knows how to analyze Edgar Allen Poe."

195
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,600
 But she can speak all these languages. I can use her to go to these other countries

196
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,600
 and make business deals and stuff like that a little further down in the resume.

197
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,600
 "Submissive level, above average." Like what? What?

198
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,600
 I've never seen this on a resume before. Someone's listing their submissive level.

199
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,600
 You're calling in your personal-- your current personal assistant.

200
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,600
 "Hey, Sally, it's been a while. You've been working here for like 15 years,

201
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,600
 but when you turned in your resume, did you let me know what your level of submissiveness you had?"

202
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:26,600
 She's like, "No, I didn't." I'm not going to tell you now. It's like, "Yeah, yeah, fine.

203
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,600
 Forget that we have this conversation. Underneath submissive level, you continue to read,

204
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,600
 underneath submissive level, pain endurance, above average."

205
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,600
 So again, this information doesn't have to be on a resume, but this is pretty impressive, right?

206
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,600
 This is pretty impressive. My submissive level is none.

207
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,600
 I'm not submissive at all, and my pain endurance is pretty low as well.

208
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,600
 I should start putting this on resumes from now on.

209
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,600
 People will be like, "Hey, man, I really wanted to hire you, but your submissive level is just way too low."

210
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,600
 I'm like, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm groveling." And they're like, "Keep groveling. You just might get this job."

211
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,600
 And then, you know, because when you're hiring a personal assistant, you want to know what they look like.

212
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,600
 Obviously, they come in for the interview, but you want to see it on paper. You want to see it on paper.

213
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,600
 And I've sent out resumes that have had typos in it, and I've always done face poems afterwards.

214
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,600
 They're for jobs that I really, really wanted, and it sucks.

215
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:27,600
 The typo in this one, she puts down her weight as 54 kilograms, which is 120 pounds.

216
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:35,600
 She puts down her shoe size as 23 centimeters, on this high-level professional executive assistant resume.

217
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:43,600
 With very, very above-average pain endurance, they put down as their height -- this was a typo, because I had to check this out --

218
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,600
 they put down as their height as 16 centimeters.

219
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:56,600
 Something clicked in my head. I go, "Wait a second. If her feet are 23 centimeters, how is she 16 centimeters tall?"

220
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:02,600
 Now, I'm assuming she meant 160 centimeters, which would make her 5'6".

221
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:13,600
 But according to this professional resume, Yuji Yasakuni is 120 pounds and half a foot tall.

222
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:20,600
 I tried putting this into one of those body calculators online. It won't let me go below 4'9".

223
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:28,600
 I really want to see -- you know what I just realized? If you're a half a foot tall and you weigh 120 pounds, you look like a pumpkin!

224
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,600
 She already looks like a pumpkin! How is that even possible?

225
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:39,600
 But apparently, there is a personal -- this is true, right? Everything on this website is true.

226
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:47,600
 Apparently, there is a woman out there who her feet are longer than she is. She's 120 pounds and she's half a foot tall.

227
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:53,600
 She ends up really telling this story of her life.

228
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:00,600
 So, I said originally -- I'm getting into more notes here -- I said originally that she was white and Japanese. That's not correct.

229
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,600
 Jennifer Suzuki, according to herself, her mother is Chinese and her father is white and Japanese.

230
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:15,600
 Her mother is Chinese. She says, "When I was born, I also had this little sister, but I looked more European and my little sister looked more Chinese."

231
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:21,600
 She tells this story about growing up with her sister who looked mostly Chinese and herself who looked mostly European.

232
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,600
 And how her dad would beat her mom and her dad would beat her sister.

233
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:33,600
 She's telling this story about all of this and when they went to school in Japan, which is where they were living,

234
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,600
 her sister was made fun of all the time because she looked more Chinese and she was more popular because she looked more European.

235
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:44,600
 And this goes on and on until eventually her sister can't keep up with the bullion and hangs herself in the closet.

236
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,600
 And Jennifer Suzuki opened the closet one day and saw her sister hanging there.

237
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,600
 So, is Jennifer Suzuki a victim of circumstance?

238
00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:02,600
 She grew up in this very, very hostile household and ended up becoming a racist and a misogynist and loving to bask in the pain of other Asian women.

239
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,600
 Are the hands of white men? Is Jennifer Suzuki even exist?

240
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:16,600
 The reason why I want to cover this story is not only because of the tiny personal assistant, but this is always the dark side of true crime.

241
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:22,600
 It's that flip side of true crime. So much of us are just interested in the dark side of man.

242
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:27,600
 And some people take it a little step further and they watch gory movies and will look at gory photographs.

243
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,600
 And the people who just kind of like true crime look at them and go, "Ah, that's a little too macabre for me."

244
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:37,600
 But then there are people who are even too macabre for the macabre people.

245
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,600
 And that's people like this who have created this whole blog that was completely underground.

246
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:50,600
 This only existed for the people who like these stories until one day she posted a story on Reddit and it was uncovered.

247
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,600
 It makes you wonder how many other websites are out there just like this.

248
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,600
 Well, there's a lot. Obviously, we know the answer to that.

249
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,600
 The internet is a wonderful place, but it's also full of a bunch of sickos.

250
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,600
 Orangutan Banana, this is the last week of season 13, so episodes are probably going to go a little bit long.

251
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,600
 You, sir, you need to get in that carbonicopter. He's still on the website.

252
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,600
 He's like, "No, just a few more clicks." He hit the mouse out of his hand.

253
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,600
 Stop it! Stop it! No more inferior asian.com for you.

254
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,600
 Orangutan Banana, get in this carbonicopter. We are leaving behind this gross woman's website.

255
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,600
 We're leaving behind the digital realm. We are headed out to Twin Peaks, Washington.

257
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,600
 I know the episodes run along, but I really am excited about this.

258
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,600
 Do you like board games and murder?

259
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,600
 Then the dark comedic thriller Murder, Barry, Wynn is for you.

260
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,600
 Critically acclaimed on the festival circuit and winner of best feature at Phoenix Fear Con,

261
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:51,600
 Murder, Barry, Wynn centers on three aspiring board game designers who have to dispose of a body.

262
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,600
 With few options available, they turn to their game for guidance.

263
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,600
 The premise of their game? How to murder someone and get away with it.

00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,600
 I was like doing that carbonicopter noise afterwards.

270
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,600
 This story actually, even though that first story went long, this story won't take long.

271
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,600
 Obrangutan Banana land the carbonicopter. We're in the fictional town of Twin Peaks.

272
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,600
 It's actually Snoqualomy in Washington.

273
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,600
 I'm actually going to an October visit where they film Twin Peaks.

274
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,600
 I don't know if I've mentioned that yet.

275
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,600
 And I want to do a week of episodes from up there, dude.

276
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
 I'm watching Twin Peaks for the third time still.

277
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,600
 We had a bit of a-- I had to take a bit of a break for a while.

278
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,600
 We were watching like, Enola Holmes and a bunch of other stuff.

279
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,600
 But anyways, we're back watching Twin Peaks.

280
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,600
 Can't wait to go. Twin Peaks. Dead Rabbit recommends Twin Peaks.

281
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,600
 If you don't know what Twin Peaks is, quick, quick overview.

282
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,600
 It's three seasons of a television show.

283
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,600
 It was the predecessor to X-Files.

284
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:07,600
 It's half soap opera, half edge of your seat terror.

285
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,600
 It's all about, like, everything I hate.

286
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:17,600
 It's about portals. It's about the real and the unreal separated by a, like, a literal doorway.

287
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,600
 You walk out into your living room. There's a demon there.

288
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,600
 No one else can see it or everyone else can see it and you can't see it.

289
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:31,600
 It's all-- it's a soap opera, but they keep having these elements of supernatural terror throughout the run of the show.

290
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,600
 And season three is absolutely insane.

291
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:39,600
 So it's funny because it has two fan bases. You have people who really like the soap opera stuff.

292
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,600
 You have kids like me who were going to puberty when it was on and now having attraction to waitresses.

293
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,600
 And then you have people who really like the supernatural stuff.

294
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,600
 And I like all three of them, especially the waitresses.

295
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,600
 But they recently came out with a VR game, virtual reality game, where you get to go to Twin Peaks.

296
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,600
 You get to visit the Red Room, which was a place of immortal torment.

297
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,600
 You can visit Glastonbury Grove, just a little place in the woods, a little--

298
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,600
 you walk in the woods, there's a couple trees.

299
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,600
 If you walk too far, you fall into Infinite Void of the Red Room.

300
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
 That's great. Game of the Nightmares is a kid.

301
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,600
 You can go to the Twin Peaks Sheriff's Station. That's nice. You can eat virtual donuts.

302
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,600
 And to top it all off, there's a whole bunch of locations.

303
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,600
 You can visit the train car where Laura Palmer was raped and murdered.

304
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,600
 That's great.

305
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,600
 Right? Who doesn't want to spend a video game where you go to a train car where a young woman was Jennifer Suzuki?

306
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,600
 It's like, "Get out of the way, guys!" She's putting on the virtual reality glasses.

307
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,600
 She's like, "I'm finally home!"

308
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,600
 It's an escape room game.

309
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,600
 So you're trying to solve these puzzles and like Killer Bob, who's a demon in the show,

310
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,600
 terrifying even talk about while I'm in the haunted closet, honestly.

311
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,600
 He's in it and it kind of takes you through the plot.

312
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
 I'll tell you this right now.

313
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,600
 One, I will never play that virtual reality game.

314
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,600
 I was thinking about maybe doing it for a livestream.

315
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,600
 I watched maybe 10 minutes of it.

316
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,600
 Someone else playing it, I was like, "No."

317
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,600
 Twin Peaks terrified me so much as a kid.

318
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,600
 It continues to terrify me so much as an adult.

319
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,600
 I want to play the VR game.

320
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,600
 So you're like, "Jason, wait a second.

321
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,600
 So is this really your final story?"

322
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,600
 Just talking about a Twin Peaks virtual reality game.

323
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,600
 Here's my final story.

324
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,600
 Why would you-- Twin Peaks is all about the real and the unreal,

325
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,600
 the dark and the light sitting right on top of each other.

326
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:27,600
 Why would you tempt fate by creating a video game that takes you to a world where nothing seems real?

327
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,600
 If you're playing this video game and it's taking you to another dimension of the video game,

328
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,600
 am I saying you can take the goggles off and you're like, "No!"

329
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,600
 Killer Bob's sneaking up behind you.

330
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,600
 Well, actually, that's an interesting question because, no,

331
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,600
 I don't think you'll put on the goggles, take them off, and you'll be in the world of Twin Peaks.

332
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,600
 I'm like, "First stop, I'm going to the diner."

333
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,600
 I think that-- We've talked about this before.

334
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,600
 We've talked about games like Fatal Frame that the developer designed to attract spirits.

335
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,600
 Do you want to put that as a VR game?

336
00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:02,600
 Because what a VR game does is it shuts off your senses, except for the video game world.

337
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,600
 I can be playing whatever game.

338
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,600
 I can be playing Minecraft.

339
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,600
 I can totally get lost in Minecraft.

340
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,600
 I can totally get lost in Fortnite.

341
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,600
 I'm a 12-year-old kid.

342
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,600
 I can totally get lost in Fall Guys and Among Us.

343
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,600
 But, obviously, my peripheral vision is still picking up everything else.

344
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,600
 With a virtual reality thing, I'm in the world of Twin Peaks.

345
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,600
 Now, you're like, "Jason, yeah, but you're like a digital hand.

346
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:31,600
 You can't really move around. You have to do that weird hop mechanic."

347
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
 But those limitations are right now.

348
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:46,600
 I, conspiracy caps fully on, there probably is virtual reality ceremonies.

349
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,600
 Now, I'm not talking about-- I know people are going to go, "Yeah, worlds.com."

350
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:55,600
 It's this old website where Saint worshipers took over parts of it and they hold ceremonies.

351
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,600
 And it looks like EverQuest. It's really bad graphics and stuff like that.

352
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,600
 I'm aware of that.

353
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,600
 What I'm talking about is there's always that conspiracy theory out there that whatever technology we have,

354
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,600
 NASA or the government has 10 times the technology.

355
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,600
 You think those Velcro shoes are great?

356
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,600
 You should check out the Velcro and Obama shoes.

357
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,600
 Hyper realistic graphics.

358
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,600
 Totally immersive experience.

359
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:32,600
 And you can perform a demonic ritual with acolytes all over the world at the same time.

360
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,600
 You put on this headset.

361
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,600
 You are in this sacred grove of trees.

362
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,600
 A place that might not have existed for 200, 300 years.

363
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:48,600
 It could have been bulldozed over and a Christian church was put on top of it.

364
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:56,600
 But this forest, this glen, this grove is perfectly recreated in a virtual reality world

365
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,600
 with graphics far better than what we see.

366
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:08,600
 You put on your VR headset and you go virtually to that location.

367
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,600
 Bio sensor feedback.

368
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:19,600
 So when you touch something in the world, it feels like the pine needles are pressing against your skin.

369
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,600
 And you're having this ceremony with people all over the planet at the same time.

370
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,600
 No more getting caught in the middle of the woods by some local sheriff and two teens.

371
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,600
 Oh, sheriff, we saw some headlights down at the grove.

372
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,600
 I'll go figure out what's going on and they stumble across this satanic conspiracy.

373
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,600
 They're all be done virtually.

374
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,600
 And it would be very eco-friendly because not everyone would have to fly out there either.

375
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,600
 And you go, Jason, but isn't these demonic rituals that we hear about,

376
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,600
 what are they sacrificing Mario? Yoshi's all "Ahh!"

377
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,600
 Is there like stabbing Yoshi? What about them sacrificing people for this?

378
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,600
 If it's just a virtual person, then would that cause any power at all?

379
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,600
 Well, no.

380
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,600
 Well, let's think about that for a second.

381
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:11,600
 Yeah, right. That is a big part of it, is actually sacrificing somebody.

382
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,600
 But not all rituals require that.

383
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,600
 But even the ones that did, I think you could have a workaround.

384
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,600
 I think you could have a workaround.

385
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,600
 I think, is that what I'm trying to think on the top of my head for a workaround?

386
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
 How's this? How's this?

387
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,600
 You have a digital dude in the woods and he's all tied up.

388
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,600
 And then you're doing your chance or whatever and you have your wavy knife

389
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,600
 and everyone takes a stab.

390
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,600
 "Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!"

391
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,600
 So, game over.

392
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
 "Yah, yah, yah, yah!" Boop!

393
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600
 You get the high score because you got the most stabs.

394
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:49,600
 And then in real life, that guy, in real life, that avatar was connected to a dude's bank account

395
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,600
 and he's like, "Aw, man, I can't wait to spend this money. That's what I do.

396
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,600
 I earn money and then spend it."

397
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,600
 And like his bank...

398
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,600
 Every stab removed $100 from his account.

399
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,600
 He's like, "Noooo!"

400
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,600
 So isn't that kind of like sacrificing someone because you're making them, like...

401
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,600
 You're giving them anguish?

402
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,600
 Or, like, have you ever had a string of bad luck?

403
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,600
 Maybe.

404
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,600
 Have you had a string of bad luck that's also connected to the internet

405
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,600
 or some sort of digital device?

406
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,600
 Not like you're tripping on black cats, but like, let's say you go to renew your insurance

407
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,600
 and it takes a long time for you to get somebody on the phone.

408
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,600
 Really, the reason why you're having that bad luck is because your avatar was sacrificed

409
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:39,600
 in a dark magic ritual on virtual reality.

410
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,600
 And because some dude in Belgium was stabbing your digital avatar,

411
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,600
 you're sitting in there on the phone and it's like,

412
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,600
 "The next operator will pick up in 15 minutes."

413
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,600
 You're like, "Noooo!"

414
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,600
 Okay, so maybe I didn't...

415
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,600
 Maybe I didn't think this went all the way through.

416
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,600
 I did think it was a spooky image of business leaders all over the world wearing VR gear

417
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,600
 and being like, "Let the sacrifice begin."

418
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,600
 But I didn't really think through...

419
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:09,600
 I didn't really think through what the sacrifice was gonna be, but I'll tell you this.

420
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,600
 Let me try to salvage this.

421
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,600
 You get a bunch of people who worship dark energy.

422
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,600
 Sometimes that's enough.

423
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,600
 Sometimes they don't need to do the sacrificing.

424
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,600
 Sometimes that's enough.

425
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,600
 Just their prayers and their focus and their power combined

426
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,600
 is just enough to start to upset the balance.

427
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,600
 And sure, spilling innocent blood probably makes it a little more powerful,

428
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,600
 but imagine if instead of having a yearly retreat

429
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,600
 because that's the only time everyone can get their schedules together

430
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,600
 and get to this area that will be unmonitored at this time,

431
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,600
 you could do that ceremony once a week.

432
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,600
 You could do that ceremony once a night if you wanted to.

433
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,600
 Think about it.

434
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,600
 Yeah, now we're back on track.

435
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,600
 Equinoxes.

436
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,600
 They only happen so many times a year,

437
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:03,600
 but in a digital world, you could have it happen every single night.

438
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,600
 You could have the stars line up perfectly every single night

439
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:13,600
 and power this engine of darkness, this engine of rage

440
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,600
 far quicker than you ever could in the natural world.

441
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,600
 Is it possible that dark forces are currently using advanced VR technology

442
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,600
 to push forward their agenda?

443
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:33,600
 They're able to create these rituals and practice them over and over and over again?

444
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,600
 Or is it just a conspiracy theory that I made up?

445
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,600
 When we think about technology in the end of the world,

446
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,600
 we always think about stuff like nuclear war, rogue AI.

447
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,600
 But what if it's more old school than that?

448
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:52,600
 What if technology isn't going to usher in a new age of technological terror,

449
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:58,600
 but an old age where magic and darkness rule the land?

450
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,600
 One we can prepare for.

451
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,600
 We can see the rise of the machines.

452
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,600
 We can try to stop the nations going to war.

453
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:11,600
 But the other one is crafted by 13 people with VR helmets.

454
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,600
 We don't know their names.

455
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:22,600
 But we will know their names when they become the dark rulers of this planet.

456
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:31,600
