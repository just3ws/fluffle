1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,880
 Republican Senator Mitt Romney gets a black eye, so that makes him fodder for the conspiracy

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,680
 theory community.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,240
 Is there any truth to the story that in eastern Algeria there is a race of half man, half

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,680
 gin living amongst the population?

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,600
 And then we traveled to Russia to meet a young woman who's getting ready to go on an airplane

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,600
 trip.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,800
 What is she, a kid?

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,600
 Who calls it an airplane trip?

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,400
 But anyway, she's getting ready to go.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,000
 She's getting ready to travel on an airplane.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,640
 It's just a normal day at the airport, until a man begins to turn blue and try to fit into

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,880
 an electrical socket.

13
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,160
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,440
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter and I'm having a great day.

16
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,240
 Hope you guys are having a great day too.

17
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,920
 Hope you guys got some cool plans for the weekend.

18
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,440
 We got a ton of stuff to cover so we're going to get started right away by introducing our

19
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,840
 newest Patreon supporter.

20
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,920
 Flying in on a dragonfly, they're not seated on it like a sectar warrior.

21
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,400
 They're actually holding onto the legs.

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,640
 A little tiny guy, it's SE.

23
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,360
 He's microscopic, but that's okay.

24
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,960
 We'll shoot him with the growth ray.

25
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,160
 He grows big, super convoluted way to just introduce a guy.

26
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,840
 But SE, you're going to be our captain, our pilot for this episode.

27
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,880
 If you guys can't support the Patreon or if you're not microscopic, that's fine too.

28
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,880
 Which helps read the word about the show, really, really helps out a lot.

29
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,160
 As SE is feeding his pet dragonfly, we got some other stuff to talk about real quick.

30
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,480
 First off, you'll see that it's fan art Friday.

31
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,720
 And this fan art comes from, I don't know how much of it's fan art, how much of it

32
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,800
 is criminal activity, it's graffiti on a wall.

33
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,160
 This comes from Cabot Cove Balloon Friends.

34
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,560
 So that's really cool.

35
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,280
 That's a way to do fan art and get the word out about the show by vandalizing property.

36
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,120
 I think he might actually own the wall.

37
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,240
 I think he just bought a single wall, one wall please.

38
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,480
 Then spray painted on it.

39
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,280
 It may not be criminal, but it is appreciated.

40
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,360
 Cabot Cove Balloon Friends, thank you very, very much.

41
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,320
 And also just letting you guys know, if you listen to the show every single day as it's

42
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,160
 coming out, which I know a lot of you guys do, I'm taking a long weekend.

43
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,240
 If you guys listen to the show a year from now, this matters not.

44
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,360
 You just get the next episode.

45
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,640
 But I'm taking a long weekend.

46
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,040
 I'll probably be back around Tuesday.

47
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,640
 I got some stuff I gotta take care of this weekend.

48
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,680
 I can't confirm or deny that this stuff involves dragonflies.

49
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,400
 But I won't be doing the podcast either way.

50
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,480
 But I will be back come Tuesday.

51
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,360
 SE, let's go ahead and give you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

52
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,400
 We're gonna leave Dead Rabbit Command and we are headed out to the nation's capital,

53
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,720
 Washington, DC.

54
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,160
 SE is piloting the Jason Jalopy through the nation's city streets.

55
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,240
 We eventually get there.

56
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,760
 The reason why we're in the nation's capital.

57
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,840
 I saw this news earlier in the week and I go, "Okay, I know what I'm gonna have to

58
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,200
 re- I know what I'm gonna have to research and talk about this episode."

59
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,200
 The Black Eye Club.

60
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,800
 I actually touched on it when I did the Adrenochrome Witch, the episode called The Adrenochrome

61
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,920
 Witch written by Sean Puffdetti Combs.

62
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,600
 But it's this idea that people who get Adrenochrome injections get it injected into their eye,

63
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,960
 get it injected into the one part of the body you really can't cover up and everyone can

64
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,080
 see and journalists could be like, "Hey, Mitt Romney, what happened to your eyeball?"

65
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,400
 I mean like if you're gonna do a top secret ritual, do it like behind the neck.

66
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,480
 Do it just a pill or two, just something that you swallow.

67
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,240
 Some people say that it's actually part of the ritual is they have to get punched or

68
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,560
 marked in some sort of way, so it has to be public.

69
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,920
 People have to see it publicly.

70
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,920
 Here's my thing.

71
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,240
 So Mitt Romney has a black eye now.

72
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,280
 And so here's my thing.

73
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,960
 If it's a super secret ritual that everyone who does Adrenochrome gets, then two things.

74
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,280
 One, all the rich and powerful people should constantly have black eyes.

75
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,880
 There's a photo going around the internet.

76
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,840
 It's popped up now because Mitt Romney has a black eye.

77
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,160
 And it's like the Black Eye Club and it's a picture of like Reese Witherspoon.

78
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,600
 Reese Witherspoon by the way.

79
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
 Reese Witherspoon.

80
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,040
 Then like Prince Charles.

81
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,400
 Reese Witherspoon, she's a lovely lady, sure.

82
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,880
 But she's not an A-list actor.

83
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,880
 She still even acts.

84
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,000
 I think she has a talk show now.

85
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,160
 I'm not entirely for sure.

86
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,120
 If I am walking down a dark hallway all confused her with Drew Barrymore, what I'm saying is

87
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,360
 she's not on the level of Barack Obama, who also has a photo of him with a black eye.

88
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,400
 She's not on the level of Prince Charles.

89
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,200
 I would argue she's maybe on the level of Mitt Romney.

90
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,240
 Mitt Romney ran for president.

91
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,360
 Reese Witherspoon was in cruel intentions.

92
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,080
 Again, I'm not knocking Reese Witherspoon.

93
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,280
 I like you.

94
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,080
 World Leaders vs. You.

95
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,600
 And then if you think I'm just giving Reese Witherspoon a hard time, Perez Hilton is on

96
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
 the list.

97
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
 Do you guys even remember Perez Hilton?

98
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,080
 He's on this list.

99
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,800
 He's on this list of the Black Eye Club.

100
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,520
 When you look at these world leaders, there's maybe about 12 people selected on there.

101
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,520
 Robert Downey Jr.

102
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,520
 Black Eye Club.

103
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,520
 He has a black eye.

104
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,160
 Yeah, can you believe that a man in action movies has a black eye?

105
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,160
 Can you believe that?

106
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,720
 Can you believe that it actually happened?

107
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:18,040
 I also gotta say, I gotta pull this picture up, I also gotta say that if this theory is

108
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:23,560
 true, then that means that every punk rocker that I used to hang out with is secretly a

109
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,200
 member of the Illuminati.

110
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,880
 Because I've grown up with people with a ton of black eyes.

111
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,880
 Here's this list.

112
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,480
 We have, I'm not gonna read all of them, John McCain, black eye.

113
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,880
 Half these guys actually don't even know who's Michael Valery.

114
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,680
 I have no idea who that guy, maybe he's the one who's the hidden ruler of the world.

115
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,960
 Actually, it's not even Prince Charles.

116
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,320
 It's not even like a real leader is on here.

117
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,840
 Prince Philip, who is Prince Philip?

118
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,840
 I don't even know who that guy is.

119
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,840
 Kanye West.

120
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,200
 I mean, come on.

121
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,720
 John Kerry and George W. Bush.

122
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,000
 I don't understand how they get this list going here.

123
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,560
 But there's about 16 people on this, on this photograph.

124
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,600
 I'll put it on the show notes.

125
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,520
 Brad Pitt got a black eye at one point in his life.

126
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,240
 Do you, they have a photo of Adam Sandler with a black eye.

127
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,360
 He looks 12 in the picture.

128
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,800
 He's almost just missing a little league outfit.

129
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,400
 He looks so young.

130
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:21,080
 But this is a real conspiracy that's going on saying if you have a black eye and you're

131
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:28,160
 rich and powerful, that must mean you're part of the Illuminati, the Adrenochrome cult.

132
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,240
 Not that one, you're an action star like Robert Downey Jr.

133
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,960
 Brad Pitt, yeah, I guess he's kind of an action star.

134
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,720
 You had all those fight scenes during an interview with the vampire.

135
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,520
 He's fighting with his conscience.

136
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,640
 And then Mitt Romney is 73 years old.

137
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,960
 Prince Phillips, I don't know who he is, but he's an old man.

138
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,400
 George W. Bush and John Kerry, they're old.

139
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,080
 So this is not a conspiracy theory.

140
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,080
 Old people fall.

141
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,360
 And it was so funny when I first saw that Mitt Romney fell down.

142
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,640
 I read the article and then I go, huh, I wonder how old he is.

143
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,640
 He was 73 years old.

144
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,480
 And I go, whoa, what a coincidence.

145
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,680
 The age where people fall a lot and they hit their eyeball.

146
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,360
 But you'll go on the X-Board and people go, I've never seen some.

147
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,280
 I saw this multiple times on the X-Board today.

148
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,400
 I've never seen a black eye in person.

149
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,720
 I've never seen a black eye in person.

150
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,080
 The only time I see black eyes are on celebrities.

151
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:28,240
 First off, that's either a flat out lie or I want to move to where you're at, because

152
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,800
 that means no one is ever getting hurt and gravity doesn't work.

153
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,720
 And elderly people, when they start to fall, they just kind of float, float gently to the

154
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
 ground.

155
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,240
 But it's super interesting to see that being bandied about.

156
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,160
 I've never seen a black eye in real life.

157
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:52,160
 On a board dedicated to ghosts, bigfoot and aliens.

158
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,240
 Where the majority of the population has never seen any of those in real life.

159
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,240
 Ever.

160
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,120
 Especially bigfoot.

161
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,120
 Ever.

162
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,120
 Aliens.

163
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,160
 Most humans have never ever seen an alien.

164
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,560
 I'd argue more people see ghosts than both of those put together.

165
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,280
 But it's still stuff like I walked into the room, I smelled my mother's perfume.

166
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,280
 Things like that.

167
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,880
 Full body apparitions.

168
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,380
 Super rare.

169
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,440
 I've never seen blank before.

170
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,280
 Therefore Illuminati Ritual.

171
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,880
 Fascinating way to look at it because so much stuff we talk about on the show, people have

172
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,040
 not seen before.

173
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,280
 Legitimately seen before.

174
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,320
 I've seen a ton of black eyes.

175
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,160
 I've had black eyes.

176
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,160
 It's just weird.

177
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,160
 It's a weird thing.

178
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,320
 It's a weird argument to have.

179
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,320
 Flat earth.

180
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,040
 Like you've never seen the edge of the earth.

181
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,040
 But this.

182
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,360
 This you're like I've never seen a man with a black eye in my life.

183
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,440
 But Madonna had a black eye.

184
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,440
 She's on the black eye list.

185
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,040
 That must mean she's part of it.

186
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,040
 It's an easy.

187
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,000
 I part of me think it started off as a joke.

188
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,880
 Part of me thinks that this is a fake conspiracy theory that started to gain traction.

189
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,120
 Because it's one of those conspiracy theories that you look at physical evidence of, i.e.

190
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,400
 a photo.

191
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,480
 And then very limited information on it.

192
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,480
 What's the black eye club?

193
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,040
 And people will come up with their own theories about what it is.

194
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,040
 It's not adrenochrome.

195
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,000
 It's they actually have to be marked as a humiliation ritual.

196
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,240
 They got to be punched.

197
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,120
 I think Queen Elizabeth probably has.

198
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,600
 Wasn't she in the black eye club?

199
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,200
 I guess one of the Supreme Court justices was in the black eye club.

200
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,000
 These people are ancient.

201
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,200
 These people are old, old people.

202
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
 And they're going to fall.

203
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,720
 And Kanye West has a black eye.

204
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,520
 Kanye West has probably done more to disrupt any sort of Illuminati plot in our lifetime.

205
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,960
 I don't know if that's actually true.

206
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,320
 I just really, really like Kanye West.

207
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,640
 I think there's an argument to say that if there is an Illuminati that's controlling

208
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,000
 the music industry, one group controlling everything, Kanye West is not a part of it.

209
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,520
 Because they're constantly trying to take him to pieces.

210
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,000
 I do, and let me go off on this real quick.

211
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,720
 I do think, because I've said this a couple of times on the show, but sometimes they get

212
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,600
 lost in 633, 34 episodes.

213
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,160
 I believe there are groups trying to take over the planet.

214
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,480
 I don't believe there's one group that controls everything.

215
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,200
 That doesn't make sense.

216
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
 That doesn't make sense at all.

217
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,240
 I think there's a lot of smaller groups.

218
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,560
 And I think some of them may go by the name Illuminati, even, because it has such a cachet

219
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,560
 in the culture.

220
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:23,400
 But I think most of them go by stuff like the double R group, or Revol group.

221
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,480
 And you wouldn't even think twice when you looked at it.

222
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:31,600
 It's a group of maybe 15, 20 people who have plans on how they want to see the world be

223
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,600
 controlled.

224
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,000
 They're very, very powerful people.

225
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,400
 And I think they fight amongst each other.

226
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,520
 I think sometimes there's alliances against the third party, and they're constantly vying

227
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,200
 for power to see who actually sets the agenda for the planet.

228
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,760
 That's what causes wars, and that's what causes economies to rise and fall.

229
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,680
 It's almost like tectonic plates.

230
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,540
 You have these different powerful parties working against each other.

231
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:58,440
 One may have more of an influence over the entertainment industry than others, but I

232
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,400
 don't think one single group controls everything.

233
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,400
 Because if that was the case, this would have been over in 1400s.

234
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,400
 Or the 1800s.

235
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,600
 We'll even give them that far.

236
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:13,600
 By the time we got into industrialized nation, if one group was controlling everything, we

237
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,200
 would have been taken over already.

238
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,800
 We absolutely would have been taken over already.

239
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:23,400
 It wouldn't be like, "Oh no, let's let the internet happen so all this media can be everywhere."

240
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,640
 And, "Oh, let's start these social networks so we can reign them back in 20 years later."

241
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:32,320
 And let's kind of like, let them start new ones that we can't regulate, and it doesn't

242
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,720
 make any sense at all.

243
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,400
 It doesn't make any sense at all.

244
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,880
 But people want to believe it.

245
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,240
 People want to believe that an old man falling down, a 73-year-old man falling down and hitting

246
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,120
 his eye, he's part of a secret society.

247
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,120
 What are you going to do?

248
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,120
 I can't control that.

249
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,480
 I can't control gravity, Mitt Romney.

250
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,480
 I'm sorry.

251
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,320
 Maybe your Illuminati Puppet Masters pushed you down because you weren't doing what they

252
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,320
 said.

253
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
 It might be possible.

254
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,080
 Highly doubtful.

255
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,880
 Most likely, you're just an old man.

256
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,080
 And I'm sorry that you fell down and hurt your eyeball.

257
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,480
 And I welcome to the club.

258
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,960
 Not that I've fallen down and hurt my eyeball, but you're now part of the Black Eye Club.

259
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,800
 People are going to be talking about you all the time.

260
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,480
 You try to run for president again.

261
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,160
 These memes are going to come up.

262
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,120
 It's just going to be welcome to the Conspiracy Theory Club.

263
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,160
 I hope you enjoy your stay.

264
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,200
 You're in here for the rest of your life.

265
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,680
 That went on for a long and I actually do want to do this.

266
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,480
 I'm not going to do the story about the half-gen, half-human today.

267
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,000
 And I'm sure some of you are going, "Didn't you already cover that?"

268
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,480
 I'm going to give you a teaser.

269
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,440
 We'll cover that next week.

270
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,600
 I covered the Zahori, which were half-human, half-gen.

271
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,720
 And they were children in, if I remember correctly, Morocco.

272
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,240
 The gen were trading out gen children with human children.

273
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,520
 They were being raised in the real world.

274
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,920
 And they were being hunted by evil sorcerers.

275
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,920
 That's a legit story.

276
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,360
 Children are actually in danger.

277
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,720
 There's a lot of articles in the Moroccan newspapers.

278
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,960
 If that's where the story takes place, if it's in another country, Morocco's not reporting

279
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,960
 on it.

280
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,200
 But it's a legit story.

281
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,240
 These young people are being snatched off the streets.

282
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,240
 It's terrifying.

283
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,240
 You go, "Jason, you already covered that?"

284
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,240
 No, it's really interesting.

285
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,200
 In Eastern Algeria, there is a similar myth.

286
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,960
 But these are half-human, half-gen.

287
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,640
 It's the same genetic makeup.

288
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,960
 They're still half-human, half-gen, but these children were not raised in our world.

289
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,400
 They were raised in the world of the gen.

290
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,360
 And they came back here.

291
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,880
 So it's a different story.

292
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,400
 It's short, but I don't want to breeze through it.

293
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,520
 I want to give it room to breathe.

294
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,880
 So we're going to save that one for next week.

295
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,440
 I think you guys will get a kick out of that.

296
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,360
 SC, I'm going to touch the keys of the Carbindercopter and give you a little tease for next week.

297
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:48,040
 But right now, fly us out of Washington, DC, or headed to the Soviet Union.

298
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,880
 Now the Carbindercopter is suited up in full military gear.

299
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,680
 We got shaft flares and guns.

300
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,120
 And we're each holding a bomb so we can throw it out if we have to.

301
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,040
 This is 1989, ladies and gentlemen.

302
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,320
 The United States is at war, kind of, with the Soviet Union.

303
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,200
 But this story has nothing to do with war stuff.

304
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,600
 I just want to carry bombs around.

305
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,600
 But we get there.

306
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,280
 We all have to dress in our civilian clothes.

307
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,280
 We get all disappointed.

308
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,000
 We're leaving our bombs on the Carbindercopter.

309
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 That was enough, right?

310
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,960
 I triggered all of the Department of Homeland Security keywords on your phone.

311
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,440
 Just tell me thanks when they come knocking on your door.

312
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,560
 Bombs.

313
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,560
 We are walking around.

314
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,320
 There's another keyword for you guys.

315
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,320
 We're walking around the Adler Airport that's in Sochi in Russia.

316
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,720
 Starting off, there's a few things I really love about this story.

317
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,800
 Takes place during the day.

318
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,640
 Multiple witnesses to this story.

319
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:44,880
 We have the name of the witness and the exact day, November 11th, 1989.

320
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,080
 That's rare when we're talking about these type of stories.

321
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,760
 Elsa Harvrave, just because we have their name doesn't mean I can pronounce it.

322
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,040
 Elsa Rave is at the airport.

323
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,680
 She's getting ready to take an airplane trip.

324
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,560
 And she's currently in the automatic baggage locker area.

325
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,760
 I have no idea what that is.

326
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,880
 I've been to quite a few airports, but I don't know what that is.

327
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,160
 I don't know what it is.

328
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,480
 So it doesn't exist.

329
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,480
 This is a lie.

330
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,320
 It's an automatic baggage locker.

331
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,320
 I mean, I know what a locker is.

332
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,320
 I know what all those words mean individually.

333
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,760
 But I've never seen an automatic locker before.

334
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,840
 But I think it's just probably a locker and there's a bunch of people standing around

335
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:25,040
 putting luggage in, taking luggage out, waiting for their airplane trips.

336
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,360
 A man shows up and he appears to be 25 and he's just kind of walking through the crowd.

337
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,880
 But the way he's moving is very slow.

338
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,920
 He's walking almost in slow motion.

339
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,120
 It's not making that noise though.

340
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,360
 But it's a podcast after he's something.

341
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:51,840
 Elle's watching him and she says he's making these awkward movements through the crowd,

342
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,800
 just moving quite slowly.

343
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,760
 He's taller than a normal man, but he has a solid build.

344
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:04,220
 He's a broad-shouldered guy, taller than most moving through the crowd.

345
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,220
 His hair is messy.

346
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,280
 I don't know what that details in here.

347
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,280
 But his hair is messy.

348
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,680
 Maybe that'll help identify what type of person this is.

349
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,680
 His hair is messy.

350
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,560
 He has a pale, serious face.

351
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,840
 And to top it off, he's dressed like the Fonz.

352
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,480
 He has a black leather jacket, blue jeans.

353
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,400
 You're like, Jason, I don't know who the Fonz is.

354
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,600
 I'm not 55.

355
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,720
 He's cool.

356
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,000
 So imagine a cool dress dude moving through the crowd super slow.

357
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Don't forget the messy hair.

358
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,680
 Don't forget the messy hair.

359
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,680
 Everything else adds up to the messy hair.

360
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,480
 He seems to be looking around the room in confusion.

361
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,720
 And everyone is kind of looking at him.

362
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,720
 Because at this point, he's made his way into the automatic baggage locker area.

363
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,920
 And people are like, what in the world?

364
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,480
 Just someone who's tall automatically kind of makes you look over.

365
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,480
 And then you go, dude, is that the Fonz?

366
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,480
 Is that the Fonz?

367
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,480
 And you're like, wait a second.

368
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,640
 No, that's not the Fonz.

369
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,800
 The Fonz never had messy hair.

370
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,120
 But the fact that he's moving and slow, he looks like he's moving in slow motion.

371
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,240
 I guess you could be two feet tall.

372
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,840
 If you're moving in slow motion, people are going to pay attention to you.

373
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,400
 But everyone's looking at him.

374
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,760
 He's kind of looking around in the Wildermans.

375
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,480
 People go, hey man, are you okay dude?

376
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,480
 Are you okay?

377
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,480
 You seem to be moving.

378
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,480
 You seem to be moving like you're out of sync with our timeline.

379
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,320
 And he's just kind of dismisses them.

380
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,200
 And just keeps moving around, walking around.

381
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,040
 Hey dude, do you need to sit down?

382
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,040
 Do you need like an energy drink?

383
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,840
 Do you literally need energy to move around?

384
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,360
 He looks around the room and then he sees a wall socket.

385
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,760
 He starts walking towards the wall socket.

386
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,120
 People are like, okay, no, he made a joke about the energy drink.

387
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,560
 But it doesn't mean you should.

388
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,840
 And he starts trying to stick his finger into the socket.

389
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,680
 Now, obviously a human finger won't fit into a wall socket.

390
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,760
 And everyone's just standing there.

391
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,760
 No one knows what to do.

392
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,080
 You don't want to touch him because you don't want to get electrocuted.

393
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,000
 You've seen enough Tom and Jerry cartoons.

394
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,680
 You don't want to see his skeleton and your skeleton at the same time.

395
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,200
 But he can't get his finger in a socket, so he gets up and leaves.

396
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,080
 Everyone's like, well, that's kind of weird.

397
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,760
 That's actually quite weird.

398
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,760
 I didn't expect to see a slow motion funds walking into the airport.

399
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:27,680
 I expected to see fast motion funds because Henry Winkler is in Russia right now.

400
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,520
 A few minutes later, he starts walking back in.

401
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,520
 People are like, what are you doing, dude?

402
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,760
 He walks back into the room.

403
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,600
 People are like, hey, listen, we pretty much know what you're going to do.

404
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,400
 We think you're going to move around all weird, like a big old weirdo.

405
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,880
 And then you're going to do that.

406
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,880
 And they were right.

407
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,760
 He starts trying to stick his finger in the wall socket again.

408
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:56,200
 And someone goes, you can't do that physically or legally.

409
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,960
 It's probably illegal to stick stuff into wall sockets at airports of all places.

410
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,560
 And the man just kind of gets up and someone goes, are you like looking for something?

411
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,040
 Which is an odd question to ask.

412
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:14,560
 Are you looking for something to a man moving out of sync with the Earth's timeline?

413
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,720
 And he's trying to get himself.

414
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,400
 He's doing a lot of stuff, but he's probably not looking for something.

415
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,920
 But the guy responds when someone goes, are you looking for something?

416
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:26,920
 He goes, I'm looking for a gift and a scarf.

417
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,800
 People go, that's actually, that thank you.

418
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,800
 That's more confusing.

419
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,640
 I'm literally more confused now than I was before I asked that question.

420
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,240
 You're looking for a gift and a scarf?

421
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,240
 What?

422
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,080
 At this point, Elle walks up and she goes, are you trying to get into your locker?

423
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,000
 Do you remember your locker number?

424
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,920
 Did you not write it down?

425
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,120
 Maybe you're in the wrong area.

426
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,200
 At this point, no one wants them here, right?

427
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,600
 Like oh no, there's another locker with really big outlets on the other side of the airport.

428
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,600
 Go, go, go.

429
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,040
 But she's like, maybe you're looking for a locker.

430
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,720
 Maybe there's like a gift or a scarf in the locker.

431
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,040
 And she goes, did you write down the locker number you wanted?

432
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:16,480
 And he turns to her and freaks out and says, quote, what is write down?

433
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:23,560
 And she's like, okay, this is actually weirder than just a guy sticking his finger in his

434
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,560
 socket.

435
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,480
 He doesn't know what write down means.

436
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,480
 Having a stroke maybe?

437
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,480
 He got some sort of brain damage?

438
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,480
 Who knows?

439
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,840
 But you don't want to deal with the situation right now.

440
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,400
 You got to get someone involved.

441
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,200
 Elle though asks, where'd you come in from?

442
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,200
 You know, we're in an airport.

443
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,200
 Where'd you travel from?

444
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,320
 Everyone else is probably like, dude, just call an ambulance.

445
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,320
 Just call an ambulance.

446
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,520
 And then you're going to quiz the guy who doesn't know about writing stuff down.

447
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,920
 He says he was from a place called Sphurd's Lock, which is a real place.

448
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:58,800
 If you pronounce it correctly, it's a real place in the Ural region.

449
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,440
 So at least he's not like a freak from a dimension.

450
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,440
 Or is he?

451
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,320
 She goes, how did you get here?

452
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,320
 Did you travel on an airplane?

453
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,320
 Did you travel on a train?

454
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,280
 And then that might sound like an odd question.

455
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,400
 Like obviously they're in an airport.

456
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,400
 Why would you?

457
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,080
 The worst airport in the world if there's trains coming in too and planes are like,

458
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,400
 "Ah, trying to dodge everything.

459
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,160
 Thomas the Tink engine gets hijacked."

460
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,440
 It would be horrible.

461
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:27,120
 But she and everyone else around is starting to think this guy is not of this earth.

462
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,280
 There's just too much weird stuff going on.

463
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,800
 I.e. moving slow at a time, dressing like the fawns but not being as cool.

464
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,520
 Trying to become one with an outlet.

465
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,280
 So she's trying to kind of...that's why she asks where'd you come from.

466
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,600
 She's trying to get information because she thinks this guy is not from around here.

467
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,400
 Around here being our solar system.

468
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,800
 When she asks, did you fly in by an airplane?

469
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,600
 Did you take the train?

470
00:21:51,600 --> 00:22:00,040
 He stops and again looks at her and goes, "Airplane."

471
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,000
 Like he had a pronounced syllable by syllable.

472
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,280
 There's only two.

473
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,600
 There might actually be more in Russian so it's more dramatic.

474
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,280
 And then he goes, here's an interesting quote from him.

475
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,280
 He goes, "No.

476
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,720
 I descended by aggregate.

477
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,320
 You have different atmosphere here.

478
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,480
 Strong pressure.

479
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,440
 I became ill."

480
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,800
 Elle looks at him and direct quote from her, "What is aggregate?

481
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,040
 You mean by flying saucer, don't you?"

482
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,720
 He says, he gets mad at this.

483
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,200
 They know my secret.

484
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,200
 I shave from side to side.

485
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,800
 I blend it in so well.

486
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,120
 He says, quote, "No.

487
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,920
 I descended by aggregate."

488
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,920
 It's an aggregate too.

489
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,920
 I don't look it up.

490
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,080
 I don't look it up.

491
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:51,640
 But the spirit you guys having to look it up, it's basically like a group of things.

492
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,920
 So I don't know what you travel, right?

493
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,840
 I guess everyone on a plane aggregates into the plane.

494
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,040
 But like a swarm of butterflies aggregate together, a lot of times it's used to describe

495
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:08,440
 a particular type of material used in construction, including sand, gravel, crust, stone, slag, recycled

496
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,400
 concrete, and geosynthetic aggregates.

497
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,360
 Aggregates are the most mined materials in the world, according to Wikipedia.

498
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,360
 That's not how he appeared.

499
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:21,560
 He did a bunch of rocks and it just pebbles fall from the sky and then he form into a single

500
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,400
 man, the original conformer.

501
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,400
 That's not what it is.

502
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,880
 But it does kind of give you an idea.

503
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,040
 She doesn't know what aggregate is.

504
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,040
 I knew what it was.

505
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,040
 I knew what it was.

506
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,600
 I totally knew what it was.

507
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,360
 But you would almost think from that, that it was some sort of like beam down technology,

508
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:43,440
 because the way that you see it in sci-fi and all those documentaries called Star Trek,

509
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,440
 you remove all the molecules and then the molecules themselves travel and aggregate.

510
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,160
 And then he appears on Earth.

511
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,040
 But anyways, he says no, I descended by aggregate.

512
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,640
 So again, he's saying he descended.

513
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,440
 So Elle raises an eyebrow and she goes, I know what dissent means.

514
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,440
 I mean, I don't know what aggregate means.

515
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,320
 I'm not as smart as Jason Gerviner, who has the internet in front of him, but I do know

516
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,320
 what descended means.

517
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,440
 At that point he goes, I need to recharge.

518
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,760
 And he sits down, of course you know where he sits down, in front of an outlet.

519
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,600
 And he's just sitting there in front of the outlet.

520
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,400
 And he's staring at it for a moment and everyone's looking at him.

521
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,320
 Eyes are totally fixed on this guy, because you just know something wacky is going to

522
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,800
 happen at this point, right?

523
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,880
 You're not going to look away at your watch.

524
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,360
 You hear a balloon pop across the airport.

525
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,360
 None of that matters.

526
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:35,320
 He's looking at the tall fawns with messy hair, who's spending the whole afternoon trying

527
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:40,440
 to get his finger in an outlet, is now sitting down in front of one.

528
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,480
 He then jams his finger into the outlet.

529
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:51,600
 Against all physical odds, his finger actually goes into the outlet at this point.

530
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,640
 And Tom and Jerry antics ensue.

531
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:03,400
 He begins to shake, mouth slapping in the corner of the room.

532
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,920
 Blue splotches start to appear on his face.

533
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,840
 You know at that point Jerry runs away.

534
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,120
 You never see that in the cartoon.

535
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,240
 That's a little graphic.

536
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,880
 These people are watching this man.

537
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,640
 Blue splotches begin to appear on his skin.

538
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,520
 10 to 15 seconds later he withdraws his feet.

539
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,640
 That's a long time to watch someone get electrocuted by the way.

540
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,640
 That's when they're dead.

541
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,120
 10 to 15 seconds later he pulls his finger out of the outlet, shakes his head, and the

542
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,040
 blue spots disappear on his skin.

543
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:39,560
 He stands up like a normal person, not in slow motion.

544
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:44,400
 He looks around and like a normal person, not standing out of each syllable or just kind

545
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,760
 of grunting or murmuring, he says, "That's all!

546
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,560
 I remember now!"

547
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,440
 And he walks out.

548
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,360
 Normal speed.

549
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:58,560
 He walks through the crowd and before he gets to the end of the room he fixes his hair.

550
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:58,560
 He turns around and goes, "Ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

551
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:28,560
 He turns around and goes "Ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

552
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:54,680
 You

553
00:26:54,680 --> 00:27:20,400
 should

554
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:50,240
 get

555
00:27:50,240 --> 00:28:17,960
 a

556
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:24,080
 hoax.

557
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:30,160
 When I read this story it reminded me of a viral video I saw a couple years ago.

558
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,920
 I think we're going to wrap it up like this.

559
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,920
 I saw a video.

560
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,600
 I'll put it in the show notes, but a lot of you guys have probably seen it as well.

561
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:49,720
 There is a woman on a subway car, a bus, and she's either heavily drunk or mentally out

562
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,720
 of it or on drugs or all three.

563
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,520
 And the video starts and she's just kind of moving her head back and forth.

564
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:05,160
 And then her eyes open up and she reaches down and grabs her stomach and starts going,

565
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,160
 "Oh no!

566
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,160
 I'm fat!

567
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,160
 I'm fat!

568
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,160
 I'm fat!

569
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,160
 I'm fat!

570
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,160
 I'm fat!"

571
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,280
 And she starts kind of freaking out.

572
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,880
 And she's screaming how she's fat.

573
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:21,600
 I remember watching that video and I thought, "Because this is- listen, conspiracy cap's

574
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,760
 fully on and my conspiracy cap never comes off.

575
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,200
 This is just the way I am.

576
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,720
 Speculative thinker."

577
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,280
 But watch this video and I go, "Here's my hypothesis.

578
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:36,440
 One, she's on drugs, she's drunk, she has mental problems, or a combination of all three."

579
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:51,200
 Or an equally possible theory is that she's a witch or a time traveler or someone hopping

580
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,960
 souls.

581
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,960
 And it's so weird.

582
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,600
 I watch this video and I immediately got this backstory in my head.

583
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,160
 I'm not saying it's true.

584
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,520
 I'm not saying it's not.

585
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,920
 But it's probably not.

586
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,920
 But I remember watching the video once and I instantly was like, "Yep, I know the answer

587
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,320
 to this one."

588
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,440
 And I watched the video several more times to see if I could see someone on a broom in

589
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,000
 the background flying around and going, "Hehehehe."

590
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,520
 Someone was hopping bodies and they ended up in the body of a fat woman, which who cares,

591
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,520
 right?

592
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,660
 Like, whatever.

593
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:30,420
 But to this person, that was the worst possible place to end up.

594
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:35,120
 This woman had to be in her 30s and it was like she was realizing for the first time

595
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,120
 she was overweight, which isn't something that sneaks up on you.

596
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,240
 But it seemed like someone's soul inhabited a body and it was like going from one location

597
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,840
 to another and ended up in the body of a fat woman.

598
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,640
 It's a really, really creepy video.

599
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,640
 Now, the most likely thing is that she has mental problems, she's on drugs, or she's

600
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,640
 drunk.

601
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,960
 Like, that's the most likely scenario.

602
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:03,020
 But it also looks like somebody's soul transferred into her body and took it over and realized

603
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:06,640
 this was not the right body for that soul.

604
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,640
 But again, who cares?

605
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,640
 You're gonna lose weight.

606
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,640
 Not a big deal.

607
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:16,200
 Then I made, then I figured maybe once the soul transfers, you can't lose weight.

608
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,120
 Like, I had to figure out a reason why she'd be freaking out, but it doesn't matter.

609
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,680
 It doesn't matter.

610
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,000
 It's just speculative conspiracy caps foiling on.

611
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,080
 I remember watching that video on a thing and that's what it seemed like.

612
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,360
 And I actually went and I had to refine the video again to put it in the show notes, because

613
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:34,060
 it had been years since I've seen it, but once I watched it, I had the same feeling.

614
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:37,420
 This was a new personality in an existing body.

615
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:40,020
 And actually it's a very chilling video to me.

616
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,220
 Some people say it's fake, which it very well could be.

617
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,060
 Some people said it's performance art, which it very well could be.

618
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,140
 I don't know.

619
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,340
 But it still creeps me out.

620
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,660
 Because to me, that's what it seems like.

621
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:57,740
 It seems like there was a woman there who had lived her entire life and then she disappeared

622
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:03,840
 and a new personality came out of that body, almost chosen at random.

623
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:10,440
 And then she looked around at her environment and she couldn't believe how fat she was.

624
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,160
 And reading this story reminded me of that.

625
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:17,080
 Is it possible that there was a tall man on his way to the airport?

626
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,760
 He had to pick up a gift and a scarf at the locker.

627
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:24,280
 He was getting ready to go on a journey to meet his fiancé.

628
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:29,700
 And something descended from the sky and took over his body.

629
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:34,740
 But because the air pressure, because there was something wrong with the transfer, it

630
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,900
 caused some anomalies.

631
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,860
 He was moving slow.

632
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,740
 He couldn't speak.

633
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:46,900
 And he was feeling something wrong in our environment.

634
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,780
 So much so that other people noticed.

635
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:53,300
 If this had happened in his house, he could have taken care of it by himself.

636
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,300
 He had all these witnesses.

637
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,660
 He could just walk around for a bit and go, "What's going on?

638
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,660
 I don't remember where I'm at."

639
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:01,520
 And he kept being drawn to that electrical outlet.

640
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,500
 And he could have just taken care of it at home.

641
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,380
 And how a man should electrocute himself.

642
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,700
 Don't do that in public, you pervert.

643
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:14,220
 But because he is in public and this transfer took place in public like the subway transfer,

644
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,420
 there's proof of this.

645
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:21,320
 Once he gets electrified, he just gets up and leaves "normal".

646
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,500
 He remembers now.

647
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,940
 But the person who was in that body before, what happened to them?

648
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,180
 Or to the woman on the subway?

649
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,020
 The personality that was in that body?

650
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:34,180
 What happened to them?

651
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:41,700
 We have this idea of aliens coming down their physical beings that we can interact with.

652
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:46,380
 Or we have this idea of reptilian shapeshifters taking over the planet and Queen Elizabeth

653
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:53,920
 lays on a giant rock to regulate her body temperature while laying eggs in Buckingham Palace.

654
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,920
 And that's fine.

655
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,920
 I mean, it's weird.

656
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,920
 It's super bizarre.

657
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:02,280
 But that's fine because, and I mentioned this on a previous episode this week on the "Pakarov

658
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,480
 Insects" episode, we can punch aliens.

659
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,800
 We can wrestle reptilians.

660
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:16,080
 But the idea of an alien race just beaming itself into our bodies?

661
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,380
 That's just terrifying.

662
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:22,940
 And it just would be completely at random that your body would be chosen to become a

663
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,940
 host.

664
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:28,700
 The idea of the reptilian shapeshifters ruling the planet is that they are reptilian shapeshifters.

665
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:32,460
 Or maybe you're Illuminati and you make a deal with the devil and you get possessed by

666
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,460
 a demon.

667
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:36,820
 These people are just walking down the street taking the subway, going to the airport.

668
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,820
 And then they are taken over.

669
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,460
 What chance do you have to fight against that?

670
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,340
 It's just luck?

671
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,700
 Unluck!

672
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:49,400
 I think unlucky is actually the word that determines unlucky.

673
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,400
 He was very unlucky over there.

674
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:58,800
 But you're just chosen, you're selected, your personality is wiped and you are now a prisoner

675
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,120
 in your own body.

676
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,120
 That sounds terrifying.

677
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:08,720
 It sounds absolutely terrifying.

678
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,480
 One day you're walking down the street and the next thing you feel is your eyes moving

679
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,860
 farther from your face.

680
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,860
 Very odd sensation.

681
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:22,000
 There's not really a way to put it into words.

682
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:29,760
 You feel like you're actually shrinking in your own physical body.

683
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:36,800
 And then you feel something slide between you and yourself.

684
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:43,300
 It's like sitting in the back of a bus and you're just watching the driver control everything.

685
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:48,600
 Take words for you, eat food for you, be you.

686
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,000
 And you are silent and frozen.

687
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,920
 You are just along for the ride.

688
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,640
 You can't scream for help.

689
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,760
 You watch this interloper go home and interact with your friends and your family and they

690
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:07,960
 don't even know that's not you.

691
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,600
 There's just enough of your personality left in there.

692
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:15,700
 You're the initial transfer which causes things to be a little odd.

693
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:21,180
 There's enough of your personality in there that they can access to pretend to be you.

694
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:27,340
 And you feel your heartbreak as your friends can't even tell you're trapped in your own

695
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,020
 body.

696
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:36,620
 You are just one of countless victims of interdimensional alien invaders.

697
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:44,960
 They will use your body until their mission is complete and then leave it for another.

698
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,280
 Under the control of this invader you see horrible things.

699
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,720
 You do horrible things.

700
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:57,200
 All to further the goals of these interlopers.

701
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:06,080
 You see exactly what these creatures have planned for our species.

702
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,740
 But you can't warn any of us.

703
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:20,540
 You can only bear witness to the indescribable inhumanity that soon awaits all of your fellow

704
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:26,940
 earthlings.

705
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:38,300
 Dead Rabbit Radio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.

706
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,640
 You don't have to listen to it every day.

707
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,200
 I'm glad you listened to it today.

708
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,260
 Have a great weekend guys.

709
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:49,260
 Bye.

710
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:56,260
 Bye.

711
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:12,260
 Bye.

712
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,840
 (upbeat music)

713
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:24,840
