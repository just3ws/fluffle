00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
 A war is currently being waged from Thailand all the way to the hippie section of your local supermarket.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,120
 And then we take a look at conspiracy theory that some people may say is crazy,

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,560
 while others say it's cute.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:26,240
 Is it possible that humans, or actually all animals, were created in the minds of plants today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:37,840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,080
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. Let's go ahead and get started here.

7
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,600
 First off, I want to give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Ryan O'Hara.

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,120
 Ryan O'Hara, thank you so much for supporting the show. Really, really means a lot. You're going to be our pilot,

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,120
 our captain, whatever vehicle we decide to take this episode, you're going to be in charge of.

10
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,680
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. Just help get the word out about the show.

11
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,640
 Really, really helps out a lot. So Ryan O'Hara, let's go ahead and hop in the Dead Rabbit Dreadnaught,

12
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:14,000
 our massive battleship, because this story is a war story. Go, go, go, go! We're all running up on the Dreadnaught.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,840
 Ryan O'Hara's got his little captain hat on. He brings a whip to me. Has it? Maybe he's a real captain in real life. I don't know.

14
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,640
 This is a war story. So as the Dead Rabbit Dreadnaught is getting closer to Thailand, I give you guys an

15
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,280
 inspirational speech that I'm not going to give now, because this is only a 35-minute podcast,

16
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,840
 but I give it everyone's in tears and clapping at the same time. They're actually catching their

17
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,240
 tears in their claps. It's amazing. And we get to the shores of Thailand. Go, go, go! We rush the beach,

18
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,080
 and what we see is there is currently a battle going on between PETA, the people for the Ethical

19
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:53,120
 Treatment of Animals, and coconut farmers. So not so much a battle, not so much a pitched armed conflict.

20
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,880
 It's just kind of a disagreement between two groups of people. What is going on? This is pretty

21
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,120
 interesting, because I didn't even know this was a thing. Usually when animals are involved in the

22
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,240
 production of something, usually they're the product. You eat pigs, right? Pigs aren't working

23
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:14,160
 at a textile factory and stuff like that, which would be... ooh, Babe 3. There we go. Make that

24
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,440
 movie. Make that movie. That's the plot. The whole movie's just with Babe the pig showing

25
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,760
 up at work, making a couple carpets, and then going home and being like, uh... there you go.

26
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,480
 Short film. Or a long one, if you really good at writing snappy dialogue. That's how it normally is

27
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,720
 the animals are the product. But what goes on in Thailand is you have these super, super high

28
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:40,240
 coconut trees. They get up to about 100 feet tall. Now a human can get 80 coconuts a day,

29
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:46,080
 but a monkey, a little monkey man, can get... this is nuts. I thought we were the dominant

30
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,200
 species. And we are. They can't come. Monkeys can't come up with great screenplays like Babe 3

31
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,800
 pigs in a blanket. Oh dude, yes! Write that script, somebody. Anyway, he makes blankets now at the

32
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,760
 textile factory, not rugs. Anyways, minor script note. We're the evolutionary king, but when it

33
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,080
 comes to coconut knocking down, that one thing, just that one thing, a human can get 80 coconuts a day.

34
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:18,400
 A male monkey can get 1600 coconuts a day. What? A female monkey can get like 800. So it's still like

35
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,080
 totally outpaces a dude, like a human dude. But a male monkey, I don't know what the difference

36
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,080
 would be between a male monkey and a female monkey. I know what the difference is between a male monkey

37
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,800
 and a female monkey. I don't know why they're able to work faster or... I don't know. The coconut

38
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:38,000
 ceiling is there even in the animal kingdom. It's a fur coated ceiling. So anyways, what happens is

39
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,480
 in Thailand, they go, "Well, we could have this dude climb up this super tall tree and it's really,

40
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,400
 really dangerous. And he can only get 80 coconuts a day." Or we can train monkeys to climb up these

41
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,560
 super tall trees. They're kind of dangerous. They whisper that to the monkeys. They don't have

42
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,640
 to. They don't understand English. But you can train a monkey... Well, they're not even speaking

43
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,760
 English over there. But anyways, the point is, is that you can train a monkey to knock down 1600

44
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,240
 coconuts a day. So the coconut farms are using the monkeys and PETA has said, "Stop drinking coconut

45
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,920
 water." They released some footage, right? So PETA went undercover. They went undercover as a coconut.

46
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,960
 They're like, "No, that's a really big coconut. It's going to take like five male monkeys to move

47
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:22,640
 around." It's a postgraduate student hiding in a giant coconut with a camera. They have this footage

48
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:28,480
 of monkeys and cages. And people... They go, "The monkeys are being abused." And when you put a monkey

49
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,920
 in a cage long enough, it goes insane. Now a normal monkey... Which I don't know if that's true. I mean,

50
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:40,720
 I think, one, I think anything in a cage has a higher likelihood to go insane. Two, how do you gauge?

51
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,960
 How do you gauge the insanity of a monkey? Like, you could probably go, "Oh, that's kind of weird.

52
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:51,840
 That's kind of weird. He has Joker make-up on. He's wearing a purple tux, right? That's the only

53
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,040
 signs of insanity. Psychiatrists are like, "You're fine. You man covered in blood. You don't have a

54
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,000
 purple tux on." I mean, you could tell a depressed monkey because he's not doing anything, but could

55
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,480
 you really tell an insane monkey unless you let him out of the cage and he attacked you? I'm sure

56
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:12,080
 someone can answer that question. I didn't do any research on that. They also said that monkeys in the

57
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,600
 wild live longer. So we got to free the monkeys and the way we'll free the monkeys is to stop supporting

58
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:24,720
 the coconut industry. No more coconut water. So NPR sent a journalist out for this. They have a

59
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,920
 section of their website called The Salt. It's their cooking section about food. And they actually

60
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:38,080
 visited the monkey training school in Saratthani, Thailand. And it's a Buddhist-inspired school.

61
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,560
 They chose a school that's using Buddhist training methods. So that may not be the standard way monkeys

62
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:51,600
 are trained over there. They talked to this guy who runs a school in Thailand. We teach them to pick

63
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,400
 coconuts, but we never threaten them. We never, ever threaten them and we definitely never use

64
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:03,840
 violence. Here's this quote from this teacher. "It is always relaxed. No shouting. No punishing.

65
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:10,960
 Every few trees, the monkey hugs his owner, who then checks the monkey for red ants. And the monkey

66
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:19,200
 gets a massage." What? If that's true, I want to be a monkey. I've never worked to jaw... I first

67
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,800
 off have never gotten a hug from any of my bosses. There's several laws. There's several U.S. state

68
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,840
 and federal laws to prevent that. I've never gotten a massage. The reason why they hug them,

69
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,240
 they hug... well, they hug the monkeys because they love them. But then they also check them for red

70
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,880
 ants. But still, who wouldn't want to hug from their boss? Who wouldn't want their boss to hug

71
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:45,040
 them and then check them for red ants? So you have the coconut farmers saying, "Listen, dude,

72
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,400
 we're hugging these monkeys. We're hugging them every couple of trees. We're hugging them so much,

73
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:56,480
 you might say. They're going crazy. I gotta say, guys, I'm torn on this one. Do I believe the animal

74
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,280
 rights people who believe that these monkeys are being exploited to do an incredibly dangerous job?

75
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:09,120
 Or do I believe that these monkeys are actually treated better than most workers on planet Earth?

76
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,040
 You decide. That's a new thing. I have because I have no other way to end this. You decide.

77
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,240
 You figure it out. I've given you half the facts and told jokes every three minutes. It's up to

78
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,120
 you now. That's a new segment. It's called You Choose because I have no other way to end that

79
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,240
 segment. That's the whole name of it. I copyright that title. Let's go ahead and leave behind Thailand.

80
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,280
 So Rhino-Hera, let's call in that carpenter copter. We're going to land here. We're hugging monkeys,

81
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,960
 and the monkeys are hugging us back. It's great. Couple of monkeys were insane. Some of you guys

82
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,240
 aren't going to be able to make the journey. I apologize for that. But join us next episode.

83
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,920
 Hopefully the insanity is not contagious. We're waving goodbye to the non-insane monkeys.

84
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:55,280
 We are flying out. So let's go ahead. I haven't done one of these in a long time. Let's do a

85
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:02,160
 dead rabbit recommends. Now this is an oddball one. Not an oddball because it's not good or because

86
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,040
 it's a controversial choice. A lot of you guys will be like, "What? I saw that when I was seven,

87
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:13,360
 bro. I saw that a long, long time ago. Well, I got news for you. Guys, I can't say the title without

88
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:22,080
 singing it. Little Shop. Little Shop of Horrors." Okay, okay. It would probably be easier to recommend

89
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,240
 if I could pronounce it correctly. Little Shop of Horrors. It still sounds like I'm butchering it.

90
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:35,040
 It was a 1986 musical. Before, it was written by the guys who wrote the music for Little Mermaid

91
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,600
 and Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin. And then one of them has gone on to steal He Writes Songs

92
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:45,360
 for Disney today. But before they became big, they wrote this movie for this small, small theater

93
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:53,040
 company in New York called Little Shop of Horrors. And it's about a plant that eats people. I loved

94
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,400
 this movie when I was 10. It was one of my favorite movies. I remember listening to the soundtrack

95
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,840
 all the time. Sabine had never seen it. My friend Sabine had never seen it. So I said, "Let's watch

96
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:11,360
 Little Shop of Horrors." And watching it as an adult, watching it 30 years later, the first thing

97
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:21,120
 that pops in your head, these special effects are top notch. I mean, the plant, Audrey II,

98
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,880
 the, it's a giant puppet. It's directed by Frank Oz, master puppeteer. First thing that strikes

99
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,000
 you is the practical effects. The music's great. I guess it's a musical, so that should be the first.

100
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,760
 I love the music I've been listening to, the soundtrack ever since, the past couple days,

101
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,720
 since I rewatched it. So if you haven't, so this, a lot of you guys are like, "Hey, I already saw

102
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,800
 this movie." When I was 10, yeah, it was pretty good, but you know, I'm looking for something new.

103
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,480
 Okay, if you haven't seen Little Shop of Horrors, you want to watch it. If you have seen it, so Sabine,

104
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:59,120
 like I said, Sabine had never seen it. I had never seen the director's cut. I had a copy of it.

105
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,600
 She comes over and I was like, "Hey, do you want to watch The Little Shop of Horrors?" So I put it in.

106
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:12,240
 It's not the same movie. It's not the same movie. It's not the same movie at all. All the songs,

107
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:18,160
 every single song is there. It's the exact same movie up until the last 20 minutes, which tends

108
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,840
 to be the most important part of a movie. This is the version that people were booing when they

109
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:29,600
 did test screenings of it and the film company, I think it was, what was it, New Line or Geffen or

110
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,360
 something like that, they weren't going to release it. But now, because it's such a classic, they

111
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,040
 did release it. So if you haven't seen, if you've already seen Little Shop of Horrors 10, 15, 20

112
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,800
 years ago, do yourself a favor and watch the director's cut. It becomes a horror movie in

113
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:53,040
 those last 20 minutes. It is not the same movie at all. I remember turning to Sabine and I go,

114
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,120
 "I have no idea what's going to happen next." I watch this movie my entire childhood. I know all

115
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,600
 the songs by heart. I have no idea what's going to happen in the next 20 minutes. It's great.

116
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,160
 So that's the Dead Rabbit Recommends, whether you've seen it or whether you're new to the world of

117
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:13,360
 Audrey 2, Mushnik's Flower Shop, Skid Row, all of that stuff. Maybe you're not Skid Row right now

118
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,680
 in the subway. My neighbors must be furious at me now because I just keep going, "Feed me.

119
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:29,040
 Feed me." I have-- it sounds like a horse when I do it. "Feed me, Seymour. Feed me. Oh, not long."

120
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:37,200
 That's right, boy. You can do it. Yeah. I'm waiting to get-- I'm waiting for my neighbors to all get

121
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,560
 re-- "Feed me, Seymour. I'm waiting-- definitely waiting at this point for all the neighbors to

122
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:49,600
 file a joint class-action restraining order against me. Oh, not long. Let's go ahead and move on to

123
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,440
 our next story." And actually, it's really a segue to this. Why is it just flying the

124
00:11:53,440 --> 00:12:00,960
 carbon helicopter in circles? He's like, "Dude, quit yelling in my air. Fade, Seymour. Got a little

125
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,280
 plant. Got a little plant. Little plant in my pocket. At least you hope it's a plant. Dap, dap, dap.

126
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:12,880
 Okay, I'll try to restrain from making more noise. I've just not even singing. I'm just like

127
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,000
 loudly and rhythmically stating a line. It's like the lowest level of singing. I'll try to refrain

128
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,240
 from making more little shop of horror noises. I'll try to learn how to pronounce the title as

129
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,960
 well, but watch it. But it's actually a good segue for our next story. Now, Ryan, go ahead and bring

130
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:34,640
 that carbon helicopter nice and low. We're going to land in a field of green splendor. I can't say

131
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:41,360
 that word either. Green splendor. Green? Don't you love it? Theater of the Mind. He's spent so much

132
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,320
 time trying to figure out what word I'm pronouncing. We land in a green pretty place.

133
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,560
 [Drums]

134
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,800
 Helicopter's landing there. We see grass as far as the eye can see if we're looking that way. If we

135
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:02,000
 turn around, we see more grass, but we see like a babbling brook and some tulips scattered about.

136
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,360
 Just kind of swaying in the wind. A little happy flowers. We look off to a distant mountain. We

137
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:13,840
 see it covered in everything from mighty redwoods to a little moss. To a little moss on the ground.

138
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,840
 We have really good vision. We can see all of that at a distance. We see the glimmer of the dew

139
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:23,600
 on the moss. It's a place of pure beauty, right? We have a tendency whether or not you're like a

140
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,560
 high-flying yuppie. Is that even a term anymore? Whether or not you're a high-flying business person?

141
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:35,600
 Or you're just working at a bookstore three days a week. Everyone loves to spend some time in the

142
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,960
 wilderness. At the very least, spend some time outside. You want to be in green spaces. Maybe

143
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,200
 not all the time. Maybe you're skewered to the forest like I am. Or flower shops because there

144
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:51,920
 may be man-eating plants there. But it does help rejuvenate the human being. It really does.

145
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:58,720
 I got this suggestion. It's hard to say. It's not really a suggestion. I got this theory from

146
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:05,520
 a long-time listener of the show, Smashers 25. So we're going to wave high. We see Smashers 25.

147
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,560
 We see your boyfriend, John, from Scar Group. Both of them have done artwork for the show.

148
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,000
 So we're going to wave to them. They're frolicking in a meadow. They're not paying attention to us.

149
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,560
 They'll listen to this episode later. Eventually, they'll realize we are waving the whole time.

150
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:26,160
 Plants lead the way for life. If you have an island with no plants, you have no life. You

151
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,760
 might have little microbes floating around in some tidal pool, but even then they're eating

152
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:37,760
 algae and stuff. Life goes. The march of biology goes where plants go. You can drop a bunch of

153
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:43,200
 animals on an island without a single blade of grass. There's a couple carnivores on there.

154
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:48,480
 They're going to have real good couple days, right? But they're eventually going to decimate the food

155
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,560
 source and then cannibalism erupts and then eventually it is a dead island. But once you

156
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:01,520
 have vegetation on an island, then you can have life continue. We don't exist without plants,

157
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:09,680
 but plants can exist without us. It's not as easy because animal life from insects to us

158
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:17,680
 help the plants survive. So how do we get into that cycle? How do we get into that cycle of

159
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,000
 evolutionary process? So let's put on our conspiracy caps right now. Everything we're

160
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,640
 going to talk about, you may go, "Oh, great. Is he talking about evolution again? Conspiracy cap on?

161
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:32,000
 Conspiracy cap on? I can say all sorts of crazy stuff. Let's put on our conspiracy caps here."

162
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,280
 This is the theory put forth by Smashers25. I may be butchering it. I may be butchering it a bit,

163
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:44,560
 but in a nutshell, get it? Oh, pun, pun, get it? Vegetable pun? Wait, or nut pun, whatever. It's a

164
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,000
 pun involving a plant. You get it? I didn't even get it. It was a mistake when I said it. I mean,

165
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,680
 it was a happy accident. So in a nutshell, huh? I'm still nudging you. I'm still nudging you.

166
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:02,080
 You're like, "I get it. I get it, bro. Okay, good. Just to make it sure." Plants dreamed us up.

167
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:12,240
 Plants created all animals as tulpas. Again, outside of little bacteria floating around in

168
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:19,840
 some tidal pool after a comet crashed into Earth, plants are the oldest life form on the planet.

169
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,920
 You have to have it first. You have a little algae floating around in a little tidal pool

170
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:31,280
 500 million years ago, and it's getting by. It can reproduce. It's getting some of that delicious

171
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:37,920
 sunlight. Oh yeah, it feels so good. And let me flip over. Oh, yeah, my back. This goes on for,

172
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,320
 you know, an uncomfortable amount of time. 100 years. Everyone's like, "Why is that algae keep

173
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,920
 flipping over?" You have these plants sitting out there, and they go, "My basic needs are met,

174
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:56,960
 but if I really, really, really want to survive, I need a couple things. I need really good soil,

175
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:03,440
 full of nutrients, and I need some way to reproduce." Now, before a little pear tree is like shaking

176
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,920
 stuff, shaking it around, trying to do that algae dance, pears would be falling out of it.

177
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:13,120
 You have flowers just sitting in a field, and the wind will blow their pollen,

178
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:23,760
 but it will only go so far. So a tulip dreams of a bumblebee, dreams of a creature that can actually

179
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:34,160
 carry its pollen miles away, dreams of birds that are specifically evolutionarily designed

180
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,440
 to feed off only one kind of flower. We look at it and go, "That's kind of weird. Why is this hummingbird

181
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:45,120
 have such a weird face?" Making fun of them, making fun of a hummingbird. We hope some woodpeckers

182
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,120
 show them what's what later on. It's very odd, because there's all these other flowers. There's

183
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:55,680
 all this other fruit. Why is a hummingbird designed to only drink out of this one particular flower?

184
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,760
 Why do we look at all of these, all creatures really? It's not just a couple of them. It's not

185
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:05,360
 just a couple weird, weird hummingbirds. All these creatures are designed to fit some sort of need.

186
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,600
 Now scientists, without its conspiracy cap on, would start saying a bunch of boring stuff, right?

187
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,920
 But we got our conspiracy caps on. The idea is this, is that plant life existed alone on this

188
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:24,800
 planet for millions of years. We are nothing but dreams of plants. We are all designed to help

189
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:34,560
 plants survive, either through spreading their pollen or by feeding them, i.e. dying and becoming

190
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:43,440
 fertilizer. We all serve a plant kind. Plants had hundreds of millions of years to do this. Reality,

191
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:51,760
 who we are, is simply a thought form of plant life. And because plant life is everywhere,

192
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,920
 because the biggest life forms we've ever found, there's two of them. One in Washington and one

193
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:06,640
 in Oregon. They're both fungus that goes on for miles. First, the plants wanted to create

194
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,880
 animals that would help them spread their seeds as far as possible, farther than the wind ever could.

195
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:19,920
 So they create insects and birds. Then they want to create animals that help fertilize the soil,

196
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:25,760
 help keep it healthy. We get mammals, we get land animals coming. I don't know what fish,

197
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,200
 I don't know what the fish have anything to do with this. They're just a fluke. They're a bad

198
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,600
 acid trip. The mushrooms are eating each other. They're like, "Uh, something's in the water,

199
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,400
 bro. Something's in the water." But anyways, and then a bunch of fish show up. It's not a perfect

200
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,360
 theory, okay? It's not a perfect theory, but conspiracy counts on. Smashers 25 had added

201
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:51,440
 this as well, where she said, "She believes that the plants created life to assist in plant

202
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,600
 domination." But the reason why we have carnivores, the reason why we have these predators,

203
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,800
 because a carnivore doesn't really help a plant. You can have an herbivore, even though it eats

204
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:09,760
 the plant, it actually helps weed out. Get it? Get it? Get it? I didn't plan that one either. I'm

205
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:15,680
 just still nudging you in the rib cage. You have a very sore rib cage this episode. It helped weed

206
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:22,160
 out the weak plants, and it would poop out seeds again and create fertilizer. A herbivore in the

207
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:28,960
 end helps plant kindness whole. So why did wolves show up? Why did killer gorillas show up? Was

208
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,560
 this regular gorillas? Really nice gorillas. Those non-crazy monkeys from Thailand. Why did you

209
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:40,720
 have all these other things show up? She said, "The carnivores are actually tulpas created by

210
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:48,480
 the fear of the herbivores." Just like the plants created them, they were willed into existence,

211
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:55,840
 and in this world they fear the darkness, they fear the death, they fear what's around the corner,

212
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:03,200
 and eventually hundreds of millions of years of fear created the wolf with sharp fangs,

213
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:09,280
 the eagle with talons meant to rip and rend. All of this stuff, all of these things that are night

214
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:15,600
 marriage are literal nightmarish. They are bred out of fear. She said, "Even if there wasn't a

215
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:22,160
 threat, you would still think about a threat." That constant fear over a long enough time span

216
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:28,560
 created the wolves. This really has a big thing of metaphysics, obviously. It's that we're able

217
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:35,760
 to apply rules of evolution and physics and observation to basically a dream. Plants created

218
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,880
 herbivores, herbivores, fears created carnivores, and we think that we can look through

219
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,000
 microscope and see all these things, but we're really just inhabitants of a plant's dream.

220
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,880
 They wished us up and they can wish us out of existence. We are just things to sustain them.

221
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:02,800
 But this is where I'm going to deviate from Smasher's 25s theory. I don't think that the herbivore,

222
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,480
 if this theory is true, again, conspiracy cap fully on it, the herbivores didn't create the

223
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:13,440
 carnivores. It's all plants. We've talked about Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Certain things need

224
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:21,280
 to be met to really have a fulfilling life. So why would that stop at humans? Because humans are

225
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:28,080
 just animals, right? Food and shelter are the basic levels of this need pyramid. Plants got that,

226
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:33,120
 right? Shelter, they really need that. I mean, if there's a big windstorm, they're not going to,

227
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,320
 you know, have a lot of fun. They're not going to have a lot of fun. Hopefully their roots work

228
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,680
 pretty well. But the food is just sunlight and water. They can be adapted to whatever

229
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:47,200
 environment they're in, the desert or not desert. I think that's kind of the only two choices,

230
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,960
 not in the cold, not in like Antarctica. Then we look at things like procreation. Again, they can do

231
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:59,200
 that by themselves, but they dream up birds and insects. They dream up creatures that are specifically

232
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,400
 designed to help them pollinate. Take a little something, something on the side. Take it home,

233
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:10,800
 make some beehive, have a little bunch of baby bees. But at the end of the day, we are dreaming up the

234
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:17,840
 bees to pollinate us. But to keep pollinating us, they also have to reproduce as well.

235
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,960
 Another level of Maslow's hierarchy of needs is community. And you can't have a community of

236
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,880
 plants without really, really good soil. And this is where you would have the bigger herbivores

237
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:38,160
 walking around. They dream up oxen and cow and antelope. So again, not only so they can eat the

238
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:44,480
 plants and then poop out the seeds 100 miles away, but when you have these giant beasts dying and just

239
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:51,040
 even from their poop, you're creating fertilizer for plants to grow. All of the herbivores, they are

240
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:57,600
 dreamt up only to serve the plants at the end. But another level of the hierarchy of needs

241
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:04,080
 is safety. If you had herbivores, if you had nothing but herbivores, they're dumb. They're,

242
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:11,440
 they're probably the dumbest of all animals. So they would eat every last plant on the planet.

243
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:18,640
 You need protection. Sometimes you can wish for someone to poop on you, right? You go,

244
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,720
 "You know what? I try that once or twice. Let someone poop on me." But if they keep showing

245
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,520
 up and pooping on you and even worse, eating you afterwards or before, it doesn't matter.

246
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:35,200
 You know, disgusting. You need protection. So they dreamt up the carnivores to keep the herbivores

247
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,720
 in line. Plus it also probably gives plants a little bit of energy. I mean, if you were an oak tree

248
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,080
 and you're sitting there for a hundred years, things would kind of get boring. And you're like,

249
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:49,840
 "Oh man, I heard, I heard that those tulips over there thought of a new thing. They call it a wolf.

250
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,120
 Let's see what it's like." And he sees these deer. He's like, "Oh yeah, those

251
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,280
 deer are always pooping on me. I mean, it's cool and all, but it's a little gross." And then he

252
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:07,040
 sees this, this creature up here. Just magically, it was the very first wolf. It's oak trees.

253
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:11,120
 He's like, "Oh dude, this is going to be totally awesome." He sees the cornfield over there. He's

254
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:17,680
 like, "Dude, can you pop yourself real quick?" Oak trees eating this popcorn. This is getting

255
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:23,440
 ridiculous. He's watching the wolf eat these deer. Give him a little bit of entertainment.

256
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,480
 Also give him protection. You have this list of needs and everything's fit. It really except

257
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,480
 for the top one. And that's where humans come into this whole thing. This is how plants dreamt

258
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,960
 up humans. You have all these needs met, but a bumblebee can't admire the beauty of a flower.

259
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:49,600
 An antelope looks for the most delicious plant, but doesn't ever call it back in the morning.

260
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:59,600
 Humans love plants. We sing to them. We lovingly water them. We have them in our houses

261
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:05,520
 so we can admire their beauty. We'll have them outside of our houses so other people can go,

262
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,480
 "Look at those beautiful roses." We give them to each other as signs of affection.

263
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:18,720
 We'll throw in a backpack, drive 50 miles, and spend a week surrounded by lush greenery.

264
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:28,400
 Humans love plants. And that was the one thing that plant life was missing in this world.

265
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:35,360
 Was someone to say goodnight to it when the lights went out. For people to smile at it

266
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:43,120
 when they see it on the windowsill. To cultivate it in mass numbers. After natural disasters,

267
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:53,280
 who replants the forests? Humans. We are all but a dream. Drumped up by a dreamer whose mind we

268
00:26:53,280 --> 00:27:02,000
 can never truly ever comprehend. Something older, something far more advanced than what we call the

269
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:10,880
 human psyche. It's interconnected across the globe. And we are simply individuals living out our lives.

270
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:21,680
 All of our problems big and small, just dreams had by other dreams. You can have plants without

271
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:29,120
 animals, but you cannot have animals without plants. If all other living things disappeared on this

272
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:37,360
 planet today, plants would get by. They'd get by. They'd still be able to pollinate. They'd still be

273
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:44,800
 able to wiggle around in the dirt, suck up some extra nutrients. They'd get by just okay.

274
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:52,480
 All of these dreams that they dreamt up to help them survive made life easier, allowed them to

275
00:27:52,480 --> 00:28:00,080
 expand farther, but they'd be fine. The one thing they would miss the most though would be the humans.

276
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:06,640
 Because the humans weren't created so much to help them survive, but to help them thrive.

277
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:13,760
 To help them appreciate how beautiful they were, how elegant they looked.

278
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:23,440
 It would be a very lonely planet if there were no animals. And in the moments when you're lonely,

279
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:32,000
 have you ever daydreamed? Have you ever imagined, created new worlds in your head, fictional universes,

280
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:40,400
 alternate takes on your real life? Imagine if you did that for hundreds of millions of years.

281
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:49,760
 It would be brought into reality just by sheer force of will. We are but the dreams of the dreamer.
