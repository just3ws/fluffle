1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 How much money would you pay to own a truly cursed item?

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,300
 And then?

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,000
 We take a look at what's in your wallet.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,300
 Money.

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,500
 Is this just a way to purchase goods?

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,700
 Or does it hold a secret truth?

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,800
 A pathway to oblivion.

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,800
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:29,300
 [music]

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,100
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,100
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:33,900
 I'm having a great day.

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,200
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,100
 I hope you guys had an awesome weekend.

15
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,600
 I do want to do a Thanksgiving special.

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,300
 I'll figure out what time of the day we're going to do it on,

17
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,900
 but it's something we've done since the inception of the show.

18
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,800
 I want to keep that tradition going.

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,100
 So don't make any plans with your family.

20
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,600
 Buy no airplane tickets.

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,600
 Wait for instructions to nothing

22
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,400
 until I announce when we are having our Thanksgiving special.

23
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,400
 It'll be fun.

24
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,700
 Those are always really fun.

25
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,900
 Speaking of fun, someone who's always a fun guy,

26
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,300
 coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now is one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

27
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,900
 Give it up for Diamond.

28
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,700
 Everyone give a round of applause for Diamond.

29
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,500
 Walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

30
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,400
 And now we locked the doors.

31
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,600
 Diamond's locked in.

32
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,000
 He can't get out because he is going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,100
 So he has no choice.

34
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,300
 You're going to be our captain or pilot.

35
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,700
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

36
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,200
 It just helps spread the word about the show.

37
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,300
 Really, really helps out a lot.

38
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,600
 Diamond, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

39
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,200
 We are headed all the way out to Canada.

40
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,400
 Actually, I went to Washington the other day right across the river.

41
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,700
 I mean, Sabine went to this old gas station.

42
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,200
 They sold porno mags still.

43
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,500
 I didn't even know these things even existed.

44
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,600
 Porno magazines.

45
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,200
 Do you remember those?

46
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,800
 Insane.

47
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,600
 And it kind of makes sense.

48
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,800
 We were thinking about that that area is a little more rural.

49
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,100
 So you may not have the best internet access

50
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,800
 or you may want to like, I don't know, hide it from your wife or something like that.

51
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,700
 But yeah, porno magazines.

52
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,800
 They still make those.

53
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,300
 It's so bizarre.

54
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,900
 I would have been less shocked if I came across the human skeleton.

55
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,800
 At least I know those still exist in some way.

56
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,800
 We're headed up to Canada.

57
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,900
 Speaking of human skeletons, we're headed up to Canada

58
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,100
 because we're going to visit the Skoll store.

59
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,700
 Skollstore.ca.

60
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,700
 If you got some money burning all in your bucket, you can go to the Skoll store

61
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,500
 and they buy and sell fossils, oddities, artifacts, things like that.

62
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,700
 And I was researching another story and I came across this is so bizarre.

63
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,900
 Now, I know that there are groups out there like this that sell these items,

64
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,800
 but this one had some particularly bizarre items.

65
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,000
 They do have like fossils.

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,900
 Like they have a fossilized turtle and that was going for like a hundred thousand Canadian dollars.

67
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,300
 So like in real money, that's I don't know, probably like 15 US bucks.

68
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:49,200
 But you have that and then you had like a wooly mammoth Skoll.

69
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,800
 If you wanted a real wooly mammoth Skoll, if you can pronounce the word wooly people like,

70
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,900
 what are you saying?

71
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:01,500
 You know, the elephants that had fur, the wooly mammoth, they have a skull of those.

72
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,600
 That's really dope.

73
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,600
 They have this one really cool thing.

74
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:10,200
 It is a Necromancer mask made out of real human bones.

75
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,600
 So it's this big ornate mask.

76
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,800
 It looks like something that someone would wear in a movie.

77
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,700
 You're like just basic clothes, Jason.

78
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,800
 You know, I mean, like it's super well designed and like the face opening is this giant John.

79
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:32,600
 It's made out of all of these bones and they're actually taken from the bones of monks or other people who have died on mountains.

80
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,500
 And you're looking at it and you're like, that's probably cursed, right?

81
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,500
 But maybe not.

82
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,000
 Maybe all those people died nice deaths at the top of mountains, but it is real cool.

83
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,700
 It's this Necromancer mask.

84
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,800
 And it's not like they made it.

85
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,600
 It's a traditional Necromancer mask.

86
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,800
 They were able to get a hold of.

87
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:53,700
 They also have this skull called the Necromancer mask is sold out.

88
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:59,300
 So if you're going to the website right now to buy it, but here's something you can buy for twenty two thousand Canadian dollars.

89
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:04,100
 It's the skull of a human, a chief from the Solomon Islands.

90
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:09,600
 And the way the skull is decorated, it has bone extra bones attached to it.

91
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:16,400
 It has like the ceremonial bone jewelry and he looks like the crazy frog from those ads.

92
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,000
 Remember those ads back in the two thousands of the frog with the little penis and the goggles?

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,700
 And he was doing the cell phone dance.

94
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,500
 That's what you're talking about.

95
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,700
 And I said the podcast off 20 minutes ago.

96
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,500
 Crazy frog, crazy frog.

97
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,800
 If you look at this and you can be yours for twenty two thousand dollars, this skull and the goggles look like crazy frog.

98
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,100
 It's super bizarre.

99
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,100
 And the wooly mammoth school I'm looking is only fifteen thousand Canadian frogs.

100
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,900
 So you can get this stuff.

101
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,900
 But all of that stuff could be cursed, might be cursed.

102
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,900
 You might have a ghost wooly mammoth walking around stomping on you because you can't pronounce his name.

103
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:58,500
 But I came across this item and out of all of them, this has to be the most cursed and it seems.

104
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,400
 Awful to even own.

105
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,300
 No one's bought it yet.

106
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,600
 It's actually on sale.

107
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
 It's 50% off.

108
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,000
 It used to be twelve thousand five hundred Canadian dollars.

109
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,400
 Now it's only going for six thousand.

110
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,800
 It's called choked to death.

111
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,800
 It's a wet specimen that that means its tissue that is preserved either in like a jar.

112
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,000
 It's preserved with preservatives, right?

113
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,300
 Put a little salt.

114
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,300
 It's basically it still looks like the muscle tissue and everything like that.

115
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,800
 It just has all these preservatives in it choked to death.

116
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,700
 And there's a photo of this.

117
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,800
 It is the preserved.

118
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
 And I you just can't stop staring at it.

119
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,100
 It's so bizarre.

120
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:46,300
 It's the preserved tongue, windpipe, heart and lungs.

121
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,300
 So it's this whole thing.

122
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,000
 Tongue, windpipe, heart and lungs.

123
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,100
 All you know how those go in the human body of a six month old child.

124
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,500
 That choked to death on a marble.

125
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,600
 And the marble is still lodged in the windpipe.

126
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:14,100
 And you can clearly see in the photo, you can clearly see a marble stuck at the top of the windpipe.

127
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,800
 It does state in its description this item is not for everyone.

128
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,800
 I'm sure they've gotten a lot of complaints about this.

129
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,700
 The necromancer's mask, the bones from Hypa Mountain, the Solomon Chief's skull, things like that.

130
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,700
 They have mummy parts.

131
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,500
 They have like a mummy hand and a mummy foot.

132
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,100
 It's a really cool website to look at, but I bet you they're getting.

133
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,100
 This was the item that was half off.

134
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,300
 I bet you they're getting a lot of complaints about it.

135
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:42,300
 They say it's not for everyone, but it can make a powerful addition to any reference collection.

136
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,500
 Which I think someone who buys that isn't buying it because they're a windpipe doctor.

137
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:54,700
 Maybe, maybe, but I would imagine it's either it's either a legit necromancer.

138
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:59,700
 You buy the mask, you get the windpipe for free, or it's just some weirdo.

139
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,000
 But I got to admit, like it is fascinating to look at.

140
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,200
 I would be hard pressed to have that in my collection.

141
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,200
 Absolutely horrible.

142
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,700
 What an awful relic, right?

143
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,700
 That thing has to be haunted.

144
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,000
 That thing has to be cursed.

145
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Six month old.

146
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,200
 Talk about not--

147
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:23,600
 And you know, I bet you anything, the way they got hold of this was the body was donated to science.

148
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:30,200
 But this, you imagine, you are just going to be like, I don't know, like some scientists are like,

149
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,000
 "We've cured this disease.

150
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,400
 Thank you, body."

151
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,100
 But really, I mean, they probably just turned their hands into pink-plunk paddles

152
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,800
 because they're bored and your head goes to the dentistry school and things like that.

153
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,600
 And this kid ended up being in a museum.

154
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,000
 Absolutely bizarre.

155
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,600
 Absolutely bizarre.

156
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,700
 A cursed item if I've ever, ever seen one.

157
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,500
 But Daimon, we got one more destination to go in this episode.

158
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,700
 I'm going to go ahead and give you the keys to the carbonar copter.

159
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,800
 We are leaving behind the Skoll Museum.

160
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,700
 We are headed all the way out to Ancient Rome.

161
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,900
 [imitates the sound of the car]

162
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,600
 This is a personal conspiracy theory of mine.

163
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,100
 It's one I've had for a long time.

164
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:14,600
 Let's see.

165
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,900
 I've thought about it over the years.

166
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:24,100
 Let's see if I can put it as eloquently into words as I imagine it is in my head.

167
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,600
 Money.

168
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,400
 What is money?

169
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:26,800
 Right?

170
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,200
 Money is a way to exchange your labor for goods.

171
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,600
 I do labor, I get money, I use that money to buy goods.

172
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,800
 It's basically what it is.

173
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,000
 It's a way to exchange things.

174
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,800
 I don't have to, I no longer have to carry a hundred pickles to the store to get two racks of lamb.

175
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,300
 We use money.

176
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:54,800
 Now people call it different things, but money seems to be the most universal terminology.

177
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,200
 When you look at other languages, their words often break down to money.

178
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,400
 Now I'm not a linguist.

179
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:09,400
 I'm sure there's some skrillic or swillic Russian word for something else, but I think you guys get where I'm going.

180
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,400
 Where does the word "money" come from?

181
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,300
 This is important because words mean things.

182
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:22,800
 Money comes from the word, the Latin word "moneta," which means money.

183
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,400
 "Moneta" means money.

184
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,000
 It's also known as a place for printing money.

185
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,400
 Like a mint.

186
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,900
 "Moneta" means money.

187
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,600
 Means mint.

188
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,000
 We go back to ancient Roman times.

189
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,700
 We're talking about 200 BC around this time period.

190
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,300
 We all know about Juno.

191
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:42,900
 Maybe you don't.

192
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,700
 Juno is the Roman version of the goddess Hera.

193
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:54,500
 So they're both goddesses. Hera was wife to Zeus, mother of Hercules or Heracles.

194
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:07,800
 When the Romans absorbed the Greek culture and took it over, renamed her Juno, she had the same role, wife of Jupiter, daughter of Saturn.

195
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,900
 And she was the patron of Rome.

196
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,900
 She was the goddess of the empire.

197
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:25,700
 And so when the empire started printing this money and holding this coin, they began to do it in the temple of Juno.

198
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,200
 Because she oversaw all the empire.

199
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,700
 She protected everything.

200
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:36,100
 And what powers a government more than its gods and its treasury?

201
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:41,800
 So her name became Juno Moneta.

202
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,600
 And that was where they printed their money.

203
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,700
 That's where they kept their gold and their silver.

204
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:51,900
 They had this vast treasury in this temple in central Rome.

205
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,500
 In the city.

206
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,800
 We don't know where it's at this day.

207
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,600
 We have an idea.

208
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,500
 It was pretty well labeled on old maps, but we can't figure out where it was this day.

209
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,500
 Juno Moneta.

210
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,400
 Juno went by many different last names.

211
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,900
 She also went by Juno Regina, which meant the queen.

212
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,800
 But Juno Moneta meant this is where the money is made.

213
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,700
 But what does Moneta mean?

214
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:22,200
 And there are some historians who go, "Moneta," and we're talking about when I say historians, we're talking historians like Cicero,

215
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,000
 who are around more contemporary than we are today.

216
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,200
 He's writing this back in the day.

217
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,600
 He goes, "Moneta means to warn."

218
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,900
 And here is why Juno got the name Juno Moneta.

219
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:43,500
 Once there was a giant earthquake that shook Rome.

220
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:51,400
 And while the earthquake was going on, a voice emanated from Juno's temple

221
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:57,400
 in Rome saying, "Sacrifice a pregnant cow to me."

222
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,300
 And so they did.

223
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,800
 There was another time there was an invasion coming.

224
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:09,600
 And Juno, the goddess Juno, she had a flock of sacred geese.

225
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,300
 And these geese scattered.

226
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,200
 They get to migrate earlier than they should.

227
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,400
 That was a warning sign that an invading army was coming.

228
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:26,300
 So because of these events, she earned the name Juno Moneta, the goddess who warns.

229
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:31,600
 And when they started printing the money in the temple, they started calling it money

230
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,100
 because it was in the Moneta temple.

231
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,500
 And I'm looking at my notes here.

232
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,200
 The temple was built on Capitoline Hill overlooking the Roman Forum.

233
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:43,700
 This was in central, I mean, like you couldn't do the business of the day without seeing this temple.

234
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,300
 That's how important this was.

235
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,500
 And this is where the money was meant.

236
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:52,200
 And so Juno who warns, the goddess who warns, that's where you're printing the money.

237
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:58,100
 Juno Moneta's temple, so Moneta became short for gold, treasury, things like that,

238
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,400
 which then got shortened to money.

239
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:07,300
 That's what historians have been saying for a long time, but modern day historians have discovered

240
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,800
 there's a problem with that story.

241
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:17,200
 The name Moneta was in constant usage before the warnings.

242
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,600
 Not Juno Moneta, but the goddess Moneta.

243
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:28,700
 The goddess Moneta existed before Juno.

244
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:35,100
 You had tribes, as Rome was first being formed, you had tribes of people

245
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:40,700
 who were worshiping a goddess named Moneta.

246
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:46,900
 And when the Romans took everything over as they did, they took the gods, they took the cultures,

247
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:53,100
 they mishmashed it together, and then the original Moneta was lost to history.

248
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:58,500
 This original pagan deity that was preached to, we don't know anything about.

249
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:07,600
 Her name became an adjective to warn and was applied to their patron god, Juno.

250
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,900
 The reason why I'm giving you that little history lesson

251
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:19,700
 is because I think money is a god,

252
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,300
 and it is a god that we all pray to every single day.

253
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,400
 Now, I'm not saying god in a sense that there shall be no other gods before me,

254
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,300
 you know, the easier for a rich man to crawl through the eye of an angel.

255
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,300
 I'm not talking about that, like we worship money as an abstract god.

256
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:40,800
 I'm saying when we say I need more money,

257
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,300
 you're calling for that god into your life.

258
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:50,500
 I don't have enough money if only I had more money.

259
00:14:50,500 --> 00:15:01,100
 You're crying out, you're psychically crying out to a pagan god that existed before Rome.

260
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:07,400
 Think about how slick you would have to be to pull something like that off.

261
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,600
 If you wore a deity and you're watching your followers get swallowed up

262
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,300
 and you knew if no one believed in you, you would be powerless,

263
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,600
 who else could pull something like this off?

264
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,300
 Even if you think about Lucifer, right?

265
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,700
 This would be something that he might want to do, corrupting mankind,

266
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,700
 but even he doesn't have the clout as money.

267
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,300
 He gives out money.

268
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:35,600
 People sell their soul to Lucifer to make money, but he's still secondary to money.

269
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,500
 Moneta.

270
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:42,400
 You could call it cash, you could call it cheddar, you could call it cheese.

271
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,500
 But what we're really talking about is money.

272
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,900
 Call it denaro, call it fronks, call it deutschmarks,

273
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,400
 but what we're really talking about is money.

274
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:02,900
 And money is the name of a god and it is the only outside of people who are devoutly religious.

275
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:07,700
 It is the only god that people talk about every single day.

276
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:14,000
 What if Moneta is real?

277
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,200
 What if Moneta is an ancient deity who is prayed to billions of times a day

278
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:27,400
 and it is the only god who is also worshiped by people who do worship a god?

279
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:33,100
 And I think we've met people who were devout who say, "You need more Jesus in your life."

280
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:38,700
 But we say to each other, "I don't have enough money. I just need more."

281
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:43,900
 And it's something you always need more of.

282
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:50,700
 Even the wealthiest of people want more money.

283
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,300
 My conspiracy theory is that Moneta is real.

284
00:16:54,300 --> 00:17:01,100
 And instead of being erased from the world, having all of her followers swallowed by the Roman Empire

285
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,500
 and just becoming an adjective, she played the greatest trick on humanity ever.

286
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:11,200
 She made it so every man, woman, and child worships her every single day

287
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:18,700
 from the second they can conceive of money to the moment they die.

288
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,100
 They are worshiped.

289
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:25,600
 There's no break in faith. There's no going to college and going, "I want to explore other religions."

290
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,700
 You do that stuff, but you still need money.

291
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:37,400
 And the craziest thing about this conspiracy theory is, if it's true, there's nothing you can do about it.

292
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,900
 Doesn't matter who you are, what generation you were born in,

293
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,700
 how long you live,

294
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:50,100
 you will always at some point in your life

295
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,000
 cry out, "I need more money."

296
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,600
 And in the second you do, you have worshiped her.

297
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:05,800
 She might be the most powerful deity walking on this earth.

298
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:11,500
 We don't know she exists, but we say her name every single day.

299
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,800
 We pray to her every single day.

300
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,500
 And if you ask people, "What do you think runs the world?"

301
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,100
 They'll always give you the exact same answer.

302
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,400
 Money.

303
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,100
 I guess they're right.
