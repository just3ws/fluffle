1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,220
 One swamp. One name. But two terrifying origin stories.

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:15,300
 And then we take a look at a man who's done the one thing we all want to do. He peed on

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,980
 a spaceship today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:29,720
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

5
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,680
 Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. This week's

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,900
 been kind of dark. Some dark stories yesterday. I was about to shoot his mom. So I figured,

7
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:44,300
 you know what? We're going to do some lighthearted stories today. So we got more tales of human

8
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,100
 troubles but they're not, they don't involve people shooting their own mothers. So you

9
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,520
 know, there you go. That's a bonus.

10
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,060
 Speaking of bonuses, here comes in our newest Patreon supporter, Liam Boucher. Liam Boucher,

11
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,220
 everybody give a round of applause to him as he's walking in. Apparently Boucher is

12
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:07,860
 butcher in French or Quebec Wheeze. So he's already turning around walking out. He's

13
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,660
 refunding his money. No, no, no, no, come back. Liam is juggling cleavers. He's going to be

14
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,500
 our captain or pilot this episode. If anything needs to get chopped up, he's going to do

15
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,500
 it. That's our guy.

16
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,740
 He's saying, he's saying, he's saying, it's just my last name, bro. Are you an actual

17
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:26,380
 carpenter? Well, I don't know. Maybe. I never tried. Whether or not you're a carpenter or

18
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:30,140
 a Boucher. If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too. Just help get the word about

19
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,540
 the show. Really, really helps out a lot. Liam, toss me one of those cleavers. I'm going

20
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:40,100
 to toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgible. We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

21
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,580
 We are headed out too.

22
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:47,460
 Durgible is flying out to Florida. While we're going out there, I wanted to talk to you guys

23
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,020
 a little bit about yesterday's episode, not the whole shoot in the mall thing. I did that

24
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,980
 new Prophecy Watch segment where I want to start highlighting these prophecies that get

25
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:02,020
 people really worried in the conspiracy community and notate them because otherwise they just

26
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:07,180
 disappear. And Dark Outpost, yesterday we covered DarkOutpost.com, the best piece of

27
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:12,740
 entertainment that I have found since Hans. And I didn't find it. Dr. Hare recommended

28
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,980
 it to me. I don't think he even realized the deep, the deep, deep well of entertainment

29
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,940
 value out of this website. DarkOutpost.com, they made this claim that the National Guard

30
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:27,780
 was going to arrest Joe Biden. And, but Joe Biden's like a clone now, so they weren't

31
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,500
 even arresting the original Joe Biden. He's already in Guantanamo Bay. They were arresting

32
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,020
 his clone for some reason. I actually dug more into it after I recorded that episode.

33
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:41,660
 And Obama's in Guantanamo Bay, but his clone was there. So they were going to put the clone

34
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,740
 on trial. Poor clones, right? They just got cloned. They don't know what's going on.

35
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:49,340
 They didn't do any of this stuff. And then Mike Pence's clone and all this stuff. So

36
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,620
 they were going to arrest all these clones, which seems like just a waste of energy, right?

37
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,900
 You already have the original people in Guantanamo Bay. National Guard is going to take over.

38
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,420
 Trump was never going to leave the presidency, all this stuff. To their credit, to DarkOutpost's

39
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:07,060
 credit, they did not remove the article. I kind of thought that they might because

40
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,100
 we knew it wasn't going to happen. But for weeks, people had been talking about this.

41
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,420
 They didn't remove the article. So that was very interesting. They did move it from their

42
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,860
 front page. You now have to search for it, but I'm still going to give a little tip

43
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:22,540
 of my hat for them not removing the article wholesale. That's all the tip of the hat they

44
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:30,340
 get. I have to say this. Yesterday I listened to their episode about that, about the 10

45
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,140
 Days of Darkness. I listened to it twice because I couldn't believe what they were

46
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,860
 saying and not in the sense that I couldn't believe the conspiracy theories because I

47
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,860
 hear that stuff all the time. About five minutes into the podcast or video. It's like a video,

48
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:48,580
 but you just listen to people. You don't have to watch it. It's one guy named David Zyblek.

49
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:53,300
 About five minutes into the video, he says, "Hey, guys, so before I tell you about this

50
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,220
 whole clone thing, you know the thing you clicked on, the thing you want to listen to?"

51
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:05,340
 Let me tell you, do you have Parkinson's or cancer or methylthemioma or Parkinson's?

52
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:11,660
 Do you have dementia? I might because I mentioned those twice. Do you have any of these horrible

53
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:18,180
 illnesses that we wouldn't wish on our worst enemy? Well, if you do, I have the not cure,

54
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,020
 not cure, but something that will make it better. Something that will make all your

55
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:26,580
 cancer worries go away. I'm listening to this and I'm like, seriously, of course I know

56
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:31,180
 you're going to talk about clones and doppelgangers and things like that, but now you're also

57
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,140
 selling snake oil. I don't know why I was surprised. I guess I wasn't surprised, but

58
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,900
 I was shocked by this. As he's talking about this, did you have cancer or does a loved

59
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:45,300
 one have cancer, which is such a horrible pitch, right? But anyways, he goes, "You can

60
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,060
 call Jeanette. Jeanette will tailor a plant and I kind of caught my attention. I'm like,

61
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:58,500
 call somebody. What are you talking about? This is a video broadcast on the web." What

62
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,460
 I would assume, really, you have a worldwide audience. I honestly think Dark Outpost is

63
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:08,340
 going to become one of the biggest conspiracy theory channels out there. It's been around

64
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:14,100
 for a long time. I think it's in a position to outmaneuver Alex Jones. That's my prophecy

65
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,140
 that Dark Outpost is going to blow up, but he's doing this video. He's releasing this

66
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:24,580
 video and he goes, "Call Jeanette." I look over at the bottom of the screen is Jeanette's

67
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:29,500
 phone number, her full phone number. It's like, "Call her." Then he says it out loud

68
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,500
 just in case you're driving. "Call Jeanette." I'm like, "What? Why are you asking people

69
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,580
 on the internet to call this woman to cure their cancer?" Now, to be fair, he's not

70
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:44,340
 saying it'll cure their cancer for obvious legal reasons, but it will make things better.

71
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:49,340
 She can tailor a health plan for your cancer. I'm looking at this and her phone number is

72
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:55,020
 flashing on the screen. It's not like a 976 number. It doesn't even exist. It's not like

73
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,700
 a toll-free number. It looks like her home or business line. I'm thinking, "How is this

74
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,500
 woman not..." I'm not encouraging this, but I'm thinking, "How has this woman not got

75
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:13,500
 10 calls a day asking to cure dick cancer?" How is this not happening? His audience may

76
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:20,420
 have less weirdos than the internet as a whole, but I don't think so. Then he begrudgingly.

77
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:25,980
 This is so fascinating. He hasn't even gotten to the clone stuff. He tells you to call her.

78
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:31,820
 He's like, "Just call her if she doesn't pick up the phone." She's watching TV and

79
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:36,980
 the phone rings. She's like, "No, I do not have to cure for dick cancer." Click. Not

80
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,980
 only does he say, and again, I'm not encouraging that at all, but I'm just shocked that it doesn't

81
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:47,500
 really happen. He goes, "If you don't want to call her and you should," he keeps pushing.

82
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:52,460
 He might be doxing this woman. He might be his ex-wife or something. He goes, "If you

83
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,420
 don't want to call her and you should, that's the best way to get hold of her. She may not

84
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:01,380
 pick up the phone. She may be ironing a shirt or something like that." You can email her,

85
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:06,420
 and he's super down on the fact that some people want to use email. Then he gives her

86
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:12,900
 email address out, letter by letter, like the oldest man in the world, like Dorfwood.

87
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,540
 The no joke, the email account for Dark Outpost or maybe for him, I didn't get it. I just

88
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:24,100
 listened to the episode twice. They use an AOL email account, which is just so quaint.

89
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:31,540
 It's so adorable. It's like thetruthseekers@aol.com that gave me a chuckle. Like I said though,

90
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:36,420
 they've been around for a long time. And then, before he even gets to the clone, at this

91
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,660
 point we're half hour into the episode. If I chase him to this point, we're half hour

92
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,740
 into this episode. You haven't gotten to the swamp yet. We may be half hour into DarkOutpost.com.

93
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,260
 And again, I'm working. I'm doing dead rabbit stuff. I'm filling out forms and trying to

94
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,580
 make the website look better. I'm listening to this, and I realized that for the past

95
00:07:53,580 --> 00:08:02,180
 five minutes he said nothing. But, so this is how you unzip a file. So I'm going to

96
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:07,660
 send you a file, and it's called a zip file. Now with a Mac, it's going to be called a

97
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:15,940
 stuffed file. But you're going to take this zipped file, the Z-I-P-P-E-D file, and then

98
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:23,700
 you're going to have to download a program to unzip it. Now I use 7-zip. That's the

99
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:32,460
 number 7 Z-I-P. And then you get this and you will extract. I'm like, here's the thing.

100
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:38,100
 He knows his audience. He knows his audience. He has no idea what a zip file is. And what

101
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,700
 they're trying to unzip. Apparently if you're like a DarkOutpost+ member or something like

102
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:48,700
 that, you can get a list of everyone in Guantanamo Bay. Now you're going, oh, so like everyone

103
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:54,740
 who was arrested from 2001 to war on terror, all the prisoners of war we got from, no.

104
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:00,020
 No, it's just a bunch of celebrities and politicians. So if you want to know a list of, he can't

105
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:06,180
 put it on his website. He makes a zip file and then has to wait for 10 minutes in his

106
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:13,940
 broadcast how to unzip it. What type of program to use. I'm thinking to put this in the email.

107
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:19,020
 Put this in the truesecrets@aol.com email when people order it. Because I didn't order

108
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,860
 it. I don't need to hear this. Send in the clones. Send in the clones. And he got to

109
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,020
 the clone stuff and it was funny. It was nothing that I hadn't heard before and I was actually

110
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:31,860
 more amused by the fact that one, you think it's a good idea to give out a woman of all

111
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:40,740
 people a woman's number on the internet and a lot of pissed off calls from people who didn't

112
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:46,340
 get their dementia cured or their cancer cured or whatever. And then just the fact that it

113
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:52,060
 became a tech podcast, it basically became CNET.com's podcast telling you how to unzip

114
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:59,220
 a file. Fascinating stuff. My prediction that Dark Out Post is going to be huge. Huge. I

115
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:04,400
 really think it's going to blow up. I will say this. Dark Out Post TV makes Alex Jones

116
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:11,860
 look like this show. Like it is just so, so off the chain. Is that a term the kids are

117
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:17,820
 still using? That's what Dave Zblix is like. If you order my thing, you'll be off the chain.

118
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:23,660
 Now I'm the boomer. But yeah, it's bizarre. Alex Jones, he makes Alex Jones look like

119
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:28,660
 a very nuanced thinker. And again, I've always said this. I think Alex Jones puts on an act.

120
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,820
 And this guy may be putting on an act too. Dave also might be putting on an act. But

121
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:38,660
 just the stuff he says is far more inflammatory than Alex Jones. So that should give you an

122
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:45,140
 idea of where we're dealing with. But if you need to have dementia cured, call that number.

123
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:49,260
 If you don't know how to unzip a file, you're taking notes during my segment. You're like,

124
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:54,140
 Jason, slow down. I have all these files that my grandson sent me. They're all zipped. So

125
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:59,140
 we'll dip our toes in the Outpost.com waters from time to time. It's just so much political

126
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:04,180
 stuff. And I like to stay away from that. But when you talk about clones, you got me.

127
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:10,100
 Is it really a political story when the clones show up? Liam, by now we have reached the

128
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,820
 jungles, not those. By now, he was like struggling to shoulder. He's like, what jungles? Liam,

129
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:22,180
 by now we've reached the swamps of Florida. Did rabbit dirgeables float in overhead? Let's

130
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:28,580
 get our ropes and scale down into the sticky green swamps of Florida. We're in Tate's

131
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:35,620
 Hell, State Forest. Which is a lie, it's a swamp. Talking about tricking the tourists,

132
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,020
 they're like, can we camp in the forest? And the park rangers are like, eyes are going

133
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:44,100
 from side to side. They're like, yeah. You totally camp in the forest. This story was

134
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:49,620
 recommended to me by a Patreon. Kim So Raw. Thank you very much, Kim, for sending this

135
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,540
 over. I had actually had this one prepped and ready to go for like, I don't know, 8

136
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,140
 months. And never covered it. And then Kim So Raw reached out and goes, hey, you should

137
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:03,020
 cover this story. And I was like, I will. And another 4 months passed. Kim sent this

138
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:07,300
 to me a while ago and then I was ready to do it. Because I wanted some lighthearted stuff.

139
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:13,700
 But it's still kind of spooky. But not, you know, dance on your mom's dead body spooky.

140
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:18,820
 Tate's Hell, State Forest. It's a swamp. Don't let them lie to you. And there is a notable

141
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:25,140
 feature to it. Like in the middle of it, there's a grove of dwarf cypress trees that are over

142
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:31,300
 300 years old. That's older than America. You hear that question work in my voice?

143
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,060
 It's older than the founding of America, I believe. 17th, yeah, yeah.

144
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:41,940
 That's the sound. That's the sound of history lessons going in one ear and out the other.

145
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:47,220
 And it's the sound of the grove trees moving. They're an endangered species. So now it used

146
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:53,220
 to be private land, but nowadays they're trying to restore it to nature. They're trying to make it

147
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:58,180
 more natural. So I just imagine they're like, getting swamped from other places is full of

148
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:02,260
 bunch of invasive species. They're like, no, no, no, don't do that. Helicopters are dropping

149
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:07,220
 big buckets of swamp water from Okie-Fanokie. But they're making it more and more natural.

150
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:12,660
 They want to preserve this area so future generations can know how disgusting Florida was.

151
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,820
 They're like, oh, this is a swamp. I always wondered what these were. But how did it get the

152
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:23,940
 name Tate's Hell? That's the story, right? That's a spooky, the word Tate's not incredibly scary,

153
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:28,580
 but hell. So there has to be an origin story of why this is called Tate's Hell. So we have our

154
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:33,380
 waders on. We're walking through the swamp, pushing around alligators and stuff like that.

155
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,540
 With sticks, we have long sticks. You brought one, right? You brought your anti-alligator stick.

156
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:43,300
 The year is 1871. You got old timey bluegrass, bluegrass swamp music playing. And there we're

157
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:50,980
 going to meet Jebediah Tate and his son, Siba Tate. They're like, oh, wake up one morning. Hey,

158
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:56,020
 son, how's it going? And it seems like it's going fine. They're dressed me up every morning and it's

159
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:02,980
 a little, again, a little annoying. Jebediah goes, look at all of this land we have. It's all swamp

160
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:10,020
 water at Supergross. There's 160 acres of swamp, a pristine swamp land that Jebediah Tate bought.

161
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:17,780
 He only paid $5 for it. So that's a deal, right? For the guy who got the $5. But he's going to

162
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:26,740
 turn this swamp land into a business. So he starts like tapping trees for pine oil, and he's raising

163
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:34,500
 cattle and pigs. Now, I see that in my notes. So I don't think this is like swamp things, swamp.

164
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:41,540
 I don't think the cows, the cows are up to their udders and slime, and they don't even know where

165
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:47,300
 the pigs are. I think there is dry land. Everyone's not in there. Like, yes, Jason, there is dry land

166
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:52,820
 in swamps. I was imagining like adventures of Bayou Billy or something like that. So apparently,

167
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:59,540
 the 160 acres was usable farmland. There's pine trees, there's cows walking around, there's a

168
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:05,540
 bunch of pigs. It's a really hard life living on the swamp. So eventually, Jebediah makes a deal

169
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:12,660
 with the, not the devil, but a local medicine man. A couple rungs down on the diabolical level.

170
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:17,540
 And he goes to the medicine man, he goes, "Listen, I want a better life." And the medicine man is

171
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:23,140
 like grinding up some herbs and spices. It's girl sanders. It's girl sanders in the swamp.

172
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,740
 The medicine man goes, "You know what? I can do that for you. I can totally do that for you,

173
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:30,980
 but you need to make a sacrifice to me." And Jebediah looks at his son. He's like,

174
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,700
 "Whatever, I don't like that guy anyways." The medicine man goes, "No, no, no. What I need you

175
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,940
 to do is, one, you need to stay out of the cypress forest." So that grove of trees,

176
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:45,060
 at that point, would only be about 200 years old. Stay away from them. Jebediah's like,

177
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:50,340
 "Fine, I don't like dwarf trees anyways." And then the medicine man goes, "And every year,

178
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,940
 you gotta bring me a pig." Jebediah looks at his son. He's like, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

179
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:01,700
 no, not your son again. You gotta bring me a succulent pig. I want to eat it up."

180
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:07,940
 So that happened in 1871. All of that stuff happened in that year. 1874, Jebediah wakes up

181
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:13,380
 one morning. He's like, "Hey son, how you doing?" The son's like, "I'm fine, Dad." What askin' me that?

182
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:20,580
 Jebediah, for whatever reason this year, decides to break off the deal. So that year, medicine

183
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,580
 man's sitting there and he's like, finishing off the pig from last year. He's like, "Eating pig,

184
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:29,300
 jerky, baking all that stuff." And he's like, "Okay, now it's time for my new pig." And he's just

185
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,060
 sitting there and the sun comes up and the sun goes down and the medicine man's waiting.

186
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:38,580
 Nah, maybe they forgot. Maybe they got waylaid by crocodiles and they just didn't bring it to me.

187
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:43,060
 Or they're all devoured by crocodiles. A couple days past, the medicine man realizes that they

188
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:49,620
 not doing the deal anymore. The deal's broken. So the medicine man goes to the Tate farm and says,

189
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:54,740
 "Listen, deal's off. I don't know if you forgot on purpose, but it really broke my heart.

190
00:16:54,740 --> 00:17:00,900
 I'm also hungry." So from now on, your life is going to be hard. Like it was before.

191
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:06,420
 Actually, no, it's going to be worse, the medicine man says. You're going to go through hell.

192
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:15,540
 There's no mention of lightning strikes in the story or my notes, but I felt it was dramatic.

193
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:20,500
 I felt it was needed. What happened shortly after this? The dad dies of malaria.

194
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:25,620
 So he is journey. I mean, that would be a sucky way to die. You're living in a swamp,

195
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:32,180
 you kind of expect it. But is that a hellish way to die? It might be. I'm looking into it

196
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,780
 and checking out my notes. I know it's not the best. Like in the top 10 ways to die,

197
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:40,980
 it's probably not even in the top 50. But he didn't really go through hell, right? The curse

198
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:48,420
 was actually going to focus on the sun Seb or CB, however I pronounced it earlier.

199
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:56,020
 Seb, we'll call him, is now walking out to the trees to check the pine oil. And he's like cranking

200
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:00,500
 the thing. He's like twisting these, twisting the trees. He's like Paul Bunning trying to squeeze

201
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:06,580
 out the oil. Nothing's coming out. Huh? Oh man, my life is hell now. And he's like, hopefully,

202
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:12,740
 hopefully this is as bad as it gets. One day he wakes up and all the cows are gone.

203
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:20,820
 Now not like UFO abduction mysteriously disappeared into the mist. He kind of figured out that from

204
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:27,620
 all the guts, from all the guts that were littering the ground, that something was predating them.

205
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:33,620
 What's the term? What's a predator does it? Not eat. Predating them, right? Predate,

206
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:39,060
 predate, it doesn't matter. He knew, he pronounced it, the pronunciation was right in his head,

207
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:45,380
 he's just going to say it. They're being predated. He says as he looks around, make sure,

208
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:49,380
 did I say that right? Did I say that right? He knows. They didn't all disappear in one day.

209
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,140
 They're going one by one. He finds a bunch of guts everywhere. He knows something in the jungle

210
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:58,260
 is coming and getting them. And to make matters worse, like for some reason this is part of the

211
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:05,380
 hellish curse. Pigs everywhere. The pigs are out breeding. Well the cows are dying, but now he is

212
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:13,220
 way too many pigs. That is hell. If you live in a swamp and you have too many pigs, apparently that

213
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:20,900
 is hell. 1875 comes around. So that is all going on for a year. And he's like, okay, I gotta figure

214
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:26,980
 out what's killing the cows. But in the meantime, I'm kind of lonely. So he actually orders a male

215
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:31,460
 order bride. So one day he's sitting there and basically the mailman shows up with this huge

216
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:36,100
 crate with holes drilled into it. How do they ship? I know they don't actually ship them in

217
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:42,180
 crates, but how do you ship a male order bride? Like I'm assuming just on a plane or a boat. I don't

218
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,660
 think they're actually taken by the post office, but how do you know that's your male order bride

219
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:54,900
 that shows up? Like you're like, no one's going to impersonate a male order bride, but do they have

220
00:19:54,900 --> 00:20:01,300
 some sort of identification? Do you mean track workers have some sort of way to keep track of

221
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,380
 these people? Like how would you know? Like you ordered, especially back then you didn't have the

222
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:09,860
 internet. Like did you just go through a catalog and there was like a description where there are

223
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:16,740
 photographs? I don't know. Maybe I should look up the history of male order bride and end up on

224
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:22,340
 eight FBI watch lists. 1875 he gets a male order bride and he's like, this will be awesome. I won't

225
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:28,900
 be lonely at all. They open up the crate and that was the sound of the crate door. Oh, that was

226
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:34,900
 the sound of the woman coming out of it. That was the crate door heading the ground. He meets this

227
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:40,340
 woman. So he's like, listen, I have this great life for you here in the swamp. She's like,

228
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:45,780
 this is horrible. Why can I have been sold to a sultan or something like that? He goes, listen,

229
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:52,260
 we have the swamp and I really hope you love bacon and pig jerky. Apparently that's a thing. Jason

230
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:58,260
 just made a pig jerky and we got ham hocks and he's going. He's like this. There's like a sea of pigs.

231
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:03,860
 There's just 160 acres of pigs and he's like, look at all this. Maybe with the two of us,

232
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:08,100
 we can actually eat all these pigs and he kind of chuckles. He rubs his tummy. He's like, I've been

233
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:13,940
 doing my best. I've been doing my best. I think I have several parasites and I think I'm very,

234
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:19,140
 very sick. And the woman looks at him and she looks around the swamp. She looks at the house and

235
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:29,220
 she goes, I can make a life here, but I'm Jewish. And then at that point, at that point, seven turns

236
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:34,660
 of the camera and goes, a gulp. And then we move on to part two of this Odyssey. So it is actually

237
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:39,380
 not part two. It's a continuation, but anyways, it's the next thing. She can't eat pork and she

238
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:44,420
 goes, I need, if I'm going to eat anything, I can eat, well, I can eat anything but pork. I can

239
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:53,860
 eat that pork. I can eat this house, but I can't eat pork. So he has to now buy some cows and protect

240
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:59,860
 them. And he figures, okay, I love this woman. I just ordered her, but she came from the heart.

241
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,340
 She can't eat pigs. That's against her religion. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to buy some

242
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:08,340
 more cows and then I'm going to find out what's killing them. I'm going to straight up Nancy Drew

243
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:12,500
 this and figure this out. So he gets some more cows and of course their guts get ripped out.

244
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,820
 He looks at his wife. She's like, did you do that? And she's like, no, I'm not that hungry.

245
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:27,220
 He realizes there's a panther in the swamp. Big old panther noise. Insert there. Insert there,

246
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,540
 editor. He goes out to hunt this panther down. Probably could have done this a while ago, but

247
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:36,580
 you know, he was fine just eating pigs. He brings his dogs with them and he's loading up his gun and

248
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:45,300
 he's looking. He hears this incredibly loud panther. It's not very stealthy at all. Walking

249
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:49,780
 through the jungle and the panther is stalking them and they're stalking the panther and the

250
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:55,140
 dogs are like this socks dude. We've seen what it's done to these cows. I mean, we may have killed one

251
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:59,940
 or two. We were hungry, but we let the panther take the blame for it, but we're not going to have

252
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:04,180
 anything to do with this. So his dogs run away. So now he's in the swamp all alone with his rifle

253
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:09,780
 looking for this panther. And then somehow it's not specified really in the story, but

254
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:17,380
 he drops his gun, splashes, and he watches it sink into the murky depths of the swamp. And he's like,

255
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:22,900
 oh no, if only I could pin it over and pick it up, but I can't. I've eaten too much pig.

256
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:30,340
 So now he's walking through the swamp. He's unarmed. Panther is still stalking him.

257
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:39,780
 And then a snake shows up. There's sound effects here. I didn't even get to do a gunshot sound effect.

258
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:46,180
 He drops the gun into the swamp. It goes off. That goes through the swamp. Now this snake,

259
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:53,380
 now fast forward back to the snake. The snake bites him. He falls down. He's laying against the tree

260
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:59,940
 and he has this swamp bite on him. He's like, oh this sucks. And then they're still a panther.

261
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,340
 They're still a panther walking around. I hope it doesn't go back to my house and get my cows or

262
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:09,860
 my new wife. It can eat all the pigs that it wants. And then a bunch of bugs show up. Because

263
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:14,740
 in the swamp they were there the whole time. But now that he's laying on the swamp with this snake

264
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:19,860
 bite, he has no gun and no dogs, the insects are putting little napkins around their necks. They're

265
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:24,020
 running up with forks and knives. They start biting him and he's like, oh this sucks. This sucks. This

266
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:30,500
 truly is hell. And he runs and he's running through the swamps and he sees that grove of dwarf cypress

267
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:36,740
 trees. He runs into the trees and apparently the bugs don't follow him or the panther or the snake.

268
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:42,820
 He's just laying in the grove of trees. And he's like, okay now I'm not getting eaten anymore,

269
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:47,780
 but I'm super thirsty. There's nothing around me but dirty dirty swamp water. So he begins to drink

270
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:53,620
 a swamp water. Seven days later people are wondering where this dude's at. They're like, hey whatever

271
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:57,140
 your husband, he's like, I don't know we just got married. Honestly do you have like a hamburger or

272
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:01,460
 something I can eat? And they're like, yeah sure. This figure comes crawling out of the swamp. He's

273
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:08,420
 like, uh, and he crawls out and he falls in front of a dude. There's just some guy walking through

274
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:13,540
 the swamp and he falls in front of him, Seb falls in front of him and he's like, uh, and he looks up

275
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:21,220
 at this man and he goes, my name is Seb. I'm assuming he pronounced it correctly. The guy's

276
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:28,740
 like, well that's not your name. This guy goes, my name is Seb Tate and I just came through hell.

277
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:35,940
 Now some versions of the story I believe immediately dies after that, which doesn't make

278
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,540
 sense because how did he tell people about the snake? It's not like they'd bring out a forensic

279
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,460
 expert. He's like, hmm, from what I can tell he was first scared and dropped his gun from

280
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:48,500
 the way that his fingers were frozen and it appears that he somehow dropped his gun into the swamp.

281
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,340
 And then from the snake bite it seems that the insect showed and no one would know any of that

282
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:57,460
 stuff. He has seven days of swamp water in his stomach. I've heard a version that he died. I think

283
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:01,620
 the other most likely version, if this is true at all, is that he lived and then they just took

284
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:06,100
 him and they gave him a couple, you know, pork loins and he's like, throw those up. He's like,

285
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:10,500
 please no more pig. They give him some fruits and veggies and he tells this story. That's more

286
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:16,580
 likely because otherwise no one would know. That's why it's called Tate's Hell, but we don't even know

287
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:23,060
 if any of that is true. We don't know. I believe that that family existed there. Obviously,

288
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:28,740
 I don't think the state of Florida was like, and then a magical man showed up and placed a curse

289
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:34,500
 on the family. There's elements of it that are probably true. I.e. there's a Tate family there,

290
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:40,740
 but as far as like the magic being cast or the snake bite, I'm sure again, the snake probably

291
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:44,500
 did bite him. I don't know why that's the most fantastical element, but you have this story.

292
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,020
 Now, but people don't even know if that's the reason. This is why there's a dispute because

293
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:52,100
 some people say that's not the reason why it's called Tate's Hell. So it could just be a story

294
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:56,180
 that's made up to match the name Tate's Hell because there's actually another version of this.

295
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:01,140
 There's another version of this story. There's no year for this one, but we'll just assume it's

296
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:06,980
 old timey again, 1871. This is on the other side of the swamp as Jebediah and Seb are waking up

297
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:12,420
 and saying good morning on the other side of the swamp. There's a fisherman named Tate. This is

298
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:18,020
 his only name. He's like Prince or Madonna. His name's Tate, and he goes missing in the swamp,

299
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:21,700
 and people are like, oh man, what happened to Tate? Dude, that guy was super dope. He also owed me like

300
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:26,180
 five bucks. I was going to go buy all this swamp land, but these other people bought it instead.

301
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:30,980
 Dang it. And then after a couple days, Tate, the fisherman, shows up out of the swamp, and he's

302
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:36,660
 like, guys, you won't believe what just happened to me. So I was fishing in the swamp. Really bad

303
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:41,860
 fishermen. I don't know why. I thought I'd catch some toads that day. And then I got to the middle

304
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:48,900
 of the swamp, and I saw her. And they're like, what? I saw her, and he's like, yes. It was a giant.

305
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:54,820
 I saw a giant woman walking through the swamp. But now at this point, all the men put down their

306
00:27:54,820 --> 00:28:00,660
 newspapers, and they're like, tell me more. Was this woman clean and bathed? He's like, no,

307
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:07,060
 because she lived in a swamp. But she may not have been clean and bathed, but she was hot and

308
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:11,300
 bothered. And people are like, ooh, they're fanning their self with their newspapers. And

309
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:15,300
 all the ladies have been dismissed from the bar, which I'm assuming is where this story is being

310
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:20,900
 told. Tate says, guys, listen, so I was fishing in the swamp. I saw this giant lady in the middle

311
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:25,860
 of the swamp, and she saw me, and I feared for my life. Plus, my pants got a little tight. And

312
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:32,500
 sure enough, that giant woman plucked me out of the boat, tore my clothes off, and banged me

313
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:37,220
 for the past couple weeks. Right? I've been missing this whole time, right? I've been having sex with

314
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:42,660
 a giant. People are like, first off, people are like, where exactly did you see this again? We

315
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:48,260
 want to mount an expedition and get mounted ourselves. He says, yeah, that seems great and

316
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:54,580
 all. And I did have the best sex ever for a week or two. But look at me, and he's like,

317
00:28:54,580 --> 00:29:00,900
 now everyone's noticing he's super thin. He's all emaciated. He's like, the sex wouldn't stop.

318
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:05,060
 Like, sure, I could grab a handful of swamp water here and there. And if a tadpole was in it,

319
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:11,220
 I'd get a little protein. But she wouldn't stop banging me to the point where she sucked all the

320
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:20,260
 energy out of me. Now, apparently, in that swamp, there was a legend of the Timucan tribe. And they

321
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:26,420
 were native to that area. And they said that these natives were seven feet tall, that they were giants.

322
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:30,340
 But even that's up for dispute, because apparently that's based on skeletons

323
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:35,460
 that were like five foot three. And they go, well, this is, this must be a toddler. This five foot

324
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:41,300
 three one must be a toddler. So we're like a, you know, second grade or whatever. So they extrapolated

325
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:46,340
 these giant natives. But there's never been really, there's never been any conclusive proof

326
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:52,500
 of giants in the, in the world. There's lots of legends and there's lots of fake photographs

327
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:57,140
 that are going around in the 1800s. We've covered it multiple times on the show. I'll put an episode

328
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:01,060
 in the show notes about the Smithsonian destroying giants. I don't want to get too way late on that

329
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:05,780
 one. We've covered it multiple times on the show, but that was the story. So people were thinking,

330
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:10,740
 well, maybe it was true. Maybe there is a lost member of this tribe who was looking for some love.

331
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:14,580
 And here is this lucky, lucky fisherman. He's shaking his head. He's like, I was not lucky. I

332
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:20,340
 was starving. I was starving the whole time. And the other people were like, we will take

333
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:24,420
 our, they'll just bring back that. So just bring granola bars with them. And they'll just lay back

334
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:28,260
 and they'll have like one of those hats on with the two soda cans sucking it through the straw.

335
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:34,260
 And they're like, take me baby. So that's the story of Tate's hell. That's also the end of the

336
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:38,660
 episode. I'm not going to be able to get to the UFO story. This episode went on really long.

337
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:44,100
 I want to give these stories time to breathe. So we'll do the UFO story on Monday. So Liam,

338
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:50,340
 let's trudge out of this swamp in the middle of this, in the middle of the grove of dwarf cypress

339
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:56,180
 trees. There is the carpenter copter, Spick and span. Liam, go ahead and climb into the cockpit

340
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:01,540
 and get us up, up and away from this army of pigs and slowly advancing on our position. Go,

341
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:08,340
 go, go, go, go. Helicopters flying off. We each got a pig though. So we each got a little pet pig

342
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:13,700
 from this episode. And we each got a mail order bride. She's not a want a mail order ride,

343
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:17,940
 but you got one. Now we're not just flying away for any good reason, then we'll escape from the pig

344
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:22,500
 army. Liam, take us out of this stratosphere. I want to get this carpenter copter as high as it

345
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:28,100
 can. It has the anti frost coating on it. We're now floating over the earth in the carpenter

346
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:33,540
 copter. And I want to end the episode like this. You know, on earth we always talk about these

347
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:40,020
 special locations. Sometimes they're blessed locations, holy locations. Sometimes they're

348
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:46,500
 cursed locations like a haunted house or spooky cemetery. The grove of dwarf cypress trees actually

349
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:51,860
 could exist in between those two. It seemed to be the source of the medicine man's powers.

350
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:55,780
 It was the one place where he didn't want any visitors to go. It could also be the

351
00:31:55,780 --> 00:32:01,140
 font of eternal banging by a giant woman, but again she doesn't let you eat, so you know,

352
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:05,300
 you gotta pick your poison on that one. Is it worth it? Who knows. But I was saying about this the

353
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:10,420
 other day. We have these locations on earth that are mystical, that can give you power or curse you

354
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:20,820
 to hell. What if earth itself is one of those locations? Hear me out. Whenever we look at

355
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:27,060
 the lore involving aliens, they're always here for some reason. Either they're here to keep an eye

356
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:31,780
 over us so we can join the galactic brotherhood, which I'd rather not. That sounds super lame.

357
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:39,220
 Or they're here to sap our resources, take our water, take our minerals. That one never really

358
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:45,540
 held much sway with me other than being a big fan of the miniseries V. I always thought there's more

359
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:51,140
 water or you could easily go to a planet that has ice caps and melt the ice caps fairly easy with

360
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:55,780
 nukes and things like that, instead of going to a planet that's populated by a bunch of monkey

361
00:32:55,780 --> 00:33:02,100
 barbarian warlords who want to use their weapon who make movies about killing people from other

362
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:06,980
 planets. Like what would be easier? Drop a couple nukes on a planet like Mars that has massive

363
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:14,500
 ice caps, or come down and engage with the species. As much as I love us, we are quite brutal species.

364
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:19,940
 No one is the human race. Then these are the idea of them using us as cattle they're here to enslave

365
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:25,940
 us or eat us. Again, the best thing is to not have a food source that can kill you. That's why

366
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:32,180
 we grow wheat and domesticated cows. That's why we're not a species that lives on tiger and bear

367
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:38,100
 meat. So none of those really held sway with me, none of those really made much sense to me.

368
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:44,180
 But what if the earth is special? It's just not a rock, it's just not the third rock from the sun.

369
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:52,340
 It's a mystical location and an otherwise mystically dead universe. Just like you can have

370
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:58,500
 the entire swamp surrounding this area, but this grove of trees is special compared to the rest of

371
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:08,660
 it. What if the earth itself is a mystical location? When we look at very rarely when we look at

372
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:14,020
 stories of aliens, very rarely do they mention religion. And I don't think I've ever come across

373
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:19,060
 the story of aliens practicing magic. Of course there are stories where it seems like they're

374
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:23,300
 engaged in magic, but it always goes back to their technologies just so advanced. I don't think I've

375
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:28,660
 ever come across a story where an alien is actually like "oh no, let me pull a rabbit, let me pull a

376
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:34,580
 rabbit out of this space calculator." They never talk about magic, they very very rarely talk about

377
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:41,380
 religion. How many holy leaders have we had visit this planet in just the past 2000 years? Maybe

378
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:48,020
 this planet is the anomaly in the universe, maybe life is abundant, but we're the only planet in the

379
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:54,740
 universe that has this mystical connection to something beyond the physical. Earth may be,

380
00:34:54,740 --> 00:35:01,780
 universally speaking, a grove of dwarf cypress trees in the middle of a swamp.

381
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:09,540
 It's just an interesting theory, and yet another reason why earth is the most amazing place in

382
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:16,500
 the universe. I'm a little biased because I live here, I exist here, but I truly think it is.
