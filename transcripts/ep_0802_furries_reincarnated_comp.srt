00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
 When a group of girls go to a summer camp, they're expecting a little bit of rest, relaxation,

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,760
 and maybe some sisterhood bonding.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:15,240
 Instead, they come face to face with a blood-soaked maniac.

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,520
 And then we take a look at one of the most bizarre conspiracies we've covered in a while.

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:26,840
 Is it possible that furries are actually reincarnated werewolves today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:37,680
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,680
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,680
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,600
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,920
 I had a tremendously fun vacation.

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,160
 I missed you guys, but I needed the break.

12
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,040
 But so much stuff happened to me.

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,640
 I lost 15 pounds.

14
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,320
 That's dope on purpose, right?

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,880
 I didn't get both my arms chopped off.

16
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,240
 And I got a patch.

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,600
 I'm not on my clothes.

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,720
 I'm not a raggedy-an character.

19
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,720
 I wear a patch on my eye now.

20
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,520
 I'm trying to do some corrective vision stuff because I have double vision and my glasses

21
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,840
 just aren't working.

22
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,320
 So that's dope, dude.

23
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:18,240
 I'm telling you guys right now, whether you medically need a patch or not, start wearing

24
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,440
 patches in public.

25
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,920
 I feel like I'm two feet taller, and people act like I'm two feet taller.

26
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,320
 It's crazy.

27
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,920
 It's crazy just putting a piece of cloth.

28
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,240
 And don't get a fancy one.

29
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,760
 Don't get one with a starfish or have it all glittery and stuff like that.

30
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,200
 Just go with a classic black eye patch.

31
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:42,160
 If I don't have a medical reason, why would I cut off 50% of my vision at all times?

32
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,600
 I can take it off from time to time.

33
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,600
 I'm removing from my eye.

34
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,800
 I'm supposed to move it from my eye.

35
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,400
 But the problem is it looks really good covering my eye.

36
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,920
 It looks really good when it's on my right eye and doesn't look that cool on my left

37
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,920
 eye.

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,000
 I'm not sure if I'm medically supposed to alternate it, but fashion-wise it says the

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,560
 right eye will never see again.

40
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,160
 But someone who we hope to see forever and ever, how's this segue, coming into Dead

41
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,880
 Rabbit Command right now, inching their way along the ground, give it up to our newest

42
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,320
 Patreon supporter, it's Hookworm.

43
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,320
 Everyone give a big round of applause for Hookworm coming into Dead Rabbit Command.

44
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,080
 Hookworm, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

45
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,240
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

46
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,800
 It helps spread the word about the show.

47
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,200
 That helps out so much when you tell your friends, you tell your families that really

48
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,560
 really, your multiple families apparently, your bigamus, that really, really helps out

49
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,880
 a lot.

50
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,120
 And I got so much more news to tell you about what's been going on on my vacation, but we're

51
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,000
 going to get this episode started right now.

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,840
 Hookworm, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

53
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,080
 We're going to hop inside and you're going to drive us all the way out to Brownsville,

54
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,360
 Texas.

55
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,800
 I learned something this week.

56
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,440
 I learned actually a lot of stuff this week.

57
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,000
 I learned that I look cool with a patch of my eye.

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,680
 I've also learned that Texas, you guys may not know this, but you know, like there's

59
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,240
 ghost stories all over the world.

60
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,080
 But for whatever reason, I can't figure it out.

61
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,000
 I'm still trying to delve into this phenomenon.

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,560
 We're going to be covering this a lot over the next couple of weeks.

63
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,120
 I got to spread them out, but Texas has hands down.

64
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,960
 Texas has the bloodiest ghost stories I've really ever come across.

65
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,880
 I was going through my favorite book, Haunted Places, a national directory.

66
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,880
 I'll put it in the show notes.

67
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,240
 I recommend every paranormal researcher have this book.

68
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,200
 I get no money from it, no affiliate link just by the book.

69
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,600
 And I was reading their Texas section over the holiday.

70
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,040
 I actually read it all in a day.

71
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,400
 The book reads like a breeze, but it's just murder after murder.

72
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,240
 And these ghosts in Texas are super bloody.

73
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,200
 Shortly after the battle of the Alamo, when Santa Anna's forces, they're like, okay,

74
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,280
 we killed everyone in the Alamo.

75
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,840
 Now let's destroy this fort, right?

76
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,480
 We don't need this fort.

77
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,480
 They go to destroy the fort.

78
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,000
 This isn't an history book, right?

79
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,720
 This part is in ghost books.

80
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,080
 This isn't an history book as far as I know.

81
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,080
 Maybe I should keep digging.

82
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:11,000
 But anyways, apparently as Santa Anna's engineers were going to topple the Alamo, ghostly arms

83
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,560
 came out of the Alamo and started pushing them away.

84
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,760
 And they're like, oh.

85
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,720
 And then like ghost arms were like, like holding torches out.

86
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,200
 And the engineers are like, oh, I don't think we're going to tear this down anytime soon,

87
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,200
 Santa Anna.

88
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,280
 And that's why it stands to this day.

89
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:32,400
 So if you have a book report due on the Alamo, you may or may not want to include that detail.

90
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,160
 I don't know how historically accurate it is.

91
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,000
 I read in a book called "Hunted Places and National Directory."

92
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,040
 But I'm like, that's some badass ghost stuff.

93
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,520
 Apparently, it wasn't the ghosts of the people that just got killed.

94
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,160
 It was the ghosts of the Catholic priests who built the Alamo in the first place.

95
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,760
 It was like a mission.

96
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:54,480
 And then the Texans came in and they turned it into the Alamo and then they all got slaughtered.

97
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,400
 And then as history states, as historians all agree, as the engineers went to tear down

98
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,400
 the Alamo, a bunch of ghosts started pushing.

99
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,600
 Just the arms too, which is creepy.

100
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,320
 Whenever it's like disembodied stuff, it's creepier.

101
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,440
 If you're walking out of a hallway and you see like a woman in black just kind of floating

102
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,440
 down the hallway, that's disturbing, right?

103
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,840
 Imagine if you just saw her toe.

104
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,960
 Her toe just floating at toe level.

105
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,920
 It's like on the ground and it's kind of moving.

106
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,040
 That's way more creepy.

107
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,160
 So the hands were pushing at the troops of Santa Ana again.

108
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,960
 Again, I don't know how historically accurate that is, but in ghost history, it's true.

109
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,080
 And while I was researching all of this text and stuff, it came across this really cool

110
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,120
 website called "Stormy Night Tales."

111
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,720
 And this website catalogs urban legends.

112
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,720
 It's a really cool website.

113
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,400
 We're going to be talking a lot about this website in the coming weeks and months probably,

114
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,400
 too.

115
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,400
 They got a lot of stuff.

116
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,600
 But we're in Brownsville, Texas.

117
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,600
 Hook, warm, pull us up to this little campground.

118
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:58,280
 We see these little cabins and there's like reeds, rustling, and this tumbleweed going

119
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,280
 by.

120
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,280
 There's a bunch of arms.

121
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,920
 There's a bunch of arms pushing people out of the cabin.

122
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:07,200
 In Brownsville, Texas, there's this campground called Camp Lulu.

123
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,560
 And it's a girls summer camp.

124
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,400
 We're sitting outside the summer camp and we're seeing these girls run around and they're

125
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,720
 like flying kites and throwing tumbleweed at each other, pushing each other into the

126
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,720
 arms.

127
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,040
 They're like, "No, the infinite void."

128
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,320
 They're getting sucked into the cabin.

129
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,520
 No, it was a totally normal summer girls camp.

130
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,960
 And the girls would go there and they'd be playing and doing whatever you do in a summer

131
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,200
 camp.

132
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,960
 But this summer camp had a counselor.

133
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,640
 Yeah, I know they all have camp counselors, but this camp counselor, when he'd be sitting

134
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,680
 there and he'd be like filling out paperwork, I don't know what camp counselors do.

135
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,600
 I don't know why I don't research this stuff.

136
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,440
 Either I just researched the ghost.

137
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,960
 Camp counselors like making kites or like building boats or something like that.

138
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,440
 And he starts hearing, "Kill them."

139
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,960
 He's like, "Oh, what was that?"

140
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,960
 "Kill them.

141
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,960
 Kill them all."

142
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,960
 He's like, "Huh?

143
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,960
 What?

144
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,640
 Oh, well, I'll just go back to sewing this boat, making these moccasins."

145
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,880
 And this camp counselor is going through the rigamarole of the day.

146
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,160
 You know what a camp counselor does.

147
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,040
 And every show, often, he hears a voice going, "Kill them.

148
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,040
 Kill them all."

149
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:13,320
 And looking around, and the only people that are around are young girls.

150
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,680
 Now if you were in like a war, if you're like a Viking running around with an axe and you

151
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,080
 heard a voice going, "Kill them all."

152
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,560
 You'd be like, "Okay, that's dope, dude.

153
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,560
 That's what I was planning to do anyways."

154
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,040
 But if you're a camp counselor and you start hearing a voice go, "Kill them all," you're

155
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,400
 going to get a little weirded out.

156
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,000
 And like that would be bad enough, right?

157
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,200
 That would be bad enough if you're getting voices from the nether telling you to kill

158
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,520
 people, especially these young girls, right?

159
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,480
 But the voice was also saying, "Oh yeah, I've never gotten the ghost."

160
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,200
 And another ghost is like, "You also gotta rape them first."

161
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
 And he's like, "What?

162
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,200
 That's a horrible escalation.

163
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,000
 I'm not doing this stuff."

164
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,600
 But these voices started filling his head with these horrible thoughts, and he can't

165
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
 stand it.

166
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,400
 Now he has two choices.

167
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,400
 He can quit, right?

168
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,920
 He can quit and go to the hospital and say, "Hey guys, listen.

169
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,920
 I'm hearing voices in my head that tell me to do horrible things."

170
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
 Or do the things, right?

171
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:11,840
 I guess there's a lot of stuff you could do in between, but he decides one night the

172
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:18,720
 voices get too much for him, and one night he breaks into one of these cabins and rapes

173
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,720
 and murders all of them.

174
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,880
 And then he runs away.

175
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:29,480
 Now some versions of the story, he rapes and murders all the girls at the campsite.

176
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,480
 That's a lot for one night.

177
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,680
 Now I don't know how many people went to this.

178
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,040
 I don't know if he was even the only camp counselor.

179
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,000
 To be honest, this is an urban legend, so we know some of it is true.

180
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 Some of it is true.

181
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,480
 But I'll get to that in a second.

182
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:48,360
 But some versions of the story, he only kills all the girls at camp.

183
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,960
 Some versions of the story, he rapes and kills all the girls at the camp.

184
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,040
 So let's split the difference, because that's just way too much.

185
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,880
 That's way too much for one night.

186
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:02,520
 We'll say, "Let's be realistic here with this guy hearing these voices from beyond

187
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,720
 the grave.

188
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,720
 He rapes and kills everyone in a single cabin."

189
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,800
 That's horrible, but more plausible, right?

190
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,920
 You could massacre everyone at a campground too, but you figure like they're running

191
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,920
 through the bushes and stuff like that.

192
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,600
 A couple are going to get away.

193
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,240
 Logistically, it would be very difficult.

194
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,680
 And if you started like throwing the rape on it, I don't think you could rape everyone

195
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,680
 at a campsite in a single night.

196
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,680
 Let me be fair.

197
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,680
 Don't try to prove me wrong.

198
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,920
 Don't be like, "Oh, I'm going to show Jason."

199
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,440
 So anyways, he eventually is caught by the authorities, and when they ask him, "Why

200
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,600
 did you do that?"

201
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,680
 He said, "The voices told me to."

202
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,920
 The voices told me to.

203
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,920
 And the story was that this land was cursed, which knowing Texas history now, probably

204
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,280
 pretty true, right?

205
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,480
 And the land was cursed, and there was this ancient spirit, this ancient demon walking

206
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,600
 the land long before Camp Lulu was established.

207
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:02,240
 And when it found the right vessel to speak through, to act through, it struck against

208
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,760
 the world.

209
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,760
 So the camp was closed.

210
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,720
 Obviously, no one's going to want to go there.

211
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,120
 No one's like, "Well, next year it might be better."

212
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:16,400
 The camp gets closed, and so far it's been a hot spot of ghost hunting activity.

213
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,560
 So this is what we know is true.

214
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,280
 There used to be a camp, because you can see the buildings.

215
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,040
 You can see a bunch of buildings out there, a bunch of cabins out there where there used

216
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,560
 to be a summer camp.

217
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,520
 And it was in operation.

218
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,320
 Some people say it was called Camp Lulu.

219
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,080
 Some people call it Camp Lulu Sam's.

220
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,800
 It depends on the article that you're reading.

221
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,800
 But it did exist up until it's late as 1980.

222
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,520
 This wasn't something that has happened in, like, 1854.

223
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,080
 A bunch of coal miner daughters were hanging out of this campsite.

224
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:50,160
 No, it was closed as late as 1980, so we can put the story in that time frame.

225
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,200
 But there is no, like, news article or court documents showing that a mass slaughter took

226
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,040
 place at this site.

227
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,560
 What's interesting is that locals are divided on this.

228
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,960
 Some people say it's all hogwash.

229
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,960
 It didn't happen.

230
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,960
 It's just an urban legend.

231
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,200
 While other locals say it did happen.

232
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,200
 It's interesting, though.

233
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,960
 This is one of those stories that you would think of someone plowed through an entire campground

234
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,800
 or even a cabin and killed even just one person.

235
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,400
 You'd find news articles of it.

236
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:23,160
 But what I've learned doing this show is, one, it's very, very hard to find information

237
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,240
 online pre-2001.

238
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,200
 Like you can go through newspaper archives, but even those can be incomplete digital archives.

239
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,400
 You'd have to go out there to research it.

240
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,360
 It's possible that there was a murder.

241
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:42,360
 It's possible that there was a incident that's been blown up to this level.

242
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,720
 It's also possible that something happened and it was covered up, right?

243
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,440
 That if you did have this horrible crime happen, the tourist board of Brownsville, Texas, isn't

244
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,280
 going to want to put that on their banner.

245
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,840
 So there'd be something that was really, really hush-hush.

246
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:01,520
 What we have is a bunch of empty cabins in the surrounding brush of Brownsville, Texas,

247
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,040
 and this legend.

248
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,640
 And if the story is true, it's absolutely horrifying.

249
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:11,840
 If it's not true, I think it's also a little horrifying that the myth that we as a society

250
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:18,560
 have decided to create when we see empty cabins is something so brutal and vicious and awful.

251
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,080
 But nonetheless, it is a very popular site for ghost hunters in the area.

252
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,240
 If you're in the area, you can try your luck, apparently.

253
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,280
 There's a man with a shotgun out there.

254
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,400
 This is another thing we see in a lot of these urban legends.

255
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,800
 It was the same thing in Chaunceyville.

256
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
 They have a guardian.

257
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,800
 There's a man with a shotgun out there and he's there to protect the spirits of the girls.

258
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,960
 So basically it's the ward off ghost hunters.

259
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:45,840
 One ghost hunter, apparently, went into one of the cabins and this part I think would

260
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,840
 be true.

261
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,440
 He goes into the cabin and there's hundreds of porcelain dolls.

262
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,600
 Maybe that number's a little high.

263
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
 Maybe there's only 12.

264
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,440
 But apparently this ghost hunter went in and there was porcelain dolls all over the cabin.

265
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,040
 And did the ghost put them there?

266
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,040
 Did the guardian put them there?

267
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,000
 Is it some sort of satanic or something?

268
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,800
 I could see people doing something creepy in a haunted location.

269
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,800
 And then a couple days later, the ghost hunter had a heart attack, which I mean, it would

270
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,640
 have been scarier if he had the heart attack at the place, right?

271
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,960
 If you're like, if you go into this ghostly adventure, you're like, oh no, that was awful.

272
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,000
 And then you're like, oh, time to go to Wendy's and you're eating a bunch of triple cheeseburgers

273
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,960
 and the heart attack is a little less paranormal, right?

274
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,920
 But anyways, we don't know if that's true either.

275
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,600
 I was only able to find the porcelain doll report in like one or two articles.

276
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,360
 I read a bunch of articles about this, but very, very interesting urban legend.

277
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,320
 If you do live in Brownsville, Texas, then you have a healthy heart.

278
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,760
 You have a healthy heart and you don't mind being chased by a man with a shotgun.

279
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,440
 Check out, check out Camp Lulu.

280
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,440
 It might be a really cool ghost story and might be a bunch of nothing, but either way,

281
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,280
 I love on the ground ghost hunting.

282
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,280
 I really do.

283
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,780
 I want to get back into it.

284
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:01,600
 So maybe someday I'll go out to Brownsville, Texas.

285
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,440
 Hookworm though, before we get there, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to

286
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,440
 the carpenter copter.

287
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,960
 We're going to leave behind rural Texas.

288
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:17,200
 We are headed all the way out to a furry convention.

289
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,600
 As we're flying out to this furry convention, I got you your own furry suit.

290
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
 It's a snail.

291
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,840
 I give you a big old snail suit.

292
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,840
 You're like, oh man, this sucks.

293
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,360
 I was like, oh, come on.

294
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,360
 It's a sexy snail.

295
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,920
 You're like, oh, this is like the grossest furry suit ever.

296
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,080
 As I was researching the story, I started thinking, are there plants?

297
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,800
 Are there people who dress up as plants and bang each other?

298
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,920
 I guess I should back up.

299
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,320
 A furry, if you don't know, a furry is somebody who dresses up in a furry-- not all of them

300
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,400
 dress up in furry suits, but, oh man, it's such a hard topic.

301
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,400
 I want to kind of bring it down into just a two minute definition.

302
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,960
 A furry is someone who fills an affinity.

303
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,560
 I'm going to put as wide as possible to start off.

304
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,720
 An affinity towards a fursona.

305
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:05,280
 A fursona is either themselves turned into an anthropomorphic animal or a separate individual.

306
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,720
 They've created a separate character.

307
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,080
 It's like a fictional character named Benny the Bug, and he's like a giant muscular beetle.

308
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,040
 Then I'm Jason.

309
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:20,240
 Then sometimes I'm Jason the June Bug.

310
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:26,280
 Some furries will say that they're actually like-- oh man, this is so complicated.

311
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,800
 Let me break it down for you.

312
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:34,840
 Basically furries are people who love to interact with anthropomorphic animals, to become an

313
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,520
 anthropomorphic animal, maybe, or to have a friend who is an anthropomorphic animal.

314
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,200
 Oh my god, this is so complicated.

315
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,960
 A lot of times, though, it's sexual.

316
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,960
 Sexual.

317
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,760
 And you have the offshoots like the My Little Pony people.

318
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,760
 What are they called again?

319
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,160
 Pony bronies, that's the term.

320
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,560
 And then you do have these offshoots.

321
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,960
 But generally it's either people who just love the culture of drawing pictures of like,

322
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,960
 "Hey, look at me.

323
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,280
 I'm a skateboarding raccoon," or whatever.

324
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,640
 And then-- but there's a lot of sex stuff in it, too.

325
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,280
 The line is super, super blurry.

326
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,800
 I'm sure there are furries who don't sexualize it.

327
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,040
 That's kind of the common perception.

328
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,000
 But anyway, so furries, it's a subculture.

329
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,760
 Some call it a fetish.

330
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,160
 You dress up like an animal and you run around in a convention.

331
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,120
 That's probably most concise I can make it without spending 10 minutes going into furry

332
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,120
 culture.

333
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,860
 But as I was researching the story, I thought, I know there are people who dress up as wolves

334
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,440
 and dragons and stuff like that.

335
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,560
 And they go to these conventions and they yiff, which is where they rub up on each other.

336
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,560
 And that's like their sex.

337
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:45,520
 And then I've always heard if a furry, if you ever see a furry and their suit has pants,

338
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,280
 that means there's holes open underneath the pants for having sex.

339
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,440
 Like, if they don't have any pants, they're just like walking around and it's like a Mickey

340
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,440
 Mouse.

341
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,440
 Well, actually Mickey Mouse has pants.

342
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,760
 Now that I think about it, you might be hanging dong all day long, too.

343
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,140
 I've heard that when you see someone dress up like a wolf and they're walking down the

344
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,580
 street going to a furry convention, no pants.

345
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:09,900
 That means they just are there for the convention just to meet other like-minded people.

346
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,380
 Or and they might rub up on each other.

347
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:17,300
 If they're aware, if you see like a fox, if you see an anthropomorphic fox and he's wearing

348
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,900
 cut off jean shorts, there's access holes down there.

349
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,980
 That's why they're wearing the shorts.

350
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,980
 That's just what I've heard.

351
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,980
 I don't know if it's true.

352
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,940
 I've had friends who are furry.

353
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,940
 I've never been a furry.

354
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:31,620
 I've been accused of being a scaly because I'm always talking about banging hot reptilian

355
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,620
 chicks.

356
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:37,680
 But I'm wondering, snaily, apparently, because I dressed you up like an anthropomorphic snail.

357
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,440
 I'm wondering if there's an offshoot of plant people.

358
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,920
 Like, there's a dude dressed up like a rose and then another dude dressed up like a pickle

359
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,920
 and they're like, "Ooh, looking at each other and they're rubbing up."

360
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,920
 I don't know.

361
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,040
 Like, are there furry plants?

362
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,120
 Are there anthropomorphic plant people?

363
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,860
 What I'm asking, I'm asking, is there an even weirder subculture than what we have?

364
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:02,580
 And it's interesting because when we look at the subculture of furries, we tend to go,

365
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,580
 "Oh, I get it.

366
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,420
 Like, it is a lot of sex stuff going on with it and I get it."

367
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:12,300
 I also grew up in the 80s and I was watching Robin Hood and Made Marion was a really hot

368
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,300
 fox, literally.

369
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,740
 And I, you know, like, I've seen some sexy cartoon characters.

370
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,460
 The mom from Tailspin was pretty good looking.

371
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,680
 She was like a bear or something like that.

372
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,200
 You know, like throughout your life, you do see Bambi's mom.

373
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:31,080
 You know, like, you do see some sexy, the reindeer, the cute reindeer girl from Rudolph

374
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,080
 the Red Nose Reindeer.

375
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,360
 I'm being able to name a lot of them off the top of my head, which should be concerning,

376
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,360
 but I'm not concerned.

377
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,360
 Wait, I think, I get it right.

378
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,080
 When I, I was like, "Dude, Made Marion's pretty hot."

379
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,480
 I remember thinking that when I was a kid.

380
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,040
 I was like, "That's a very attractive design."

381
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,400
 But I never, like, got into it anymore than that.

382
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,080
 I was like, "Oh, she's cute."

383
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,300
 So when people started dressing up as furries and I found out about the culture, I go, "Oh,

384
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,300
 that makes sense."

385
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,660
 It's kind of my age group a little bit before as well.

386
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,580
 And anthropomorphic animals, if fetishes start when you see something in an early age,

387
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:06,180
 your kid and your big sister puts her feet in your face, you're like nine.

388
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,980
 And she's like, "Smell my feet, smell my feet, smell my feet."

389
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,580
 And you pop a boner.

390
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,140
 And now all of a sudden you have a foot fetish.

391
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:15,340
 I get that's why this type of stuff happens.

392
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,940
 Stuff that happens in your, nine might be a little early, but.

393
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:23,160
 Stuff that happens in your early childhood, your 11, your 12, your sexually awakening.

394
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,680
 And your mom, it makes you brush her hair.

395
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,680
 That happened to a friend of mine.

396
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,400
 That happened to a friend of mine.

397
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,960
 And they developed a hair finish.

398
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,240
 Because it was just in that formative time.

399
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,880
 So I get furries from that level.

400
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,320
 But we're going to go a little bit deeper here.

401
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,200
 Like, please, Jason, don't, that was good enough.

402
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,280
 Just stop it now.

403
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,280
 Just stop it now.

404
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,280
 Let's get a little bit deeper into this.

405
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,460
 I came across this post recently on the export.

406
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,220
 It was really interesting.

407
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,920
 Export's been on fire recently.

408
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,420
 Export's been putting out some good stuff.

409
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:56,220
 I found this interesting green text on the export.

410
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,980
 And this is what it was in summary.

411
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,500
 This guy, we're going to call him Jake.

412
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,060
 Jake is a furry.

413
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,060
 He comes right out of the beginning.

414
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:07,180
 He goes, "Listen, I'm a furry, but even I have a hard time."

415
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,540
 I don't have a hard time wrapping my head around the furry culture.

416
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,460
 I'm wondering where we come from.

417
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:18,640
 And he goes, "I think most people, myself included, assume that it's because of anthropomorphic

418
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,720
 animals from Disney cartoons."

419
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,840
 But he goes, "Let me tell you what my journey was."

420
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,440
 He goes, "I remember, I watched the cartoons."

421
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,560
 He specifically mentions Robin Hood.

422
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,520
 I watched these cartoons growing up and never really gave it much thought.

423
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:36,040
 He goes, "But when I turned 16, something clicked inside of me.

424
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,360
 Something awakened inside of me."

425
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,780
 I just discovered this idea of what furries was.

426
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:51,420
 And he goes, "Within about a couple days, he went from being, oh, what's a furry, to

427
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:56,780
 being completely absorbed into the furry culture, into the yiffing and the fur suits and all

428
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,780
 this stuff.

429
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,940
 He went from just being slightly interested to tento invested like that."

430
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:06,220
 And he always wondered why that happened.

431
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:11,680
 And 16 is pretty late to start getting just the development of a brand new fetish.

432
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,880
 It's not impossible, but fetishes a lot of times start earlier than that.

433
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,360
 So his idea is, this is very fascinating.

434
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,960
 I've never heard this before.

435
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,080
 His idea was this.

436
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,040
 Since the dawn of time.

437
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,040
 This is so cool.

438
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,040
 I really, really like this one.

439
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,520
 Since the dawn of humanity, right?

440
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,760
 Since we've been able to kind of communicate with each other in any sort of social group.

441
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,860
 We have had, this is across the globe.

442
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,980
 You can pretty much find any culture on the planet has done this.

443
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:45,380
 We began to engage in something called totism.

444
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,380
 Totemism.

445
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,140
 One of the two pronunciations, totemism.

446
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,740
 We began to worship, not even worship.

447
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:57,940
 We began to follow the path of the totem.

448
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,940
 So the totem is a spirit guide.

449
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,540
 A lot of times it's an animal.

450
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,540
 Sometimes it's a plant.

451
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,120
 Sometimes it's a location.

452
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,200
 That a tribe would listen to for advice.

453
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,320
 You'd have a totemism.

454
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:19,320
 So you may have a tribal group and we're going back 6,000 years and one day their leader

455
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,400
 comes back from a vision quest and says, "I am now one with the great eagle.

456
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,360
 The great eagle will guide my way.

457
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,040
 He will help me make decisions.

458
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,040
 He will be wise.

459
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,640
 He will be fair."

460
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:38,500
 And because this leader is so respected, the culture also takes on the totem of the eagle.

461
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,340
 This is replicated all over the place and we can read any story about tri- like, it's

462
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:46,460
 even replicated in popular culture where people going on the vision quest, young men going

463
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:52,100
 out in the wilderness and they have like three days to find themselves or die and they're

464
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:57,100
 taking copious amounts of drugs or depriving themselves of food and water to bring apart

465
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,100
 these visions.

466
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:02,320
 It's replicated across the world to see that spirit animal.

467
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,600
 It's even a joke in the Simpsons movie.

468
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,960
 It's just such a common trope because it's across the world.

469
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,840
 It literally is a common thing that happened.

470
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,480
 And you would imbue yourselves with the spirit of the eagle or the spirit of the eagle would

471
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,480
 be a separate figure.

472
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,240
 It's not actually inside of you but it's a separate thing that is completely interwoven

473
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,080
 into the society, into you.

474
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,340
 Even if it's a separate eagle, even if it's separate it's still part of your identity.

475
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:37,620
 And that was the way things were for thousands of years.

476
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:44,780
 If you were in a tribe, you had a connection to something else, a totem.

477
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:51,660
 But as the nomads, as the hunter-gatherers begin to settle in cities, you started to

478
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:54,820
 see a little bit less of that, right?

479
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,760
 Now you're in a location.

480
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,920
 But it didn't completely go away.

481
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:04,160
 You were now reforming the environment to your wishes.

482
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,560
 You were no longer subject to the whims of where you were going and where the buffalo

483
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,200
 were or anything like that.

484
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,960
 You started to build settlements.

485
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,000
 And so for thousands of years we have this and then it just kind of stopped.

486
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,040
 But what's interesting is it never really went away.

487
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:28,380
 Because we look at the banners of France and English kings and what's on them?

488
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,020
 Animals.

489
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:34,820
 Richard the Lion-hearted from Robin Hood, right?

490
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,980
 That was their totem.

491
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,500
 In the United States, the great eagle.

492
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,060
 But it's become less of a personal thing, right?

493
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,060
 Russia has the bear.

494
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,980
 It's become less of a personal thing.

495
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,060
 We know that the bald eagle is America's symbol.

496
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:55,000
 But do you ever feel infused with the power of the bald eagle?

497
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,500
 We used to.

498
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:01,660
 If a leader came into power and he says, "No, the eagle is done, my spirit animal is the

499
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,660
 boar."

500
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,700
 And it's a new way to do government.

501
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,980
 It's going to be super muddy and messy and I'm going to gore people left and right.

502
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:13,700
 The rest of the tribe would take on the totem of the boar.

503
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,040
 So it would shift in things like that.

504
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:20,800
 And it would affect your lifestyle, it would affect your policy depending on which animal

505
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,220
 you're with.

506
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:30,860
 And what this dude is saying, what Jake is saying is that we spent so much of humanity

507
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:36,220
 connected closely to nature, communing with nature, imbuing ourselves with the power of

508
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:43,140
 the eagle, with the power of the wolf, with the power of the dragon.

509
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:49,660
 And that is not being fulfilled in any sort of way anymore.

510
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:57,600
 And our ancestral DNA is still crying out for this connection to this natural world.

511
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,320
 It still wants it so much.

512
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,560
 And what happens is, imagine this.

513
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,480
 So when we're talking about these stories, I'm talking about like the great leader, this

514
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,560
 was how it would work.

515
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:10,880
 The great leaders of the tribe or the shaman, the medicinemen, the great wise people of

516
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,520
 the tribe, it would be their totem that would become the people's totem.

517
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,100
 And then you may go off and find your own totem, but it was through an arduous journey

518
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,420
 of self-discovery.

519
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,700
 We don't have that anymore, right?

520
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,820
 We don't have that anymore.

521
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:33,300
 The problem is that our ancestral DNA is still crying out for this connection to this wolf,

522
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:38,860
 this spirit wolf that your ancestors from Siberia had and their ancestors from deep

523
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:42,140
 within China had and their ancestors that deep from the Middle East had.

524
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:46,640
 And it's just this journey of humanity was so connected to these creatures.

525
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,080
 We don't have that anymore.

526
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,560
 And so we're still getting the beam into our head.

527
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:55,880
 We're still getting the message that we need to be connected to this, but the modern world

528
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:08,800
 is so corrupt and so sexualized and so materialistic that when that wolf spirit comes to you, you

529
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,620
 want to bang it.

530
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:17,780
 It has completely stripped it of all spiritual meaning, though the modern world still has

531
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:27,180
 a need for this old religion, this old in touch with nature.

532
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,660
 But we don't know how to deal with it, so we turn it sexual.

533
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:35,620
 We give the wolf a big bubble butt, rippling muscles tight, jeanshorts the hide of the

534
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,720
 access holes.

535
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:44,920
 The connection between man and nature is still there, but it's so broken and frayed and it's

536
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:49,280
 no longer the great medicine man, no longer the shaman or the warriors or the people who

537
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,000
 go out to have these vision quests.

538
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,360
 It's people who have no connection to nature, who are still recalling these great memories

539
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,520
 and it's so corrupted they turn it sexual.

540
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,040
 That's absolutely fascinating.

541
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:08,460
 He kind of wraps it up by saying that he does blame a little bit of the anthropomorphic

542
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:15,740
 animation culture for, he goes, "Not everyone becomes a furry because of that, but it definitely

543
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,740
 doesn't help."

544
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,740
 It doesn't help.

545
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,740
 And he has a furry.

546
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,780
 He is proudly a furry.

547
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,140
 He's not like, "I'm ashamed of it."

548
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,180
 But he said, "What you need to do as a furry," he goes, "without guilt."

549
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:28,340
 He goes, "Too much guilt is a bad thing, but what you need to do as a furry is you need

550
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:35,400
 to stop one, stop watching furry porn, and then two, stop sexualizing your own furry."

551
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,640
 Make a connection to that.

552
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,720
 He goes, "The shamans used to go and they used to make these wolf skins and they would wear

553
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,200
 them and they would imbue themselves with the skin of the wolf.

554
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,840
 Even though they killed the wolf and took the wolf's life, they respected spirit and

555
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,280
 wear the flesh now."

556
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,680
 He says, "That's the same thing when someone's making their fur suits, what they're really

557
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,680
 trying to replicate."

558
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,300
 They don't want, this is all subconscious.

559
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,660
 This is all ancestral memory.

560
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:07,980
 What they're trying to do is they're trying to recreate that shamanistic practice, but

561
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,980
 they don't know how.

562
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,980
 They have none of the techniques.

563
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,940
 Those have all been lost to time.

564
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,740
 They don't know how.

565
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,640
 So it turns into this weirdo looking cartoon character.

566
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,180
 With any good argument, and I love this because obviously he's not a zealot about this.

567
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,300
 He says, "Listen, there are some holes in my argument.

568
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:31,080
 If there's any truth to this," he goes, "It does seem to be that most furries are within

569
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,560
 these different types of species.

570
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,080
 Most furries are wool canines or felines.

571
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,880
 There's dragons."

572
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,880
 All this stuff.

573
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:45,320
 He goes, "If this theory was true, you think there would be a wider variation of furries."

574
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,580
 He goes, "But I think some of that could just be jumping on the bandwagon.

575
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:52,880
 You may feel like you have a connection to a grasshopper, but that's a really hard suit

576
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,880
 to make.

577
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,180
 It's super sexy, and everyone else is doing the furry, and you go, "Well, if I can't be

578
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:01,580
 a grasshopper, maybe I'll just be a puppy."

579
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,580
 Interesting theory, though.

580
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,660
 It would explain why it explodes.

581
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:09,620
 And he goes on to say, I thought myself here, but the animation industry basically, he

582
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:14,380
 goes, "Is it making furries on accident?

583
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,100
 Or is someone doing this on purpose?

584
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:23,860
 Is someone actually trying to further corrupt mankind's connection to the natural world?"

585
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:28,200
 If we do have this way that we can actually reach back through our ancestors to talk to

586
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,320
 the same animals they spoke to that led the tribes from where they were at 10,000 years

587
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:38,240
 ago to today, you could talk to that same spirit animal.

588
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,840
 That would be something that you could see, quote, unquote, the powers that we would want

589
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,360
 to eliminate.

590
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:49,600
 So instead of us having the connection to the Great Eagle or the mighty wolf or the Wysau,

591
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,880
 you just want to bang them all.

592
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,220
 So our cartoon's doing this on purpose.

593
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,820
 And he neither answers that.

594
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,820
 He doesn't answer that question.

595
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:00,820
 And that, again, is a sign of a very well-written article.

596
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:06,620
 If you ever come across something and they have all the answers, it's a little suspicious.

597
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,540
 So really, really interesting work.

598
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:11,660
 And I do want to take it a step further and I'll wrap it up like this.

599
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:18,980
 When we look at the stories of the shaman in history, it's the shaman, the medicine

600
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:22,920
 man, they would see this, they'd have the vision quest of the wolf, they would wear

601
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:27,240
 the wolf skins and then they would impart the visions, the knowledge that they have

602
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,560
 on the rest of the tribe.

603
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,520
 But when you look at the world of the paranormal, there's a piece missing there.

604
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:37,280
 And that is, in pretty much any culture, it's not just that the shaman puts on the wolf

605
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,280
 skin.

606
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,520
 Again, historians and scientists will tell you that.

607
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:45,880
 But when you look at the legends, they become the wolf.

608
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,320
 They become the eagle.

609
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:54,700
 They don't just get the power and the wisdom, they physically shape shift.

610
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,940
 That's one of those things that you can look at almost any culture.

611
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:02,460
 And they have stories of not just the wisest people being able to commune with nature and

612
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:08,380
 be told secrets beyond that of the normal man, that they actually could assume the shape

613
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:11,300
 of those things.

614
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:16,660
 So science says that they just wore the suits, but in the paranormal world, they became these

615
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:24,280
 animals, which would become an even closer connection to that natural world.

616
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:28,240
 And it would explain why you had this time period of the hunters and the gatherers and

617
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,360
 the nomads, and they had their most powerful people being able to take on the attributes

618
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,080
 of the bear, of the wolf.

619
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,600
 And then later on, as society moved forward and our cities got bigger, no one actually

620
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,520
 believed that King Richard the Lionheart had turned into a lion.

621
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,940
 But that was the symbol on his banners.

622
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,140
 It still had that totem.

623
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:55,020
 But my question is, is that if we did have a lineage of shape shifters, a lineage of

624
00:32:55,020 --> 00:33:03,940
 people who had unlocked the key of turning from man to animal back to man, that has been

625
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,940
 lost.

626
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,580
 And what's really interesting is when you go the farther back you go in time, the stories

627
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:14,500
 of somebody turning from a man into an eagle and then coming back into a man, or the shot

628
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,880
 of a Dominic turns into a wolf, those are the most highly celebrated people of those

629
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,480
 societies.

630
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:25,360
 By the time the hunter and gatherers had settled, by the time we started having cities and

631
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:31,800
 civilizations, let's fast forward, way fast forward, to like Roman times, dark ages times,

632
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,480
 shape shifters wore the enemy.

633
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,320
 Like the stories of werewolves were no longer about guardians, the stories they were told

634
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,240
 to us to be killed on sight.

635
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,940
 When you just skipped back a thousand years, two thousand years, those are the people you

636
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,020
 wanted to hang out with.

637
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:55,620
 So why did society shift from venerating the shape shifter to hunting the shape shifter?

638
00:33:55,620 --> 00:34:01,060
 And now, apparently that skill has been lost.

639
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:05,500
 People will claim to see shape shifters, we've covered shape shifters on this show before,

640
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:09,540
 but the closest we have to it is these furry suits.

641
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,540
 What do we do?

642
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,560
 We deride them and we mock them, right?

643
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,560
 Just on cue.

644
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,560
 How many people laughed at the topic of this episode?

645
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,680
 It is kind of funny, it is funny, but you know what I mean?

646
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:23,920
 We used to venerate them, now we hunt them, and now we just kind of scoff at them, right?

647
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:29,400
 Like I said, I have friends or furries, it's not something that particularly bugs me.

648
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,920
 But a lot of people make fun of them.

649
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:38,840
 And what is it about the anthropomorph, the connection to that, especially if this guy's

650
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:43,700
 theory is true, when you see someone in a furry suit, and even if they've totally sexualized

651
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:48,940
 it, it's because it's such a pure energy being put into such a corrupt world.

652
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,860
 How else would it infuse?

653
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:57,820
 So are the ancient shaman connected to the modern day furries?

654
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:03,820
 Could you argue that the furries of today actually are the reincarnations of these great

655
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,820
 shape shifters?

656
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:08,580
 And now they're in a world and they've lost all their memories, but their body, their

657
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,360
 soul still cries out for this connection to nature.

658
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:15,840
 But they're no longer leading a tribe in the middle of the Sudan.

659
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:21,520
 There's some Irish kid in Ohio, but he still has that yearning, he still feels that pull

660
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,520
 from the great night sky that he must become this beast.

661
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,440
 He must lead his people, he's like what?

662
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,320
 I just want to play Switch.

663
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:36,040
 And that pull is so great, it just becomes so corrupted and so sexualized that eventually

664
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:42,060
 he dresses up as a sexy vulture or something, goes to a con and gets railed by a bunch of

665
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:46,180
 people dressed up like porcupines.

666
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:57,140
 The purity of the idea guided humanity for thousands of years in a hostile planet.

667
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:01,900
 Until finally we became the dominant species, but we didn't do it alone.

668
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:05,760
 The totems guided us.

669
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,280
 That energy is still there, that magic is still there.

670
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:17,760
 But the world it feeds into now is darkened and corrupt.

671
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:25,520
 Instead of becoming a leader of your people, moving them forward, you just become a dude

672
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:32,660
 watching the cast of duck tails bang each other while sitting in an overpriced suit

673
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:38,400
 someone else made for you.

674
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:44,040
 Is the totem powerful enough to break through the cancer of society?

675
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:50,460
 Or is humanity now and forever cut off from our guardian spirits?

676
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:58,620
 I'm back baby.

677
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:01,260
