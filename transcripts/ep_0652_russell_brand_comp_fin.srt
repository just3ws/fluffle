00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Season 14 of Dead Rabbit Radio starts today. I don't know why I'm so angry. I'm actually really excited. The show's back.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Errrr!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 First off, we take another journey to the Dark Outpost to see if there's any truth behind the stories that demons have taken over the Vatican.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 And then we take a look at a conspiracy theory that is a riddle wrapped in an enigma, wrapped in two more riddles, and then a couple more enigmas.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Is it possible that stand-up comedian Russell Brand is actually the mastermind behind all conspiracies today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 [music]

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 I had a great vacation. Very, very well rested. If you just listened to the last episode and the tone of my voice, and now you're listening to this one, you're like, "Whoa, he's not on the verge of death."

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 I had a really restful vacation. I went to the last blockbuster on Earth in Bend, Oregon.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 And then the other 13 days of my vacation did absolutely nothing. But you know who didn't do absolutely nothing?

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now dressed up as a carpenter. Not as me. He's not wearing my flesh.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Dressed up as like a guy from the Village People. He's wearing his sexy carpenter outfit, really like low-cut jean shorts.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 It's our newest Patreon supporter, Robert Reif. Everyone give a round of applause to Robert Reif. He's doing a little fashion show.

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 He's probably been hard at work these past few weeks. He's been rebuilding Dead Rabbit Command. I can look at all of this stuff here.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 I actually did a live stream last night. If you guys are listening to the podcast, I'd recommend subscribing to the YouTube channel as well,

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 because we're going to be doing a lot of live streaming this season and going forward.

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Where I was actually building, making improvements to the Haunted Closet recording studio, the improvements are...

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 I duct taped my microphone stand. I ordered a new one.

19
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 But for now, you may occasionally hear the sound of duct tape ripping. This is not the most... I have a yoga block taped. It's a mess.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 But anyways, it's all for the show. All this duct tape, all these yoga blocks, it's all for the show.

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Robert, go ahead. You can wear your Village People outfit for the rest of the episode. It's totally up to you.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 But let's go ahead. I'm going to toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy. We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 We are headed out to begin season 14. We're headed out to the dark outpost.

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Jason Jalopy's going down the road. You know what? Before I forget, I want to say this to you guys.

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 A while back, I did a live stream from this girl's house. And I said that I was live streaming from a haunted house,

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 and I saw like this shadow figure, and then I saw what appeared to be a shadow kid.

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 We did that live stream. Nothing appeared on camera. It was a really fun live stream. I'll put it in the show notes.

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Probably about a week ago, that girl casually mentioned that, "Oh yeah, her house is totally haunted."

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Like, when I brought up that I was live streaming from her house, she was just like, "Oh, you know, eyes are shifting side to side."

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 She totally blew it off. And she told me later on, one night, she says, "Listen, I heard someone opening the door and coming into my house multiple times,

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 but I was the only one there, and every time I got up, because I thought it was her roommate coming in, and it wasn't.

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Unless her roommate is also a shadow entity." So yeah, and she admitted at that point, that really kind of unsettled her,

33
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 and she's like, "Yeah, you know, when you said you were live streaming from my house, I kind of played it off, but that house is haunted."

34
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 So I'm hoping to do some more stuff from that location. It'd be cool to get back in there.

35
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Because now we have two people confirming the hauntings, me and the person who lives there.

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 But let's pass by that house, Robert. I keep on driving the Jason Jalop.

37
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 She's screaming for help. The shadow people have her in a headlock. They're giving her nuggies.

38
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 And we're like, "Ah, no, we'll come back for a later episode. See you later."

39
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Let's leave behind the house. We're headed out to the Dark Outpost.

40
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Long-time listeners of the show know Dark Outpost is a conspiracy website. We've talked about it a lot.

41
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Some of the most notable stories they've covered is Hillary Clinton is in Guantanamo Bay, and she's throwing her poop.

42
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 As we speak, right now she's throwing poop at prisoners.

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Guards. Maybe other prisoners, I don't know, maybe.

44
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 But Hillary Clinton is in Guantanamo Bay throwing poop.

45
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 There's underground tunnels. That's a very famous conspiracy theory.

46
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 But let me finish before you start saying, "Well, there are underground tunnels."

47
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Back last year, 50,000 Chinese troops were in...they were all in one tunnel.

48
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 They were all in one tunnel underneath Main, and we nuked it.

49
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 So, those things...okay, each of those individual things are true.

50
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 There are underground tunnels. There is a state known as the State of Main.

51
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 There's 50,000 Chinese troops somewhere in the world, and the United States has dropped a nuclear bomb.

52
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Technically, all four of those statements are true, but he combined them.

53
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 It's hilariously absurd conspiracy theories on the DarkOutpost.com.

54
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 So, it's rich territory for us to keep going back to. I mean, for the first episode of Season 14,

55
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 the fact that we're returning to DarkOutpost.com, you may think, you may think,

56
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 "Oh, Jason is creatively bankrupt." No, it's just that fun.

57
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 I actually thought about putting it off later in the season.

58
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 I was like, "No, I want to talk about it now."

59
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 It does sound like I'm just going back to the same old well, but I'm not.

60
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 David Zubleck is just such a great character.

61
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Such a great character. He has this daily show where he talks about conspiracy theories.

62
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 This current conspiracy theory, Robert, go ahead and park the Jason Jalopy here.

63
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 You realize now that you haven't driven us to the DarkOutpost.

64
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 They gave you bad directions. They gave you bad directions on purpose.

65
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 We're not at the DarkOutpost. We're actually in Vatican City, home of the Pope.

66
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 What is going on here? This video evidence of this.

67
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 So I don't know why I'm poo-pooing it.

68
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 It's the middle of the day in Vatican City.

69
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 There's a young man holding a camera.

70
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 He's aiming it at the tops of the buildings, because that's when you go to Vatican City.

71
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 You just look at the tops of the buildings.

72
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Maybe the Pope's on one of them. Maybe the Pope's on all of them.

73
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 A true miracle.

74
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 This video camera is scanning the tops, the rooftops of these buildings in Vatican City.

75
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 And then...

76
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 It's not a dog. It's not a dog chasing the gravy train.

77
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 A winged creature.

78
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 A beast.

79
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 A demon.

80
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 This thing has to be at least 15, 20 feet tall.

81
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 It's flying across the sky.

82
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 A Vatican City.

83
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 And then it lands.

84
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 And it's like walking on...

85
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 It's like buying some falafels or whatever they eat in Italy.

86
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 I guess spaghetti.

87
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 I don't know what's falafel that's in Middle East.

88
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 It doesn't matter.

89
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 He's not doing that. He's actually walking on rooftops.

90
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 And then he crawls on top of this dome that has a cross on it.

91
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 And this giant creature crawls on the cross and just sits there blasphemously.

92
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Sits on the cross.

93
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 And then they videotape this creature flying away.

94
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 David Zublik, host of DarkOutPost.com, tells us that there's hundreds of people in the streets who heard this.

95
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 You actually hear large crowds in the streets.

96
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Now as this...

97
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Now as this... as my studio is collapsing, I don't know how much I edited out of everything falling down.

98
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 As this winged creature...

99
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 This great start to season 14.

100
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 As this winged creature is soaring through the city, Vatican City, you do hear people in the streets.

101
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 But, oddly enough, throughout this whole encounter, the hundreds of people in the streets, no one is screaming.

102
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Nobody's screaming.

103
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 There is people on the street.

104
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 So that should be your first clue.

105
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 There's something wrong with this video.

106
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 I'm putting the show notes, obviously.

107
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 But David Zublik plays it in full on his DarkOutPost.com show.

108
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 The second clue should have been this creature is obviously CGI.

109
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Like, listen.

110
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 I believe the demons exist.

111
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Let's cut to the chase here.

112
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 The video is so fake.

113
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 The video is super fake.

114
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 He played it.

115
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 He played it on his show.

116
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 And I'll get to it in a second, because I got something to say about it.

117
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 But I believe in demons, right?

118
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 I believe in demons.

119
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 I believe that I have seen demons.

120
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 They look weird, obviously.

121
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 They look bizarre.

122
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 And I think what I've seen has been basically, like, possessed humans.

123
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 So there is...

124
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 And I've talked about it before on the show.

125
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 I'll try to find the episode of...

126
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 I think it's called "The Demons Surround Us."

127
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 I'll try to put it in the show notes.

128
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 But I've seen what I believe to be demonically possessed people.

129
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 They appear monstrous.

130
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 But there's also this thing.

131
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 I don't believe Thor exists.

132
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 And I can watch a Thor movie, and I can enjoy Thor movie,

133
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 but I can tell that Chris Hemsworth exists,

134
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 but he doesn't really have a hammer full of lightning and stuff like that.

135
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 The thing is, obviously, CGI now, that your argument could be,

136
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 "Well, maybe real demons look like really bad 1990s CGI from the movie Spawn."

137
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Because they're from another dimension.

138
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Well, let's go back to this video here that David Zublik plays this video for all of his listeners.

139
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 And he has quite a few.

140
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 He assures us.

141
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 This is a quote after showing this video.

142
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 He goes,

143
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 "It was not a bird.

144
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 It was not a bat."

145
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Now, again, this thing's like 15 feet tall, right?

146
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 So, if it was a bat, that's alarming as well.

147
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 "It was not a bird.

148
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 It was not a bat.

149
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 It was not some sort of dragon."

150
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 He assures us.

151
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 I'm glad that was his third go-to.

152
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 He's like, "You know, some of my viewers believe dragons exist,

153
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 so I should let them know.

154
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Don't worry, guys, it's not a dragon.

155
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 If you currently have a bunch of dwarves to go on an expedition,

156
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 it wasn't there.

157
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 You can still raid Vatican City."

158
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 He does say, so he makes this leap of logic.

159
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 He watches this video that is confirmed to be fake.

160
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 It was actually made by two brothers called JJPD Productions.

161
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 That's not the brother's names that the mom wasn't like.

162
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 You'll be JJPD and you'll be productions.

163
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 It's two brothers.

164
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 They're from Nickerogra.

165
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 They shot this video in Nicaragua.

166
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 It's not even Vatican City.

167
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 It's not even Vatican City.

168
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 It's Granada City, or Granada City.

169
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 It's not even the Vatican City.

170
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Let's refresh this.

171
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 It's not a demon.

172
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 It's CGI.

173
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 It's not Vatican City.

174
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 I'm nexious those are the two big ones, right?

175
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 What are the other ones?

176
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Oh, the day was very overcast.

177
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Those are the two main ones.

178
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Now, listen, I've been fooled before.

179
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 I've been fooled before on the show.

180
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 I've been fooled before in my personal life.

181
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 I've covered stuff that turned out to be hoaxes.

182
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 It happens.

183
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 So I'm not knocking David Zublik so much for being tricked.

184
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 It's going to happen when you're covering this stuff.

185
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 The problem is David Zublik uses this video to claim that the Vatican itself is demonic

186
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 and all associated with it is demonic.

187
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 He basically, basically from a fake video from two dudes in Nicaragua,

188
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 a man across the world,

189
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 declares that one billion people are Satan worshipers.

190
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 One billion Catholics are actually worshiping the devil.

191
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 This is where this story, it's fun because this guy is obviously making a huge mistake.

192
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 The video is obviously fake and we can laugh about that.

193
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 But then he turns it into this hate-mongering screed.

194
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 And I'm not going to go on a big rant about how that's bad.

195
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 You guys know you shouldn't just broadly brush an entire group of people.

196
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 Especially from a 30-second video on YouTube of a CGI demon.

197
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Now if it had been a dragon, maybe he would have gone a little easier on the Catholics.

198
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 But I just find that's where it goes from being funny to just a spooky side of conspiracy theory.

199
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 A lot of people called him out on this video,

200
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 but I'm sure other people watched the video and it reaffirmed their belief

201
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 that Catholics are demonic and they're worshiping the devil because they worship the pope.

202
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 And this is where it gets creepy. It's okay to make mistakes in this forum,

203
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 but when you take that mistake and turn it into a hateful screed,

204
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 who's the real demon, Mr. Zublik?

205
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Who's the real demon? It's so funny when I'm watching the video because his production quality is so bad.

206
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 It's so cheap.

207
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Constantly he's moving around and the green stick green is distorting his face.

208
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 He looks like he's a reptilian. I'm not saying he's a reptilian,

209
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 but all those videos we have of news anchors and they're like turning and they look and then their eyes like flash or Kamala Harris,

210
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 that one where like her eyeballs turn black and she's levitating three feet off the ground and flames shooting up behind her.

211
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 All those little glitches that you see, people go, "Oh, see it's proof it's reptilian. It's proof Obama is a hologram."

212
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 If you believe those glitches, then David Zublik is basically Agent Smith from The Matrix.

213
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 He's constantly morphine into something else.

214
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Robert Reith. Let's go ahead and leave behind Vatican City.

215
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Leave behind the Dark Outpost. We'll be back. We'll be back to the Dark Outpost at some point.

216
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 Cole and Matt Carpentercopter, we are headed out to the United Kingdom.

217
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 [imitates carpenter]

218
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 It's so funny. I saw this conspiracy theory the other day

219
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 and I have been waiting to share it with you guys.

220
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 And it's weird. I don't want to oversell it, but I think it's so telling about what the conspiracy theory community actually is.

221
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Robert Reith landed us in, I don't know, Piccadilly Square. I know that place exists in the United Kingdom.

222
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 That place? Well, land at Piccadilly Square. We're walking around and we see this tall dude walking down the street

223
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 and everyone's like, "Oh my god, dude, look at that giant tall guy in there pointing at him."

224
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 And we're thinking it's kind of rude, right? And then as he gets closer, you go, "Whoa, that's Russell Brand!"

225
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 And I'm like, "Huh?" And that was kind of my reaction to the story started.

226
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 I'm vaguely aware of who Russell Brand is.

227
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 You guys, longtime listeners of the show know I'm a huge pop music fan and I watch celebrity gossip.

228
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Katy Perry, she's okay. Her music is just okay. I'm not really into it.

229
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 But obviously I knew that at one point Russell Brand married Katy Perry, more of the celebrity gossip thing.

230
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 They got a divorce. And when I watched a lot of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, they would always show commercials for Brand X,

231
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 which was Russell Brand's television show. I've never seen anything that Russell Brand's ever been in.

232
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 I've never watched any of his movies, never seen a stand-up special. He could be the funniest guy on the planet.

233
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 He could be super lame. I don't know. The reason why I'm stating all that is I don't have a dog in this fight.

234
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 I'm almost as an outsider looking in at this conspiracy.

235
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 There's a subreddit called "conspiracy no poll," which means no politics.

236
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 Of course politics bleeds a little bit into the conspiracy theories, but they set it up because they just got tired of all of the overtly political conspiracy theories.

237
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 And there was a Redditor who posted this comment the other day.

238
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 And I want to read it to you in full, because I kind of think it sets the tone here.

239
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 But to give you some context, Russell Brand, he has 3 million YouTube followers.

240
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 He is fairly well-known. He had his own show for a while. He's done all these award shows and stuff like that. He's worked for MTV.

241
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 He's been in a couple movies.

242
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 Now as a YouTube channel, he has about 3 million followers.

243
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 And recently he's always done videos on spiritualism and enlightening yourself.

244
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 But he's starting doing videos on the Great Resets and the Davos group.

245
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 And the Great Reset is this idea that we are going to try to reset society, and that's become you will own nothing and you will be happy.

246
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 You're going to live in a box. You're going to eat bugs type of thing.

247
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 The Great Reset, it's been covered in Time Magazine. It's very, very normie conspiracy theory.

248
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 Newsweek covered it. There's tons of articles on it.

249
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 But anyways, he's been talking about the Great Reset. It's very, very important in the conspiracy theory community right now.

250
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 It's just super normie.

251
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 So that's why I don't talk about it. We will talk about it now though.

252
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 So cheap cards and packs on Reddit, type this in.

253
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 I sound like such a boomer type to send. This is what he put off in his spellograph.

254
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 Quote, "I've watched some Russell Brand videos. He used to be mainstream and has a big YouTube channel.

255
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 He's talked about vaccine hesitancy, the Great Reset, you will own nothing and be happy, etc.

256
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 He's saying everything that we're saying.

257
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Why do the elites allow or want him and other popular figures to call them out on their sinister agendas?

258
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 I think he's controlled opposition. But I'm not sure how he's misdirecting people or what disinfo is he spouting.

259
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 I can't figure out what's the 1% lies in his 99% truth."

260
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 People are like, "You're right. Thanks for pointing it out. Cheap cards and packs. You have shown us the truth."

261
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 Russell Brand has to be controlled opposition or predictive programming.

262
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 He's either set up by the powers that be to say stuff against them and speak 99% truth but tell the 1% lie.

263
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 Or he's predictive programming. So Russell Brand gets us... Russell Brand, the guy who I've never seen in any media ever,

264
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 is getting us to prepare for the Great Reset or whatever conspiracy du jour.

265
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 We're using the Great Reset as an example because that's the video I watched as well.

266
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 But there's no way he could authentically actually be on our side. It's the general consensus of the Reddit community.

267
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 It's impossible. He's too rich. He's too famous.

268
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 There's another weird thing that's popped up in this Reddit thread. And I've come across it as well, but it's very just clear as day.

269
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 This is something I call the conspiracy purity test.

270
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 If you don't believe in conspiracy X, then you are a shill.

271
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 You can literally believe in every other conspiracy theory. Every single other topic.

272
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 But let's say you are a Flat Earth-er and I go, "No, I don't believe in Flat Earth."

273
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Then I'm at, "That's the 1% lie, see?" The 99% truth, the 1% lie.

274
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 The problem is that nobody, let me back up, hopefully nobody believes in every single conspiracy theory because some of them,

275
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 "You can't be a Flat Earth-er and a Hollow Earth-er at the same time."

276
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 Now that I said that, I'm sure somebody can figure out a way.

277
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 But we see that too and they're saying he hasn't spoken out on this issue.

278
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 He hasn't spoken out on that issue. Therefore, he's a shill.

279
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 But really what it boils down to, he's too rich and too famous and too powerful to be speaking the truth.

280
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 Here's the thing. I don't know, really, this is what I know about Russell Brand, what I read on the Wikipedia page,

281
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 that on September 11th, 2001, two planes, I'm not laughing at this, I'm laughing about what happens afterwards.

282
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 On September 11th, 2001, three planes crashed into various buildings around the United States and 3,000 people were killed.

283
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 On September 12th, 2001, Russell Brand showed up for work at his job at MTV Studios dressed as Osama bin Laden.

284
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 It's not funny back then, it's funny now, right? It's funny now. They fired him.

285
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 I saw that on his Wikipedia page. He also won a fashion award. GQ was doing this men's fashion awards, or just fashion awards in general.

286
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 And the sponsor of the event was Hugo Boss. And he wins this award and he gets up on stage and he starts goose stepping and saying,

287
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 "Hugo Boss," which is true, "Hugo Boss designed and manufactured costumes for the Nazi regime."

288
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Not costumes, uniforms. So, like wearing Dracula outfits on the battlefield, he's the one, Hugo Boss helped design and did produce the uniforms for the Nazi.

289
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 So he's saying that there's a giant billboard or there's a giant wall behind him decorated and says, "GQ sponsored by Hugo Boss."

290
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 And he's putting his fingers up like he has a Hitler mustache and goose stepping around and talking about...

291
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 So, I mean, that's pretty ballsy. He got kicked out of that event after he got his award, they kicked him out.

292
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 That stuff, that's pretty ballsy trolly stuff, speaking truth to power.

293
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 Osama bin Laden thing wasn't speaking truth to power. That was just him being a shock comedian.

294
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 But anyways, that's all I know about him. I've never seen him in any of his movies or anything like that.

295
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 He could be a total douchebag in real life. Who knows? Or he could be a nice guy. I don't know.

296
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 But when we just look at this stuff, he is famous. He's worth about $20 million. I had to look all this stuff up.

297
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 But, you know, he's famous. He does have a platform. He has 3 million YouTube followers.

298
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 He could probably get another talk show if he wanted one, or at least he could start making connections.

299
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 He's published books. He definitely does wield power.

300
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 But this weird idea that just because he is famous and powerful that he can't speak the truth, I find baffling.

301
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 And you see people making these comments in Reddit, and the commenter underneath them going,

302
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 "Write on, brother. You are speaking the truth. You are absolutely right. You know it. They're all agreeing with each other."

303
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 And I'm looking at it, and I'm thinking, who are these anonymous people?

304
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 How do you know you're talking to a non-famous, non-rich person when you're on Reddit, or when you're on X, or when you're on God-like productions,

305
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 or vigilance citizens? Jason, a rich person wouldn't waste their time on those websites. You got it wrong. You got it backwards.

306
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 A rich, famous person, they want anonymity. That's the main complaint about being famous.

307
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 Eminem famously said, "If I could do it over again, I'd be Tech 9."

308
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 Tech 9's number two. I'm number one. Tech 9 has 100,000 fans. Every album he makes, he sells 100,000 copies.

309
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 Every show he does, he sells out, and he can go shopping. He can spend time with his family. He can do whatever he wants.

310
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 He goes, "I'm number one. If an album flops or it's not as good, I'm a joke."

311
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 Everyone says, "I'm washed up. I can't go anywhere with my kids. They've got a camera in my face. If I could do it all over again, I'd be number two."

312
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 So you're telling me that Eminem's never been on an anonymous board. Be like, "Oh, so he's all busting flows?" Of course he has.

313
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 And you've probably had a conversation with him.

314
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 And if he said, if Russell Brand was on an anonymous board and said the same stuff about the Great Reset, people would be like, "Oh, dude, that's so...man, you're right. You're right. Noodle man, you're totally right."

315
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 But then when you realize that the person saying that has money, he had money already and fame and power. But you didn't know it. You took...

316
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 And this isn't directed at you guys. You guys are smarter than this. But the people who are just really piling onto this, Russell Brand, is absolutely wrong because he's famous camp.

317
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 They've probably, if Russell Brand does believe in the conspiracy theories, they probably have talked to him in these forums and agreed with him.

318
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 But because he's famous, one percent of the stuff he says has to be intentionally a lie.

319
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 Now there's hundreds of comments in this Reddit thread of purity tests that they need to believe X for that to ever be real if they never state an allegiance to this conspiracy theory.

320
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 It's always fake. See a lot of that stuff. Other people just saying he's too rich and famous.

321
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 And I'm reading this and I'm thinking...I was doing research on Russell Brand and once I found out that he trusted with Osama bin Laden, I started thinking he's probably in these comments.

322
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 He's probably looking at these comments and posting as them and saying stuff. Posting as Osama bin Laden 89.

323
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 But out of all of them, this is what I love about conspiracy theories. One of the things I love about conspiracy theories is unraveling them.

324
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Robert Reith, let's fire up the carbonicopter one last time. We're leaving behind the UK. We're traveling to just a house in the middle of nowhere.

325
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 And we see a young boy. We'll just assume he's like 20.

326
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 Typing away. We're looking in through his window. It's a crisp spring night. He's all alone tapping away on his keyboard.

327
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 No one's paying attention to him on Reddit. Out of all of the Reddit posts and answers and stuff, he got like four upvotes and two responses.

328
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 And he actually had the key to this whole theory. Fascinating stuff. This is what I love about conspiracy theories.

329
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 And what's so funny is it was getting so bogged down in controlled opposition, predictive programming, controlled opposition, predictive programming.

330
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 There's a young man. For all I know, this could be Russell Brand. There's a young man. He's raising his hand. He's like, "Guys, guys, listen to me. I have the answer."

331
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 So often in conspiracy theories, the legit stuff gets buried by the stuff that takes very, very little mental imagination.

332
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 Because it's easy to digest and just move on.

333
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 Reluctant Chimera is the name of this Reddit user. And they said that they actually used to follow Russell Brand on YouTube.

334
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 They actually used to watch his video and they noticed that he had a number 33 tattoo on his wrist.

335
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 Which if you don't know, the number 33 is a big number within the Masonic lodges.

336
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 I've also heard that there's 33 vertebrae in the human spine. So that's something to do with Kundalini spiritual practice.

337
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 I don't know about that. I don't know how many vertebrae in the human spine. I've never counted.

338
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 But I do know that 33 is very, very tied into Masonic theory, the 33 degrees.

339
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 Russell Brand does have a 33 tattoo on his wrist. He says that's because that's how old Jesus was and he was crucified.

340
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 He does seem to be a very spiritual person. Other people said that's a cover story. I can't speak on that.

341
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 I can't speak on that. Russell Brand is saying it's this. Other people go, "Well, that's not..."

342
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 I mean, who's word are you going to take? And we're back to that same thing. Who's word do you take?

343
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 The guy who's being accused of it or the anonymous person. Who might also be him?

344
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 The point of anonymity is you don't know who it is. It could be a average person. It could be someone just like you.

345
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 It could be a super rich and famous guy. It could be Russell Brand. It could be anybody.

346
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 You don't know. We assume when you read stuff on the Internet, a lot of times we assign a voice that's similar to our own.

347
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 But anyway, so this person says he has the number 33, so I looked more into it and I found out about the new statesman.

348
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 So Russell Brand is speaking out about the Great Reset. And I did watch that video and it was interesting because his takeaway was this.

349
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 And the video does drop red pills. I'll put it in the show notes. The video isn't him like saying it doesn't exist.

350
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 The video is pointing stuff out about the Great Reset and why it would be terrible. It's really interesting.

351
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 In this video, Russell Brand goes, "If you're going to tell us we're going to own nothing and like it, my question is, well, then who will own those things?

352
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 Those things aren't going to go away. If I own nothing, somebody else by default must own it."

353
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 So he's not sugarcoating any of this stuff. It's a very, very interesting video.

354
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 But Russell Brand, as he's talking about the Great Reset and all this stuff, he is connected to a magazine he used to be an editor for called The New Statesman.

355
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 It's a British magazine. That magazine was started by a group called The Fabian Society.

356
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 The Fabian Society was founded on January 4th, 1884 in London. Its goal was to change society.

357
00:28:51,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 It's what we would call today a progressive group. They fought for things like, and they continue to fight for things like minimum wage, higher minimum wage, getting rid of landlords, things like that.

358
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 Those were a lot of their early goals. One of their early goals was eugenics as well. So not a good look. Not a good look, Fabian Society.

359
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 They've dropped that one, but it's basically this progressive utopian society.

360
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 Fabian Society is named after a Roman general named Quintus Fabius Maximus Verroclus, who believed he had to win a war by making small tactical battles, harassing the enemy behind their own lines,

361
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 making it hard for them to gain footholds, not have these huge toe-to-toe fights, slow little fights, and over time you whittle them down.

362
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 Here's a quote from a Fabian Society pamphlet.

363
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 "For the right moment you must wait, as Fabius did most patiently when warring against Hannibal, though many censured his delays.

364
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 But when the time comes you must strike hard, as Fabius did, or your waiting will be in vain and fruitless."

365
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 Their original coat of arms for the Fabian Society, they had to change this, because people thought it sent the wrong message.

366
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 It's a wolf in sheep's clothing.

367
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 That is research. That's not buzzwords. That's not controlled opposition, predictive programming, controlled opposition.

368
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 Now things get weird. Now it's just not going, "Why is this guy so famous? How can he be dropping the truth?"

369
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 But now we have him being linked to a group that wants to enact social change, like almost every group wants to do.

370
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 But you see, and now the pieces start to come together. That's research.

371
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 And that is what is so sorely lacking in the conspiracy theory community.

372
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 People just want to spout those buzzwords as anonymous people nod their heads and agree with them and they spout their own buzzwords.

373
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 While we have someone who is able to link him to a group that wants to change the world, that wants to change society, by enacting tiny little changes over time to do so.

374
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 Whose original logo was a wolf in sheep's clothing.

375
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 Now the article that's really, really interesting stuff when we're talking about groups and ideas like the Great Reset, but the article then goes on to say, "He's a sane worshipper who might have been brainwashed by the Illuminati."

376
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 And again starts adding in all those buzzwords, all that sexiness, right? And becomes inconsequential again.

377
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 But looking at that key thing, he worked for a newspaper.

378
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 He was the editor of a newspaper called The New Statesman that was founded by the Fabian Society who wants to change the world.

379
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 Now if there's nothing wrong with wanting to change the world, I may disagree with what you want to change the world to be in.

380
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 My idea, dream idea, is Star Trek universe, post scarcity, everyone is just chilling.

381
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 And we get to fight aliens, that's my dream world.

382
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 Some people want to live in a Mad Max anarchy, more power to you.

383
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 I will rule that world as well, but see you on the battlefield.

384
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 There's nothing wrong with wanting to change the world.

385
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 I don't want to live in a box, I don't want to eat bugs.

386
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 I think most people don't want to and Russell Brand, as he pointed out, if I'm living in a box eating bugs, someone's still owning the stuff.

387
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 So I'm not saying the Fabian Society actually agrees with the Great Reset.

388
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 I'm not saying that Russell Brand agrees with the Great Reset. He's saying that he doesn't.

389
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 But that little bit of extra information makes the story more complicated, it makes it juicier.

390
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 And this is what I love about conspiracy theory, guys.

391
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 If you've gotten anything from this segment, I hope you get the excitement in my voice.

392
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 This is what I love about conspiracy theories. I love the mysteries, I love the different layers to them.

393
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 We have this guy who's saying, "I believe in X." People are saying he's controlled opposition.

394
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 Then it turns out that he works for a group that is trying to enact social change, or at least is aligned with that group.

395
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 But does that group want the same social change that he's rallying against? Is it controlled opposition? Is it all these layers and layers of stuff? It's so juicy!

396
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 I love this story! And the biggest takeaway of this story is just because somebody is famous, you can't give them certain motives.

397
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 Because in a world, you can't, you can do whatever you want, I really don't care, it's your life.

398
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 But in a world where everything is anonymous, how do you know you have not debated whether or not jet fuel can melt steel beams with a Kardashian?

399
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 Now see, right now, something in your head, you either laughed at that, or something in your head goes, "Yeah, right."

400
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 You don't know. We're given an image of the "We think Russell Brand is just a guy who shows him on movie sets dressed up like Osama bin Laden."

401
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 But you don't know what he was. He is still just like us. He just has more money and you know his name and he's on television. That's it.

402
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 Right? So who's to say that there's not a Kardashian? It's like, "Yeah, you know what, I don't believe the official story about 9/11."

403
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 Or she does and she's very adamant. She has all these facts and you've actually debated.

404
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 So it sounds ridiculous because we have this image, this photoshopped image of these young women.

405
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 But in the world of the anonymous, they could be anyone. That's the thing about anonymity.

406
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 It's not just you and your peers. It's not just 12 year olds raging on their Xbox and boomers drinking their monsters.

407
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 I find it so fascinating. One, because of the different layers and two, just this idea that because someone's famous, they can't be saying something true or something important.

408
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 And we say that and we're typing it into our keyboards and everyone on the reddit is like, "Yeah, everyone's just like me. Just the dude sitting at home."

409
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 And then the dude, then at another home, a guy, he sits there and he's like, "Yep. Russell Brand sure is controlled opposition."

410
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 And then someone goes, "Hey, Mr. Spielberg, it's time to go make that movie." And he's like, "Oh wait, I forgot I was on a film set. I shouldn't have been on my phone typing away on reddit."

411
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 And then he goes to make whatever Spielberg's making.

412
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 Anonymity benefits the famous more than anybody else. It truly does.

413
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 They don't get to express their opinions as much as everyone else does.

414
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 If you express your opinion, people may just go, "What? That's dumb."

415
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 But a famous person expresses their opinion for the next 50 years whenever they're doing an interview.

416
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 They're like, "So, Kim Kardashian, it's the 50th anniversary of you being born. You're 50 years old. I don't know why I said it was 50th anniversary."

417
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 But a long time ago, you talked about jet fuel not melting steel beams. It'll always be brought up.

418
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 Now, obviously, if you express a controversial opinion, you can get fired or you can get arrested.

419
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 The anonymity legally doesn't exist. The police can always track down what you say.

420
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 But I'm talking about like social anonymity.

421
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 The number one benefiters of that are the rich and famous.

422
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 So to think that when we're talking about conspiracies online, that rich and famous and powerful people,

423
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 that Warren Buffett has never logged into X to check out a succubus thread, is ridiculous.

424
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 They do do that. Don't sue me, Warren Buffett.

425
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 Don't use your succubi powers to come after me in the middle of the night.

426
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 But you know what I mean? It benefits them.

427
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 I just find this whole conspiracy super amusing.

428
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 I find it interesting that there is that extra layer that does connect him to a very powerful society in the UK

429
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 that doesn't want to enact social change and no one else picked up on it except one person.

430
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 Fascinating. And this idea that we have probably all debated conspiracy theories with very famous and powerful people.

431
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 And we've go, "You know what? You actually made a good point."

432
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 And if you knew that was actually Chris Evans on the other side, you would have called him a shill.

433
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 And again, not you. I'm just talking about these guys in general.

434
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 But they would have called him a shill. The opinion was exactly the same.

435
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 But once it was done by someone they considered a peer, the second time they found that it was from someone who was "better than them,"

436
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 they immediately disregard the opinion or try to find fault in it.

437
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 Conspiracy theories are fascinating in and of themselves.

438
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 But when you look into the minds of a conspiracy theorist,

439
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 it is truly an amazing and scary journey to go on.
