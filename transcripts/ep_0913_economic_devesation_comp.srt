1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,400
 When a young man is out on a hike, he has no idea he's about to come face to face with

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,200
 a haunting event from his past.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,320
 And then we meet a single mother who's trying her best to raise her two kids.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,340
 Life is already difficult for one parent trying to do that job, but it is almost impossible

5
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:27,040
 when the house you are living in is possessed by a demon.

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:34,040
 Day on Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:40,040
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,040
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, and I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,440
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,720
 I hope you guys have some awesome plans for the weekend.

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,560
 Let's go ahead and get the ball rolling here.

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,320
 Let's go ahead and introduce in one of our newest Patreon supporters walking into Dead

13
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,320
 Rabbit Command.

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,320
 Give it up for DJ Blue.

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,320
 Woo!

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,040
 Wickedy wickedy whack!

17
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,640
 Scratching him turntables, DJ.

18
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,040
 His real name might be DJ.

19
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,080
 I don't know if he's actually a disc jockey, but DJ Blue, you're going to be our captain,

20
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,080
 our pilot this episode.

21
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,360
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,360
 It really is.

23
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,920
 Just help spread the word about this show.

24
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,840
 That really, really, really helps out a lot.

25
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,840
 It sucks.

26
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,840
 Just a quick...

27
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,840
 I am having a good day.

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,640
 I really am having a good day, but I want to see something real quick because I know

29
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,640
 other people deal with this.

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,600
 I'm also like in the middle of an anxiety attack.

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,360
 I'm like, "Hey, when you have an anxiety attack, your fight or flight mechanism is rewired,

32
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,360
 right?"

33
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,600
 And I woke up from this nap and I've not felt 100%.

34
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,600
 I'm just...

35
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,440
 I think, you know, there's a lot of stuff going on in my life right now.

36
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,320
 The temperature's really hot.

37
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,760
 I had a coffee this morning.

38
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,480
 I really don't drink a lot of caffeine anymore, so now any caffeine can set me off.

39
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,480
 But you know what?

40
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,480
 Here I am, man.

41
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,480
 I'm having an anxiety attack.

42
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,440
 My body feels like it could shut down at any moment.

43
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,280
 I'm like panicking and I'm still doing what I need to do.

44
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,120
 And I wanted to share that with you because you can't let your own fears get in the way.

45
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,600
 I mean, I have to do this, right?

46
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,600
 I enjoy doing this podcast, but I got to get these episodes out and I got to record them

47
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,400
 when I record them.

48
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,400
 And here I am.

49
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
 I'm sitting in here.

50
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,480
 I'm a little panicky.

51
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:13,800
 I feel aches and pains that actually don't exist or it's like a muscle soreness in my

52
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,800
 lower right side, which makes me think I'm having a heart attack.

53
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:24,800
 It's just you got to push through all the obstacles, especially the fake ones, especially

54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,880
 the obstacles we put in front of ourselves.

55
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,840
 So let that be a little PSA for you guys this weekend.

56
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,940
 Do what you need to do.

57
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,240
 Do what you want to do.

58
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,840
 Don't ever let fear get in the way because most of the time there's nothing to be afraid

59
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,840
 of.

60
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,440
 DJ Blue, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

61
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,720
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

62
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,760
 We're driving all the way out to Willet, New York.

63
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,200
 I found this story online.

64
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,360
 It was posted by someone going under the alias Left-handed Archer.

65
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,800
 We're going to go ahead and call this guy Aaron.

66
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,280
 I don't think that's your real name.

67
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,280
 Hopefully it's not.

68
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,120
 If it is, it's just a guess.

69
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,920
 Again, I'm just giving you a name that's a little bit easier than Left-handed Archer.

70
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:13,680
 Aaron is hiking through Redbrook State Forest in Willet, New York.

71
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,520
 He provided a Google map when he was talking about this story like a satellite view and

72
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,480
 just lush trees.

73
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,360
 It's not straight up in the middle of nowhere, but it's also not across the street from a

74
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,360
 Wendy's.

75
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,880
 It is a hike.

76
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,120
 That's where Aaron is walking through right now.

77
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,040
 As he's walking through the forest enjoying nature, seeing the beauty of the world all

78
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:40,640
 around him, he stumbles across the cabin in the woods.

79
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,200
 It's partially collapsed.

80
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,200
 It's sitting there.

81
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,320
 The elements have destroyed most of this cabin over the decades since it's been built.

82
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,440
 But even though it's weathered, even though it's been falling apart, he immediately recognizes

83
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,440
 it.

84
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,800
 Memories begin to flood back into his head.

85
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,120
 He's been here before.

86
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,120
 Aaron tells this story.

87
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,680
 He goes back in 1997.

88
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,880
 I was between the ages of three and four years old.

89
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,680
 I was in that little age group.

90
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,680
 And I was kidnapped.

91
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,760
 I was kidnapped at gunpoint by a man and a woman.

92
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,280
 And they took me to this cabin.

93
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,160
 They took me to this cabin and I was sexually molested.

94
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,840
 And then they let me go.

95
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,560
 And when I got home, I told my parents what happened.

96
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,520
 They didn't even know I was missing.

97
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,080
 They had no idea that I was gone.

98
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,960
 Especially no idea I was kidnapped.

99
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,960
 And they didn't believe me.

100
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,440
 They thought I made the story up.

101
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,760
 So nobody contacted the police.

102
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,760
 I was three, right?

103
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,200
 I don't know how to contact the police.

104
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,040
 I don't know how this stuff happens.

105
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,400
 I go home and tell my parents what happened.

106
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,400
 They totally don't believe me.

107
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,800
 They don't even believe that I'm missing.

108
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,440
 There's never been any police investigation done on this place.

109
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,760
 So life goes on.

110
00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:02,520
 But as I'm hiking through the woods just recently, I came across that cabin again and I realized

111
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,040
 I should look into this.

112
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,320
 Because let's say he was three years old in 1997.

113
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,320
 You're like, great.

114
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,880
 Here's a Jason Does Math segment.

115
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,880
 This is how I do math.

116
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,720
 He'd be six in the year 2000 and it's the year 2020.

117
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,120
 He'd be 28 years old now.

118
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,560
 So now he does know how to call the police.

119
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,280
 Now he knows how things work.

120
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:30,880
 And he's actually, he was posting this on the subreddit RBI, which is Reddit Bureau of

121
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,880
 Investigations.

122
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,840
 They try to solve mysteries and stuff like that.

123
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,040
 I have this one noted and I have an archive of it.

124
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,680
 They usually take stuff like this down.

125
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,120
 This subreddit is kind of lame.

126
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,680
 Anything that involves anything, basically anything that involves anything other than

127
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,560
 I have an NES cartridge, but the label's peeled off.

128
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,560
 What is it?

129
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,320
 Other than that, and that stupid California raisins, ARG that's going on, they delete

130
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,160
 anything most of the time that's police related.

131
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,520
 But it is an interesting subreddit to take a look at.

132
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,640
 He says, this happened to me and he provided the Google Earth coordinate.

133
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,600
 So I went ahead and pulled those up and sure enough, you see this little collapsed structure

134
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,600
 in the woods.

135
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,000
 This is an interesting story, obviously, on a couple of different levels.

136
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,360
 Let's start taking it apart.

137
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,960
 First off, absolutely tragic incident, right?

138
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,960
 On multiple levels.

139
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,960
 He was kidnapped.

140
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,360
 He was sexually molested.

141
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,980
 And then his parents didn't believe him.

142
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,400
 That's all three of those things in and of themselves.

143
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,440
 Well, your parents not believing you if like, you're like, no, I didn't break the vase.

144
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,440
 That's okay.

145
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,360
 But your parents not believing you about something serious in and of itself is awful, being kidnapped

146
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,860
 is in and of itself at awful.

147
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,920
 They took him to the Waffle House and dropped him back off.

148
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,420
 That's horrible.

149
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:44,360
 And then obviously the third, the sexual assault is the worst, but having all three of them

150
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,040
 happening.

151
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,280
 Interesting story.

152
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,960
 It's a true crime story.

153
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,760
 And there's so many ways we can look at this.

154
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:57,540
 I'm trying to figure out looking at this map, like was he, because there's some information

155
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,040
 missing too, right?

156
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,360
 I'm sure some of you guys are like, huh?

157
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,360
 Where was he kidnapped from?

158
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,440
 Was he kidnapped from his house?

159
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,840
 Was he walking down the road?

160
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,360
 Even the road seemed a little out of the way.

161
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,920
 I didn't see a neighborhood in there.

162
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,120
 So was he kidnapped from his house?

163
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,160
 Was he kidnapped from the road?

164
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,920
 He doesn't say that he remembered the people.

165
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,120
 He actually looking back, he goes, those people were incredibly dangerous.

166
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,520
 They kidnapped me at gunpoint and took me out to this cabin.

167
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,240
 And then he said there was a light bulb on in the cabin.

168
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,320
 So there was utilities out there.

169
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,720
 Was I the only one?

170
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,520
 Did they do this to multiple children?

171
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,840
 Did the other children just disappear?

172
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,440
 Or were they also not noticed that they were missing?

173
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,560
 But it's just creepy on that level.

174
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,440
 Like he had this thing happen to him, which would be a major news story if the police were

175
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,760
 involved, if the parents believe him.

176
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,280
 He goes, listen, I didn't have the best family life.

177
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,240
 I was looking through his posting history.

178
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,840
 That wasn't the first time that happened either.

179
00:07:52,840 --> 00:08:00,360
 He does mention that a female family member had also sexually abused him.

180
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,000
 And he was trying to see if he could figure out who owned the cabin.

181
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,840
 But by now, the deeds had been transferred.

182
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,280
 People are actually looking into this, you know, like land ownership and deeds were transferred

183
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,280
 in and out.

184
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,160
 So just because someone owned it now, and it doesn't seem to be inhabited, it seems like

185
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,160
 it's empty.

186
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,480
 I mean, obviously there's not a lot of people living in an house with a collapsed roof.

187
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,400
 And here you have this 28 year old man.

188
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:28,560
 You know, he's trying to, I think at this point, find out more about the case to see,

189
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,200
 you know, has this, these people need to be stopped.

190
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,000
 Obviously, if there are people driving around and they're kidnapping children at gunpoint,

191
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 it's not the first time.

192
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,720
 And it wasn't the last, you know, like did these people do other things to other people?

193
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,000
 Are they still out there?

194
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 One of the reasons why I like doing this show is to depress you, not to just tell creepy

195
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,840
 stories on Fridays.

196
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,480
 Especially true crime.

197
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,440
 And the reason why I go out of my way to find true crime that people haven't heard of is

198
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:03,120
 because stuff like this, these are the events that happen daily all across America, all

199
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,880
 across the world.

200
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:12,920
 But the Ted Bundy's and the Jeffrey Dahmers and the Laurie Valos, you know, these big

201
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:17,240
 true crime cases, those are the outliers.

202
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,760
 And that's why they're covered because they're so weird.

203
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,500
 But this type of stuff happens all the time.

204
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,520
 And a lot of times people don't talk about it because the family doesn't believe the

205
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:33,600
 victim or because the victim doesn't say anything.

206
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,280
 You know, at that point, it's normalized to them that it might not have been the first

207
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:41,440
 time that something happens to a kid who's seven, eight, and they get grabbed by some

208
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,480
 strangers and taken to the sawmill and stuff happens to them and then they get dropped back

209
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,480
 off.

210
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,080
 That's not the first time I've had family members touching me.

211
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,720
 I'm not even going to re...it's just part of being a kid.

212
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,160
 And then they go on with their life.

213
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,160
 It's disturbing.

214
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,800
 I'm not even talking about it out loud.

215
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,600
 I realize actually how disturbing it is.

216
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,040
 But these are the true crimes that happen all the time.

217
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,520
 Creepy, creepy story and a mystery too.

218
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,400
 Like he doesn't know who these people are.

219
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,960
 What happened to them?

220
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,120
 Are they still out there?

221
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,240
 Are they still doing this?

222
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,840
 All he knows is that the shack is still there.

223
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,440
 The fact that he was able to find the shack and I don't think he was out there looking

224
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,440
 for it.

225
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,040
 I think he was just hiking through the area and saw the shack.

226
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,280
 Absolutely creepy, disturbing mystery.

227
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,560
 Are these people still out there?

228
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,640
 Did they do it multiple times?

229
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,200
 I would say yes.

230
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,520
 They probably did this multiple times.

231
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:44,240
 How many other young children did they abduct and take to this cabin or any other cabin?

232
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,280
 Creepy, terrifying, true crime story.

233
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:51,120
 I probably would not have told it on a Friday had I thought it through how creepy it actually

234
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,120
 was.

235
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,960
 But DJ Blue, let's go ahead and give you the keys to the carpenter copter.

236
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,320
 We are leaving behind Will It New York?

237
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,680
 Not a moment too soon.

238
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:09,640
 We are headed all the way out to suburban America.

239
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,200
 The ride is very long and very silent.

240
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,760
 DJ Blue, I was going to have him do yesterday's episode.

241
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,920
 I go, "Nah, yesterday's episode was too gross."

242
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,280
 And then he's like, "Oh, thanks, Jason.

243
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,760
 That story is absolutely terrifying.

244
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,500
 Keep flying us in this carpenter copter, DJ Blue.

245
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,040
 We are headed out to this small house in suburban America."

246
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,320
 We don't know where this takes place, honestly.

247
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,240
 We don't know where this takes place.

248
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,280
 I say suburban America, but the house that this family is living in is like 200 years

249
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,280
 old.

250
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:47,120
 It's actually not a set of tract housing somewhere in Anaheim, California.

251
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,320
 It may be like a nice big house on the East Coast.

252
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,920
 200-year-old house.

253
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,640
 We're back in the year 2013.

254
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,640
 That's where this saga begins.

255
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,240
 And we're going to meet this woman.

256
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,920
 We're going to go ahead and call her Monica.

257
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,560
 She did not give her name.

258
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,760
 Monica's a single mother and she is moving into this house with her two children and

259
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,760
 her shih tzu.

260
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,760
 Little puppy.

261
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,240
 We will call Barkley.

262
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,600
 Now she knows she's buying an old house and she said when she was looking at the house

263
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,520
 and when she was visiting the house, she could tell the house was haunted.

264
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,760
 She could tell the house had this sort of energy to it.

265
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,480
 And she actually told her kids, "Listen, listen, I know this is your first night in this spooky

266
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,600
 icky house and it's haunted, but just don't give it any energy.

267
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,120
 Don't think about it.

268
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:43,040
 Don't think about that lingering death glare staring at you from underneath the bed.

269
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:50,160
 When you're taking a shower, don't think about hands pressing up against the shower curtains.

270
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,640
 Don't think about any of that stuff.

271
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,800
 Just ignore it.

272
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,040
 Don't give it any energy."

273
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,680
 Kids are like, "Okay, Ma."

274
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,040
 And that's what she kind of did, right?

275
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,680
 She's just like, "Okay, it's haunted.

276
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,680
 I got a bigger fish to fry.

277
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,560
 I'm not going to think about it."

278
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,960
 And then obviously, because we're talking about this on a paranormal podcast, things

279
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,960
 escalate.

280
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,680
 At one point, you know, she's, it's just her in the house.

281
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,360
 Her kids are staying with their grandparents and they're like only like a mile or two away.

282
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,360
 So she can work on the house.

283
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,760
 At this point, she was tearing off the old paneling to the house and kind of fixing it

284
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,000
 up.

285
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,520
 And she said, "She's tearing off the paneling and it's hard work.

286
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,520
 Very physical.

287
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,520
 She's exhausted.

288
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:38,360
 She's up calling in at night and her and Barkley go to bed.

289
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:45,080
 So she's laying in the bed and the little shitsue is sleeping at her feet."

290
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:53,560
 And Monica says at around 3.15, she remembers the time at around 3.15, she hears Barkley

291
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,120
 yell.

292
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,600
 She actually said, that actually sounded like a happy yelp.

293
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,080
 She said it sounded like somebody had kicked Barkley.

294
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,080
 Like it wasn't a happy one.

295
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,040
 It was a, "Oh, Barkley is in pain."

296
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,040
 It wakes Monica up.

297
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:15,600
 She wakes up and she's trying to figure out what's going on while her little dog's yelping.

298
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:23,000
 And she said, "I sat up in bed and then my entire body froze in place."

299
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,680
 She said, "As I sat up, it was like I got locked into that sitting up position."

300
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:37,440
 And she goes, "The angle that my body was at, you wouldn't need to have a full on ab

301
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,440
 workout.

302
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:45,400
 Suzanne Summers came to your house every day and worked out your abs type of physical fitness."

303
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:51,080
 She goes, "When I came up into that position and I locked, she said it was extremely uncomfortable

304
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:56,080
 and she couldn't figure out how she stayed like that for so long.

305
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,280
 She sat up and then she froze."

306
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,200
 And she goes, "The freezing wasn't just my body.

307
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,040
 I also couldn't scream.

308
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,680
 Like I was in immediate shock that this was happening to me and I couldn't scream and

309
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:14,120
 I was locked into this very uncomfortable sitting up position almost like a mid crunch.

310
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:23,520
 And then she felt something reach in and grab onto her heart.

311
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:30,640
 She said my chest was just wracked with wave after wave of pain as something is just squeezing

312
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,720
 my heart and my tummy.

313
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,720
 My abs.

314
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,560
 I was in this awkward position.

315
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:42,960
 My entire midsection was cramping up and hurting so bad in her chest was just getting crushed

316
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,080
 and she's in this position and she gets a thought in her head.

317
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,500
 You have two choices Monica.

318
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:55,680
 Choose to live or choose to die."

319
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,840
 And she said because she's in so much pain, this is interesting, this is interesting,

320
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:07,200
 because she's in so much pain, she chose to die.

321
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,320
 And right when she made that decision, her body completely relaxes.

322
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:15,520
 She falls backwards onto the bed.

323
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,040
 This entire sensation is done.

324
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:23,040
 She reaches over, she turns on the light, she grabs her car keys, she grabs her dog and

325
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:30,520
 that's when she realized that both her and Barkley had both wet the bed.

326
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,600
 Now when I'm reading that I'm thinking, I'm reading this in order the first time I read

327
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,600
 this.

328
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,200
 I go, "Oh man, it sounds like she was having a seizure or a heart attack."

329
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,200
 But as the story progresses, as the story progresses, that's not the story.

330
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,200
 That's not the end of the story.

331
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:48,000
 As the story progresses, at first you go, "Because I am skeptical of everything, but I believe

332
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 in ghosts and all this stuff."

333
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 We've talked about that on the show before.

334
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,560
 But when I'm reading it, it sounds like she might have had a mild heart attack or a stroke.

335
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,240
 Maybe they'll reveal that later in the story.

336
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,240
 They don't.

337
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,600
 It was a ghost.

338
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,680
 But then the idea of her choosing to die, we've covered a ton of stories.

339
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,480
 So many stories, I don't even think I can put them in the show notes, of people being

340
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,560
 faced with these decisions, these impossible odds, and they choose to live.

341
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,800
 And then something happens, they have a near-death experience.

342
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,840
 They meet an alien or a ghost or something like that, guardian angel.

343
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,640
 Monica chose to die, even though she had two children, she loved very much.

344
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,280
 The pain was just too unbearable.

345
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,680
 And she chose to die.

346
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,360
 And the phenomenon ended.

347
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,520
 That event ended.

348
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,440
 Or did it?

349
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:38,800
 Was her decision that night an aggravating factor for what happens going forward?

350
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,760
 I couldn't say that was the decision that I would make, right?

351
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,760
 I'm a big baby when it comes to pain.

352
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,520
 And then she peed the bed, which isn't demonic, but it's kind of funny.

353
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,920
 It's kind of funny.

354
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,360
 She goes on to say, she goes, "Listen, life is not easy.

355
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,440
 It's not easy for anyone.

356
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,520
 It's not easy for a single parent or two children.

357
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,800
 But this house has made it so much worse."

358
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,400
 And she goes, "I'm a homebody.

359
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,200
 I love staying at home.

360
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,200
 That's where I relax.

361
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,280
 That's where I recharge.

362
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,640
 But not here.

363
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,440
 My entire life, I've been a homebody.

364
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,120
 I'd rather sit at home watching television or reading a good book than going out.

365
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,320
 My entire life, I was like that.

366
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,520
 But not in this home.

367
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,600
 Not in my home.

368
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,400
 And so she finds it odd that when she leaves, let's say she goes away for a weekend.

369
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,080
 She's on this little vacation.

370
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,520
 She feels amazing.

371
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,480
 She feels so good about life.

372
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,880
 She feels physically healthy.

373
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,040
 She feels mentally healthy.

374
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:51,480
 But when she comes home, she describes it as an unending cycle of depression.

375
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,040
 Something is wrong with this house.

376
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,040
 Something is wrong with this house.

377
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,520
 And she believes that this house has a ghost in it.

378
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,400
 And she starts looking for spiritual answers, which is a great place to start and usually

379
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,240
 a great place to finish if it's just something small.

380
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,240
 She goes, "I pray.

381
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,200
 I prayed in every room.

382
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,720
 I was praying for deliverance from this thing."

383
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,320
 She said that she saged the place.

384
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,200
 She said she brought in a priest to bless the place.

385
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,840
 Nothing helped.

386
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,760
 The place still was oppressive.

387
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:29,320
 She could feel this presence in her house, in the house of her and her family.

388
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,120
 It's like putting a thumb on her.

389
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,200
 I'd say more than that.

390
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:39,920
 Just washing her down with a boot into the mud.

391
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:44,600
 She says that when she's alone in the house, which I don't know why you would be, but

392
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,360
 again, she kind of talks about that.

393
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,920
 She goes, "I can't afford to move."

394
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,600
 The story starts in 2013.

395
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,440
 I'm telling it in 2022.

396
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,280
 She's still there.

397
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,520
 She's still trapped.

398
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:03,120
 She goes, "When I'm home alone, because I can't force my children to be there all the time."

399
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,000
 She goes, "I will hear someone call my name."

400
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,440
 And she says the way that it says it is desperate.

401
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,440
 It's not, "Yo, Monica.

402
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,080
 Hey, what's up?"

403
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,920
 It's, "Monica.

404
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,920
 Monica."

405
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,920
 Monica.

406
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,920
 Monica.

407
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,920
 Monica.

408
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,920
 Monica.

409
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,920
 Monica.

410
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,920
 Monica.

411
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,920
 Monica.

412
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,920
 Monica.

413
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,920
 Monica.

414
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,920
 Monica.

415
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,920
 Monica.

416
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,920
 Monica.

417
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,920
 Monica.

418
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,920
 Monica.

419
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,920
 Monica.

420
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,920
 Monica.

421
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,920
 Monica.

422
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,920
 Monica.

423
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,920
 Monica.

424
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,920
 Monica.

425
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,920
 Monica.

426
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,920
 Monica.

427
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,920
 Monica.

428
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,920
 Monica.

429
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,920
 Monica.

430
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,920
 Monica.

431
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,920
 Monica.

432
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,920
 Monica.

433
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,920
 Monica.

434
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,920
 Monica.

435
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,920
 Monica.

436
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,920
 Monica.

437
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,920
 Monica.

438
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,920
 Monica.

439
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,920
