00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
 Does YouTube have a monkey torture problem?

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,320
 And today we take a look at one of the most requested topics on this show,

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,000
 golf rumors. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,560
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,520
 Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day. Okay, so anyways,

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:29,440
 let's go ahead and get started with the episode. So this first story came to me through an

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,320
 anonymous email one morning I woke up. Some of you guys have been sending me story ideas and

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,560
 I appreciate that. And I think you guys have kind of gotten the tone of the show. I like to cover

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,440
 conspiracies that nobody's heard about. Very unknown things, like things like 9/11 and stuff

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,640
 like that I don't really cover about. This was one I had never heard about. Super bizarre.

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:57,280
 And I did a bunch of research into it and I can't figure it out. So, and this is going to be rough

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,120
 guys. This is going to be rough because I'm going to have to get into some kind of gory details.

13
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,840
 So if your discretion is advised or listener discretion. So if you go to YouTube and you

14
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,120
 look at a video of monkeys, I like monkeys. I like monkeys. I love gorillas. They're just amazing.

15
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,600
 And if you go to videos like they have videos of people doing magic tricks with monkeys or

16
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,280
 a gorilla like scaring away baby gorillas and stuff like that, the comments are like,

17
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,920
 oh look at that gorilla. Ooh, look at that monkey. So surprised. That's so cute. There's a video of

18
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,600
 a girl booty shaking in front of I think an orangutan. That one's pretty funny too because

19
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:38,720
 the orangutan's like ready to go. Ready to get right through that glass. But if you go to a video

20
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,560
 of a monkey being injured or that has a dead monkey in it, the comments are going to be much,

21
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:51,760
 much different. The comments are going to be actually very, very brutal and cold-hearted.

22
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:59,760
 This is really looking into what can only be called the monkey torture community on YouTube.

23
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:05,280
 I don't think YouTube is aware of it. Obviously, I think they would shut this down.

24
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:14,960
 The videos themselves, I think people are posting videos of monkeys being hurt

25
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:21,360
 and not really thinking anything of it. I don't think the people posting the videos are part of

26
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:30,080
 this weird fetish, but they're definitely giving them something to talk about. Here's some of the

27
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:37,280
 comments that have been posted regarding these videos. "I want to hang the baby by its balls and

28
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,640
 slowly lower it into boiling water while I smash its ugly mother in the face with a baseball bat.

29
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,720
 She can watch me boil that little shitflinger alive." Then someone responds to that comment,

30
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,160
 "Why was perfectly good water?" I'm assuming that's waste. "Why waste perfectly good water when you

31
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,000
 can just cover it in gas and toss a match?" Here's some more comments here. "Man, some of these guys

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,720
 need to be put down. Get some more monkey bait and a real fast riding lawnmower."

33
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:12,720
 "I want to give the fleabag..." Cut. "I want to give the fleabag clutching his leg something to really

34
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:20,160
 cry about. Hot needles, poker up the ass, fun times for these worthless vermin." And I'll just

35
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,400
 share one more with you. "I would give almost anything to have those baby monkeys in that one

36
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,000
 room all to myself, little assholes cling into each other because it's instinct. I'll show them

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,880
 the horrors that make the German death camps look like nice clean and friendly euthanasia clinics."

38
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:47,760
 These comments are everywhere on these videos. I couldn't even give you an estimate. They just

39
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,440
 go on and on and on. Anytime there's a video, I shouldn't say anytime because I did find an

40
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,600
 exception, in these videos where monkeys are being injured or dead, people just talk about how much

41
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:04,560
 they want to bash in, stab these monkeys, burn them, you know, flay them, all sorts of horrible

42
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,680
 things. And the thing is, is other people chime in. Now, my first instinct was it was some sort of

43
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,920
 troll. But the thing with trolls is that you try to get a reaction out of people. The point of a

44
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:23,440
 troll isn't to just troll with your friends. The point of a troll is to go to a liberal website

45
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,720
 and talk trash about their policies, pretend you're somebody else, and you can do it with the right

46
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,600
 too. You can go there and you say provocative stuff to get a reaction out of them. If it's everyone

47
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,280
 believing the same thing, it's not really a troll then. But I was still going on the troll angle.

48
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:47,200
 And so I went to PETA's YouTube channel and looked at a video of babies. I didn't watch the videos

49
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,280
 because I don't want to watch videos of monkeys getting hurt. I'd always scroll down just the

50
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,440
 comments. But I went to PETA's, PETA had a video about monkey abuse and these comments weren't

51
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,600
 there, which means one of two things. PETA is removing the comments through moderation,

52
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,240
 which we have a lot of power to do on YouTube. We can actually make it so no comments get posted

53
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:15,600
 until we review them first. Or once they're up we can take them down. So I thought maybe they're

54
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:23,680
 moderating the comments. Or this YouTube monkey torture community is not posting on that site

55
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,120
 simply for visibility. Because if they post on PETA's website, on PETA's YouTube channel,

56
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:36,400
 PETA will report those people and have their accounts closed. As hate speech or hateful

57
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,600
 speech, animal abuse, so on and so forth. So they're only sticking to a certain subgroup of videos.

58
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,440
 Now the people who are posting these videos, they may be part of the fetish as well. I'm calling

59
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:53,600
 it a fetish because I don't really know what it is. It's very odd. I went and I started to research

60
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:00,160
 why is this a natural thing for people to hate monkeys. One article I was looking at said,

61
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,000
 "Part of the reason may be have to do with the uncanny valley." And that's the idea that

62
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,280
 humans are very comfortable around things that don't look like them at all. But as it becomes

63
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,400
 more human looking, we get a natural aversion to it. And we've come across that in animation and

64
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,240
 robotics. When we look at CGI animations, say like the Incredibles, where they clearly don't look

65
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,280
 human, we're totally comfortable. But when we watch Polar Express, or even better example,

66
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:34,480
 Mars Needs Moms, it's very discomforting to watch. I remember watching Mars Needs Moms and my brain

67
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:41,120
 kept thinking, is that astronaut played by an actor? Or is that animated? He looks so realistic.

68
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:47,280
 And people have a natural aversion to things that don't look human but are supposed to look human.

69
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,480
 The big complaint about Polar Express was the dead eyes. They look dead. And with the uncanny

70
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:58,480
 valley, the idea is, if we're looking at something that's supposed to look human and it looks identical

71
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:04,160
 to human, but our brain tells us it's not human, our brain is telling us that's a dead thing. Stay

72
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,080
 away from it because it breeds disease. They think it's a natural defense. And that's why robots

73
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:15,840
 are starting to look more not like humans. Sex robots are interesting, but I think too,

74
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,320
 they just kind of lay there. And I guess they have exaggerated features with their big boobs, but

75
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,640
 in general, people don't like things that look super close to human.

76
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,600
 Gives us the natural aversion. So that was one theory. But other people have said,

77
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:35,120
 "Now, people who hate monkeys, I've found some posts of theirs." They say, "No, it's not that.

78
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,320
 I just hate monkeys. I found this Reddit post. This is under confession."

79
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:45,520
 He said, "So many people think monkeys are cute or funny or whatever else, but I absolutely hate them.

80
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,000
 I think they're ugly, annoying, and downright infuriating. I have no idea why I feel so strongly

81
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,960
 about this. I just do. I've never had a bad experience with a monkey or anything of that sort,

82
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,240
 but I just cannot stand them. If someone posts a video or photo of a monkey doing something that

83
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,440
 the general population would find entertaining, it makes my blood boil. I'd actually go as far as

84
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,640
 saying if I were ever to come across one, I might get mad enough to hurt it. This could possibly

85
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,200
 make me a horrible person, but I swear it's only with monkeys. I'm a very relaxed, nonviolent person

86
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:21,200
 who can never use the word hate to describe anything, but monkeys and one specific individual

87
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:26,480
 for a good reason. Hate is a strong word, but it's the only thing I can use to describe my

88
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,360
 unnatural feelings towards all monkeys. I have no idea why I feel this way."

89
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,520
 And I found other posts like that as well. There was a post on thebodybuilding.com forum.

90
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,520
 Same thing. I seriously despise monkeys, specifically baby monkeys.

91
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,800
 And it's interesting. So it's like these people have a natural aversion to monkeys,

92
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,080
 which is fine. Some people hate dogs. Some people hate cats. Some people hate cockroaches, whatever.

93
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:58,880
 But then to take that hatred and find out YouTube videos of monkeys being injured or killed,

94
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,520
 it's, "Yeah, I wish I was there." That human should have strangled that monkey. That human

95
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:09,120
 should have punched that monkey in his monkey face. You know, I don't seek it out. I used to hate dogs.

96
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,680
 I saw a dog violently mull a man and I had to get involved and it was terrifying because the

97
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:20,080
 dog came after me and I had to beat it over the head with a stick. But I didn't seek out images,

98
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,880
 and I'm fine with dogs now. I love dogs now, but I don't seek out. I didn't seek out images of

99
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,880
 dogs being hurt and being like, "Yeah, I wish I could have broke all of its legs." I had a battery,

100
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,080
 a bad incident with a dog. I took care of it. I got over it. These people don't know why they

101
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:46,160
 feel this way and they rejoice in watching monkeys get hurt. I looked into this for days. I was

102
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:53,920
 sending this email about a week ago. There, I cannot find a logical reason why, one, people hate monkeys

103
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:00,800
 so much they want to see them hurt. And two, why they then post those comments on these YouTube videos.

104
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,520
 The person who sent it to me said they had been looking into it for a while. There's other YouTube

105
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:13,200
 videos about this problem, but it's never been brought to the public attention. And I don't think

106
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,280
 that this podcast is going to be the final match and the final match is going to ignite it and all

107
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:25,120
 the people, but there's something wrong here. There's absolutely something wrong here.

108
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,920
 You know, these people are rejoicing in the torture of these animals, and it's happening right under

109
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,960
 everyone's nose. I think it too, if we knew why these people felt this way, I think it'd be a

110
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:45,520
 little more understandable to us non-monkey haters, but to me it's so puzzling. If you hate monkeys,

111
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:51,360
 why are you watching videos on monkeys? If you love watching animal suffer, why are you posting

112
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:59,280
 about it? What's weird about this is how deep does this go? Like at what point do you stop

113
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:06,560
 watching YouTube videos of monkeys getting hurt and start buying or seeking out videos where people

114
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,040
 are purposely torturing monkeys? Because some of these videos are, you know, people in other

115
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,600
 countries chopping monkeys up because they're getting into their crops. Some of these videos are

116
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,520
 monkeys just getting hit by cars. Some of these monkeys are just dying naturally. But at what

117
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:26,080
 point does that not feed your desire anymore? If this goes deep, there could be web providers,

118
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,800
 websites where you can like personally order a monkey video. Like what do you want to happen

119
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,520
 to the monkey? I want all four legs broken and I want to see it drown. Okay, that'll be $200.

120
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:43,600
 And then they send you a video of that happening. It's so creepy. It's creepy. And to me, it's not

121
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,680
 because monkeys look like humans or anything like that. It's creepy that this has been going on,

122
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:53,680
 and I haven't known about it. I don't think most people know about it. So my concern is because

123
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,920
 we don't know why these people are feel this way, there's not really a way to combat it.

124
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,760
 You can go to YouTube, definitely, and report these videos and report these people. That's one

125
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:10,640
 way to stop it. But I feel like there's an even darker core issue there. That if this community,

126
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:16,000
 it's numerous, tons and tons of people believe in this or have these feelings,

127
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,920
 the fact that they probably are, there probably are services that provide videos for these people,

128
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,960
 personalize videos is terrifying. We always hear stuff about like red rooms and person like hostile,

129
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:33,040
 like purposeful human torture videos. That's a little bit harder to carry off than, you know,

130
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,640
 paying someone on Fiverr to kick a monkey down the street. I'm sure people would do that. So we're

131
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:44,080
 going to move on to our next story. It's a story a lot of people have talked about. It's on the

132
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:49,840
 conspiracy iceberg list. It's the one that I've personally talked to other people about online.

133
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,040
 This one is called "Golf Rumors". Now, golf rumors has always had a little caveat next to it. It says,

134
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:08,640
 "Golf rumors do not research or golf rumors beware" and parentheses. So the idea has always been

135
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:13,760
 that this conspiracy is so deep that simply looking into it will get you arrested.

136
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,680
 Now, I don't believe that, obviously. So I looked into it and we're going to take this step by step

137
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:29,040
 here because this is kind of a fascinating story of how this evolves. The first, the earliest thing

138
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:36,000
 I've seen of the term "Golf Rumors" was in early 2017. That was like the earliest mention that I

139
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,080
 could track down to it. I believe it was on Reddit. It was possibly 4chan, but that was the earliest

140
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:47,760
 mention of golf rumors that I had found. It was just those two words, "Golf Rumors", so people

141
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:54,720
 had questions about it. After that, they started to appear this post, referring someone had found

142
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:01,440
 informational golf rumors and this was the post. What do we know? Golf rumors run down. Okay, so at

143
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,200
 the PGA tournament in 2009, a political journalist apparently attended some after-party and discovered

144
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,760
 a cult shit happening in the basement. Not just your normal, larping, Satanist wannabes,

145
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,800
 but some truly sick shit. She posted a story about it, which was immediately taken down,

146
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,480
 presumably after the powers at B threatened her. There was more chatter than they were comfortable

147
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,600
 with in online golf forums, which are now deleted, and a few days after the Tiger Woods sex scandal

148
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:33,840
 was posted by National Acquirer. Tiger Woods ruined his image to bury the story. There was more info

149
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:39,680
 on it on some onion site, which is like the underground dark web. There was more info on

150
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,160
 it on some onion site, but I can't seem to find it. All surface web traces of it have been wiped

151
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,840
 outside of threads like this, goes deeper than most know. So that was the first thing that popped up.

152
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:58,320
 So let's dive into that. There's obviously some problems that you see right off the bat.

153
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,920
 So you have a political journalist that nobody knows the name of. The name is never sourced.

154
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,280
 There's never any death notice of a political journalist. There's never any

155
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,080
 tracking back to who this political journalist who would have been covering this PGA tournament.

156
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:20,160
 None of that is available. It involves Satan worshipers at the PGA tournament in a basement,

157
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,480
 which I'm being a little dismissive, but that's completely ridiculous.

158
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,760
 She posted the story. So obviously, Politico had no problem with her initially posting the story.

159
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,000
 It would have been on the website. Editor would have seen it. Editor in chief would have seen it.

160
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,960
 The web design guy would have seen it, or girl, not to be sexist.

161
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:45,520
 And nobody questions it. It goes up. It's all up long enough that it gets linked to online golf

162
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,840
 forums, which are conveniently disappeared, which are conveniently deleted. Everything about the

163
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:55,680
 story smacks of it's totally made up. There's no name of the journalist. There's no name of the

164
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,000
 location of the PGA 2009 tournament, which we could look up, but it's not in here. The original

165
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,600
 person didn't even put that information in. It involves the Satanic cult that's doing something

166
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,720
 so horrible that they're able to shut everything down, but this political journalist goes, "Oh,

167
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,400
 I'm not going to call the cops. I'm not going to do anything. I'm going to post this on my website."

168
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:19,920
 Everyone who works on that story on the website, okay, it gets deleted, that is totally false.

169
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,880
 That story is 100% false. There's nothing to back up any of it. That was the first thing

170
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:31,840
 it was floating around. And generally, there was this time period where copypasta, creepypasta,

171
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:36,400
 like stories about lost episodes of television shows was super popular. And it would always go

172
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:45,280
 like this. One day, there was a video of recess, the cartoon recess, but the video I saw, all the

173
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:50,480
 characters were ultra realistic people, and they got stabbed and ultra realistic blood spilled out.

174
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,440
 There was blood everywhere. It was dark and blood. And then that little nerd kid showed up as a

175
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,720
 demon and he's ultra realistic. And it got to the point where people were like, "Oh, great,

176
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,040
 ultra realistic blood. Yeah, yeah, they look like life like drones. Yeah, yeah, yeah." Like, it goes

177
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,520
 so overboard. They could have made the story more believable by saying a political reporter went

178
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,400
 into a basement and saw some sort of ritual. But no, this has to be like completely sick,

179
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,880
 disgusting, Satan worshippers. So it goes overboard. So of course, the average person's

180
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,760
 going to look at that and go, "That's completely made up." Then that was connected to there was a

181
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:30,080
 female golfer who committed suicide named Erica Blazburg. That took place way later. But of course,

182
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,160
 because I'm researching this story as if it's true, I had to go research Erica Blazburg. Now,

183
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,840
 Erica Blazburg was a player for the ladies golf LPGA. She was a phenom when she was early, when she

184
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,480
 started off. She was rocking the amateur leagues. She dropped out of college to play golf in the

185
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:51,200
 amateur leagues. She went to become a professional. She wasn't playing ranking. She was like 128th on

186
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,080
 the money list. Like, she wasn't ranking where she thought she should be. She moved to Las Vegas.

187
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,840
 She thought she'd have a lot of friends. She thought it would be a good golf community. It wasn't.

188
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:06,000
 She didn't have any friends. She met up with a, I think he was a psychiatrist or psychologist,

189
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,360
 one of the two, the one who can prescribe drugs. She meets up with them. She may or may not have

190
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:17,760
 an affair with him. He was there the last night she was alive. They found her with a bag over her

191
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,640
 head, taking a bunch of medicine. Nevada State law does not reveal how much medicine is in you at

192
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,360
 the time of death. You think a bag over your head, that's suspicious. It's a suicide. Don't

193
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:33,200
 use this guy. I mean, again, I've said several times about don't commit suicide and how sad that

194
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,360
 is. But anyway, she had a bag over her head. It's a technique called rebreathing because you put

195
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,600
 a bag over your head and you just keep breathing normally until you run out of oxygen. The drugs,

196
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,680
 the combination of the rebreathing and the drugs will kill you. A lot of people don't know this.

197
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:50,800
 Elliot Rogers took a bunch of drugs and then shot himself with two guns. It doubles your chance of

198
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:55,440
 not being able to be revived. Even if they can cure the head wound, they can't pump a stomach at the

199
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,360
 same time. Or if they pump a stomach, he's still bleeding out. So people will use two techniques.

200
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:05,200
 And again, that's not a tip. I'm not trying to help you to commit more suicide. Don't do it. It's

201
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,840
 100% not worth it. I've been in some dark times in my life too, guys. It's not worth it. Things

202
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,720
 always get better. Okay, so Erica Blazberg, though, unfortunately killed herself. Her psychiatrist,

203
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:21,120
 that guy, took her suicide note and took the drugs out of her house. The cops ended up finding out

204
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,920
 that he had removed that stuff. He said he removed it. So her parents didn't feel bad. It was really

205
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:32,800
 suspicious. He ended up getting found guilty of obstructing an investigation. He served the year

206
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,920
 probation. And people go, that's golf rumors. He's part of the Illuminati Connection. She was part of

207
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:42,080
 this thing called the Maro Institute that studies psychic energy and all that stuff. Here's the

208
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:48,240
 thing. Again, if this is some high level conspiracy, these are people who are able to say Tiger Woods,

209
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,680
 reveal your darkest secrets. So no one will know about this. Why do we know about Erica

210
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,720
 Blazberg and the psychiatrist? She could have just had the inquest and said, as she committed

211
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,640
 suicide, there would be no suspicions whatsoever. The judge would have never arrested him or

212
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,200
 anything like that. So yes, that psychiatrist was acting suspiciously. He probably was having an

213
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,240
 affair with her. He was married. She wasn't. She had had affairs with two other men in that area.

214
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,600
 I don't think that's connected to golf rumors. I don't think that's connected to the Maro Institute.

215
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,400
 I don't think that's connected to any sort of conspiracy. It was just a sad woman taking her

216
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:27,120
 own life. So we've disputed the initial creepypasta because it's not detailed enough. And in the

217
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:34,960
 small amount of detail they do give, it is, oh, and then it's super creepy. Watch out. Don't

218
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,600
 investigate this because super creepy Satanists will kill you and ultra realistic blood will

219
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:46,080
 shoot out of you. It's not verifiable and it's completely comic bookish. Erica Blazberg has

220
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,400
 nothing to do with that. The only connection she has to any of that is that she was a golfer.

221
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:56,320
 Then another rumor popped up and this one was saying, oh yes, yes, the Satan worshiping story

222
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,800
 was made up. It was to cover for this one. So of course, now I'm reading this one. The golf

223
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:08,160
 rumor has to do with a psychic named Robert Golf and the glass camera project. The glass camera,

224
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:14,080
 according to this post, the glass camera project was the clandestine effort by the CIA and the FBI

225
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,840
 in the 90s to create truly non detectable surveillance tools, particularly a camera and a

226
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,960
 microphone system. And I'm like, okay, maybe this is something. And then I get to the next sentence.

227
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,480
 Now, according to classical theories of physics, this should be impossible.

228
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,280
 So right now you're already telling me in your second sentence, what I'm about to tell you

229
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:40,320
 is impossible by any measure of science. But I'm okay, whatever. So basically, they're saying that

230
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:47,680
 this camera allows you need something. This camera is basically made of glass, which is impossible

231
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:53,920
 and absorbs light, but it's able to reflect light and so on and so forth. So you get a psychic who

232
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:58,640
 remote views a subject. It goes on to say it is believed that the sheer psychic energy to

233
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,800
 accomplish this goal puts a minstrel in on the viewer's body, which always results in death.

234
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,840
 Apparently, one of the first people who used it was Robert golf. It says a somewhat prominent

235
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,400
 psychic from the 1980s that disappeared overnight and is practically unheard of today. So again,

236
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,280
 now they've given me a name. So I start looking for Robert golf. There is no psychic called Robert

237
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,920
 golf. He conveniently disappeared. But here's the thing, there's no books about a psychic called

238
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:26,480
 Robert golf. There's nothing that you can go to a used bookstore and find a book about a prominent

239
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,400
 psychic and the name Robert golf in there. He doesn't exist. So they made up that name so they

240
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,720
 could tie it into golf rumors. They would have been better off saying he was a gardener or he was

241
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,360
 a psychic at a shop in Long Beach. When you say he's a prominent psychic in the 1980s, I grew up

242
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,240
 in the 1980s. I've never heard of that guy. There's no books or any identification that this person

243
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,440
 exists because you can find books online that are scanned in. So what you're telling me is they

244
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,320
 either removed the whole book or they simply removed the one reference to Robert golf. But

245
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,840
 if he was a somewhat prominent psychic, not a nobody, there would be more because these

246
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:07,280
 books, this was the new age boom. There'd be multiple documents on this guy. This story goes

247
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:14,400
 out the window right after really this camera can't exist due to physics. I give it a little more.

248
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:20,560
 This camera is a psychic device that allows you to make photographs of remote areas. Okay. And if

249
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:25,680
 you use it, you die. And then the Robert golf thing. So again, you just this totally gets thrown

250
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:32,640
 out. It's throwing too much sci fi x files, buzz words at us. And they use the person who was

251
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,640
 somewhat prominent who doesn't exist and there's no proof of it. It's easy to have a conspiracy

252
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,640
 theory where you go, yeah, but good luck researching this because you're not going to find anything

253
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,520
 because the government's so powerful, it deleted everything. Yet I can find this post. They have

254
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:51,760
 the ability to delete a person. They have a ability to scrub people from published books.

255
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,920
 But this post is online. So debunked. You got to do better than that. Same thing. This is just more

256
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:03,200
 creepy pasta. If you're going to invent a conspiracy theory, make it halfway believable.

257
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:10,400
 The question I have about the term golf rumors is that just like ageless travel, which we track

258
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,200
 down on this show. And just like the ocean at night, which we track down on this show,

259
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:21,360
 both of those phrases were considered to be just a toss off some word salad things people put together.

260
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,080
 So as I was looking into golf rumors and I kept saying, that's not true. That's not true. That's

261
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,320
 not true. That's not connected to anything. I put the research aside, but I kept thinking. I go,

262
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,240
 maybe there's something to the phrase golf rumors. I started to think, you know, most,

263
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,760
 like they say 80% of all business deals are handled along golf courses. Maybe it has to do with that.

264
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:47,040
 See, that's more realistic than super secret Satan worshippers being discovered because

265
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:51,520
 a political reporter was looking for the bathroom. Started looking into that. I figured that's

266
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,960
 pretty common. That's pretty common knowledge. There's the idea that drug deals are done on

267
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,440
 golf courses, high level drug deals, because they're so vast and empty. Yeah, you know, maybe.

268
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,160
 And then I thought golf rumors is a meme that was totally made up or it's something else.

269
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:13,280
 Possibly a meme, possibly a joke. I totally dismiss the do not research thing. I think

270
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:19,200
 someone just threw that in there. But I thought, what if golf is an acronym? GOLF.

271
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:29,680
 And it is global oscillations at low frequency. Global oscillations at low frequency or golf

272
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:36,880
 is an instrument on a satellite that we've built. Its purpose is to steady the sun. Its purpose is

273
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:44,160
 to steady the gravity oscillations within the sun. It's been up since the late 90s. What it just

274
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:50,000
 discovered in 2017, around the time the golf rumors started, was that the core of the sun

275
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,560
 spins four times faster than the surface of the sun. We can tell what the earth is made of

276
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:02,720
 through earthquakes, but we never had a device to tell what the sun, how the sun worked. We have

277
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:08,480
 this golf instrument that can measure the gravity oscillations coming out of the sun. And we just

278
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:14,720
 learned about two years ago that the core of the sun moves four times faster than the surface.

279
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,960
 It's a huge breakthrough. Now we know something about the sun that we haven't known since the

280
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:25,120
 birth of science, since we thought it was a big magical ball. So we have this information now,

281
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,680
 how the sun works. We have a more detailed idea of what's inside the sun. But let's say what if,

282
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,400
 what if, there's a scientist working on that project and they're looking through the readings,

283
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:40,000
 drinking their coffee, going about their day. They come across some unusual readings,

284
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:47,840
 something they didn't expect, something that they don't understand, that is being picked up by

285
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:55,600
 golf, something that defies what we previously knew. They tell their coworker, their coworkers

286
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:01,760
 alarmed, they tell another coworker, they tell a boss, they tell other people in the institute,

287
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,280
 other people in the science community that would understand what these statistics meant.

288
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:13,600
 And as it spread out and as people became more and more concerned about what golf actually picked

289
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:21,600
 up, the rumor would spread. Is it possible that that machine measured something that was completely

290
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:29,680
 unknown to man? Is the fact that the core spinning so fast make a difference in how we thought the

291
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:37,360
 sun worked and the time limit we gave on the sun, burning energy? Is it possible that the device

292
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:44,720
 picked up something else? Some other sort of gravity anomaly nearby? Something that shouldn't be there?

293
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,960
 Something we can't detect in any other way? But the golf device is reading that.

294
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:58,640
 Is it possible that this device in space is sending back information

295
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:06,960
 that puts the planet in peril or simply has to make us rethink everything we know?

296
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,840
 Who knows? You can never believe rumors.
