1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
 a bus that wanders the streets of Philadelphia, but only picks up those who really need its help.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,160
 And then we take a look at one of the first cases of cattle mutilation in American history.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:21,040
 Did a rancher named Alexander Hamilton actually see an airship abduct a cow right in front of him,

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:26,000
 only to dispose of the carcass the next day, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:37,520
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter,

6
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,280
 I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too. I'm still on vacation,

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,120
 I'm still using my travel mic here. Seems to be doing pretty good, but yeah, I pretty much just

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,840
 slept today. I've been thinking, oh dude, when I'm on vacation I'm gonna do so much research,

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,960
 I'm gonna get so much stuff done. I've really just been sleeping and playing Mad Max, the video

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,480
 game Mad Max, which is pretty cool. I like beat 'em up games. There's not many of them out there,

11
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,720
 but I'll wake up, I'll play Mad Max for a couple hours and I'll be like, okay, now I'm tired,

12
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,000
 I'm gonna go back to sleep. And when I wake up, I'll do the show, I'll do so much reading for the

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,360
 show. Then I usually wake up, eat lunch, and take another nap. I don't like being this unproductive,

14
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,120
 I like being a productive person. But tomorrow, tomorrow I'll get so much research done for the

15
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:29,440
 show dude, so much. But that being said, I do got two great stories for you today. The first story

16
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,760
 is a really interesting one, and I'm gonna take you along the path that I took when I found it.

17
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,840
 So let's go ahead and hop on board the Carpentercopter because we're going to Philadelphia,

18
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,280
 Pennsylvania. It's always sunny in Philadelphia, is the new season coming out? I usually had new

19
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,720
 episodes ready to watch with my brothers before I came out here. I guess they're taking like a

20
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:56,160
 year and a half off now. Anyways, let's hop on board the Carpentercopter flying over to Philadelphia.

21
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,240
 And we have to land, we can't enjoy this story from the air, we have to kind of get down. So we

22
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,240
 land, we're walking on the streets of Philadelphia. Now, hopefully you're depressed, or I'm depressed.

23
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,760
 One of us needs to be depressed, which is a sad state of affairs. But we're sitting there,

24
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,720
 it's late at night, we're in downtown Philadelphia. We're both just like, hmm, little storm clouds

25
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:27,280
 over our heads. Depressed, sad, neither of us know what is coming next in our life. And that's when

26
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,600
 we look down the street and we see a bus. It looks like every other bus out in Philadelphia,

27
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,480
 but instead of on the sign, on the electric sign that shows where the bus is headed,

28
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,560
 it just says SEPTA, which is the name of the bus organization down there. It's like Southeast

29
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,720
 Philadelphia Transit Authority or something like that. I don't know, I just pulled that out of my

30
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,400
 head. So I'll be shocked. It's probably fairly close, but anyways, so SEPTA is like the bus

31
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:01,040
 organization down there. Now, we kind of look at each other and go, hmm, now we're new to Philadelphia,

32
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,800
 but we think it's weird that the bus doesn't list where it's going. We have that much knowledge.

33
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,560
 And then we wait for the bus to come to us and it just sits at the corner there idly,

34
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:19,280
 cold, filly winds wrap around us. And then we have to stand up and we start walking towards the bus.

35
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:26,320
 The bus just sits there. But we feel if we don't get to the bus in time, we're going to miss our

36
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:33,760
 chains. So we begin running through this empty street in Philadelphia. And finally we reach the

37
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:42,080
 bus. The door slide open. We step on board and we see the bus driver. He's just sitting there,

38
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,720
 cat pulled down over his eyes, kind of staring ahead. We assume we can't see his eyes. He's

39
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,800
 looking ahead, cat pulled down over his eyes. And he kind of motions to us to pay. But if you can't

40
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:59,760
 pay, you get the feeling it'll be okay. This bus ride is still for you. And then we just take a seat,

41
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,280
 sit down on the bus, we look around. There's a lot of people on the bus. All of them look depressed,

42
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:13,280
 all of them look lost. And the bus just, I don't know what sound effect that was. It's lost in

43
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:20,000
 the bubble gum factory apparently. The bus begins to drive off into the depths of the city of Philadelphia.

44
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,800
 I think we need to take it to the maintenance shop. So here's, this is where this story comes

45
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,120
 from. This is an urban legend in Philadelphia right now. And pretty much what I said, you'll see a

46
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,880
 bus when you're down on your luck, when you think that you can't go any further, you can always go

47
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,520
 downtown. It's half the song when you're done. No, that's when you're feeling alone and there's

48
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:48,880
 nowhere to go. You can always go downtown. That's that song, right? It's not if you're horribly

49
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:55,760
 depressed and you don't know what's next. You can always, I think that should be a remix. I think

50
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,080
 it should just be about a guy at the end of his rope trying to figure out, oh my god,

51
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,880
 my wife left me, my dog's dead. Let's go downtown. Okay, so anyways, anyways,

52
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,680
 now the song's stuck in my head and hopefully it's stuck in yours too. That'll make you more depressed.

53
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,800
 Anyways, so the story is this bus in Philadelphia, when you're down on your luck,

54
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,320
 you'll see it, it will never come to you. You see it, but you have to run to get on it. And when

55
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:28,240
 you get on it, pretty much what I said, and it's full of people, and the story is this, the bus

56
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,880
 will drive you around the city for an indeterminate amount of time, but and it, you can't get off

57
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,080
 when you want to. It will drop you off when and where you're supposed to get off. And where you

58
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,280
 get off is where you can start getting your life back together again. They say when you get off

59
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,520
 the bus, you have a vague recollection of seeing other people on the bus and you go, that was weird,

60
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,560
 I was on the bus and there was like a politician on there. There's a couple hobos. And even though

61
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,640
 you may recognize them on the bus, when you get off the bus, you just have vague recollections. You

62
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:06,000
 could never name anyone you actually saw on the bus. The legend goes that some people never get off

63
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,520
 the bus, that they just stay on the bus for the rest of time. And there's even stories that if you

64
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:19,920
 stay on the bus long enough, you'll be dropped back off where you got on, but back in time before

65
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:27,360
 your troubles even began. Some say that there's a bus like this in every major city in the world,

66
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,440
 but people don't notice it because it's not the bus they're looking for. And these buses just glide

67
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:40,160
 through the streets trying to help people find the answer that they're looking for, find a new

68
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:47,520
 beginning, find some peace. Now it's interesting, so I've read about that. I was looking up on

69
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,080
 Urban Legends, different Urban Legends around America. I came across that and I was like,

70
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,480
 this is gold. This is such a great story. And I do what I normally do. I start clicking on the links

71
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:04,560
 and start investigating all this stuff. And what I found out was, this is so interesting, there's a

72
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,080
 ton of websites that list this as an Urban Legend in the city of Philadelphia. But what it actually

73
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,080
 is, it's a short story. It's a short story on this guy's blog. It's about one page long.

74
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,000
 Pretty much entails everything that I told you. And that's it. What? And you're like, well Jason,

75
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,240
 thanks for Jason's fiction corner. But this is what's interesting about this. Think about it.

76
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,880
 When I told you that story, I'll bet you anything you have the same feeling here in it that I did

77
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,800
 reading it. It is so, I don't want to say like realistic, I mean, assuming that in the world of

78
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:48,000
 paranormal, this is something that one rings true to sounds incredibly comforting. It's a very cozy

79
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,360
 Urban Legend. And I remember reading it and thinking that's a beautiful Urban Legend. Like,

80
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,720
 that's a beautiful kind of creepy story. But like, no one gets trapped. It's something that's

81
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,240
 totally beneficial. And because we get lost in the hustle and bustle of the city, whether it's a

82
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,600
 major metropolis or just a small burgh, you get used to all the sights and sounds and everything

83
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,320
 in your particular area and the idea of something kind of roaming the streets and you never noticing

84
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:20,800
 it. But if you needed it, it would be there. It's a very comforting thought. And the guy who wrote

85
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,800
 this wrote it as a short story, the wandering busts of Philadelphia. But I think the reason why so

86
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:34,080
 many people have latched onto it as being some sort of true story is because it's oddly compelling and

87
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:41,520
 oddly believable. We want to believe it at least. I did. I definitely think that this has transcended

88
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:47,280
 the short story. It'll always be remembered now as the Urban Legend, which, you know, kudos to the

89
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,600
 author. I didn't write his name down, but kudos to the author for writing that because that it will

90
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,120
 now become part of Philadelphia legend. Kids will tell that, maybe not kids, because it only really

91
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,160
 appeals to young people, but people in their 20s and older, they can they can appreciate that type

92
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:09,440
 of thing. An ability to either go back in time before your troubles began or if not that dramatic,

93
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:16,960
 just be when life feels like you don't know where to go downtown. When life feels like you're in a

94
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:23,600
 dead end and you don't know what's coming up next and you feel powerless, there's a universal power

95
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,480
 out there to help guide you to where you're supposed to go, where fate wants you to. Very,

96
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,760
 very compelling story. And again, touches on that thing where I love it when we can find an Urban

97
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,040
 Legend and find out where it started. This story will be re- this, I don't see this Urban Legend

98
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:45,680
 going away anytime soon. I only see it growing, actually. And I would imagine in the next couple

99
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,840
 years, the author being like, "Well, you know, there's a hint of truth. Like, I could see that

100
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:57,520
 happening because it does sound real and it sounds comforting and it sounds like a paranormal event

101
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,080
 you would actually want to have happen in your neighborhood." As opposed to most of them, which

102
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,320
 are just ghosts kicking in your windows and stuff like that. I guess most ghosts don't kick in your

103
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,480
 windows. Maybe you lived in a bad neighborhood. Actually, that's a good question. What about

104
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,200
 like people who are like drug dealers who are shot in the street? Do their ghosts continue to sell

105
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,600
 drugs and like break into cars and stuff like that? What if a good maybe 3% of all random vandalism

106
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,960
 in cities is attributed to ghosts tagging buildings and stuff? I wonder if you spray painted a ghost

107
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,560
 if you'd be able to see them. I wonder, basically, they work on Little Rascals physics. We throw

108
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,680
 blanket over them and you see a ghost. Anyways, I'm not going to do a whole segment on this,

109
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,800
 but I was reading the news recently. I guess some idiots out on the east coast have figured out that

110
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,720
 I don't know if you smoke it or inhale it or turn it into some sort of powder, but people have been

111
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:59,040
 ingesting wasp spray to get high. I've read a couple articles about it and they have the same

112
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:08,480
 quote from some government official saying, "You can do wasp spray once or twice. You'll be fine,

113
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,440
 but when you do it the third time you'll have an allergic reaction and you might die." I read

114
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,200
 about it a couple days ago and they were like, "Yeah, dude, it's a crazy new thing. Kids are

115
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,920
 smoking or doing wasp spray." I can't even say that word right. Wasps. I can't say,

116
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:31,440
 is there a singular, right? Wasp. Wasp. Okay, wasp spray. Kids are doing wasp spray.

117
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,880
 Everyone's looking at this official China given press conference. He totally pauses and he's like,

118
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,760
 "Can I say it singular? Is there a wasp?" Everyone reporters just standing there with the cameras.

119
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,280
 And finally, he gets on with it. "You can do it once or twice, but the third time it'll kill you."

120
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,680
 And the first time I saw it was people were doing it and then just today I was reading on Judges

121
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:56,720
 Report that three people have died from using wasp spray as a meth alternative. Apparently,

122
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,720
 it like amps you up and causes your hands and feet to swell and I'm like,

123
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,800
 knowing a lot of meth addicts. I don't remember having gigantic hands and feet.

124
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,880
 Okay, so that's, I'm not going to do a full story on that. And part of me thinks it might not be

125
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,920
 true. Part of me thinks it could be some sort of moral panic that no one's actually doing this.

126
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,840
 The news articles could be wrong, which has happened in the past. I want to believe that people

127
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:29,200
 aren't so stupid that they're like, "Man, I don't have any meth, but I have all of this wasp spray."

128
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,000
 Like I want to believe people aren't that dumb, but I don't know, I could be wrong.

129
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,120
 But let's go ahead and move on to our next story. We're going to hop on back on board the carpenter

130
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,040
 copter. Come on, get on board. Pulling you off the bus, you're like, "No, I have to go back in

131
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,440
 time. I have to go back in time for everything." Went wrong and I'm like, "Get on the carpenter

132
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,000
 copter. Get on the copter dude. Just can pull you on." You're like, "No, my future.

133
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,440
 They're on the carpenter copter." We take off and we're going back in time.

134
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:06,400
 We're flying around now. We're in 1897. We're flying over Kansas.

135
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:13,920
 Anyways, we still got the song "Downtown Stuck in Our Head" as we're landing.

136
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:21,360
 And we're going to go to a meeting with a man named Alexander Hamilton. No, not that Alexander

137
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,120
 Hamilton, not the rapping forefather, but this Alexander Hamilton was a rancher. Kind of a step

138
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,200
 down. I wonder if he had any cool dance moves. But we do know that he is a member of this club,

139
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:39,520
 this speaker's club, and he's a rancher and he has a very famous name. Now, he's at this speaker's

140
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:45,600
 club and we're here listening to him tell this story. Now, he's already told this story all over

141
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,960
 town. He actually had this story written up as an affidavit with some of his closest friends.

142
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,280
 One of them was like a member of law enforcement. One of them was an attorney. One of them was a

143
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,280
 judge. It was signed by nine people, close friends of his. It was registered with the postmaster in

144
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,800
 town. Alexander Hamilton swore up and down this story happened and we're sitting in this meeting

145
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:11,840
 as he's retelling the story to us. And Alexander takes a sip of brandy. Alexander, did they have

146
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:16,720
 Jack Daniels back then? Alexander takes a sip of whiskey. That's better. Sets it down and goes,

147
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,400
 "Well, you know, gentlemen, you've all heard the story, but I'm going to tell it again for our new

148
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:28,080
 friends who just came through a time portal." I don't know why he sounds like Barack Obama,

149
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:36,000
 but anyways, Alexander goes, "But here's the story. Here's the story." So me and my friends were out

150
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,560
 wrestling up some cattle. Wait, no, we're ranchers. We already have cattle who don't wrestle them up.

151
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:46,800
 But it was a dark night. It was 10 30 p.m. I remember that specifically. And quote, this is one

152
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,160
 of my favorite quotes from this whole thing, quote, "I arose thinking that perhaps my bulldog was

153
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:59,040
 performing some of his pranks, but upon going to the door saw to my utter astonishment an airship

154
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:06,880
 slowly descending upon my cowlot about 40 rods from my house." Now there's two important things in

155
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:13,120
 there. One, what he's saying is, he heard a bunch of noise in the backyard or his friend yard or

156
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,880
 whatever. Went outside and he saw what he described as an airship. And he goes on to describe it as a

157
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,320
 cigar shaped vehicle, which is one of the classic shapes of UFOs. We have the flying saucer,

158
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:30,560
 we have the triangle, we have cigar shaped ships. This one was 300 feet long. Now he uses the term

159
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:37,280
 airship, which makes you think like a dirgeable. That was the term back then for UFOs or would be a

160
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:43,440
 term for UFOs, an airship. So he walks outside to his utter astonishment. He sees a 300 foot long

161
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,240
 cigar shaped vehicle floating over his ranch and he describes as having a dark reddish color.

162
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,960
 That's the first important thing to take from that quote. But I also like the fact that he heard a

163
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:01,200
 bunch of noise outside as cattle were running around. And he said, he thought that perhaps my

164
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:07,520
 bulldog was performing some of his pranks. Who does he have an animated bulldog? Does he have that

165
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,000
 little bulldog from those Hanna-Barbera cartoons that's like lighting firecrackers and throwing

166
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,080
 you on and blowing up cows and stuff like that? He's like replacing their water with oil. I guess

167
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:23,040
 those aren't pranks. Those are more like murderous acts. I think those are more like animal cruelty.

168
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,280
 But the idea that he goes, man, my cows are freaking out. May oh, it's just a bulldog

169
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:32,400
 performing some of his pranks. That might be a translation error, even though both are written

170
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,680
 in English. Maybe pranks meant something different back then. Although I like the idea of a bulldog

171
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,880
 in this story stalking around Alexander, who's basically he looks like a 2D drawing going.

172
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:50,240
 But more importantly for this story, he goes on and he goes, now I looked up into the sky.

173
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:58,800
 Night was all over the place. It was black. And I saw this airship. But oddly enough,

174
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,000
 my voice has changed. But in one of the meetings, like that is weird, his voice did change. It's

175
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,960
 almost like you forgot what voice he was doing before. Alexander is like, ignore that. I'm looking

176
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:16,240
 over this airship and I see a carriage underneath it, underneath the cigar. And it had quote,

177
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:23,760
 "Six of the strangest beans I ever saw. They were jabbering together, but we could not understand

178
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:31,040
 a word they said." We're all like, okay, okay, Colonel Sanders. That's interesting. It's weird.

179
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,160
 The aliens might have changed your voice. Now he says they were jabbering together and they

180
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,240
 couldn't understand a word they said. They're also like up in the air. I don't know how many,

181
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,000
 people on a hot air balloon, I don't ever look up and go, oh, that's so sweet.

182
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,360
 He proposed to her. You can't really hear people. Plus it's windy up there. It's not windy down

183
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,560
 where you're at, but the words, when you talk, all your words get stuck on the wind and they go

184
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:58,240
 forward. People can't hear. That might be the worst example of physics. But think about it,

185
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:04,160
 if someone's standing in a blimp, in a windy, windy blimp and you're speaking, technically,

186
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:10,160
 aren't your sound waves being washed away with the wind? The sound waves don't come out like a

187
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:16,000
 bubble. They come out right in front of you and then you're talking into the wind. Maybe the wind

188
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,320
 doesn't have anything to do with it. Maybe the fact that you're just 100 feet up can make it a little

189
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,360
 hard for people on the ground to hear. Anyways, so he sees this thing that may or may not have been

190
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,840
 a blimp, but it was definitely an airship and it definitely had six of the strangest beings I ever

191
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:40,160
 did see. And then a rope falls out of the airship and wraps around the neck of a two-year-old cow.

192
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:46,080
 So the cow's like freaking out. Everyone, Alexander Hamilton standing there, he's shocked,

193
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:52,480
 shocked that someone could last so that good out of an airship. And then the rope starts getting

194
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,920
 pulled up and the cow's flipping out. The bulldog's all of a sudden going, "Oh, this prank got a little

195
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,320
 too real." He runs off. Cow gets lifted up into the ship and Alexander Hamilton's like, "What?"

196
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:09,360
 and shaking his fist at the airship as it flies away. Now, the next day, that's an odd enough

197
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,840
 story. It would basically be one of the first reported cases of a cattle abduction. But the next

198
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:21,280
 day, a farmer over, like a rancher, a couple ranches over, gets a hold of Alexander, sends over

199
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,640
 his cartoon vulture to go and tell Alexander, Alexander and his cartoon dog go over to his buddy's

200
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:33,840
 house and they see the cow's hide, legs and head just laying in the field. And the rancher knew

201
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:40,320
 it was Alexander's because of the brand on the hide. Now, Alexander Hamilton swore up and down the

202
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,040
 story was true. People were kind of like, "Well, maybe, but I don't know." He ends up getting,

203
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:51,120
 making a notarized statement that's signed by all of his buddies saying, "This happened. Like,

204
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,880
 you guys trust me? This happened. I saw this. Judge signs it. Law enforcement guy signs it.

205
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,320
 Attorney signs it. Registered with a postmaster. Put into his official record." And everyone's like,

206
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:09,440
 "He saw the very first cattle mutilation in recorded American history. Cow, he's

207
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:16,080
 visually seen a cow get abducted onto an unidentified flying craft and then dropped off the next day

208
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:22,560
 with all of its guts taken out." Now, I talked recently on an episode about this documentary film

209
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:28,720
 crew that, it was a really good episode. It was a really good story too. The truth was almost out

210
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,960
 there, I think is the name of the episode on Dead Rabbit Radio. There's a documentary crew that got

211
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,920
 invited by the US military to make a documentary on a UFO landing. And then the last minute,

212
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,600
 the government said, "No, no, no, we don't want you to do that." And then the documentary did

213
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,760
 come out, but it lacked some of the information that the government promised them. In that

214
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,040
 documentary, it's hosted by Rod Serling. He said, "There's a story about a man named Alexander

215
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,840
 Hamilton who witnessed one of the first cattle mutilation things." I thought, "Oh, that's,

216
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,120
 I got a bunch of stuff from them." And I'm like, "That's awesome." So, and that documentary was

217
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:06,960
 released in the late 70s? And I researched it and I found the story. And what's interesting again

218
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,080
 is they mentioned this on the documentary. I looked it up. I found out about the story. And

219
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:16,720
 when you look into it though, this is a very controversial UFO encounter. Very, very controversial

220
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:22,720
 UFO encounter. Because what happened was it was all in part, people were like, a lot of people

221
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,760
 thought it was actually Alexander Hamilton, the wrapping forefather, but it turns out that it

222
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:33,040
 was just this guy in this rancher. But people still go, "This is one of the very first cases of cattle

223
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:38,640
 mutilation recorded." And we have this signed affidavit from 1897 before the whole UFO flap.

224
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,760
 We have someone talking about this. Fate Magazine, which covers paranormal stuff. It's basically,

225
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,360
 it's a monthly magazine. I don't know if they're still monthly, but anyways, it's a magazine that

226
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,840
 covers like psychic powers and aliens and ghosts and Loch Ness monsters and all sorts of stuff.

227
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,360
 Basically, it's like a print version of Coast to Coast AM or something like that.

228
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:02,160
 They are not known as skeptical by any means. They talk about all sorts of weird stuff that I think

229
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:11,600
 is ridiculous. They ran an article about this encounter and they said, "It's fake. The story is

230
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:18,880
 not true." And they say, and people got really, really upset. And they go, "Listen, the story itself

231
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,400
 was told by a man named Alexander Hamilton." And even they were saying it, there may be a hint of

232
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,560
 truth to it, but here's the problem. Here's the problem with this story. Remember how we landed

233
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:33,920
 in that meeting the first time Alexander Hamilton was telling us this story? Alexander Hamilton

234
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:39,040
 belonged to a group that had speaking engagement. They'd all get together and they'd talk to each

235
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:45,840
 other just like the Friars Club. But this was called, this group was called the Liars Club,

236
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:52,720
 where they would come up with the most ridiculous stories and try to convince other people or

237
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,560
 tell them to each other and think about, like, what's the most ridiculous story you can come up

238
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:04,240
 with? And this was one, and so here's the problem is that it is most likely, it is most likely,

239
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,680
 that he made this story up for the Liars Club and everyone who signed the affidavit were also

240
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,840
 members of the Liars Club. It wasn't like they were walking around town with Liars Club jackets.

241
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,720
 Nobody knew that these guys were totally into this thing, but he was a member of a group called

242
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,640
 the Liars Club. Fate Magazine also said in 1943 there was an article in a Kansas newspaper called

243
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:31,120
 The Buffalo Enterprise, which said that this woman said her mother knew Alexander Hamilton back in

244
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,480
 the day. You know, they were a little freaky. He's wearing this leather jacket with a cow head on it

245
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,320
 all of a sudden. He was a man about town wearing this cow skin. She's like, hmm, I'm picking up what

246
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,360
 you're putting down. And he's like, you're abducting cows? She's like, no, that's weird. He tells her

247
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,280
 the story. And she's like, now that quip makes sense. But no, maybe me and you could have a little

248
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:57,520
 abduction story. I don't know where I'm going with this. Anyways, the point is this woman's elderly

249
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:04,400
 mother knew Alexander Hamilton back in the day and he admitted to her that it was a hoax. And this

250
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,840
 girl, this woman says, oh yeah, my mom used to bang Alexander Hamilton back in the day, super freaky

251
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,680
 stuff. He's really into leather. And the reporters like this is gross. But he admitted that it was

252
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:20,080
 a hoax. Now that was an article that was published in 1943. He didn't really gain any traction.

253
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,880
 Fate magazine dug that article up, also found out this guy was a member of the Liars Club.

254
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,080
 And they said this story was most likely 100% made up. It was made up as part of the Liars Club

255
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,360
 tradition, which I believe. And so here's this. This is what I think is most interesting about

256
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:41,120
 this story is that if we accept that this story is made up and we'll get into whether and we'll

257
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,600
 get into another side of it in a second. But if you can imagine this story is made up, which it most

258
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:53,600
 likely is, it almost perfectly matches up to what we know of modern catamethylations. And so here's

259
00:24:53,600 --> 00:25:01,440
 the thing. We've seen this before. Somebody tells a lie. You can you see this a lot with mass panics.

260
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,240
 Someone could be like someone could start having some sort of mental breakdown and it'd be like my

261
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,160
 skin's itching. I can't saw my skin itching. I can't oh my skin's itching everywhere. Is there

262
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,680
 something in the air? I don't know what it is. I was fine at home. I'm itching, itching. And then

263
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:19,760
 other people in the room will kind of start itching too. So people are fairly suggestible as a species.

264
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,760
 This story was believed to be true and a lot of people still believe it to be true.

265
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:30,240
 It was believed to be true though. It wasn't disputed at all for over 100 years. What are the

266
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:36,000
 chances of someone making up a story and then it perfectly matching modern day alien abductions?

267
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,720
 It's it's quite unlikely. What the more possible, what actually the more logical answer is,

268
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:49,680
 is this guy made up this story and then other people basically when they came across bizarre

269
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:55,440
 encounters in their own farms or ranches. You remember the story their grandpappy told them

270
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:01,600
 about a cow getting pulled up into a UFO dumped off the next day. And then that rancher tells that

271
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,000
 story and says yeah my cow they found just found his guts hanging out or all blood was drained from

272
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,800
 his body or whatever whatever the thing is. It is most I kind of mean relation is one of those

273
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:15,040
 things that I really have a hard time believing in. I do believe cows die obviously they're not

274
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:20,160
 immortal beings. And you could come across the cow's body and be like that's weird.

275
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:25,920
 Like that's not a normal wound for a cow or that's weird that this may a lot of times too they'll

276
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:32,080
 say the body was drained of blood. How does the farmer know that there's absolutely no blood in

277
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:38,720
 the body? None. Zero. None. Because there's a big difference between being drained of blood like

278
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,480
 having blood drain out of you and all the blood is gone. There's a huge difference between those two.

279
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,800
 Same thing with 9/11 they'll talk about the building's fall at freefall speed.

280
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:54,960
 But then they'll say they fell at near freefall speed. Huge difference between the two things.

281
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:01,680
 Sorry to throw the 9/11 thing in there. Huge difference. Freefall would suggest internal

282
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:07,760
 detonations. Near freefall would suggest structural damage to a building. And the building's fall at

283
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:13,680
 near freefall speed. But to the average person you just hear near freefall you think whoa that's

284
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:18,240
 super fast. That's super fast. Same thing when someone says they're drained of blood sometimes

285
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,160
 they'll be specific. When someone says drained of blood you would assume there's no blood left in

286
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,400
 the body. Sometimes they'll use they'll say there was no blood left in the body with these

287
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:32,160
 catamethylations. But how does Joe Hick Farmer know there's no blood? Does he do the dissection

288
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:37,680
 there himself? And if you tell me they're sending these things off to labs to be tested on like to

289
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:43,200
 they take them to a cow corner and he's like yep there's absolutely no blood in this cow's body.

290
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,480
 I don't believe that for a second. I think what happens these cows are dying for whatever reason.

291
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,600
 Natural causes, heart attacks, poor diet, whatever it is. Broken heart couldn't catch the bus.

292
00:27:53,600 --> 00:28:00,640
 It makes far more sense there is a natural cause to it than to think to logically think about this.

293
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:08,400
 An alien craft appears over a farm abducts a cow using technology. This was rope level technology.

294
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,680
 This was some great rope level technology because he wasn't thinking tractor beams. That was way too

295
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:19,520
 sci-fi to even imagine back then. But and again that's such a bizarre detail that that matches up to

296
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,160
 the stories we hear today but tell me what's more logical. A cow dies of natural death and it has some

297
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:30,320
 weird predator wounds on it. Eyeballs are missing, tongue are missing. There's some blood missing.

298
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:35,760
 Or an alien ship showing up. A vehicle that we don't understand shows up.

299
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:42,720
 Abducts a cow using technology we would consider is magic. And then drops the cow back off within a

300
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,400
 range you can find it. It doesn't that makes no sense at all. Why would a UFO abduct a cow,

301
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:53,680
 do medical experiments and they just throw them out the out the UFO near you? Why don't they just

302
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:59,280
 why isn't the ocean why isn't the mariana what is it marinara? No the mariana why isn't that deep

303
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:05,360
 trench in the ocean full of cows? Because that's what you that's what someone would do if if you

304
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,000
 go and you kidnap a cat to do medical experiments and on you don't then throw the cat back on the

305
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,840
 street to be found unless you want it to get caught. But see think of this is this is the extrapolation

306
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:22,720
 of that. You can't have a story of cattle mutilation if you don't find the cows. It doesn't work.

307
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,360
 So logically the aliens would be abducting the cows and either incinerating them,

308
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,840
 destroying all evidence that they are ever taken or dropping them off in a location that no one

309
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:38,320
 would ever find them. I.e. two-thirds of the planet no one has the ocean. But that doesn't work for

310
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:44,160
 the myth of cattle mutilation. You have to have the cattle be found and you have to have it be found

311
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:49,440
 by someone who goes that's weird that cow went missing. Or that's my cow. It can't just be a

312
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,360
 cow in the middle of the forest. That would be weird if you were walking through a yellow stone

313
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:59,840
 and there was just a cow with drained of blood. If there was just a cow in the forest that would

314
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:06,160
 be weird. So I think that this story really shows that to me at least. I mean I went into it thinking

315
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:10,640
 oh this is interesting but once I found out this was fake I go this is just more proof that all

316
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:17,280
 cattle mutilation stories are fake. And I think they were all based off this original lie. This guy

317
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:22,800
 told this story that he thought was funny and it ended up creating a worldwide phenomenon

318
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:28,480
 just like flat earth. Just like flat earth. Because to a normal person the idea of aliens

319
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,680
 abducting cows and then discarding their remains near where the body was taken is ludicrous.

320
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:39,360
 Just like to a normal person the idea of a flat earth is ludicrous. But cattle mutilations are so

321
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,680
 widely known now as like a quote unquote legitimate thing. That I think this bodes. I think this shows

322
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,200
 what's going to happen with flat earth. Flat earth is just going to keep growing and growing and

323
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:57,440
 growing and growing. Flat earth I really do believe was either a meme like the new resurgence of flat

324
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:03,120
 earth was either a meme or some sort of PSYOP some sort of government psychological operation

325
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,920
 to see how stupid people could be. And it's gotten out of hand. I think it's one of those two things.

326
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:12,480
 I think it's like my little pony wasn't a thing until some people decided to meme it into being a

327
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,120
 thing and then it became this phenomenon for like four years. I think that's flat earth and I think

328
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:22,720
 that's cattle mutilations too. I think this guy made this story up and it got out of control and

329
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,160
 people actually believe it's a legit thing. They find a they find a dead cow. It's nose and tongue

330
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:35,280
 are eaten out. It has less blood in it than when it was alive. Shocker I know. But all that being said

331
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:42,560
 there is the slight chance the slight slight chance that Alexander was telling the truth.

332
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,880
 But the problem is is that this is a real life version of the boy who cried wolf. If you belong

333
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:56,080
 to a group called the Liars Club and you see something fantastic no one's going to believe you.

334
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:02,080
 He may have had that affidavit written because he knew people want to believe him. He had to go

335
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:07,600
 that extra step to be like I swear all my lives gentlemen. I swear all my lives this happened

336
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,360
 and everyone's just kind of like okay Alexander you know last time you tricked us your dog was

337
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,920
 pulling pranks. It's terrible. Oh my cows are dead. He's throwing fireworks at him. It's like I know

338
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:20,480
 I know when I punished good old Rufus I punished him. But I threw some through some turpentine

339
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,920
 on him. He doesn't exist no more. But is the thing. This is true gentlemen this is true and

340
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:30,960
 everyone's just kind of rolls their eyes. Now there is a chance that yes this really did happen

341
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:37,760
 to him but the reason we just have to look at his past and go he lied he lied as a hobby.

342
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:44,320
 Why should we believe this one? And if that's the case if that's the case the fact that the

343
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:50,720
 very first cattle mutilation in the United States is tied to a no one fabulous fabulous fabulous

344
00:32:50,720 --> 00:33:00,240
 does discredit the whole thing. It really does. I just don't believe in cattle mutilations

345
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:07,120
 other than any sort of human involvement. I just have never bought into the idea of aliens abducting

346
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,560
 cattle and then discarding the bodies. I don't have a problem with the idea of aliens or aliens

347
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:18,400
 abducting people or aliens abducting cattle it's just the whole phenomenon of them them dropping

348
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,000
 them off with their guts ripped down. So I think that's totally ridiculous. I think people are

349
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,440
 finding weird things and trying to figure out a way to explain them. But you have to wonder if

350
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,640
 this story was true if this story was true. Alexander Hamilton wakes up that night and he

351
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:38,720
 hears his dog pulling pranks and as he's throwing on his pajamas and getting a shotgun he walks out

352
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:47,040
 into his yard and there he sees that giant cigar shaped craft that rope curl out of the ship and

353
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:52,800
 wrap around that cow's neck and it begins to get lifted up into the sky. You have to wonder

354
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,560
 Alexander Hamilton must have been thinking if this story was true Alexander Hamilton must have been

355
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:05,840
 thinking two things. One, this is the craziest thing I've ever seen and two, no one is going to believe me

356
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,360
 that this is true.
