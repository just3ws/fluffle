1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,260
 It's missing persons week once again here on Dead Rabbit Radio.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:09,760
 A whole week of the craziest stories and you go, "Jason, I know the ending to each one.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,760
 They're still missing.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,760
 Uh-huh!"

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,000
 Well, maybe some of them are, but the other ones, who knows?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,160
 Maybe we found them.

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,400
 It's that crazy of a week.

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,720
 First off, we travel to Helena, Montana to look at a story straight out of the pages

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,160
 of missing 411.

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,600
 A young girl vanishes in the middle of the woods, but this story has a creepy perverted

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,600
 twist.

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,400
 You're like, "Jason, I don't want to hear that."

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:46,680
 And then we take a look at the saga of 4 different men who vanished in plain sight.

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,320
 One of them was leaving a party.

15
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,960
 One of them went out to get a bucket of water.

16
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,040
 And then the other one was doing something else and he also vanished.

17
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,400
 And then there was another guy, I think two.

18
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,080
 The point is that today's episode, this whole week is vanishing week, but today I'm missing

19
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,320
 people's week, but today it's all missing people.

20
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,840
 And it's super spooky and I hope you enjoy it.

21
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,680
 And this intro has gone off the rails, so let's start the show today on Dead Rabbit

22
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,680
 Radio.

23
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:25,880
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

24
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,760
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

25
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,760
 I'm having a great day.

26
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,760
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,760
 I hope you guys had a great weekend.

28
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,320
 I hope you guys had lots of fun.

29
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,320
 And you guys heard the intro.

30
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,320
 It's missing people's week.

31
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,600
 I found all these crazy stories.

32
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,040
 I didn't set out to do this, but I found all these crazy stories of people not only mysteriously

33
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,960
 vanishing, but people mysteriously being found, which is not something that we often get.

34
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,560
 Sometimes they are found, but it's not very mysterious.

35
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,480
 They're like, "Oh, I was kidnapped and put in a basement for the longest time."

36
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,800
 I have stories about people who just magically reappeared.

37
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,800
 It's amazing.

38
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,760
 We have so many cool stories this week.

39
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,240
 But speaking of magically appearing in our lives, let's go ahead and give a round of

40
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,160
 applause to our newest Patreon supporter.

41
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,080
 Give it up for Goose Motion.

42
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,440
 Everyone clap your hands.

43
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,000
 Goose Motion waddles on into Dead Rabbit Command, shaking his little feathers.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,440
 Goose Motion, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

45
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,640
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

46
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,760
 Just help spread the word about the show.

47
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,760
 Really helps out a lot.

48
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,360
 Now, Goose Motion, we're going to put a little hat on your goose head.

49
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,640
 We're going to pick you up and put you in the Jason Jalopy.

50
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:43,560
 You are going to drive us all the way out to Helena, Montana.

51
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,320
 This first story, it's a little rough.

52
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,400
 It's a little rough, but the second story is very whimsical.

53
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,840
 Now I could have told them in a different order.

54
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,920
 I could have told them in an order that you could listen to the whimsical stuff and go,

55
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,760
 "That was a fun episode, a fun Monday episode, Jason."

56
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,920
 I just skipped the second story.

57
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,160
 I did consider that.

58
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,760
 But I figured, no, I'm going to do it this way.

59
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:14,600
 And hopefully, hopefully you know where your fast forward button is.

60
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,360
 I want to give a shout out to Pingo One.

61
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,240
 Pingo One is the one who brought this story to my attention, so thank you very much.

62
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,720
 I hadn't seen this before.

63
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,600
 Their post.

64
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,640
 It's June 25th, 1983.

65
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,520
 And we're in the Elkhorn Mountains.

66
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,920
 That's in the Helena National Forest near Helena, Montana.

67
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,780
 It's 4 p.m.

68
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,040
 Sunbeams shining down from the sky.

69
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,800
 Look how fast I can run.

70
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,760
 No, I can run faster.

71
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,800
 These kids are playing a game.

72
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,520
 Apparently they're having a race.

73
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,240
 And it's just a fun family picnic.

74
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:55,120
 Everyone's just hanging out, laughing, debating who has the fastest children.

75
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,440
 And at this picnic is Nyline K. Marshall.

76
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,960
 She's a four-year-old girl.

77
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,160
 She's kind of waddling behind these other kids.

78
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,680
 They're down by Moppen Creek.

79
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,880
 And they can go, "Oh, look at these berries, man.

80
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,600
 I can eat more of these berries than you can.

81
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,440
 It's a very, very competitive family.

82
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,120
 Om nom nom nom."

83
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,440
 And at one point they see little Nyline kind of waddling behind them, the way a four-year-old

84
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,440
 walks.

85
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,560
 And they're just playing around.

86
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,600
 And as these cases often happen, not much time goes by.

87
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,600
 And they turn around.

88
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,280
 And Nyline is no longer on the trail.

89
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,080
 And then the search begins, right?

90
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,720
 They contact the authorities.

91
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,720
 Police come out.

92
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,600
 The FBI gets involved at a certain time.

93
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,720
 Friends and family and volunteers from their church are all combing the area looking for

94
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,720
 Nyline.

95
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,040
 I can't find her anywhere.

96
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,200
 She has vanished.

97
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,720
 In this type of situation, you're praying for the best that she reappears.

98
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,360
 Magically, mysteriously, or not, you just want her to show back up.

99
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,640
 And then the worst-case scenario is that she fell off a cliff, was eaten by a bobcat, fell

100
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,840
 into a mineshaft.

101
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,120
 But that's not really the worst-case scenario.

102
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,960
 We like to think that's the worst-case scenario, but it's not.

103
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,280
 Because we all know the worst-case scenario is that somebody abducted her.

104
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:25,320
 On November 27, 1985, so two years later, the national missing and unidentified person

105
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:34,440
 system receives a phone call from a man who says that he has Nyline.

106
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,880
 And she's still alive.

107
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:46,200
 January 1986, type-written letters begin to be sent to law enforcement agencies.

108
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:52,640
 This letter says that I have Nyline.

109
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,200
 Now the full context of the letters have never been released.

110
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,480
 We have excerpts, and we'll get to those in a second, but they don't want to release

111
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,400
 the whole thing because there's information they know only the kidnapper would know.

112
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,280
 What we do know from these letters is that they came from Wisconsin and more phone calls

113
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,480
 began to be made from pay phones in Wisconsin.

114
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,080
 So the police are flooding the area around here.

115
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,280
 We're talking to Madison, Wisconsin, Edgerton, Wisconsin to try to find Nyline.

116
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,560
 There's a sighting of a girl that matches her description in Janesville, Wisconsin, but

117
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,760
 they were never able to verify that that was Nyline.

118
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,400
 In 1990, there was a guy watching Unsolved Mysteries, one of the best shows ever made.

119
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,960
 And he goes, he's watching it, and he's eating his Cheerios, and he goes, "Whoa, wait, wait,

120
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,960
 what?

121
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
 I know Nyline.

122
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,040
 Not know Nyline when she was four.

123
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,960
 I went to school with her, like in elementary school."

124
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,400
 So he calls up the hotline they have on Unsolved Mysteries, and he goes, "I'm pretty sure

125
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,360
 I know this girl.

126
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,560
 I'm pretty sure I went to school with this kidnapped girl Nyline."

127
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,280
 Now it's really interesting, Unsolved Mysteries, they get tons of tips, tons of phone calls.

128
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,160
 You gotta sort through all of them.

129
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,040
 And a lot of them are fake, but you do have to sort through all of them.

130
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,840
 And this is one where the police probably got this tip, I mean, seven years after the kidnapping.

131
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,760
 Do you really expect this to be true?

132
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,280
 I'm sure they're getting all sorts of calls from psychics, and people will be like, "Oh,

133
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,280
 I saw her.

134
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,120
 She was with Elvis and Big Fun, like crank calls and all sorts of things."

135
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,840
 But the police go and they investigate this.

136
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,260
 I believe this was in the Pacific Northwest.

137
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:31,400
 They go out to investigate this sighting of Nyline from like elementary school.

138
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:39,880
 They go out and they start knocking on doors and they found a missing girl.

139
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,440
 Not Nyline, oddly enough.

140
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,160
 They found a girl named Monica Benilla.

141
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,840
 She'd been kidnapped by her non-custodial father eight years ago, even before Nyline

142
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,640
 went missing.

143
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,420
 Looked like Nyline.

144
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:59,300
 Acted weird, acted like you would expect a kidnapped kid to act.

145
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,380
 I don't know how kidnapped kids act, but I'm sure there's something a little off about

146
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,380
 them.

147
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,540
 I don't know if you're a kidnapped kid.

148
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,700
 I'm sorry if I discriminated against you.

149
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,700
 But my point is, is that so that did solve that mystery.

150
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,540
 They have now been reunited.

151
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,340
 The mother and the daughter.

152
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:23,260
 In 1997, New Orleans, there's a nurse watching reruns of Unsolved Mysteries.

153
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,160
 The greatest show ever made.

154
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,160
 She calls police.

155
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,440
 Now you know that they've been getting phone calls this whole time.

156
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
 And it's good.

157
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,000
 How many just false leads?

158
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,440
 Good hearted people, but false leads.

159
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,360
 This nurse tells this story.

160
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:44,360
 One day she's working at a hospital and a woman named Helena comes in.

161
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:50,080
 She's with an unidentified older man and she comes in to give birth.

162
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,940
 And it is typical hospital policy to ask simple questions like, "Who are you?

163
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,380
 Can I see some ID?

164
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,780
 What are your medical records?

165
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,460
 Is there anything we didn't need to know about?"

166
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,020
 And the couple gets kind of weird.

167
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,580
 They get kind of cagey.

168
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,580
 And they leave.

169
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,580
 This woman's trying to give birth.

170
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,900
 And they leave the hospital and that nurse thought about that story and thought it was

171
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,500
 so weird.

172
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,180
 And then she goes, "Wait a second."

173
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,280
 Nyleen was kidnapped from Helena Mountains.

174
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,840
 That maybe it's a connection.

175
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,280
 She's using that as a fake name.

176
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,000
 She calls the tip line of through unsolved mysteries.

177
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,480
 And they pass it to the FBI.

178
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,040
 The police are like, "Oh man, we're so tired of falling off these leads."

179
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,520
 The FBI looks into this one.

180
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,120
 They track down this pregnant woman.

181
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,480
 Very, very good at their job, the FBI.

182
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,920
 They track down this pregnant woman that this nurse met a single time.

183
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,920
 They track her down.

184
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,920
 There they go.

185
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,740
 So, listen, someone thinks that you're a missing girl named Nyleen.

186
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,740
 She goes, "No, no, no.

187
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,460
 My name is Helena.

188
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,700
 But my mom's name was Nyleen."

189
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,140
 I think.

190
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,060
 She goes, "I don't remember my mom's name."

191
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:06,100
 FBI just, at this point you think they're having to interrupt.

192
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,100
 What do you mean?

193
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,720
 You're named after the mountains where a girl named Nyleen disappeared.

194
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,700
 You happen to know someone named Nyleen you think.

195
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,800
 You don't know your mom's name?

196
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,040
 FBI agents don't even know how to process this.

197
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,480
 What are the chances that this girl even knows someone named Nyleen?

198
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,280
 Let alone now she's saying she doesn't know her mom's name.

199
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:30,520
 So they are like, "Let's just get a blood test so we can end this whole thing."

200
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,480
 So they take some of Helena's blood.

201
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,640
 And then they get some blood from Nyleen's father.

202
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,720
 She is not Nyleen.

203
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,060
 What's interesting about this is that you would prefer to test the mother's blood because

204
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,780
 the fact of the matter is Nyleen, women cheat, men cheat, right?

205
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,780
 That just happens.

206
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,260
 It's unfortunate but it happens.

207
00:10:53,260 --> 00:11:00,380
 But there's always a chance that he was not the real father of Nyleen.

208
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,700
 That she had an affair or something like that.

209
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,900
 You always want to test the mother's blood just to be sure.

210
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,940
 And I'm sure the FBI agents even knew that.

211
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,200
 So you would want to test the mother's blood.

212
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,360
 Why can't they test the mother's blood?

213
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:21,840
 She was murdered in Mexico in 1995.

214
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,360
 Such a bizarre story.

215
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,760
 And when I looked, I was immediately intrigued about that.

216
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,280
 Oh, we haven't even gotten to the letter yet.

217
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,680
 We haven't even gotten to the letter yet.

218
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,040
 I want to go into that in a second.

219
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,400
 But at the end of the story, when you read about this, it always says the mother was

220
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,540
 murdered in Mexico in 1995 and I'm like, "What?

221
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,460
 And there's no details on that.

222
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,820
 There's no details on that.

223
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,700
 Was it just a random murder?

224
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,700
 Was it a hit?

225
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,820
 Was she involved in some sort of cartel activity?

226
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,820
 Who knows?

227
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,820
 Who knows?

228
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,820
 We don't know.

229
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:01,420
 But I would say I'm sure that law enforcement always would prefer to test the blood or the

230
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,020
 DNA of the mother.

231
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,660
 Because then you could totally rule it out.

232
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,920
 It's possible that that wasn't, that Nyleen was never his daughter.

233
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,080
 I'm not saying that that's the case.

234
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,800
 This woman may not have been Nyleen, but it's very weird that she doesn't know her mother's

235
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,800
 name.

236
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,800
 She thinks it was Nyleen.

237
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,640
 It's a very, very weird story all around.

238
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,720
 And we haven't even gotten to the letter yet.

239
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,080
 So at this point, we're in the year 2021, we still don't know where she's at.

240
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,240
 She's still missing.

241
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,680
 And the reason why, I mean, obviously there's two things going on.

242
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,560
 The FBI wants to find missing kids.

243
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,700
 One wants to find missing kids.

244
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:44,740
 But this letter that they received made things far more alarming.

245
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,860
 I'm sure there are people who kidnap kids.

246
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,140
 There was that movie I watched a long time ago called Slender Man or Tall Man with Jessica

247
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,140
 Beale.

248
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:56,100
 And the whole part of the movie was rich people.

249
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,340
 They send this tall guy out who's dressed like Slender Man to break into poor people's

250
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:07,200
 houses to steal their pretty young children and take them to rich people's houses.

251
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,160
 And you're like, ew, gross.

252
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:15,960
 And then they just taught them manners and had them become young debutants of society.

253
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,560
 It's like, what?

254
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,880
 It was nothing sexual.

255
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:27,600
 They just wanted attractive kids to carry on their attractive lifestyle and raise them

256
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,600
 right.

257
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,680
 And then there was, sorry spoiler alert, you're like watching it right now, you're like,

258
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,680
 dang it Jason!

259
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,680
 That was the premise.

260
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,060
 It was nothing sexual.

261
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,840
 They just wanted to give them a better life.

262
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,340
 And that's still creepy, right?

263
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,920
 Because you're still kidnapping people.

264
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:46,780
 But it's better than what that, that, that, that, that, that fictional account is better

265
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,380
 than what I'm about to tell you in real life.

266
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,460
 So here we go.

267
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,620
 Here's this letter.

268
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,120
 He keeps calling her K. Here's the first part of the letter.

269
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,520
 I picked K up on the road in the Elkhorn Park area between Helena and Boulder.

270
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,000
 She was crying and frightened.

271
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,920
 And as I held her, she was shaking.

272
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,280
 And I decided that I would keep her and love her.

273
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,000
 I took her home with me.

274
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,160
 I have a nice investment income and I can work at home, so I care for her myself all

275
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,160
 the time.

276
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,820
 I teach her at home and she likes to go with me when I travel.

277
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,560
 Her hair is short and curly now and she's really grown.

278
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,600
 She's about 45 inches and around 50 pounds.

279
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:38,020
 She has all four of her permanent upper and two of her lower incisors at this time.

280
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,880
 She takes a bath and brushes her teeth every day.

281
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,440
 She eats well.

282
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,640
 Her favorite meal is pizza and cherry.

283
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:52,560
 Okay, I'm gonna assume for whatever reason they edited out cherry Coke.

284
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,500
 Maybe they didn't want to do an advertisement for this creepo.

285
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,500
 The Coke company is like, "Uh-uh, uh-uh, we don't want to be associated with this."

286
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,100
 It's her favorite meal is not pizza and cherries.

287
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,100
 Because that's disgusting.

288
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,380
 We kidnapped his pretty gross too, right?

289
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,100
 I'm like telling that kid like gross.

290
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,820
 Ew, you like pizza and cherries?

291
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,580
 She's like, "Please help me."

292
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,780
 No, the cherry is also capitalized, so I think they cut out Coke.

293
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:22,540
 I think the FBI was like, "No, we have a big sponsorship deal with them."

294
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,680
 They provide us with free sodas so we can never mention Coke.

295
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,680
 Coca-Cola products, right?

296
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,760
 None of it in ransom letters.

297
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,920
 This is the second part of the excerpt.

298
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,920
 Coca-Cola, I'm just joking.

299
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,200
 I'm gonna go on more about Coca-Cola.

300
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,200
 Here's the letter excerpt.

301
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,520
 I have to get a laugh sin now because this is gross and it starts off rough.

302
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:46,320
 I give her medicine from the bathroom every morning.

303
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,980
 It is actually a spoonful of my semen.

304
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,620
 It doesn't affect her physically.

305
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:59,160
 I have never molested her in any other way.

306
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:04,180
 She is a sweet little girl and it is because of how much I've grown to love her that I

307
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,740
 realize how much her family must miss her.

308
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:10,820
 But she has adjusted and seems happy.

309
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,660
 She trusts me and she isn't afraid.

310
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,160
 We play a lot and she laughs when we clown around.

311
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,640
 She smiles and acts coy when I tease her.

312
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:26,960
 She giggles when we snuggle and hugs me sometimes for no apparent reason.

313
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,280
 I love her and I have her.

314
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,680
 I just can't let her go.

315
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,400
 Did you imagine getting that letter about your kid?

316
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,880
 It's horrifying.

317
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,880
 Horrifying.

318
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,260
 I don't know this girl and it's gross.

319
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:49,180
 It's hard to even read at a certain point.

320
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,860
 Absolutely insane and she's never been found.

321
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,460
 She's never ever been found.

322
00:16:54,460 --> 00:17:01,100
 Horrifying story about a young girl who went missing and what a terrifying way to start

323
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,820
 off missing persons week.

324
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,140
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

325
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,900
 I have no real segue from that.

326
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,180
 It's just creepy.

327
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,720
 But I will say this and we're running out of time but I do want to say this real quick.

328
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,920
 It is amazing how this story saved another girl.

329
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,600
 And even the family said, listen we were hopeful that it was Nyleen.

330
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:27,240
 But the fact that another family was reunited means so much to us.

331
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,280
 Really really means so much to us.

332
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,000
 So that's an interesting side note on that one.

333
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,440
 Okay, we have more missing people coverage to talk about so let's see how we can squeeze

334
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,500
 all of this missing goodness in.

335
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,420
 Goose motion, I'm going to go ahead and touch the keys to the carbonicopter.

336
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,900
 We are leaving behind Helena Montana.

337
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:54,060
 We are headed all the way out to an insane asylum.

338
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,060
 Pick a one.

339
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:55,940
 Pick any one of them.

340
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,940
 Goose motion.

341
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,940
 Any insane asylum.

342
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,380
 You're like, I don't even call them that anymore.

343
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,220
 Yeah, well I'm a boomer.

344
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,620
 And we still call them insane asylums where I come from.

345
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:09,160
 I don't have time to tell the other missing story that I talked about.

346
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,360
 The super interesting one that I said.

347
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,160
 You're going to have to listen to this horrible story about this kid before you get to.

348
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,880
 But this story is also equally fascinating and more importantly takes less time to talk

349
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,880
 about.

350
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,680
 This story is recommended to me by Weiselhorn on the Patreon Discord so thank you very much

351
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,200
 Weiselhorn or Vizelhorn maybe.

352
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,720
 But thank you so much for sending this my way.

353
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:39,140
 We're headed to this insane asylum because what he turned me on to was a shared delusion.

354
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:43,380
 Because he was talking about, you recently did an episode where reality is basically

355
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,380
 consensus.

356
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,140
 It was like in the past week or two.

357
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,060
 I don't remember what the episode was.

358
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:52,220
 Reality is consensus and what happens if a lot of people agree on something that's not

359
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,220
 true.

360
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,780
 If a majority of people agree on something that's not true, does reality shift?

361
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:00,620
 It's kind of where we were at the last week on this show.

362
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:05,280
 When he sent this to me, there actually is, this is so fascinating to me, there is a thing

363
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,720
 known as folly adieu.

364
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,900
 Which means delusion, a folly of two and then it goes on.

365
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:17,000
 They have folly infamilie which is family.

366
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Family believes something crazy.

367
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,720
 And then the folly aprecio which is madness of several.

368
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,120
 They should call it madness of many.

369
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,600
 That would be a dope like heavy metal album.

370
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
 Madness of many.

371
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,220
 They're not trying to name heavy metal albums, they're trying to cure psychotic diseases.

372
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:37,340
 Trying to help people but they should make them sound cooler.

373
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,980
 And it's funny because he sent me this and I'm looking at this and at the same time I

374
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:46,140
 was reading an article from the BBC called The Moment QAnon.

375
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,140
 There goes my YouTube channel.

376
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,580
 Getting banned again.

377
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,540
 The moment QAnon took the person I love most.

378
00:19:52,540 --> 00:20:00,720
 I read that article and I often go to the subreddit called QAnon Casualties and what

379
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:09,200
 they do, it might be the funniest subreddit on Reddit right now.

380
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:17,360
 QAnon Casualties is this subreddit where people, I gotta read you some of these headlines.

381
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,120
 These are absolutely hilarious.

382
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,460
 QAnon Casualties is a subreddit where people talk about their friends and family who have

383
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:31,220
 started following QAnon beliefs and they're like "I don't know what's going on."

384
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,220
 And it's hilarious.

385
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,220
 It's so funny.

386
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,820
 I would love to know these people.

387
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:43,380
 All of these interactions sound so fascinating and they're complaining about them.

388
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,420
 I would love to one day just walk into a dinner party and there's two people sitting there

389
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:54,480
 like an aunt and a nephew and the nephew is just trying to eat steak and the aunt is going

390
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,800
 on about the craziest conspiracy theories and the nephew is like "I've had enough.

391
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,280
 I would just sit there and soak all that energy in and it would be hilarious."

392
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,720
 Let me read you some of these QAnon Casualties headlines here.

393
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:12,760
 "My QMom, so a mom who believes in Q, thinks I support cannibalism.

394
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,660
 That would be hilarious.

395
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:22,860
 I would love if I was talking to my mom and she goes "Can we watch something else?"

396
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,340
 And she goes "Jayson, the only reason why you want to watch something else is because

397
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,340
 you're a cannibal."

398
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,340
 I was like "What?

399
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,340
 What?

400
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,340
 No, I'm not a cannibal.

401
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,340
 It would be hilarious."

402
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,340
 Here's another one.

403
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,340
 "This would be fantastic.

404
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,340
 Why are these people complaining?"

405
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,340
 "My dad told me that he's going to be a cannibalist."

406
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,340
 "I'm not a cannibalist.

407
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,340
 I'm not a cannibalist.

408
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,340
 I'm not a cannibalist.

409
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,340
 I'm not a cannibalist.

410
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,340
 I'm not a cannibalist.

411
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,340
 I'm not a cannibalist.

412
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,340
 I'm not a cannibalist.

413
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,440
 I would love this.

414
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:49,120
 I love my dad, but my dad would be 50% cooler if he believed this.

415
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,240
 My dad told me he can now detect me via Bluetooth.

416
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:03,480
 He can now detect me via Bluetooth on his phone since I was vaccinated because the vaccine

417
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,000
 has 5G particles or something in it.

418
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,400
 So I read this one and this kid says "I'm walking around my dad's house."

419
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:22,780
 And when he goes on his phone via Bluetooth, it's whatever this dude walks into the room.

420
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:27,580
 Dude, this is amazing.

421
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,420
 Why would it use to be the best thing I could do?

422
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:41,220
 Whenever this dude walks into the room, his dad's phone shows a new set of wireless headphones.

423
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:54,560
 He has to convince his dad every day he's not a set of headphones.

424
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,960
 Tell me that's not the best sitcom ever.

425
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,960
 Why are you complaining?

426
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,560
 Dad, I told you once, I told you twice I am not headphones.

427
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,560
 He's trying to log in.

428
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:12,420
 He starts singing Bruno Mars.

429
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,380
 He's like "Oh no."

430
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:19,260
 Oh, it's hilarious.

431
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,900
 This one person goes on about their 84 years.

432
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,260
 These are all in one day.

433
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,420
 I didn't even look at the time.

434
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,820
 Just look at the newest posts.

435
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,580
 These are all posted within the past day.

436
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:38,160
 One of them is their grandma started buying survival gear.

437
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:44,160
 She has a little mirror for signaling in the outdoors.

438
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,320
 Hilarious.

439
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,280
 I wish my dad thought I was a pair of headphones.

440
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,760
 And it goes on and on and on for them.

441
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,000
 So let's bring that back to the mannists of many things here and we'll wrap this up like

442
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,140
 that.

443
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,960
 This is basically how it goes.

444
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:03,060
 If you believe that your son is a pair of headphones, that is insane.

445
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,060
 And it is insane.

446
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:10,800
 I think we can all agree that if you think that your son is injected with 5G particles,

447
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,300
 that is nuts.

448
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,140
 But the idea of a shared delusion, which was what Q would be classified as, a shared delusional

449
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,140
 disorder, it is spread.

450
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:21,780
 It is something that you would not have otherwise if you had not listened to this leader, who

451
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:29,800
 would be Q in this case, and generally happens in times of social anxiety and social isolation.

452
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:35,180
 So stress and social isolation, which we've seen a huge explosion of conspiracy theorists

453
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,680
 in the past 18 months because of the COVID lockdowns.

454
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,680
 You're stressed.

455
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,640
 You don't have any other peer groups you can really talk to.

456
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,200
 You're on the internet all the time.

457
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,880
 The last time we had an explosion this big was back, I would say, 9/11.

458
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,640
 It's not a pun of the building blown up.

459
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,840
 I mean conspiracy theory explosion.

460
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,100
 So we have this shared delusional disorder.

461
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,660
 Here's the caveat, though, and this is actually written into the definition of shared delusional

462
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,660
 disorder.

463
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:04,020
 It is only insane if most people don't agree with it.

464
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:07,340
 It has nothing to do with whether or not the belief itself is nuts.

465
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:13,420
 It has to do with the amount of people who believe in the insane belief.

466
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:19,920
 Because if you think about it, most of the things we believe in don't make sense.

467
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,920
 They really don't.

468
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,960
 And I mean, sure, we believe that if you hit a gas pedal on a car, the car goes faster.

469
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,760
 There are certain things that do make sense, but I'm talking about life after death.

470
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,880
 I'm talking about religious principles.

471
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,160
 Follow these rules, and you will go to paradise.

472
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,920
 Don't follow these rules, and you will go to eternal damnation.

473
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,000
 But it's my rule.

474
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,200
 My religion's rules, not your religion's rules.

475
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,300
 Those ones are all messed up.

476
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,380
 Mine are the right ones.

477
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:50,740
 When you step back from it, it doesn't make much sense.

478
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:57,300
 They may be good rules for us to follow through life, but we're making a lot of assumptions

479
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:01,100
 about heaven and hell and things like this and what happens in the afterlife.

480
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:06,380
 If there is even an afterlife, ghosts and Bermuda Triangles and all this stuff, all the fun

481
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,380
 stuff, right?

482
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,820
 All the fun, meaningful stuff.

483
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,760
 If less people believed in it, it would get you locked up.

484
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,800
 That's 100% true.

485
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:21,560
 If less people believed in your religion or believed in your paranormal beliefs, people

486
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,880
 would out and out call you and say, "People do think people who hunt ghosts and are into

487
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,960
 all that stuff are nutty to begin with."

488
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,840
 And think about the sea change we've seen just recently.

489
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:37,640
 In my lifetime, people who believed in UFOs, they were writing books for a very particular

490
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,940
 audience and everyone else thought people who believed in UFOs were nuts.

491
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,900
 And now you can't read the newspaper without a week going by and they're doing articles

492
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,840
 on UFOs.

493
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,380
 Now you would start to be considered insane if you didn't believe aliens exist.

494
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,380
 People would be like, "Really?

495
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,940
 You think in the whole universe there's not any aliens?"

496
00:26:54,940 --> 00:27:01,580
 And you'd be like, "Well, the idea is still weird, but more people are starting to believe

497
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:05,420
 in the existence of UFOs, so therefore you're starting to become a weirdo."

498
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:09,920
 If you don't, you'll hear people go, "Well, sure, I believe in UFOs, there's unidentified

499
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,320
 objects, I just don't think they're...".

500
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,720
 You have to start to introduce all of these side notes.

501
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,120
 Whereas before, people would be like, "What?

502
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,440
 No, little green men, you're nuts.

503
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,200
 You should need to stop reading comic books, you big old weirdo."

504
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,040
 Just in my lifetime, we've seen that shift.

505
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,800
 It's only insane if not everyone believes in it.

506
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,600
 This is the actual caveat they have written into this.

507
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:36,660
 It cannot be something "ordinarily accepted by other members of the person's culture

508
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,660
 or subculture".

509
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:42,220
 It doesn't have to be global, just in your subculture.

510
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,580
 Think about this, in rural China, I don't know if they still do this, but in rural China

511
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,100
 at a time, they bound women's feet.

512
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,780
 They wanted the girls to have petite feet.

513
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,940
 And that was considered normal.

514
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:59,180
 If I did that to my daughters in America, they'd lock me up.

515
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,560
 They'd call it child abuse.

516
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,560
 They'd lock me up.

517
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,680
 It's interesting though, I don't have daughters, thankfully, but I could send my daughters

518
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10,120
 to ballet class and they could damage their feet all they wanted.

519
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,240
 They could damage their feet till kingdom come.

520
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,240
 That's fine.

521
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,720
 And the ballet community is acceptable to be in foot pain.

522
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,720
 Terrible foot pain.

523
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,720
 Bizarre.

524
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,040
 It's only insane if not everyone believes in it.

525
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:26,840
 And it doesn't have to be a worldwide thing in your subculture.

526
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:34,140
 So the people who make the rules deciding what's insane have carved out an exception for themselves

527
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:38,220
 and for most of society and said that other group's insane.

528
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:45,700
 At what point do we get to when people go, "Oh, the world is ruled by reptilians."

529
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,340
 When a mass amount of people do.

530
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,840
 It's growing.

531
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,100
 It is growing.

532
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,780
 More people believe that now than honestly I ever thought would.

533
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,040
 I mean, it's blowing up.

534
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:03,200
 So what happens when more people believe that reptilian shapeshifters rule the planet?

535
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:09,840
 What happens when the world changes so radically that most people believe in something you

536
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,440
 know is false?

537
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,800
 You know it.

538
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:18,360
 You've watched it slowly take over society.

539
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,920
 You know it's not true.

540
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,400
 You start to question your own belief and go, "Maybe they're right.

541
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,700
 How could I be so wrong?

542
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,540
 How could I be so wrong?"

543
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,100
 Do you say, "You know what?

544
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,020
 It's just easier to go along with the belief."

545
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,180
 I know it's fake, but I'm just going to pretend that it's not.

546
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:40,340
 If anyone asks me about it, I'll agree with it.

547
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,700
 But I know it's not real.

548
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,900
 Or do you continue to stand and fight?

549
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,980
 But see now you're the lunatic.

550
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,780
 Now you're the person who doesn't believe in the consensus.

551
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:55,920
 Reality is consensus.

552
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:02,640
 And I meant that on a metaphysical level, but it is also a very social level.

553
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:10,320
 If everyone agrees with something and you don't, you are out of order.

554
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,320
 You are chaos.

555
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:16,400
 And when you stand against order, you pay the price.

556
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:22,720
 Even if the chaos was order, chaos was the truth just a few years ago.

557
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,100
 Reality is consensus.

558
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:48,780
 But that doesn't always mean it has to make sense.

559
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:55,780
 It's not.

560
00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:00,780
 It's not.

561
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:06,780
 It's not.

562
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:12,780
 It's not.

563
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:19,780
 It's not.

564
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:24,780
 It's not.

565
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:28,780
 It's not.

566
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:33,780
 It's not.

567
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:37,780
 It's not.

568
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:47,780
