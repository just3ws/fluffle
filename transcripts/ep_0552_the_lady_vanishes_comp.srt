1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
 A woman trying to fall asleep.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,880
 A couple at Lovers Lane.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:12,120
 A mother and her daughter traveling through France.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,240
 What do all three of these scenarios have in common?

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,200
 They're part of our Trilogy of Terror, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:30,480
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,480
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,480
 I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,800
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,720
 I actually, I don't know if you guys can notice this, but I have a whole new setup.

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,680
 I bought, I used my Patreon money and I bought some pretty high-end stuff.

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,920
 So hopefully it sounds better.

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,480
 If it sounds worse, let me know so I can return it.

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,360
 But yeah, so this is all new for me.

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,760
 Investing in the show and I can't do that without my Patreon supporters.

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,200
 We have a new one.

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,680
 Let's give a round of applause to Bill Gape's.

18
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,680
 Bill Gape's.

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,680
 Let's give him a round of applause.

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,080
 He's doing a little bow for us.

21
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,000
 He's going to be our pilot, our captain this episode.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,520
 You can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

23
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,440
 Just help spread the word about the show.

24
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,600
 That also really, really helps out a lot.

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,880
 We're almost done with October and I've been thinking, we haven't had any really

26
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,880
 scary episodes.

27
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,000
 We haven't done any real spooky stuff.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,240
 Now the stuff in this episode, I don't know if it's terror might be pushing it.

29
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,880
 It's more of a disturbing story, but not disturbing like Monday's episode.

30
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,680
 Monday's episode was gross.

31
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,680
 Too disturbing.

32
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,680
 There's a line.

33
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,280
 But the reason why I wanted to do this episode is I actually had a dream last night.

34
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,480
 You're like already fast-forwarding.

35
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,840
 Yes, no one wants to hear about dreams, but every so often I'll have a very rarely, I

36
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,840
 guess I should say.

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,240
 I'll have a really unsettling nightmare.

38
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,680
 I have a really good friend named Jackie.

39
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,080
 Talked about her several times on the show.

40
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,000
 I haven't spoken to her in probably about a year or now, but you know, because people

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,680
 have families and stuff like that, but really, really close friend of mine growing up.

42
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,840
 Plus, not a dream.

43
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,800
 She was a witch.

44
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,360
 She was up to no good.

45
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,000
 She was casting spells on people.

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,360
 She was interrupting the daily life of this community I lived in.

47
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,080
 It was one of times I didn't live in like 1890s.

48
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,640
 I wasn't carrying milk to turn into butter.

49
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,360
 This is modern times, but I found out that she was this witch and she was up to no good.

50
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,280
 She had all sorts of powers and I grabbed her by the throat.

51
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,640
 Don't read too much into this, especially Jackie if you're listening to this podcast.

52
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,360
 I grabbed Jackie by the throat and I'm bringing her to the constables or the police because

53
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,360
 again, it's not old time.

54
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,680
 There's actually officers of the law.

55
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,920
 I'm grabbing her by the throat and I'm carrying her through the center of town to where I know

56
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,000
 where law enforcement's at.

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,280
 She's talking trash.

58
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,640
 She's kind of like goading me on to do whatever, but I have won the day.

59
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,720
 She has this little smirk on her face and I have my hand wrapped around her tiny little

60
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,000
 neck.

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,160
 When I walk into the police station, my hand is around my own neck and she's gone.

62
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,160
 I was like, "Where did she go?"

63
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,360
 They're like, "Well, that is Jackie for you."

64
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,760
 I go, "Yeah, Jackie does have those powers.

65
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,760
 You really know..."

66
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,760
 I let go of my neck at this point.

67
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,640
 I'm not still strangling myself.

68
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,560
 You never really know what to expect.

69
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,400
 At some point, I did have her by the...

70
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,360
 Maybe, maybe I never captured her.

71
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,200
 Maybe that was all in my imagination.

72
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,480
 I'm talking to these officers of law and they're like, "Yeah, she really has the ability to

73
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,480
 warp reality."

74
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:30,880
 I said, "For all I know, this isn't real and I'm crucified in some abandoned warehouse

75
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,680
 somewhere with my legs chopped off."

76
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:44,960
 Then instantly the dream ended and I was in this room crucified and I can barely breathe.

77
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,400
 I can barely hold up the weight of my body because that's what crucifixion does.

78
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,800
 It starts to compress your lungs and there was a mirror set up in front of me and I

79
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:59,400
 could see my face turning a weird bluish purple and I'm gasping for breath.

80
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,840
 I remember I start looking down to see if I had my legs but I couldn't take my eyes off

81
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:12,960
 of the image of myself in the mirror that had been set up so I could see my own death.

82
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,120
 And then the dream starts again and we're like, "Ha ha ha, laughing with the constables

83
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,160
 and stuff because what a wacky idea.

84
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,280
 Who would think that someone could alter reality that much?"

85
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,880
 And then I woke up and I'm laying in bed and I'm like, "That was a creepy nightmare."

86
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,640
 Bill Gates is hiding under the covers.

87
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,920
 Come on, that's not the creepiest story we're going to talk about and it was just the dream

88
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,920
 or was it?

89
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:41,800
 It's really weird to have a dream where you're watching yourself slowly die but Bill Gates,

90
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,440
 come on get out of the bed.

91
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,600
 He's like, "These sheets are so clean.

92
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,680
 You have to get in the dead rabbit rowboat.

93
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,120
 We are leaving behind America and we are headed out to California."

94
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,880
 I thought we were going to another country this first story.

95
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,260
 We're headed to California.

96
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,960
 Some place in California we don't have a specific location.

97
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,680
 We don't have a name of this person.

98
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,320
 And I know you guys are thinking, "Is this a dream?

99
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,320
 Was this made up?"

100
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,440
 Well we'll get to it whether or not it was a dream in a second because it does start off

101
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
 in bed.

102
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,720
 A lot of these stories that start off in bed I'm already a little suspicious of.

103
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,720
 So it's February 1997.

104
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,440
 We're in California and we're going to meet this woman.

105
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,560
 We're not going to meet her because she's actually in bed right now.

106
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,560
 She's like, "What?

107
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,560
 What are all these people showing up?"

108
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,520
 We're like, "Shh, we're here for a podcast.

109
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,520
 Don't pay attention to us.

110
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,260
 Pay attention to the thing that's about to happen, but not all these strangers in your

111
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,260
 bedroom."

112
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,660
 We're going to call her Margaret.

113
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,220
 Margaret is sleeping.

114
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,220
 So it could be a dream.

115
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,860
 I always got to say that.

116
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:46,220
 Margaret's sleeping and then all of a sudden she wakes up and she hears, "Margaret!

117
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,220
 Margaret!"

118
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:53,300
 I don't know if the voices are super creepy.

119
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,340
 "Come here, Margaret."

120
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,040
 I don't know, but she heard her name.

121
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,640
 It could have just been like, "Margaret!

122
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,640
 Hey, you!

123
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,640
 Margaret!"

124
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,560
 She just heard someone calling her name.

125
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,560
 They weren't like, "A tisket, a tisket."

126
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,600
 They may have been, I don't know, not enough details with this story.

127
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,160
 So that's not really creepy.

128
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,160
 It is.

129
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,520
 It's to wake up in the middle of the night into an empty room and someone's saying your

130
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,520
 name.

131
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,520
 That's super spooky.

132
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,680
 But that's not the creepy part of the story.

133
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,160
 She finds herself paralyzed.

134
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,520
 She can't move.

135
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,960
 Sleep paralysis is very common.

136
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,880
 It's a real thing.

137
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,880
 She's laying there in bed.

138
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,580
 Now eventually she starts struggling more and more.

139
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,980
 She's able to roll over onto her side.

140
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:36,420
 And that's when she sees a human walk into the room.

141
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,460
 Now he's pretty short guy.

142
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:45,700
 So we'll say four feet tall, fairly short man, almost alien height.

143
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,780
 So you think it's a great alien, a hybrid.

144
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,700
 This dude has a full head of hair and a little beard.

145
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,820
 We don't really see facial hair among aliens.

146
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:58,040
 The story crosses a lot of weird boundaries, but everything else that's going on seems

147
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,540
 alien.

148
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,520
 He walks into the room, almost floats into the room.

149
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,000
 She said the way that he glided, she couldn't see his feet.

150
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,160
 She's frozen, but now she's sideways in the bed.

151
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,680
 She had struggled enough to do that.

152
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,200
 She could see he kind of floated across the ground.

153
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,200
 And she's continuing to struggle.

154
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,960
 She's obviously distressed that this total stranger's in her bedroom.

155
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
 She's frozen.

156
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,960
 Who was calling her names?

157
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,460
 There's a whole bunch of questions.

158
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:28,160
 And the bearded man just kind of looks at her and says, "Hmm, you should be used to

159
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,160
 this by now."

160
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,120
 And then the next thing she knows, it's daylight.

161
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,000
 I think that story's creepy.

162
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,280
 Come on, Bill, get out of underneath her covers as well.

163
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,280
 He's also super scared.

164
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,120
 I think this story is creepy.

165
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,000
 All the elements are pretty routine.

166
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Like I'm not saying they're not creepy just because we hear them all the time, but sleep

167
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,320
 paralysis, alien abduction, all that stuff is creepy and in of its own.

168
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:58,740
 But the fact that one, that was his exact quote, "You should be used to this by now."

169
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,740
 It's so clinical.

170
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:04,140
 The first time you go in for a rectal exam, it's going to be incredibly uncomfortable.

171
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,380
 Probably it'll do that for the first 10 times.

172
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,660
 But eventually you'll just be like, "Well, it's time for my rectal exam.

173
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,100
 What are you doing that you need so many?"

174
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,100
 Who knows?

175
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,660
 Maybe you like to ride dirt bikes.

176
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,660
 Is that a thing?

177
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,460
 Does that mess up your butthole?

178
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,460
 I assume it would.

179
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,340
 You get a bunch of dirt in it.

180
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,600
 Eventually you're going to get used to it.

181
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,880
 The fact that this is happening so often that this alien doctor I can presume would say,

182
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,080
 "Hmm, she's still fighting it.

183
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,240
 You should be used to it by now."

184
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:39,520
 And it's that idea of he's probably made comments to her multiple times during these

185
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,600
 examinations or abductions or whatever they are.

186
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,280
 And she doesn't remember any of them.

187
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:49,960
 There's been so many interactions between herself and this being, not remembering any

188
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,960
 of it.

189
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,620
 It's weird enough when you're walking down the street and you see someone who clearly

190
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,980
 recognizes you and starts talking to you and you don't remember them.

191
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,820
 It's always like, "How could I forget a whole human being?"

192
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:06,660
 Now add the possibility of that person abducting you from time to time and putting stuff in

193
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,660
 your body.

194
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,620
 And then be like, "Hey, Jason, remember me?"

195
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,780
 I was like, "Uh, can you jog in my memory?"

196
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,540
 "Yeah, I broke in your apartment the other day.

197
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,540
 Totally abducted you."

198
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,540
 "What?

199
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,540
 Why not?

200
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,540
 I'm not moving that at all.

201
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,540
 Oh man.

202
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,540
 Well, I'll see you later."

203
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,360
 "What are you talking about?"

204
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:25,000
 It's 10 times more disturbing when you have that on it.

205
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,680
 So I thought that story was, again, just creepy.

206
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,680
 A creepy short little story for Halloween.

207
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,680
 It's not really Halloween, really.

208
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,600
 It takes place in February of 1997, but it's still spooky.

209
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,900
 And I'm actually a kind of feel bad that I haven't covered enough spooky stuff.

210
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,240
 So I wanted to get some spooky stuff for you.

211
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,240
 Like, that's kind of spooky, Jason.

212
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,240
 Okay.

213
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,040
 Bill Gape's Let's Go Ahead and Leave Behind California.

214
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,780
 Now we're going to hop into the Jason Jet.

215
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:58,700
 We are flying out to the country that never sleeps, Puerto Rico.

216
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,900
 Jason Jet's flying over there.

217
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,900
 We're hanging out.

218
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,500
 Bill Gape has a bunch of blankets.

219
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,500
 He's flying the plane.

220
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,500
 He's too scared to fly the plane.

221
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,900
 Oh, come on, man.

222
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,980
 He's flying out there.

223
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,340
 We're going to Ponce in Puerto Rico.

224
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,900
 It's January 1999.

225
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,300
 It's late evening.

226
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,300
 Little crickets.

227
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,920
 Apparently they've evolved to be blue jays.

228
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,600
 Little crickets.

229
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
 Making those noises.

230
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,400
 You're like, Jason, that's the farthest from a cricket noise, I think, is humanly possible.

231
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,400
 Frogs then.

232
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,680
 I'm setting the scene.

233
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,680
 I'm setting the scene.

234
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,120
 I imagine Ponce Puerto Rico looks like that little lagoon from the Little Mermaid.

235
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,120
 Anyways, it's a lover's lane.

236
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,640
 See, you have two people.

237
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,640
 They're unnamed.

238
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,420
 They're called Ariel and Eric.

239
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,060
 They're sitting at this lagoon.

240
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,860
 They're doing more than just, "Do you want to kiss the girl?"

241
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,580
 They're getting hot and heavy.

242
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,020
 They've moved far past the musical numbers.

243
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,980
 They're getting hot and heavy.

244
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:05,500
 And that's not the guy.

245
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,500
 That's not the guy.

246
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,340
 I forgot to change perspective.

247
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:15,420
 Now we're outside the car that they're in.

248
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:22,120
 They turn and they look and they see standing outside of their car, Bigfoot.

249
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,320
 Now I know what you're thinking.

250
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,320
 What?

251
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,320
 Bigfoot in Puerto Rico?

252
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:32,200
 I mean, we've covered Mormon Bigfoot in Bigfoot's out of UFOs and Bigfoot's turning

253
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,400
 from human into Bigfoot.

254
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,720
 I don't know why I'm shocked.

255
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,720
 What?

256
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,720
 Bigfoot in Puerto Rico?

257
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,720
 That's unbelievable.

258
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,560
 I don't know why I'm shocked that Bigfoot could show up in Puerto Rico.

259
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,920
 Apparently he can.

260
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,920
 He did.

261
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,920
 And this story, at least.

262
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,860
 Could be a localized version of Bigfoot.

263
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,120
 Because this Bigfoot has an interesting power.

264
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,620
 So let's go back to the narrative.

265
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,880
 I just want to do that noise again.

266
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,120
 And the couple turns and they look and they see Bigfoot standing outside of the car,

267
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,920
 glowing red eyes.

268
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,460
 The girl jumps out of the car.

269
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,760
 Fight or flight, right?

270
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,000
 They figure you're safe in the car if an elk shows up or a bear shows up to your car.

271
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,480
 I don't know if they have those in Puerto Rico, but for all I know they do, better to

272
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,640
 stay in the car.

273
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:25,240
 Again, something like Bigfoot, your instinct may be to run away from it.

274
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,600
 To try to put distance between yourself and this giant creature.

275
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,640
 But the boyfriend sees the girl fiddle with the handle and she jumps out of the car and

276
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,000
 he's like "Wait, no, Ariel, come back!"

277
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,200
 And he's expecting to watch her run off into the dark forest.

278
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:46,160
 But instead, she walks out of the car, walks to a cliff face, that's there.

279
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,600
 I should have said that up earlier, it's not a lagoon, there's a cliff there.

280
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:56,200
 She gets out of the car, doesn't run away, she walks to the edge of the cliff and jumps

281
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,680
 off.

282
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,800
 The Bigfoot leaves and the girl survives.

283
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,160
 She doesn't die when she jumps off the cliff.

284
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,040
 And of course people are thinking, if you're ever attacked by Bigfoot again, if this ever

285
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,160
 happens again, because it's so common, if you're ever attacked by Bigfoot again, stay

286
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,160
 in the car.

287
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,680
 And she goes, "I didn't have a choice."

288
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,680
 And everyone's like, "What are you talking about?"

289
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:24,240
 And she goes, "I was in the car with Eric reading Bible verses, like we do every night."

290
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,240
 And then this creature showed up and the creature told me, "No, no, no, the creature forced

291
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,240
 me.

292
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,440
 It took control of my mind.

293
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,800
 It walked me to the edge of the cliff and made me jump.

294
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,560
 I didn't want to get out of the car.

295
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,040
 The creature made me."

296
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,240
 That's another interesting slice of lore we can add to the Bigfoot story.

297
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:52,000
 Maybe that's something only the Puerto Rico and Bigfoot can do, but that is beyond creepy.

298
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,240
 I think, again, we've talked about this before, like beating up aliens, you can totally beat

299
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,360
 up a grey alien, I've beaten that message into the ground, but you always have to worry

300
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,040
 about them using mind controllers, some sort of space-age weapon.

301
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,280
 There's not many cryptids that can actually possess a human like that.

302
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,320
 There have been interesting stories about people getting ready to shoot cryptids, and

303
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,320
 we've talked about this recently on the show, and they're guns.

304
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,920
 They imagine their guns are going to miss fire so they don't pull the trigger and the

305
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,480
 cryptid gets away.

306
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,040
 And the implication is that that creature put that image in their head, much like Jackie,

307
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,120
 put the image of me, she didn't really, it was a dream, but put the image of me choking

308
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,600
 her, I was choking myself, I never had her in prison.

309
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,160
 But that's just illusion, the idea that you could be trying to outrun a Bigfoot or even

310
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,080
 look for a Bigfoot, or really even not even knowing Bigfoot is in the area, you're out

311
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:47,760
 on a nature hike all by yourself, and something is in the bushes, completely unseen, and you

312
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,960
 start to feel the need to kill yourself.

313
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:57,800
 She survived, so she could tell the story about what happened, but there's variations of this,

314
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,000
 I mean there's different ways it could have come out, she could have just jumped off the

315
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,920
 cliff and died, and then the boyfriend would have said "well yeah, first thought that would

316
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,320
 have been a murder case, right?

317
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,960
 You can't go back to town and be like "hey what happened to Ariel?"

318
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,760
 And he's like "dude you won't believe it, Bigfoot showed up and then she jumped off

319
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,760
 a cliff."

320
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,160
 They're like "awesome, can you tell that story again but with your hands behind your back

321
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,200
 and your head to the wall, that'd be totally awesome, you're under arrest."

322
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:25,600
 It would be really hard to explain that away, but had she died, it would have just been

323
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,480
 so scary that she ran out into the darkness, didn't know there was a cliff there.

324
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,360
 Or if there was no witness there, then when she jumped off the cliff there was no one

325
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,000
 there to help render aid or get her back to the car or something like that.

326
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,200
 And you gotta wonder, just because we're paranormal people, how many times do you hear about these

327
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:48,720
 lone hikers or these mountain climbers or something that fall to their deaths?

328
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:55,000
 Tragic accident, it is tragic, but what if there's another paranormal answer behind that?

329
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,600
 What if they are successfully making that trek up the mountain, but then something in

330
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,280
 the bushes pushes them closer to the precipice?

331
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,560
 See, that's a creepy one, I thought that one was really creepy too.

332
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,280
 Bill Gape's, he's already doing it, he's signaling in the carpenter copter it's making a landing,

333
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:23,360
 you are going to fly us out from Puerto Rico, we are headed out to Paris, France.

334
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:29,040
 And while we're headed out to Paris, France, I'm going to turn to you, turn the lights

335
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,240
 down a bit, the super dim Bill Gape's like "I can't see where we're going, I just keep

336
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,240
 flying."

337
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,320
 Eventually you'll see an Eiffel Tower and then stop, land right there.

338
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,480
 But I turn to you in the dark and I hold a flashlight up under my face and I say "This

339
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:50,000
 Halloween, prepare yourself for the terrifying suspense thriller Spell."

340
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:18,320
 You'll see him in the movie, "The

341
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:23,040
 Watch the Trailer" a couple times, it looks like a tale from the crypt.

342
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,760
 It looks pretty cool and then I was showing other people the trailer too, I show people

343
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,080
 trailers because no one has time to watch a whole movie with me.

344
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,080
 So we watch trailers.

345
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,640
 I turn the lights back on, just in time Bill Gape needs to learn how to fly by instruments,

346
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:43,000
 but he successfully lands us on the tip of the Eiffel Tower, so we got a rappel down,

347
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,920
 but you did a great job anyway sir.

348
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:50,600
 We are now at the base of the Eiffel Tower, we are in the late 1880s to be specific, it

349
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,440
 is the turn of the century.

350
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,560
 This was before Paris was the city of lights, it used to simply be the city of candles.

351
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,240
 It was a very dangerous place to be.

352
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,720
 We're walking around in our old timey clothes, everything is velvety and we're not in a

353
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,200
 chocolate mousse commercial.

354
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,640
 You know what I mean, imagine a steampunk but without all the punk, it's just like old

355
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,360
 timey ruffles and stuff like that.

356
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,320
 Jackets, we just have jackets and jeans on, okay, it doesn't matter.

357
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:25,280
 We're walking around Paris, France, late 1880s, and we see a young woman running down the

358
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,480
 street.

359
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,760
 She runs into the British Embassy and she's like, "Mangeaus, mangeaus, you won't believe

360
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:40,560
 what just happened, the event that just was laid forth on this fateful night."

361
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,800
 The British consulate is like, "Dude, can you speak English?"

362
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,840
 And she's like, "Yeah, yeah, actually I'm a British citizen, I don't know why I did

363
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,840
 that.

364
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,200
 I just read a Jane Austen novel, it just came out, it just came out yesterday, it's amazing."

365
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,600
 This woman, we don't have a name for her, but we do have an interesting provenance to

366
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,040
 this story.

367
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,760
 This story isn't one of those like, "Oh, it could be made up."

368
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,920
 This is a really interesting one, they're all interesting.

369
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,520
 Otherwise, we wouldn't tell them.

370
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,600
 But we're going to call this woman Bella.

371
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,360
 Bella and her mother, Susanna, are on a trip around Paris.

372
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,600
 It's actually the time of the exposition, so the whole city is full of people.

373
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,280
 Everyone's walking around going, "Whoa, look at that.

374
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,960
 Ooh, yeah, that's cool, look at that's a globe, I've heard so much about these things."

375
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,520
 And then they just walk home, they're just seeing food and stuff from other different

376
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,520
 countries.

377
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,200
 I did not research what an exposition was.

378
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,400
 I mean, I know what it is, just the generic, but I don't know which one they actually went

379
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,400
 to.

380
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,720
 They just walked around and they're like, "Whoa!"

381
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,160
 And after a long day of walking around, Bella and Susanna retire to a local hotel.

382
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:52,520
 Now, because the exposition's in town and everyone knows what it is, and everyone's

383
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,400
 there to see it, all the hotels are booked.

384
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,360
 So they actually had to, the hotel they got actually, they couldn't get a double room.

385
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,360
 They had to get two single rooms.

386
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,480
 Which yes, is weird.

387
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,800
 If the hotel is booked, you would assume there'd be no rooms.

388
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:13,480
 But so I don't know why there's two single rooms if it's so busy, but that is the case

389
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,080
 in this story.

390
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:22,120
 The mom chooses room 342 and Bella helps carry in her mother's bags and they set it down.

391
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,640
 And Bella describes the room that her mother chose.

392
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,760
 When they're inside the room, they all look the same.

393
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:34,800
 It's a hotel, but when they're inside the room, it's decorated with rose, strewn wallpaper

394
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,480
 and plum-colored velvet curtains.

395
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,680
 I knew there was velvet in this story.

396
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:44,160
 And the mom goes, "Oh, me, oh my, I have the vapors!"

397
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,920
 And she says, "I need to go to bed."

398
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,920
 And the daughter's like, "That's weird.

399
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,080
 First off, I don't know what the papers are.

400
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,880
 I'm not from deep south."

401
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:57,000
 Secondly, yeah, my mom does tend to fall asleep, like most humans do.

402
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,560
 But she just seems to collapse onto the bed.

403
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:04,360
 Bella lets her kind of lay there for a bit, but then she tries to wake her mom up.

404
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,240
 And her mom is ill at this point.

405
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,120
 She's not in a coma, but she's not doing well.

406
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,120
 There's a huge difference between the two.

407
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,560
 There's a huge difference between having a slight fever and being in a deep coma.

408
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,840
 She was somewhere in between that.

409
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,360
 So she goes downstairs and she talks to the hotel staff doctor.

410
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,160
 I guess they used to have these.

411
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,360
 They would have a doctor that would just hang out at the hotel all day.

412
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,360
 He's playing pinball.

413
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,560
 He's like, "Oh man, I hope someone gets sick.

414
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,640
 I'm so bored."

415
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,640
 And that's what happened this night.

416
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,160
 He's like, "Yes!"

417
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,560
 She goes, "My mom, I think my mom's sick."

418
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,000
 Somewhere between a fever and a coma.

419
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,240
 And the doctor's like, "I heard that diagnosis."

420
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,120
 Many, many times he goes upstairs and he's diagnosing her.

421
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,480
 And he goes, "Yeah, she's really bad.

422
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,680
 What we need to do, I don't have the gear here to take care of her.

423
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,680
 It's at my office."

424
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:57,560
 Not at the hotel, even though my job is to be a hotel doctor, I don't have what I need

425
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,560
 to take care of her here.

426
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,160
 Let's hop in the horse and carriage.

427
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,920
 We're going to just go out to my office.

428
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,920
 We'll get the stuff.

429
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,680
 We'll come back, take care of your mom."

430
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,280
 So Bella's like, "Yeah, okay, that totally works."

431
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,600
 I mean, obviously she's not from Paris.

432
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:13,120
 She's from England, but it doesn't take long for her to realize that they seem to be going

433
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,920
 in circles around town.

434
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,600
 She's like, "Yeah, yeah, I know I'm a tourist, but you can only see the Eiffel Tower so many

435
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,600
 times before.

436
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,760
 Even that's boring."

437
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,760
 And then what's going on?

438
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,760
 The doctor's like, "No, no, no, this is just the way...

439
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,920
 My house is magical.

440
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,080
 You have to go around the block three times counterclockwise and then one time clockwise.

441
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,520
 It's like playing the Legend of Zelda.

442
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,920
 There's a pattern to find my house."

443
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,120
 She said, even when the...

444
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,120
 And she said he was going really slow in the horse and buggy.

445
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,400
 Like it was a tour ride.

446
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,520
 And then when they got to the office, he was like, "Where did I put that?

447
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,080
 What am I looking for again, huh?"

448
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,760
 He sits down, he's watching television, he invents a television, he's watching.

449
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,760
 She's like, "What are you doing?

450
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,760
 You're supposed to pick up medicine."

451
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,760
 He's like, "Oh yeah, but..."

452
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,200
 He's kind of looking around, making a cheese sandwich.

453
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,960
 She goes, "It took him forever to get there."

454
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,120
 And then once he got there, he didn't seem like he was in a hurry to get the medicine.

455
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,360
 But he finally finds the medicine.

456
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,400
 We go back to the hotel.

457
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:12,600
 She runs in the hotel and asks the concierge, "How's my mom?"

458
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,760
 The concierge looks at her and goes, "You came alone, dear.

459
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,760
 You checked in by yourself."

460
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,880
 Belle is like, "No, no, no, I came with my mom like we checked in."

461
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,520
 And the concierge goes, "What room was your mother in?"

462
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,920
 She goes, "Room 342, the one with the roses and the velvet curtains."

463
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,240
 And the concierge goes, "No, there is no...

464
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,360
 I know I've mispronounced his name.

465
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,760
 Get worse each time."

466
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,760
 Pierre will call him.

467
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,600
 Pierre goes, "Your mother did not check in to room 342.

468
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,040
 Nobody under the name Suzanne checked in to room 342.

469
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,320
 She's not getting to say that name."

470
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,320
 And he's like, "Gulp."

471
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,480
 He goes, "It doesn't matter.

472
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,480
 There's no one.

473
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,400
 Your mom has not checked in to room 342.

474
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,800
 You came alone."

475
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:57,060
 And she looks at the ledger and it has a different name under room 342.

476
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:00,960
 So she rushes up the stairs, knocking on the door.

477
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,440
 "Hey, mom, let me in.

478
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,440
 I got that medicine.

479
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,440
 They'll bring you back."

480
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,440
 Belle is knocking on the door.

481
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,440
 Dude opens it up.

482
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,720
 The dude is puzzled as she is.

483
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,440
 He goes, "No, no, no, I just checked into this room.

484
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,360
 There's no one else here."

485
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,880
 And she at this point is losing her mind.

486
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,400
 And as anyone would, she pleads to be let into the room.

487
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,760
 She knows that if her mom is not in there, there will be some trace that her mom was

488
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,960
 in there.

489
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,920
 So the stranger opens the door and she walks in.

490
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,880
 The wallpaper is different.

491
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,880
 The curtains are different.

492
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,880
 Her mother's luggage that she brought in herself is gone.

493
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:42,240
 Her mother was never seen again.

494
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,760
 Now this is a fascinating story on two levels.

495
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,760
 One, that story, that narrative.

496
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:54,560
 Because you look at the idea of people just vanishing into thin air, portals, Mandela

497
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:59,360
 Effect, time slips, alternate reality, all of these things.

498
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:05,360
 But then there's even a more fascinating backbone to this story.

499
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,920
 Obviously, the question we have, like stories like Manitoured or the nanny who disappeared

500
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,120
 in Spain, are these stories real?

501
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,200
 There's a Reddit user named A. Carter, 8.

502
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,360
 And they posted on the subreddit, "Unresolved Mysteries."

503
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,040
 This post, this is what brought this to my attention, so thank you very much, A. Carter,

504
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,040
 8.

505
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:30,080
 It might actually be Aaron Carter, which would be kind of interesting that he's now no longer

506
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,080
 in a boy band.

507
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,800
 He's investigating ghosts.

508
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:38,200
 He wrote this post called "The Vanishing Hotel Room, A True Urban Legend."

509
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,840
 Lay down the narrative like I just did and then takes it another step further.

510
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,680
 Is this story true?

511
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,520
 It turns out a lot of people have been asking that question over the years.

512
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:54,560
 This story was first published in newspapers back in 1898.

513
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:59,240
 So this isn't something that was popping up on the internet and it's been retconned.

514
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:04,360
 Back then, you could pick up the newspaper and read this story about the missing woman.

515
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:08,600
 This story is actually, some of you guys may have known where this story was going.

516
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:13,000
 This story has been turned into television shows, into novels.

517
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,680
 Alfred Hitchcock did a movie about it called "The Lady Vanishes," but it takes place on

518
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:24,080
 a train and it involves spies and a knife-wielding magician, which sounds way cooler than this

519
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,040
 story, but I read the plot and it's just kind of lame.

520
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:30,520
 There's some woman walking around in bandages, not the mummy, so not as interesting.

521
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,880
 And then the knife-wielding magician, I guess, just disappeared.

522
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,800
 He just disappeared from the plot from the write-up on Wikipedia.

523
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:42,600
 But anyways, this story has been told over and over and over again in all sorts of mediums.

524
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,280
 It definitely captures the imagination.

525
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,920
 It's been around since 1898.

526
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:51,280
 And what A. Carter VIII has done is what other people have done over the past hundred years.

527
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:56,800
 In 1929, there was a journalist for The New Yorker named Alexander Wulcott.

528
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:04,240
 He wrote a column on it for The New Yorker and he tracked down the author of the 1898

529
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,240
 article.

530
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,240
 His name was Carl Herriman.

531
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,240
 It's Bigfoot.

532
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,080
 It's Bigfoot's cousin.

533
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,120
 Carl Herriman of the Detroit Free Press.

534
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,400
 And he asked him, "Is that story real?"

535
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,280
 Back when I was doing, when I was a journalist, when I was writing, before digital, we were

536
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:26,280
 doing print papers and we had to print everything out and put it on a thing and send it to the

537
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,920
 printing press and all that stuff.

538
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,720
 You had column lengths that you couldn't mess with.

539
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:37,080
 Like if you had a 4 inch gap in your paper, you had to have an article or an ad in there.

540
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,400
 You just couldn't have a blank spot.

541
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,200
 Now with online newspapers, it doesn't matter, everything formats to the page.

542
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,480
 What Carl says is, he goes, "This is what I remember.

543
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,600
 There was a column that we had to fill.

544
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,880
 They had a column that they needed something for."

545
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:58,200
 And Carl remembers, I remember we had blank space and I put the story in there.

546
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:03,280
 And so Alexander goes, "Yeah, I get that because that's what journalists do, but is the story

547
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,440
 real or not?"

548
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:10,960
 And this was Carl's quote, "Whether I invented the story or whether someone told it to me

549
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:18,040
 as an anecdote and I expanded on it, I cannot for the life of me tell you after all these

550
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,640
 years."

551
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,440
 And that was the answer for a long time.

552
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,560
 People goes, "Okay, whatever it is, it's at least an embellishment.

553
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,760
 He may have made it completely up or it could have been a story he just heard and he added

554
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,760
 stuff to it."

555
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,800
 But people kept investigating it.

556
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,560
 It's definitely been something people have been curious about over the years.

557
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:44,800
 And it was found that the Free Press, another newspaper, published a version of this story

558
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:51,340
 ten months before Carl Horryman's post in the Detroit Free Press.

559
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:55,480
 So even though his story is what made it popular, they were able to actually trace back and

560
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,560
 find a variation of it.

561
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:06,000
 On November 14th, 1897, this article was entitled, "Dropped out of existence, a strange and

562
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,800
 true mystery of the French capital."

563
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,660
 This is really cool and weird addition to this story.

564
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,400
 So remember the story I just told you.

565
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,920
 Everything pretty much starts the same, but this article that came out ten months before

566
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:28,240
 became a viral hit tells a story, but it involves two daughters and a mom.

567
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,080
 They're going there for the expo.

568
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:35,680
 The mom gets sick and the two daughters are trying to figure out a way to treat her.

569
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,520
 And when they come back, the mom is gone.

570
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,240
 Pretty much the same story.

571
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,400
 But there's an additional fact in this news article in 1897.

572
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:52,360
 Just later, the expo is ended, the daughters are still looking for their mother.

573
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,240
 And a police officer tells them what really happened.

574
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,600
 This is so cool.

575
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:06,320
 The police officer says this, "Your mom came into the hotel and our hotel doctor almost

576
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:12,360
 immediately realized she was suffering from black smallpox.

577
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:20,440
 An incredibly fatal, incredibly contagious disease in the middle of the exposition.

578
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:27,200
 So while you were taken off the premises to go find medicine to help her, she died.

579
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,000
 We removed her body.

580
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,240
 We destroyed her luggage.

581
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:36,400
 We didn't tell anybody, even you, because it would cause a panic."

582
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,320
 That would even make sense as far as why the wallpaper and the curtains were different

583
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,040
 when they went back.

584
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,560
 Because they would have been destroyed because they were contaminated.

585
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:51,920
 Now in that article in the Free Press in 1897, it doesn't have the detail of that stuff being

586
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,920
 destroyed.

587
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,120
 That may have been something that Carl had added on later.

588
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,120
 But remember, Carl's story just ends with the mystery.

589
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:03,320
 The original article published 10 months earlier explains what happened.

590
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,320
 And that article wasn't a way to just fill space.

591
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:14,400
 That article appeared in several major US papers on the exact same day.

592
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:19,580
 So a wire had come overseas and major newspapers were publishing it.

593
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,680
 It wasn't just a little "we need to fill some space."

594
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,920
 It was an actual news story.

595
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:32,000
 I love this story because on the one hand you have the combination of that mystery.

596
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,440
 What happened to the mom on that night?

597
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,000
 That's very compact.

598
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,280
 When in real life the chain of events probably took a little bit longer.

599
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,920
 They probably didn't say "oh your mom doesn't exist."

600
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,920
 She never showed up.

601
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,400
 They probably just go "oh, she got up and left."

602
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,080
 We don't know what happened to your mom.

603
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,680
 She must have taken her luggage and left.

604
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,160
 She disappeared.

605
00:31:53,160 --> 00:32:23,160
 The hotel wasn't like "bluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluhluh

606
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:49,840
 It just has all these different combinations of creepy.

607
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,680
 The possible mystery of the Mandela effect.

608
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,280
 Alternate universe portal stuff.

609
00:32:55,280 --> 00:33:01,840
 And then you have real life tragedy and people making decisions that affect other people

610
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,200
 without their knowledge.

611
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:09,320
 So that my ghoulish friends would have worked better.

612
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,880
 Is our trilogy of terror.

613
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,360
 Are you chilled to the bone?

614
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,360
 That's actually a symptom of black smallpox by the way.

615
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,040
 You might need to go to your doctor.

616
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:24,120
 These stories are not terrifying in the sense of creatures busting down your door to eat

617
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,680
 your guts.

618
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:29,760
 Or the serial killer chasing you with a blade to eat your guts.

619
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,720
 It's a cannibal serial killer.

620
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:36,240
 They're terrifying in separate ways because they remove power from us.

621
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:42,280
 There's nothing more powerless than being frozen in your bed, from being mind controlled,

622
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:47,680
 or from being manipulated by people who you trusted would take care of you.

623
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:52,840
 Not having the ability to fight back being powerless is actually the scariest thing

624
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,840
 of all.

625
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,680
 And it happens all the time, every day, to all of us.

626
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:04,640
 We're in a constant state of mental fear because we live in a world that we are powerless

627
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,640
 in.

628
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,440
 It eats at us every single day.

629
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:12,360
 You think we'd be used to it by now.

630
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:34,960
 But it's still the scariest thing out there.

631
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:52,400
 It's still the scariest thing out there.

632
00:34:52,400 --> 00:35:08,440
 It's still the scariest thing out there.
