1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
 in the city of Prague during World War II, was a real-life superhero fighting the Nazis.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:13,680
 And then we traveled to America to take a look at one of our most famous real-life superheroes,

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:21,280
 Phoenix Jones, who will profile his rise and his fall today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

5
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,160
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too. You're like, "Jason,

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,840
 what's up with your voice?" Well, I still have this sinus infection. I'm still super congested up in

7
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,200
 my nose. You guys are saying, you sound more like a muppet than you normally do. Hey, I know.

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,960
 What are you gonna do? It's a daily show and I don't want to miss episodes just because I sound

9
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,920
 super congested. But other than this sinus infection going on, I'm totally healthy.

10
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,240
 Guys, don't be worried. I'm self-isolated. I'm doing really good. So I hope you guys are good as

11
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,160
 well. Let's go ahead and get started with today's episode. We got a lot of stuff to cover here.

12
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:13,280
 First off, let's hop on the Carpenter copter. We're headed to Czechoslovakia, the country somewhere

13
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,200
 in Eastern Europe. We're flying over and as we're going over to Czechoslovakia, does that

14
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,080
 country still even exist? Oh, that's Yugoslavia. That disappeared. And we're also going back in

15
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:30,720
 time to World War II. So not a high point for Eastern Europe. There weren't many, to be honest.

16
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,720
 It seems that it's always been kind of a rough go over there. You had territorial warlords for

17
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,240
 the longest time and then things kind of got settled. And then Hitler came in and took over

18
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,480
 much stuff, started executing people. And then the saviors, the glorious Soviet Empire, saved them

19
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,960
 from the Nazis. People were like, "Yay, we're free." And the Soviets are like, "Mmm-mm, that's what

20
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,560
 you thought." And they put up the iron curtain for about 50 years and now we are here today,

21
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:03,600
 Czechoslovakia. But we're not here today. We are in World War II and we're in the streets of Prague.

22
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,040
 There's Nazis walking down the street doing Nazi stuff, just generally being a pain to the

23
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:15,600
 Czechoslovakian citizens. And you also have Czechoslovakians who are informants, who are turncoats,

24
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,640
 working with the Nazis because they're like, "Oh yeah, I want some of that sweet, sweet Nazi power."

25
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,400
 "I'm going to turn in my own people for minor infractions." But there's someone in the shadows

26
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:34,320
 in the streets of Prague. A man watching, waiting. He doesn't have to wait. There's

27
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,760
 evil around every corner. It basically would be the best place to be a vigilante because basically

28
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,600
 you're like, "You wouldn't need a bat signal. There's crime everywhere. You have Nazis and

29
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,520
 collaborators on every single street corner." So, I mean, you just walk down the street and just

30
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:55,200
 start punching people. You're going to hit a Nazi eventually. Anyways, this guy springs into action.

31
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:02,880
 "Baboying." Now, that wasn't a turn of phrase. "Baboying." A man jumps out of the shadow, super high,

32
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:09,760
 20, 30 feet. "Baboying." And lands right behind a Nazi, punches him in the back of the neck. "Oi,

33
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,320
 my neck." Bounce away. Sees two collaborators being like, "Who should we rat on next?" "Oh,

34
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,560
 that girl turned me down for a date. We should say that she's hiding some Jews in her." "Baboying."

35
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,720
 The dude bounces on top of his head multiple times, pushes him into the dirt. The other

36
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,800
 collaborator runs away. "Baboying, not for long." So, he just does this. So, just imagine for the

37
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:41,280
 course of World War II, this dude was jumping on people. Now, this guy, his name is Parak,

38
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,520
 aka the "Spring Man" or "The Springer," is what his name means. And throughout World War II,

39
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:53,520
 there was rumors of an event. So, this is, he basically has two origin stories, okay? Some people

40
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,480
 swear that this guy's real. People nowadays go, "It's an urban legend," because when they look in

41
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,280
 Nazi and police reports, there's no men, which were the same thing back then, because the police

42
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:10,400
 were the collaborators. There was no reports of a man with springs on his feet, "Baboying" all

43
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,000
 over the city, stopping crime. To be fair, I wouldn't put that down in a report. I mean,

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,440
 it's Nazi control territory, right? You're not going to be like, "Um, I lost those people. I was

45
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,600
 supposed to kidnap because a man baboing them on my head." Like, you're not going to put that. You're

46
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,960
 just going to be like, "Oh, they ran away." They just dissolved. They just dissolved right in front

47
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,680
 of me. You're not going to put that there's a superhero chasing you down the street. Anyways,

48
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,320
 some people swear this guy's real. Other people think it was just a legend, but he has two origin

49
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:47,360
 stories. One, there was an inventor who was like, "How do I fight crime? I'm just a lowly inventor.

50
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,920
 I know." And he put, "Oh, God, look at this chase." He's an inventor. He puts springs on his shoes.

51
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:59,280
 Some people specifically say they're springs from a couch, which I've never met a couch that

52
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,480
 boing-y, because apparently he could jump over rail cars, which, okay, that's a bad image. When

53
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,600
 we're talking about the Holocaust, we're talking about World War II. Can they come on? He's just

54
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,000
 bouncing over trains. He doesn't stop them. They keep head at east. He's just bouncing over them.

55
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,480
 They could have come up with a better image for something that's bouncing over a building,

56
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:24,160
 perhaps. But anyways, an origin story about a guy who put springs on his shoes. The reason why,

57
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,880
 pardon me, thinks this is real. You're like, "Jason, you can't actually believe that a guy can bounce

58
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,720
 over structures." Well, we can talk about physics later. The reason why I think this might be true,

59
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,160
 because that's such a stupid power, right? Like, if I was making up a power, it would be he could

60
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:47,520
 turn invisible, or he could like transform himself into, like, I don't know, anything really. You

61
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,680
 don't need to have a limit on that. If you're making it up, he can transform himself into, like,

62
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,920
 a he-man. And he's ripping Nazis in half and stuff like that. If you're making it up, why do you

63
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,160
 just give him this power to jump really high with springs on his feet? Makes me think it might be

64
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,520
 true. But when folklorists look at this, because what happened was, whether or not the police were

65
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:12,000
 writing this down, everyone believed in Prague believed in Patar, everybody. And when anything

66
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,480
 went wrong, they blamed it on him, like a ammunition truck explodes, or it was Patar. I'm walking down

67
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,840
 the street and all my groceries fall out of my hand. It was Patar. When folklorists look back on this,

68
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:31,760
 they go, "We see stories of a springing man in Prague all the way back to, like, the 1890s,

69
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:37,200
 almost a contemporary to Spring Hill Jack in England." What's interesting about that is Spring

70
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,400
 Hill Jack, it was kind of like a, he was sexually molesting women. They leave that part out of a

71
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,560
 lot of the monster books for kids. That's the first time I ever heard about Spring Hill Jack.

72
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,400
 And there's a little monster toy line. It was like, remember those muscle characters,

73
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,480
 little rubbery muscle guys? They had a toy line like that, but they were all classic monsters.

74
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,520
 And I remember one of the first ones I got was Spring Hill Jack. And it was like,

75
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,840
 "This menacing man jumps over buildings!" And then, maybe about a year and a half ago,

76
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,400
 I was doing research for a show and he didn't jump over buildings. He jumped into buildings and

77
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,240
 sexually assaulted the women inside. Spring Hill Jack, he was, he's known for jumping everywhere,

78
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,680
 but when you look into the actual myth, he was constantly assaulting women, pinching their butts

79
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,280
 at the least. So when I saw this ago, that's weird. Like, one, it's weird that you have two

80
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,640
 bouncing people, but if this guy was a contemporary of Spring Hill Jack in the 1890s, why did he become

81
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:35,360
 a hero character in the 1940s? But this is why. He wasn't a hero character in the 1940s, actually.

82
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,120
 So what happened? This is from what they can gather, because part of the problem is that

83
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,040
 this guy was totally believed in during World War II. People had heard stories about him before,

84
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,640
 but during World War II, you had all of these things happening. People were blaming

85
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:59,200
 Patar. And then when the Soviets freed, quote unquote, freed Prague and took over,

86
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:05,120
 the legend of Patar was put to rest. You can't have this guy jumping around, or maybe he was

87
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,680
 actually arrested by the KGB, or maybe he joined the KGB, who knows. But the Soviet Union said,

88
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,640
 "No more stories about Patar." So it wasn't until the fall of the Iron Curtain where you had people

89
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,640
 going back and researching this stuff and going like, "Well, there's a lot of stuff about this,

90
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,520
 but there's not a lot of real documents because they were suppressed for so long." The Nazis

91
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,120
 didn't want to hear about it. People were afraid to go to work during World War II. People blamed

92
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,880
 every problem on Patar. And then the Soviets took over. They didn't want to hear about it either.

93
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,680
 There's a really cool cartoon, and I actually included it in the show notes. It's called

94
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,760
 A Spring Man in the SS, is what it's called. It's in the show notes. Check it out. It's like 14

95
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,920
 minutes long. It's kind of a really cool little cartoon that talks about it. It has the Spring Man.

96
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,840
 It's just a chimney sweep, which was another origin story, but that didn't really make any

97
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:53,520
 sense. This is the weird thing. So like I said, you had stories of him back in the 1890s, right?

98
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,680
 And then you had stories of him in World War II. And today he's celebrated as a war hero,

99
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,000
 fighting the Nazis. And he has cartoons and theater based on a bunch of books coming out of

100
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,280
 Czechoslovakia. It's considered Czechoslovakia's only superhero. But here's the weird part. So he

101
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:12,400
 does show up. These are the things that everyone agrees on. He shows up during World War II mostly,

102
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:18,320
 bounces around on people, and fights the Nazis towards the end of the war. For the first

103
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,200
 couple years, and the reason why people were so afraid of him and people wouldn't go out at night,

104
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,960
 and the Nazis were like, "Dude, we need you to build these bullets for us. We need this

105
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:32,000
 cheap slave labor." And people were like, "No, I don't want to leave my house and watch your factory,

106
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,640
 because this guy is going to bounce on top of me." The people of Prague, for the first couple

107
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,600
 years of the war, did not seem as a hero. He was raping and murdering people. He would bounce out

108
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,400
 of the shadows and rape you, bounce out of the shadows and murder you, or both. And the Nazis

109
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:54,240
 were like, "That's impossible." And the citizens were like, "Who is raping and murdering us?

110
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,920
 Like, why can't you catch this guy?" And that people refused to work. And at some point,

111
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:07,280
 he became a hero, he became a hero figure versus not being a villain anymore. What

112
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:12,720
 made that change? At what point were you like, "Oh, that mythological figure we made up. Yeah,

113
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,040
 now he's a good guy." Now, it would be the equivalent of if all of a sudden, everyone agreed that the

114
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,680
 boogeyman was actually like an undercover cop. And he was like hiding in the shadows, he started

115
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,160
 arresting criminals. He'd be like, "Wait, no, no, no, I forgot the boogeyman. He hit him on my bed

116
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,720
 and like ate my dog. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

117
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:30,720

154
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:23,280
 so that's sad, but that was, I read a lot of articles on this and it was only one version. The other version is that, he and his buddy were out at a bar and his buddy got in a fight and Phoenix Jones like didn't know what to do so he threw on a ski mask and jumped around the corner and quote made a commotion until the people left and the cop showed up or something like that.

155
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:32,000
 And I'm thinking, wait a second, so you're, you're a fighter, he is a fighter, like we know that, we do know his record because he did actually compete in a lot of MMA stuff.

156
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,800
 He is a fighter, but your buddy's getting beat up, you take the time to run around the corner.

157
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:36,800
 Do you just have a ski mask on you? Was there one in the garbage can? And then come back and the guys are already left anyways and you're like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

158
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:53,840
 Do you just have a ski mask on you, was there one in the garbage can, then come back and the guys are already left anyways and you're like, oh, and then there's a version of that story where his friend had a permanent facial injury. Come on, man, like what, like something like that is generally reported in all the articles.

159
00:26:53,840 --> 00:27:01,040
 His friend was left with a horrible injury and every time Phoenix Jones looked at his friend he thought, somebody has to do something, so he put on a costume.

160
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:20,000
 Whatever the case, both of those stories supposedly happened, his son slipped on some glass, got cut up, his son became his own superhero glass boy that wherever he went, he was, that was his superpower, was slipping on glass, he was like Iceman, he's like, I'll get down from this cliff real fast, he like throws glass in front of him and like slides everywhere.

161

00:27:50,000 --> 00:28:05,440
 He's on a rooftop, his very first time fighting crime, he's staying on a rooftop wearing a tuxedo underneath was his spandex uniform. I don't know why the tuxedo either, I don't know why a tuxedo either, but anyways, he's on the rooftop and his idea was to rip off the tuxedo and then run around the spandex.

163
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:15,440
 He sees a mugging and he's like, oh, now I gotta get down there and according to him it took him five minutes to get down off the building and then he runs over and the woman had already been mugged and she's like, what are you doing?

164
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:24,720
 You look like Count Chocula here, like that's, the actual quote is, well that's pretty close actually, the actual quote is quote, this is what she said, what are you doing?

165
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:35,680
 He already left, you look like Count Chocula, you look stupid, I don't believe that happened, like I don't believe, I don't believe that she's dropping pop culture references after being mugged.

166
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:40,800
 What do you mean you look like Thomas the Tank Engine but without the Thomas or the Tank Engine?

167
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:45,840
 You look like nothing because you're a big old loser, I don't believe that story.

168
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:55,840
 I do believe he's probably running around in tuxedo, I do believe that he probably saw him mugging, he couldn't stop but I don't think she turned around with a witty one liner, but anyways, anyways, so that happened according to him.

169
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:06,880
 That was back in 2009, he continues fighting crime, quote unquote, in 2011 the first time that he got in the news was some guy's car was getting stolen, Phoenix Jones shows up.

170
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:16,400
 At this point, at a certain point he starts wearing body armor, he has like ballistic armor, he has his own private doctor, so at one point he got stabbed, this is written in this article, he gets stabbed, right?

171
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:21,200
 And they said, "Jones fixed his suit up and then got treated by his private doctor."

172
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,560
 And I'm thinking, everyone has a private, I have a private doctor, everyone has a private doctor.

173
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:34,160
 When I go to the doctor, there's not four other people sitting in the room with me, they try to make it sound like he went to go see Alfred.

174
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:38,480
 Your private doctor is your doctor that you pay for, right?

175
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:49,520
 I don't think this guy has a do- just I definitely think the doctor does, the doctor's like, oh man, hope Phoenix Jones gets shot tonight, I really need to make a car payment, uh.

176
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,480
 Everyone has a private doctor, journalist.

177
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,120
 You're trying to make it sound like he basically is a superhero.

178
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,160
 I mean, he's stopping crime, that's great.

179
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,520
 That's really good.

180
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:08,480
 But, I also, I'm super suspicious about a lot of the stuff, a lot of the adventures that you guys are having.

181
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:16,240
 Where I grew up, you would watch people beat each other up and you'd be like, okay, do you want to keep sitting in this Burger King or should we leave?

182
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,200
 Because we're not getting in the middle of that.

183
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:26,400
 Like, the only time you would get in the middle, and you rarely see this, I'm trying to think of a time that I'd seen this, the only time you'd ever get in the middle of a fight,

184
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,680
 is when it was someone who was much bigger than the other person.

185
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:37,840
 And even then, it was like, I remember once I came across the fight, and it was between a guy who was, I don't know, a 200 pound weightlifter out of prison,

186
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:43,360
 and his 19, 18 year old daughter, and he was throttling her.

187
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,000
 And I just walked up and I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa.

188
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,160
 And what I did was I just put my hands on his shoulders.

189
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,520
 I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa.

190
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,640
 I knew both of them.

191
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,240
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, man, come on, come on, come on.

192
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,600
 He let her go.

193
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,200
 Put my hands on him to let him know I'm here, I'm standing behind you.

194
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,240
 You're overreacting.

195
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,600
 Uh-uh, no, that's-- uh-uh.

196
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,480
 I didn't jump in the middle of them and go, stop, evil doer, because now I'm escalating it.

197
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:16,720
 Perfect example, one day Phoenix Jones was walking down the street, and he saw two men arguing, and he did jump in the middle of them.

198
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,720
 And one of them got him in a headlock, and the other guy pulled out a gun and broke his nose, started pistol whipping him in the face.

199
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,880
 And then they both left.

200
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,520
 So you don't really jump in the middle of fights, it's super not smart.

201
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:32,000
 That's why domestic violence incidents are so dangerous for cops.

202
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,480
 I made an offhand reference to that in the last episode.

203
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,080
 I was like, cops hate doing those.

204
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:47,840
 Because what happens is you go up, knock on the door, the cops come in, guys fight and the wife, the wife's fighting the husband, you start to separate them, and then they're like, get off my wife, and now you're fighting two people at once.

205
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,000
 They hate doing domestic violence stuff.

206
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,080
 So anyways, I mean, like, yeah, I think it's cool to fight crime, but I don't think it's feasible in that way.

207
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,840
 I think that's one of the follies of youth.

208
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:05,840
 I don't know how many of these real life superheroes exist in their 40s and their 50s, because as you get older, you go, I'll just make a phone call to the police.

209
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:10,160
 Or I'll just, just don't, I mean, you can give sandwiches out to anybody.

210
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,920
 Maybe also, that's the weird thing about it.

211
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,560
 There seems to be a weird egotistical thing about this.

212
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,880
 Because can't you just hand out sandwiches to the police?

213
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,640
 Not the police, I don't need sandwiches.

214
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,200
 Can't you just hand out sandwiches to the homeless people anyways?

215
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,120
 Why do you need the costume?

216
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,840
 But, like Bane once said, nobody cared about me until I wore the mask.

217
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:33,760
 If Phoenix Jones was just out doing, uh, handing out sandwiches and stuff like that, would anyone have paid attention to him?

218
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:38,240
 Now, Phoenix Jones actually has retired now.

219
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,400
 He's retired.

220
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:45,360
 He was on a podcast called the Northwest Nerd podcast, NW Nerd podcast.

221
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,960
 And he gives this quote, kind of heartbreaking.

222
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,280
 We've had a lot of fun at this dude's expense.

223
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,000
 We have a quote, this is in March of 2019.

224
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,600
 Quote, "I've seen what people do to each other, and I live with it every day.

225
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,440
 Every day I live with horrible, horrible things.

226
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,480
 And I think to myself, apparently, apparently he's Barack Obama now.

227
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,120
 And I think to myself, I made a difference.

228
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,520
 But I didn't make a difference.

229
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,840
 It didn't make a difference.

230
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,320
 The difference was supposed to be the people who saw a superhero

231
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,560
 being inspired to not act this way anymore.

232
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,200
 We have not gotten that lesson.

233
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,120
 We didn't get it at all.

234
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,960
 The shots, the stabbings, the bullets.

235
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,560
 It wasn't worth it.

236
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,240
 No one got it.

237
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:40,880
 Maybe I stopped an individual situation, but people were supposed to get better.

238
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,560
 So he was wearing a suit as a symbol.

239
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:48,880
 He was wearing a suit to inspire the population of Seattle and hopefully the world.

240
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,480
 Let's see this man.

241
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,120
 He fought crime from 2009 to 2019.

242
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,960
 Ton of stuff.

243
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,520
 He'd pop up in the media every once in a while for being one sort of crazy antichrist or another.

244
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:04,720
 He says that he stopped a bunch of people from blowing up city hall in Seattle.

245
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,560
 Again, I don't believe that.

246
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,560
 I don't believe that's true.

247
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,760
 I believe that he was at a May Day protest.

248
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,240
 Apparently May, you're like, "That was just a poignant."

249
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,120
 How do you pronounce that?

250
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,720
 That was such a great moment.

251
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,040
 Now you're back to making fun of this guy.

252
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,960
 And you can't pronounce poignant.

253
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:28,800
 But anyways, on May 1st, 2012, Phoenix Jones, L. Calbrero, and Midnight Jack

254
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,080
 were undercover at a Black Block protest.

255
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:36,880
 "Raw, hate the U.S. Hate the U.S. Down with banks."

256
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,360
 And the superheroes are undercover and they hear some guys being like,

257
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,440
 "Hey, you got the explosives.

258
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,680
 You're, yep, right here, right here in this bag.

259
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,760
 It's full of dynamite and a bunch of other, of comical bombs.

260
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,600
 There's a bomb with a giant fuse out of it.

261
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,560
 This is bomb on it.

262
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,360
 Good.

263
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,720
 Now let's just get these to city hall and blow it up."

264
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,800
 Then everyone will agree with our anarchist ways.

265
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,120
 That's the best way to achieve people to come to our point of view.

266
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,920
 Terrorism.

267
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,880
 Phoenix Jones, L. Calbrero, and Midnight Jack look at each other.

268
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,200
 They go and they tell the cops, "Hey, those guys are going to blow up city hall."

269
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,920
 And the cops refuse to stop it.

270
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,040
 So the trio of heroes have to beat them to city hall and while they're there,

271
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,560
 they start getting beat up and apparently one of them, he denies this, but

272
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:28,640
 one of the superheroes sprayed the protesters with pepper spray and they prevented,

273
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,520
 they prevented the bombing.

274
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,600
 What I think happened was some knuckleheads in the crowd.

275
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,760
 You always get some weirdos like, "You know what'd be awesome, dude?

276
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,480
 You know, to really show them if we blew up that building and someone else being like, "Yeah."

277
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,040
 And I know that guy's just running his mouth.

278
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,520
 Most people know they're just running their mouth.

279
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,120
 And that's why if they went to the cops and said, "Hey, this guy's talking about blowing up a building."

280
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,920
 "Oh yeah, whatever."

281
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,360
 I don't think they actually had comically sized bombs on them.

282
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,000
 And the police refuse to do nothing.

283
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,120
 The police are part of the plan.

284
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:09,680
 They're like, "Oh yes, only we had the guts to blow up the Capitol, but these black block protesters,

285
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,120
 they will do it."

286
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,320
 I don't believe that story.

287
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,600
 I believe that they overheard someone threatening to blow something up.

288
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,400
 I.e., they're on any college campus.

289
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:18,880
 Right?

290
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,240
 There's always radicals on every level, basically anywhere young people gather.

291
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,280
 You're going to get people talking about blowing up this or blowing up them.

292
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,440
 So, you're like, "Jason, where do you hang out?"

293
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,240
 "Where are you going?"

294
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,080
 This are like bomb threats.

295
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,520
 It's no big deal.

296
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,240
 What?

297
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,520
 They're threatening to blow that stuff up?

298
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,480
 I don't care.

299
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,120
 They're just smoldering ruins all behind me.

300
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,240
 Like fake news.

301
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:44,880
 Uh-uh-uh.

302
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,000
 Yes, I'll hold this bag of bombs that are lit.

303
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,320
 What?

304
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,600
 No.

305
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,080
 But anyways, I've heard tons of weirdo threats like that.

306
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,560
 Anyways, so he retires, March 2019.

307
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,720
 And I hope you don't.

308
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,360
 I hope you guys don't.

309
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,960
 I kind of like Phoenix Shows, right?

310
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,160
 Like, I'm making fun of all this stuff, but at the same time, I admire him.

311
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,400
 I know the episode, it seems to be a little weird,

312
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,760
 because I'm like totally making fun of this guy, but I get where his heart is at.

313
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:13,680
 Like I said, if I was younger and wasn't as like realizing how the world worked,

314
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,480
 if I was much younger, and I didn't understand logic,

315
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,200
 I would also want to go out to fight crime.

316
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,040
 But it's just, you can't really do that.

317
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,160
 I think, I've always said this,

318
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,320
 you can't save the world, but you can save the people in it.

319
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,720
 You can affect lives one at a time.

320
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,960
 Handing out food to the homeless, that's awesome.

321
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,600
 Not now.

322
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,640
 Don't do it now.

323
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,520
 Stay inside.

324
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,880
 Don't do any of this stuff now.

325
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,520
 But when things, when this is all over, community service is great.

326
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,400
 Starting your own community service is totally fine too.

327
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,280
 If there's like groups in the area, you don't necessarily want to work with them.

328
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,400
 There's tons of stuff you can do.

329
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,280
 I totally agree with that.

330
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,760
 And I enjoy that part of it.

331
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,200
 At the same time, you can, you, I think you'd be more effective working with a drug prevention

332
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,400
 program with middle school students and high school students,

333
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,640
 then you would be beating up a drug dealer,

334
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,720
 because then the other drug dealer's going to be like,

335
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,480
 "Great, now my territory has expanded because you be this guy."

336
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,120
 So, or just become a cop or a judge or a lawyer or anything.

337
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,760
 There's a lot of different ways you can do this without putting on a mask.

338
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,160
 But he retires in 2019.

339
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,440
 Now that all the superheroes are gone in Seattle,

340
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,400
 there's whispers of a super criminal in the city.

341
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,080
 An unstoppable drug dealer.

342
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,960
 So maybe these superheroes were actually doing some good.

343
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,560
 Because now you have a drug dealer who's moving a lot of product.

344
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,080
 There's a drug dealer operating in Seattle that the police didn't even know about.

345
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,600
 They know drugs are being sold.

346
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,720
 Obviously, that's part of their job, not selling the drugs.

347
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:45,680
 But part of their job will sum up the cops might, but part of their job is to track and stop drug

348
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:45,920
 dealers.

349
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,040
 So they know drugs are coming through.

350
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,160
 But finally, this informant, this confidential informant for the police goes,

351
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,200
 "I'm surprised that nobody has caught this drug dealer yet."

352
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,320
 The cops are like, "What drug dealer?"

353
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,000
 And they're like, "There's a really big drug dealer operating in Seattle."

354
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,240
 You guys don't even know about it.

355
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:10,480
 Police are like, "Well, okay, Einstein, don't leave us in suspense.

356
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,600
 You're an informant.

357
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,800
 You're supposed to inform us.

358
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,840
 Go try to be dramatic."

359
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:19,520
 And the informant goes, "One of the biggest drug dealers that is out right now that you can't catch

360
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,680
 is Phoenix Jones."

361
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:29,520
 Police begin an investigation of Phoenix Jones.

362
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:36,880
 Just months after announcing his retirement, he retires in March of 2019.

363
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:44,400
 By November, the police are setting up deals online to buy Mali or MDMA.

364
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,840
 But they can't catch him.

365
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,360
 He's slick.

366
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,440
 They're making these deals.

367
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,040
 And when he makes an appointment to show up in the spot to move the product, he's not there.

368
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,000
 He's at a different spot.

369
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 The drops are changing.

370
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,920
 Everything is constantly moving.

371
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:07,920
 It takes three months of them tracking him down before they finally arrest the former

372
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:15,360
 superhero Phoenix Jones with four grams of cocaine and 31 grams of an unknown white powdery substance.

373
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,760
 I mean, it's probably not confectionary sugar, right?

374
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,640
 It's most likely the MDMA.

375
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,160
 They caught him with distribution.

376
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,560
 They're charging him with drug dealing, all of this stuff.

377
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,840
 And at his bail hearing, the police are like, "Don't do not let this guy out on bail."

378
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,800
 And the judge let him out on bail.

379
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,240
 So he's walking free.

380
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:42,960
 Now he's probably self-quarantined now, but that is the story of Phoenix Jones.

381
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:50,160
 A man whose broken window caused him to wage a one-man war on crime for 10 years.

382
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,000
 And then for a couple years, he was with other people.

383
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,520
 But you get the point.

384
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,880
 The dark night, you guys knew I was going to say this.

385
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,800
 The dark night had that great quote, "You either die the hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain."

386
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,560
 That fits this perfectly.

387
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,120
 A man who risked his life.

388
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,520
 And he could pronounce that word correctly.

389
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,880
 A man who risked his life.

390
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,720
 He did get stabbed.

391
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,440
 He did get shot.

392
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,120
 He went to his private doctor.

393
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,040
 He went to his private doctor who worked at Kaiser.

394
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,440
 Man who put his life on the line.

395
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,600
 To save us.

396
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,680
 Us homo sapiens.

397
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,880
 Us normal people.

398
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:36,800
 And in the end, he became disillusioned with the hero thing.

399
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,520
 For 10 years, he put on that costume.

400
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,600
 For 10 years, he went out and saved people.

401
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:48,000
 And each night, as the sun was rising, that's the morning.

402
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,320
 Each morning, when the sun was rising, he was headed back to his secret headquarters.

403
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,280
 A house that he lived in with his family.

404
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,720
 Every morning, he thought, "I made a difference tonight.

405
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,880
 I became a symbol.

406
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,920
 People will change, but for 10 years the sun rose and the sun set.

407
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,640
 And nothing changed.

408
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:16,960
 The people of Seattle continued to use drugs, to beat each other up.

409
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,120
 To beat him up.

410
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,240
 That never changed either.

411
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,600
 10 years, he became disillusioned and said enough.

412
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,360
 Tired of being a symbol.

413
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,000
 Tired of risking my life.

414
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,520
 It's time to put away the cowl.

415
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,920
 Become a citizen.

416
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,680
 And then become a drug dealer.

417
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,280
 And then he became part of the problem.

418
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,560
 And every morning, as he walked back to his house.

419
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,320
 A pocket full of cash.

420
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,760
 The other pocket empty because there were huge, sweet drugs in it.

421
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,960
 He thought, "I couldn't be a symbol of hope.

422
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,360
 So I will be the problem.

423
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,920
 I will be the drug dealer.

424
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,040
 I will make money for me.

425
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,280
 Nothing else matters.

426
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,880
 Just me.

427
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,200
 How the mighty have fallen.

428
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,680
 From hero to zero.

429
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,000
 From Phoenix Jones, the superhero.

430
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,400
 To Benjamin...

431
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,600
 This is his real name.

432
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,440
 From Phoenix Jones.

433
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,440
 To Benjamin John Francis.

434
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:41,200
 From Benjamin John Francis Fodor.

435
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,120
 From the lofty superhero name of Phoenix Jones.

436
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,680
 To Man On Trial Benjamin John Francis Fodor.

437
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,600
 We can't choose fate.

438
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,240
 Some people are fated to be successful.

439
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,760
 Some people are fated to slip and fall on glass.

440
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,960
 But it's the things we do with what fate gives us.

441
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,080
 That either makes us a survivor.

442
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:10,560
 Or makes us become disillusioned, quit.

443
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:15,600
 And become the very thing you've always fought against.

444
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,400
 Which to me is the greatest tragedy of all.
