1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Can a deadly drug actually be a cure?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,320
 Then we travel to Greece to take a look at four different encounters with bizarre humanoids.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,160
 Are they ghosts, aliens, demons?

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,160
 Who knows?

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,760
 But you'll find out today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:29,960
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead.

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,360
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter, and I'm having a great day.

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,360
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,000
 Let's go ahead and get started with the episode.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,720
 First off, let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter, Eli Rack.

11
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,360
 Eli Rack, round of applause.

12
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,440
 Eli Rack doing a little bow over there.

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,560
 You are going to be our captain this episode.

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,000
 Whatever vehicles we take, you are going to be in charge of.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,480
 If you can't support the Patreon, totally understandable, just help me get the word out

16
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,800
 about the show.

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
 Spread it online.

18
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,280
 Spread it in person.

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,120
 Spread it as if it was a communicable disease.

20
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,400
 That also helps out a lot.

21
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,040
 But maybe don't use that as a, as if you're just coughing on people.

22
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,320
 "Dead Rabbit Radio."

23
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,320
 Maybe not that far.

24
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,520
 Eli Rack, let's go ahead.

25
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,480
 Let's start off in the Dead Rabbit Durgible.

26
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,760
 We're going to take a little flight.

27
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,760
 Across the nation, we're going to Stockton, California.

28
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,560
 Meth, capital of the world.

29
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,560
 Yes, yes, yes.

30
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,640
 It's another meth story.

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,600
 So just be prepared for lots of references to meth andphetamines.

32
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,040
 This one I actually found on Reddit.

33
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,640
 Like I always, I find all this stuff on Reddit because I go to the meth subreddit.

34
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,400
 It's a guilty pleasure of mine.

35
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,480
 I'm on the meth subreddit and there's a user named TeddyNobs, which this is why I go to

36
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,480
 the meth subreddit.

37
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:51,120
 Not because there's people named TeddyNobs, but this was popped upon on the meth subreddit.

38
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,040
 Tell me you cannot click on this.

39
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,520
 Here was the headline or post or whatever you call it.

40
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,800
 I honestly believe, okay, coming from a meth, from one meth addict to another.

41
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,320
 I honestly believe doing meth daily.

42
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,320
 Okay, you just can't be an occasional meth user.

43
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:14,600
 I honestly believe doing meth daily prevents you from catching COVID-19.

44
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
 Hear me out.

45
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,560
 Which I love how he adds that at the end because he obviously knows most people are like, "What?"

46
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,560
 He's like, "No, no, no, no, no.

47
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,560
 Hear me out."

48
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:30,400
 And he goes on to say that he doesn't know any tweakers who have COVID-19.

49
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,000
 So that's scientific proof right there, right?

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,880
 But he goes, he goes, "Listen, tweakers," which is, if you don't know, tweakers, someone

51
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,120
 who's super high on meth and they're working on cars, they're working on your car by stealing

52
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,120
 the stuff out of it.

53
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,120
 Come back here.

54
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,400
 He goes, "Listen, tweakers don't have any of the safety precautions that are put in place

55
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,560
 with COVID-19 stuff.

56
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,560
 We don't social distance."

57
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,840
 I mean, we pass a pipe around, right?

58
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,840
 That's the worst thing.

59
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,440
 We have this little pipe, we're smoking meth, and then I hand it to you and you're smoking

60
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,840
 my meth and stuff like that.

61
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,400
 We're hanging out, we're breaking into people's cars.

62
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,240
 He didn't say that breaking into people's cars thing and stuff, but you know what I

63
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,240
 mean.

64
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,480
 Basically, they're repairing starter engines at three in the morning and then someone tells

65
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,160
 them they found some springs in a dumpster.

66
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,960
 So you ride your bicycle because you can't have a car, because you took it apart, you

67
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,320
 ride your bicycle over to the dumpster and grab some springs because you'll want to need

68
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,800
 them for that project you're working on.

69
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,480
 That spring-powered car.

70
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,440
 Basically, there's no social distancing or anything like that.

71
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,000
 So at the end, then he goes, "Listen, if you know someone who has COVID-19 who's a daily

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,320
 user," see, it's again, not you tourists, not you people who just use it on the weekend,

73
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,840
 daily users only.

74
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,000
 If you know someone who smokes meth daily, who's got COVID-19, let me know.

75
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 He posts this and people start going, "You're an idiot."

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,600
 In the midst of people going, "Oh, no, no, no, I know people who smoke meth, but do they

77
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
 do it daily?"

78
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,120
 I would ask, but people would go, "I know people who smoke meth who've gotten COVID-19."

79
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,240
 In the midst of all of that, somebody posts an article.

80
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,840
 Meth may fight flu virus, steady suggests.

81
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,280
 This was from covid19data.com.

82
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,960
 It's written by Chino Contreras.

83
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,680
 Ellie Rack, let's take this dirgeable and leave behind Stockton, California.

84
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,800
 There's a couple bullet holes in it, so we got to get fast and got to refill it.

85
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
 We're headed out to Taiwan.

86
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,800
 We're going to land.

87
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,800
 We're going to put on our lab coats.

88
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,080
 We're going to walk into the National Health Research Institute in Taiwan.

89
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,520
 This was back in November 6th.

90
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,360
 They published the study, November 6th, 2019.

91
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,520
 This study does not speak specifically about COVID-19, but let's go in there and we see

92
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,360
 the scientists standing around and they're in their lab coats.

93
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,960
 There's a lump of lung cells.

94
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,240
 There's just a big old gross lump sitting on a table.

95
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,320
 Looks like a slab of meat and the scientists are like, "Are you ready for tests?"

96
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,320
 This is our first test.

97
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
 We don't have a number for it.

98
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,320
 They're like, "Yeah."

99
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,760
 They expose the lung cells to meth.

100
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,840
 I don't know how they did it.

101
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,720
 I don't know if they brought in Johnny and he walks in.

102
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,480
 He's like, "Hey guys, is it time?

103
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
 Is it time?

104
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,600
 I've been smoking meth anyways."

105
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,200
 They're like, "Oh man, you're not supposed to smoke yet."

106
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,520
 I don't know how they did it.

107
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,520
 He smokes in.

108
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,520
 He has this little meth pipe.

109
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,440
 He smokes it in.

110
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,920
 He smokes it all over the lung cells.

111
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,680
 To be fair, they can't get in the article.

112
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,680
 They said lung cells.

113
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,680
 I don't know if they had a clump of lung.

114
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,100
 I don't know if they had a human's lung just sitting there and a guy's blowing

115
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,280
 meth into it like he's playing the bagpipes.

116
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,800
 But let's just pretend.

117
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:36,400
 The fact of the matter is they exposed lung cells to influenza A and then they infused

118
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,560
 it with methamphetamine.

119
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,520
 Then 30 to 48 hours after the infection.

120
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,600
 So you've got the scientists sitting around calmly looking up the cells and then the meth

121
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,120
 dude's like all bumping into him.

122
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,600
 He's taking apart the laboratory.

123
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,840
 He's like, "Oh dude, you know how many cool things I can do with this microscope once

124
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,840
 I've taken it apart?"

125
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,880
 They're like, "Ah, we need that."

126
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:03,400
 They realized that the meth treated cells had a much lower concentration of the virus

127
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,200
 than the control group.

128
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:11,520
 What's more, this reduction occurred in dose dependent manner, meaning the more meth, the

129
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,360
 less the virus reproduced.

130
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,160
 What's interesting, so the doctors, they do see a correlation.

131
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,560
 So this guy actually is onto something.

132
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,480
 But they're saying, "We're not telling people to smoke meth.

133
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,240
 We're definitely not telling people to smoke meth daily."

134
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,680
 We're not saying that.

135
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,280
 But now scientists are starting to look at this and they go, "If we can take something

136
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:38,240
 that's structurally similar to meth, if we can take meth and modify it some way, take

137
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,520
 away the tweakiness, take away the damage, take away all the bad stuff, take something

138
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:50,800
 that's structurally similar to meth, we could actually prevent or possibly cure influenza

139
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
 A."

140
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,600
 So we're leaving behind Taiwan, Elirac.

141
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,720
 Let's go ahead and hop in the carbonicopter.

142
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,800
 The durgible has been stripped for parts at this point.

143
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,040
 Johnny's already completely dismantled it.

144
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,840
 There's just a balloon and a couple cinder blocks holding up the balloon.

145
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,840
 Everything else is gone.

146
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,840
 We're in the carbonicopter.

147
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,800
 Elirac, we're leaving behind Taiwan.

148
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,760
 We are headed out to good old Greece.

149
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,360
 Okay, Elirac, let's go ahead and put that carbonicopter in a holding pattern actually

150
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,040
 before we get to Greece because I'm going to give you guys a little meta commentary here,

151
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,680
 a little behind the scenes thing.

152
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,040
 This is 10 hours later I'm recording this part.

153
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,960
 I did this thing about humanoids in Greece.

154
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,080
 We're still going to do that segment because I think it's interesting.

155
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,960
 But originally it was an interactive adventure.

156
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,880
 It was horrible.

157
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,280
 I recorded the whole thing.

158
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,880
 It was bad.

159
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,160
 It was funny.

160
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,480
 I had a good time recording it, but it's really, really bad.

161
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,480
 What's interesting and this is my tip to you for you artists out there.

162
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,620
 You always want to do your best obviously, but you're never always going to do your best.

163
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,760
 And I can get, whoa, that was like the best episode I've recorded.

164
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,760
 That's great.

165
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,760
 My first 50 episodes, there's some stinkers in there because I didn't know what made a

166
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,000
 good Dead Rabbit Radio episode.

167
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,200
 The key to actually like being an artist, not a lot of people talk about this.

168
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,520
 The key to being an artist isn't always about putting out the best material.

169
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,560
 It's about knowing when you've sucked, knowing when you've missed the target, knowing when

170
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,280
 it's bad.

171
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,280
 It's weird.

172
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,180
 You want to do your best obviously, but every time you sit down with a pen and paper to

173
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,500
 write a story or to start drawing a picture or to make music, it's not always about putting

174
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,260
 out the best product possible.

175
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,700
 It's about the craft.

176
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,300
 It's about creating product.

177
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,220
 There's artists who just dream and dream and dream and never do anything.

178
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:53,880
 There's artists who labor so long trying to get the single best novel they can that they

179
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,900
 never get past the world building phase.

180
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,200
 They've written stuff down, but nothing as a narrative.

181
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,260
 Or they start writing stuff and then they rewrite that first chapter, start writing

182
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,780
 stuff, rewriting the first chapter.

183
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:07,580
 It's not until you start actually putting out books, putting out stories, releasing

184
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,640
 artwork to the public that you can start to go, "This is a good picture.

185
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,580
 This is a bad picture."

186
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,820
 It's part of that craft.

187
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,820
 Kanye West.

188
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:20,500
 Kanye West famously said, someone asked him about being a producer.

189
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:27,080
 He says, "Make three beats a day every day for three summers."

190
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,080
 That's how you become a great producer.

191
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,080
 It's about the craft.

192
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,560
 It's about building things.

193
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,120
 If he just labored over the same beat over and over again or the same 10 beats or 20 beats

194
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,320
 or whatever over and over and over again trying to perfect them, you have to build body of

195
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,320
 work.

196
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,800
 That's my motivation to you guys out there.

197
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,840
 And also to let you know why I'm so much more subdued as I'm recording this part at

198
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,700
 9.30 at night.

199
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,980
 It's not always about creating the best single thing.

200
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:59,700
 It's about working your craft over time, releasing stuff, releasing stuff and realizing what

201
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,740
 works and what doesn't.

202
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,540
 That is a not often things that about art.

203
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,620
 And I think a lot of people just don't do that.

204
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,380
 They just tinker, tinker, tinker on something for a long time.

205
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,060
 Like I am with this introduction.

206
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:18,100
 But I wanted to share that with you guys because I know a lot of you guys struggle with that.

207
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,880
 Eli Rack, let's come out of that holding pattern.

208
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,400
 We are headed finally to Greece.

209
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,080
 Second time for me today.

210
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,320
 First time for you.

211
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,560
 First off, let's head back to the year 83 BC.

212
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,960
 Helicopters flying over.

213
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,800
 There's like pantheons and stuff.

214
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,880
 Big old marble pillars in the middle of nowhere.

215
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,200
 Yeah, we're like going in between them.

216
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,760
 Nice flying Eli Rack.

217
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,080
 We look back, there's rubble everywhere.

218
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,080
 Not so nice flying.

219
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,460
 But we are going to meet a dude named General Sola.

220
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,820
 And he's like, has his army and stuff like that.

221
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,860
 He's marching on Rome.

222
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:59,100
 Second time, by the way, he originally took control of Rome, established himself as the

223
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,980
 ruler and everyone's like, "Oh yeah dude, hey why don't you go out and fight that war

224
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,980
 dude?"

225
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:08,580
 And like us, the senate, we will make sure nothing bad happens.

226
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,100
 And he's like, "Ah."

227
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,780
 The way everyone's eyes is shifting back and forth at the same time makes me a little

228
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,780
 suspicious.

229
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:19,600
 But he ends up going, taking his army out to Asia Minor, which I believe is Turkey

230
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
 nowadays.

231
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,920
 Anyways, it obviously, he gets overthrown while he's gone.

232
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,440
 The senate's like, "Yeah, we don't like that guy.

233
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,440
 We totally lied to him."

234
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,800
 They take back over to him and he's like, "Oh great, so now he has to walk all the way

235
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,600
 back to Rome to show him who's boss."

236
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,280
 And he eventually does, but before he does, he's actually moving with his troops through

237
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,440
 a place in Albania called Dyratc.

238
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,580
 That's apparently the modern place where it's at is Dyratc, and originally was the

239
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:52,420
 Illyrian Apollonia, which I believe was one of Prince's backup singers that are, "This

240
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,500
 is better than the original version!

241
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,380
 This is better than the original version!"

242
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:02,460
 As General Sola is moving with his troops, according to a dude named Plutarch, he was

243
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:07,900
 like a historian, old-timey historian and stuff like that, he says that he heard a story.

244
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,340
 That's how history was back in the day.

245
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,960
 You just heard stories from people.

246
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,320
 Someone was like, "Hey, you won't believe it.

247
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,320
 I was out doing this stuff with General Sola and this happened."

248
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,920
 And Plutarch goes, "That is going to go great on my blog."

249
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,360
 Plutarch tells the story as General Sola was moving through the area in Albania.

250
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,120
 They're walking through this place, it's just nothing but all green trees and meadows and

251
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,960
 stuff like that, aka everything back then, right?

252
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,040
 You either had a small town, everything else was untouched of urgent nature.

253
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,740
 But anyways, so he's moving his troops through this area and General Sola is sitting there

254
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:45,300
 with his leaders and stuff like that and they're trying to figure out battle maneuvers and these

255
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,100
 soldiers run up, they're all sweaty because they've been running because they don't have

256
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,100
 cars.

257
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,500
 Everyone sweats because they're constantly running.

258
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,860
 They're like, "General Sola, General Sola, you won't believe what we found."

259
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,980
 And he's like, "This better be important."

260
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:03,380
 And so he walks out of his tent and he sees this sader being restrained by his men.

261
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:09,720
 "General Sola is like, "You're right, I do need to see this.

262
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,720
 This is quite interesting."

263
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,920
 You remember that movie Hercules?

264
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,040
 This is the best example I can think of.

265
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,360
 Remember Danny DeVito and Hercules?

266
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,360
 That's a sader.

267
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:24,320
 It's like this little dude, he had generally had horns on his head and then he had horse

268
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,640
 legs to be specific.

269
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,000
 And this guy, they're holding him and General Sola is like, "Hmm, the beast.

270
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,200
 I've seen this beast before."

271
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:37,340
 He actually said, Plutarch actually says, "This sader looked like what you would see

272
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,660
 a statue of."

273
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:46,000
 He actually wrote this, said, "Here they say a sader, such as statuaries and painters represent,

274
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,820
 was caught asleep and brought before Sola."

275
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,260
 Sometimes his names use this Sola, but I've seen Sully, I've seen all different names

276
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,700
 for this dude, but...

277
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,160
 So Plutarch's saying, "This is exactly what you would think of.

278
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,440
 This was a little Danny DeVito goat man that they have in front of him."

279
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,520
 And General Sola's first thinking, he doesn't say this out loud, I wonder what he tastes

280
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,520
 like.

281
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,920
 I wonder if this man creature is delicious, but he shakes the idea from his head.

282
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,400
 He's not a barbarian, although he is a little curious.

283
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,960
 Little man, horse legs, little horns on his head.

284
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,320
 General Sola's like, begins to question this creature, like, "Where are you from?

285
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,800
 How delicious are you?

286
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,000
 What spices do you think would work best on your legs?

287
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,840
 No matter what, soldiers are like, "What is going on?"

288
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:35,680
 No matter what questions Plutarch asks this guy, he's just not responding.

289
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,400
 He's giving off these grunts and these growls and all sorts of stuff.

290
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:45,040
 And eventually Sola, as much as he is mystified by this whole thing and a little hungry, he

291
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,240
 thinks this is a bad omen.

292
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,560
 One, I'm not getting any information from this guy.

293
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,720
 Like, it's not like this guy can actually have a conversation.

294
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,280
 Two, this is a creature from beyond the veil.

295
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:59,520
 Like, basically, I'm getting ready to march on Rome and talking to this goat, horse, whatever

296
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:05,520
 he is, man, with little hooves, little legs, little hooves, is probably not a good thing.

297
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,880
 So he bade his soldiers to just let it go.

298
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,280
 And he's like, "Let it go into my kitchen."

299
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,960
 And they're like, "Oh, that's weird."

300
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,320
 And then they have like a giant pot boiling.

301
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,960
 But that's not what happens as far as we know.

302
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,960
 They just let it go.

303
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,160
 And it's funny because you read that and you're thinking, "Who nowadays, like, imagine General

304
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,160
 Schwarzkopf?"

305
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:29,040
 And he's like going into Iraq during Desert Storm because I'm a boomer and that's my reference.

306
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,320
 General Schwarzkopf is like, "We're moving troops through here and then like, we'll move

307
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,320
 a tank over here."

308
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,240
 And they're like, "Sir, sir, sir, look what we found."

309
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,000
 And it's like a goat man, right?

310
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,560
 I don't even have to make up another creature.

311
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,760
 It's just a plain old sader.

312
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,360
 General Schwarzkopf would be like, "Call the Pentagon."

313
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,360
 And they would like put him in a Pentagon.

314
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,960
 The Pentagon's like, "Hmm, I wonder what this guy tastes like."

315
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,360
 They're running taste analysis on him.

316
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,720
 And back then, one, if you captured him, you'd have to like take care of him and stuff like

317
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,720
 that.

318
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,720
 And then if he died, maybe it's a curse.

319
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,720
 It's an omen.

320
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,720
 They let him go.

321
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:03,440
 So an interesting story, an interesting sighting of basically what would be encrypted nowadays.

322
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,760
 Back then you could say with some sort of like nature spirit or things like that.

323
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,440
 But let's take a closer look at this story.

324
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,200
 In the early, early versions of the Sader myth, they had horse legs and horse tails

325
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,920
 and then the upper body of a human, little horns on their head.

326
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:25,280
 But by the 6th century BC, the legend had actually changed.

327
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,720
 So even though Plutarch says this looks like you would see on the statues and you'd see

328
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:35,120
 in the paintings, we don't know if he's talking about the paintings for before Solas time.

329
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,640
 Because remember, Solas make in this March in 83 BC.

330
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:44,400
 So for the past 500 years, a Sader was described as something different.

331
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,280
 The top half's the man.

332
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,720
 The bottom half is a man as well.

333
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,920
 The point is regular human legs.

334
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:57,160
 By his time period, Saders were described as just being all human but covered in hair,

335
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,880
 bigfoot maybe, covered in hair.

336
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,920
 Horse tails, tail of a horse, that's still weird.

337
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,360
 And super ugly, which I guess is kind of implied with the horse tail coming out of you and

338
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,920
 covered in hair.

339
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:13,840
 Super ugly, big naked dude, giant horse sized boner.

340
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,400
 So this is what's interesting.

341
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,240
 The story says he captured a Sader and we're like, oh that's interesting.

342
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:25,200
 But what he probably really found was a fully erect, ugly, hairy man in the middle of nowhere.

343
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:31,360
 It's possible that he actually saw an ancient looking Sader from the old, old periods.

344
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,520
 And that's what he saw.

345
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,000
 Or he just saw an ugly, naked man with a big boner in the middle of the woods.

346
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,480
 We don't know, but this is historical record, really.

347
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,720
 About as close as to historical record as you could get back then.

348
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,760
 There's always these weird little tidbits in the middle of these stories and you're

349
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,760
 like, what?

350
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,600
 Because it's all about him marching on Rome and someone would be like some dusty historian.

351
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,160
 Historians not dusty.

352
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,520
 A clean historian going through a dusty book, reading about Roman history would be like,

353
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,520
 what?

354
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,360
 Kind of naked dude with a big boner in the middle of nowhere.

355
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,800
 Are you trying to eat him?

356
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,800
 Oh, that's weird.

357
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,720
 And then you just go on to the next paragraph because it's just too weird for those nerds

358
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
 to comprehend.

359
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,320
 Ellie Rack, let's go ahead.

360
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,320
 We're taking that carbonic copter.

361
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,440
 We're going a little bit farther in time.

362
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,480
 We're going to go to the period of time before World War II.

363
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,880
 Shortly before World War II.

364
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,200
 Technically, that story was pre-World War II, but you know what I mean.

365
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,200
 We're going to a place called Pentilichen Mountain in Attica.

366
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,760
 A bunch of people in Greece just shook their head.

367
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,320
 That's not how you pronounce it, bro.

368
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:35,280
 But before World War II, there was a woman walking down this mountain pass and there's

369
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,040
 this old, spooky house.

370
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,320
 The house is known as the Planktacea Palace.

371
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,320
 It's still around.

372
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,760
 Apparently it was just an old house.

373
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,360
 At this time, it was abandoned.

374
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,000
 This woman's walking down the road and we're going to be walking down the road as well.

375
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,400
 We're walking down the road.

376
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,640
 Streets as dusty as a researcher.

377
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,920
 As this woman's walking down the road, a little 10-year-old girl is coming the opposite direction.

378
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,640
 She's not singing a creepy song.

379
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,280
 She's walking down the street, right?

380
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,720
 She's walking down the street, but this is kind of in the middle of nowhere.

381
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,960
 So the woman's like, "Hmm, interesting.

382
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,360
 That girl must be lost."

383
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:11,240
 But before she can really comprehend what's going on, the little girl starts to...

384
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,240
 change.

385
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,520
 Her hair begins to start standing up straight.

386
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,800
 Almost like a magnet is being brought over her head and her hair is metal.

387
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,800
 Because otherwise a magnet wouldn't do anything.

388
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,680
 Her hair starts standing up straight.

389
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,880
 Ding!

390
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,480
 And now she looks like kid.

391
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,480
 Kid in play.

392
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,720
 She already is a kid.

393
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,000
 So her hair standing up straight and the woman's staring at this little 10-year-old girl.

394
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,440
 Now as the girl is walking, she's still walking.

395
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,440
 That doesn't deter her.

396
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,480
 She's like, "I don't care how straight my hair is.

397
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,480
 I'm going to keep on walking.

398
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,520
 Nothing's going to stop my locomotion."

399
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,400
 But once she crosses the path, so the woman's walking out one side of the road and the little

400
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,520
 girl's walking towards her, the house is in between them.

401
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:59,360
 And then as she's getting closer to the woman, she gets sucked into the house.

402
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,840
 Now the woman obviously does not go after the girl.

403
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,760
 She's not like, "I'll save you."

404
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,760
 She beats feet.

405
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,560
 Because what would you do in that case?

406
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,840
 The question is this.

407
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,920
 Was that girl real?

408
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,120
 There's a couple different ways we can look at it.

409
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,240
 We can look at it.

410
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,080
 If the girl was real, she probably should have went to go find her.

411
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,080
 But it's possible the girl was real.

412
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,080
 She's walking on the street.

413
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,720
 Her hair sticks straight up and she gets sucked into the house.

414
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,640
 She's now a prisoner of Plaintasia Palace.

415
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,480
 And she can never get rescued because no one can pronounce the name of that house if that

416
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:37,800
 woman goes, "Oh, oh, I just ran into a horrible thing at Plaintasia Palace up in the Pentechalean

417
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
 Mountain."

418
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,760
 The authorities are like, "Those places don't exist, ma'am.

419
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,360
 That's not how you pronounce anything in Greece.

420
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,360
 We won't be able to help you."

421
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,360
 And the woman's like, "No, it's possible."

422
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,080
 Or here's an even creepier scenario.

423
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,080
 I don't know.

424
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,920
 The girl getting sucked into the house is kind of creepy.

425
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,360
 Ghost activity, right?

426
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,480
 And this ghost is actually trying to escape the house.

427
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,640
 Every day it's getting a little bit farther out.

428
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,640
 Maybe not every day.

429
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,480
 Because then she eventually should be in downtown Athens.

430
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,640
 But she's constantly, this little girl is trying to escape the grip of the house and

431
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,280
 she's getting farther and farther away.

432
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:17,320
 But whenever she passes a certain threshold, she gets sucked back into the house.

433
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,320
 You can live there now.

434
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,360
 I actually think people live in that house.

435
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,920
 It is a real place that you can visit.

436
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:27,680
 So if you decide to go visit this place, first off, I would recommend learning how to renounce

437
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,680
 it.

438
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,760
 The locals will not take kindly to you if you're calling it whatever I called it.

439
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,200
 Secondly, I shave your head before you visit because you never know.

440
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,800
 You know that's a bad idea because you'd want your hair to stand up that way you would

441
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,520
 know you were about to get abducted into a house.

442
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,440
 Let's go ahead and move on to the next one.

443
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,640
 Eli Rack is flying the helicopter away.

444
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,120
 Let's move on to this other place in Greece that I don't have a name for.

445
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,080
 Eli Rack is like, "It's June 24th, 2001.

446
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,240
 It's 1.50 a.m."

447
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,680
 There's a university professor who's sitting at home.

448
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,360
 He's the only one up at this time and he's watching some television.

449
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,960
 Now this college professor goes by the initials GP.

450
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,800
 He'd actually had two previous encounters with the paranormal.

451
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:18,720
 Once in 1974, a woman comes knocking on his door and asks him for money.

452
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,440
 He's like, "Well, it's kind of weird, but yeah, sure mate."

453
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,320
 And before he can finish his sentence, she vanishes into thin air.

454
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,560
 And he's like, "Well, that's a relief because I didn't really want to give her any money."

455
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:34,320
 Also, in 1986, he was right.

456
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,160
 He's riding a bus through town.

457
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,000
 And he sees his mother-in-law on the bus.

458
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,520
 That's not the weird part.

459
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,240
 His mother-in-law was dead.

460
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,240
 Not like...

461
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,040
 Okay, it's not like she was a corpse on the bus.

462
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,920
 And he's like, "Someone should do something about that.

463
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,440
 Probably me because this corpse is sitting next to me."

464
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,280
 Let me rephrase that.

465
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,360
 So what 500 episodes does to you?

466
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,600
 His mother-in-law had been dead before.

467
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,960
 She'd already died.

468
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,080
 And so was his ghost on the bus.

469
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:12,120
 And he said, "Not only did I see my dead mother-in-law on the bus as a ghost, again, not as a corpse,

470
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,560
 but she was there for five minutes.

471
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,920
 It was on a fleeting glimpse.

472
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,880
 He was looking at this ghost for five minutes, which is an extremely long time for paranormal

473
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,880
 activity."

474
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,120
 So June 24th, 2001, GP is watching television.

475
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,760
 His wife and his son are sleeping in their respective bedrooms.

476
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,440
 And his daughter is not home.

477
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,240
 So her bedroom was unoccupied at this time.

478
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,880
 And he's sitting there and he's watching television.

479
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,000
 And then he's like, "Yeah, television's done.

480
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Click.

481
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 Shut it off."

482
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,200
 And he starts doing that routine.

483
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,520
 We all do is we're going to bed.

484
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,440
 You know, you kind of get up, make sure everything's shut off.

485
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,480
 He's walking around his house.

486
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,320
 He realizes the kitchen light is on.

487
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:52,320
 He walks into the kitchen, shuts the light off, and he goes, "He instantly feels a cold

488
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,560
 chill crawl over his skin."

489
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:02,040
 He turns around and he sees this almost indescribable thing.

490
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,040
 It's six foot two.

491
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,200
 And he sees that all of its limbs are very lanky.

492
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:13,120
 He sees a face devoid of any facial features, but where the eyes, the nose, the mouth should

493
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,400
 be, there were just bumps.

494
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,560
 He said it looked like computer graphic.

495
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:25,560
 It looked like it was artificial, not artificial in the sense of it being robotic or plastic,

496
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,920
 but artificial in the sense that it doesn't belong in our reality.

497
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,560
 Everything mimicking our reality.

498
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,840
 Trying to get a human face, trying to get a human body, but failing at it.

499
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,800
 The limbs were too long.

500
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:44,760
 The face knew where the features should be, but couldn't generate them.

501
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,520
 It's standing there in the kitchen with him now.

502
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,640
 Lights are off and he sees this thing standing there.

503
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,840
 And then it begins to move.

504
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,880
 But even that seemed like a mimicry of human movement.

505
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:03,440
 He said it moved in large leaps, but it was in slow motion, like an athlete jumping a

506
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,160
 hurdle but painfully slow.

507
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,160
 The feet wouldn't touch the ground.

508
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,760
 There was no noise as this was going on.

509
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,600
 Right before the foot should touch the ground, it simply leaped again.

510
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:19,120
 He watches it jump out of the kitchen and go into the bathroom.

511
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:25,120
 The GP immediately follows it, goes in the bathroom, throws the light on, it's gone.

512
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:31,040
 He turns around and sees that his daughter's bedroom door is open.

513
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:37,920
 And this creature leaps out of his daughter's bedroom, slowly jumping, silently, back into

514
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,320
 the kitchen.

515
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,040
 He goes into the kitchen.

516
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,440
 It's empty.

517
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:48,120
 He turns and now it's jumping out of the bathroom, jumping through the house.

518
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,740
 It leaps into the middle of the living room and completely disappears.

519
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,040
 The whole encounter, he says, took about 30 seconds.

520
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,760
 He's just watching this thing bound around his house.

521
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,920
 This was very, very interesting.

522
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:08,600
 GP said he got the impression that the creature was running from something.

523
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:14,240
 He felt like the creature was hunted by something and wanted to avoid any contact.

524
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,360
 So while this man is sitting in his house and he's watching this truly alien phenomenon

525
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,120
 happen, he's not really scared.

526
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,580
 And he senses fear from this creature.

527
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:27,340
 Not afraid of him, but afraid of something.

528
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,900
 They didn't belong in this man's house.

529
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,260
 It didn't belong on this planet.

530
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:38,340
 So if tonight, when you sit at home, maybe you're reading a book, maybe you're watching

531
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:43,820
 television, maybe you're just lounging about listening to your favorite podcast, when it's

532
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:48,620
 time for you to go to bed, you're gonna get up, do your little ritual, make sure your

533
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,500
 lights are shut off.

534
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:55,960
 But when you shut off that last light, don't turn around.

535
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,560
 You may feel that cold wind on your skin, but don't turn around.

536
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:05,840
 You may feel those eyes that aren't quite eyes staring at your direction, but don't

537
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,800
 turn around.

538
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:14,000
 Because even though GP had a bizarre experience and was able to report it to us, there's a

539
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,320
 chance that this is more than just a one-off thing.

540
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,020
 This thing was being pursued by something.

541
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,860
 It was in fear of its life.

542
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,180
 And it got away.

543
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:35,180
 But who's to say that the next time this lanky, featureless creature appears behind you?

544
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:39,860
 That the predator chasing it won't appear as well.

545
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:48,380
 If you turn around and look, you may become a participant in this ghastly game of tag.

546
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:54,320
 You may find yourself not retelling the story to appear in some weird podcast.

547
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:01,720
 You may find yourself waking up in a world that you don't recognize with no eyes, no

548
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:08,560
 mouth, and a predator right behind you.

549
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,400
