00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
 your soulmate may be living in Brazil, although she's currently a headless horse.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:15,520
 And then we take a look at what happens when a love of horror movies collides with real life

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,960
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:28,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,720
 Carvener. I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too. So we got some cool

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,360
 stuff to cover today, so we're just gonna go ahead and slide right into this. First off,

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:45,360
 we're going to... So first off, we're taking a trip to Brazil. Sunny, sunny Brazil. Home of the

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,360
 Brazil nut and was featured in a documentary called Brazil about an office worker who becomes an

9
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,120
 angel. I don't know, never saw the movie, just saw the cover. But anyways, that's all I know about

10
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,360
 Brazil. And they have a UFO problem. We've documented that in other episodes, but in this episode

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:09,600
 we're going to Brazil specifically to meet Mula Sem Cabaca. Mula Sem Cabaca. Fluent in Spanish.

12
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,520
 Oh wait, no, is that Portuguese? Which one's the Portuguese country? I think that's Brazil.

13
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:22,640
 Anyways, and Portugal. But, or in English, the headless mule. Dun, dun, dun. Now, generally

14
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,440
 animals that have their heads chopped off aren't threatening because they're dead. But this one is,

15
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,040
 and you're thinking, oh okay, it's just going to be a headless horse running through the fields

16
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,520
 of Brazil. But don't jump to conclusions because this is far, far more than just your average

17
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,480
 headless horse. There's three types of headless horses. There's ones that are just dead in some

18
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,360
 sort of slaughterhouse. Those are the sad ones. There are ghost headless horses, which those aren't

19
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,120
 very interesting because again, they're just a horse. I guess it's more interesting than a

20
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,440
 dead headless, I don't know why I keep calling it a headless horse actually. It's a headless mule,

21
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:02,480
 which is when a horse and a donkey have sex and oddly enough, a mule can't have offspring itself.

22
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:08,720
 I learned that from an Isaac Osmob novel. The headless mule, not horse, headless mule is this

23
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,960
 creature that lives in Brazil. But it's more, it's so much more, it's so much more than that.

24
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,960
 This is its origin story. Apparently there's a lot of them because they had a serious problem

25
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,560
 with this in Brazil at some point. Back in the past, there was a beautiful young woman who fell

26
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,520
 in love with a priest, which you're not supposed to do that. Rule number one, never fall in love.

27
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,240
 But she didn't listen to rule number one. She fell in love with a priest and she actually is able to

28
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:38,960
 use her witchy woman powers to seduce this man of the cloth and they have sex. And all of a sudden,

29
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,360
 she's like, "Oh no, I did something totally wrong." What's funny is that so her, what happens is she

30
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,600
 runs out into the forest or the jungle, whatever's down there, or both, I'm not entirely for sure,

31
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:55,920
 but she runs off into the foliage of Brazil and her body, like her bones, start breaking and her

32
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,960
 legs grow long and she's like, "Oh, that's not good." And then her arms are getting long too and her

33
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,440
 fingers, her perfectly manicured fingers are turning into gnarly horse hooves and she's like,

34
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,960
 "I thought I was a mule, gnarly mule hooves." She's like, "That's better." And she realizes she's

35
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,640
 not running now, she's galloping, her clothes are ripping off, her body, she's swelling up,

36
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,520
 her bones are getting thicker. She's like, "Uh, this is not the normal, this isn't that time of the

37
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:27,280
 month. I don't normally don't bloat around now." And she realizes that's her voice, she's nane,

38
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:36,560
 because she's turning into a mule and then her head falls off and flames shoot out of the stump

39
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,320
 of where her head used to be and she gallops off into the night air. Oh, and for people who have

40
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,160
 a weird fetish, also a tail pops out of her butthole. So I mean, I don't know if you're into that

41
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,560
 thing, if I don't know if there's any bronies going on, but if there are, you have a beautiful maiden

42
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:57,360
 who's turned into a mule, which to me, the word mule is far less sexy than the word horse. I guess

43
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,200
 it's kind of the same thing, but if someone was like, "Hey man, I'm dating someone," I'm like, "Really?"

44
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,920
 They're like, "Yeah, but she kind of looks like a horse." I'd be like, "Ugh." But if that same person

45
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,200
 says, "I'm dating someone," I go, "Really?" And they're like, "Yeah, she kind of looks like a mule."

46
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:17,360
 I'm going to be like, "That's, you break up with her right now. You can date the horse chick, date the

47
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,160
 horse chick." But if she looks like a mule, that's a stage too far. Does she look like a headless

48
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,480
 mule or are there flames shooting out of her neck? He looks down to the floor, he's like, "No." And I'm

49
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,640
 like, "Yeah, you just got to break up with her." So anyways, she turns into this headless mule,

50
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:35,280
 but for all intents and purposes, it's a horse. It's a galloping thing. But what I find funny

51
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,480
 about that whole story is nothing happens to the priest. The priest who made an oath to God

52
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:47,760
 to never have sex, to take a vow of celibacy, bangs this chick and then she jumps out of bed

53
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,160
 and starts transforming it into this hell beast. He just goes back to like, reading the Bible.

54
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,840
 He's like, "Oh yeah, I forgot, headless mule. Shouldn't have done that." There's a bunch of headless

55
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,520
 mules running around his yard. He's like, "I should probably stop banging all those peasant girls."

56
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,800
 So this mule, this flaming headless mule is running around. Despite its lack of a head,

57
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,800
 it makes a lot of noise. It nays really loudly and like totally like, scares you. A lot of times,

58
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,880
 it also moan like a woman is the description given. I'm like, "Okay, that's oddly sexual."

59
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,680
 But so it can both nay really loudly. It can moan like a woman. And I keep saying loudly because

60
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,440
 one of its key characteristics is how loud it is. It's almost deafening. You can hear it from miles

61
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,800
 away. When it's getting closer to you, it's getting louder and louder and louder. That sounds

62
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,920
 sound normally words. Its horseshoes themselves are made of like iron and they're very loud. It

63
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,800
 sounds like giant drums are just bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump bump

64
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,880
 as it's running towards you. So there's almost no way you don't know this thing's coming at you.

65
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,280
 But there are people out there who don't want to avoid this hellish creature because it will kill

66
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,160
 you. It can stop you to death and get mad. It can shoot flames out of its neck at you, set you on

67
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:05,120
 fire. But in where its mouth should be is a bridle. There's like a red hot metal bridle.

68
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:12,000
 Bridal's a little thing that goes in the horse's mouth. In this case, a mule's mouth. So this legend

69
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,800
 is akin to a werewolf where during the day she is a normal woman but at night transforms into an

70
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,920
 extremely loud beast who can trample you to death. I.e. just like she's your wife. And she will destroy

71
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:31,280
 anything in its path. This horse is just a ramp. This mule is just a rampaging beast will destroy

72
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:38,000
 anything in its path. And the one thing that attracts it more than anything is shiny things.

73
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,600
 So if you have like a little gold nugget on your mouth, I don't know why you do that. You just

74
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,520
 spit in gold nuggets everywhere. It'll come after you. But let's say you don't have any metal on

75
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,880
 you, anything shiny. Your fingernails and teeth are shiny enough. If it sees those, it'll come

76
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,280
 towards you and try to trample you to death. You have to lay down on the ground face first,

77
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,720
 cover up your pearly whites, cover up your fingernails. You'll just look like a lump

78
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,040
 in dirt and the horse will walk past you. Now that's the advice they give you. I'm a little

79
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:12,080
 iffy on it because one, laying down in front of a demonic mule is never a good idea. I'd rather

80
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,600
 take my chances running and the chance that it may see one of my fingernails than laying down on a

81
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:23,120
 dirt road where a fiery mule is headed towards me. They're saying the reason why this trick works,

82
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,120
 because it doesn't have good eyesight, which is kind of a given because its head is gone. It

83
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,320
 shouldn't have any eyesight at all, but apparently it's able to see shiny things and come after them.

84
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:38,720
 But during the day, it's a normal woman. It's like a werewolf-esque curse with these things.

85
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:45,120
 So the problem is, is that she can go about her daily life, but as the sun starts to set,

86
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,040
 she's going to go through that horrible changing process again. She's going to feel her bones

87
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:54,160
 break and her body weight shift and all that stuff. There's a bunch of fetishists sitting in the

88
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,760
 village eating popcorn. They're like, "Oh, this is a real good part." Some of the tail pops out of

89
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,880
 her butt. Everyone's like, "Yeah, yeah." So anyway, she turns into this monster every night. But if you

90
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:08,480
 are looking for love, gentlemen, if you are looking for love, there is a way to tame this beast's heart

91
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:14,720
 and get a little something, something for yourself. See, there's a couple of different ways to cure it.

92
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:21,200
 You can take a needle and when they're in mule form, you poke them and they'll start bleeding.

93
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:28,000
 Obviously, that's what needles tend to do. Or you can tie her to a cross. Now, when I read that,

94
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,680
 I realized that one of the most curculean tasks that could ever be undertaken would be tying a

95
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:42,480
 horse to a cross. I just don't think their body works that way. But if you can somehow take a mule

96
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:48,560
 and tie it in the form of a cross, you can cure this thing. But it has to be done where the sin

97
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,040
 was committed. Answer, basically in the priest's bedroom, you're like, "Hey, sorry, sir, here.

98
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,480
 We're wrecking this giant cross in there." He's like, "I already got like 10 of those." He's like,

99
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,080
 "Yeah, but this one's specifically horse-designed." And he's like, "Oh, great." And then he sees you

100
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,120
 leading this headless mule and he's like, "Hey, Betty, you can do that, but she will only be cured

101
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,160
 for that night." So it's pretty useless. So I don't even know why they came up with that part of the

102
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,640
 legend. They're like, "Yeah, we have a way to cure you, but it'll only last for eight to ten hours."

103
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,880
 If you really want to cure this woman, what you have to do is you have to reach in and grab the

104
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:27,520
 hot bridle from, is it bridle or brittle? You have to reach in and grab the what the, the, the, the,

105
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,720
 the, you have to reach in and grab the metal mouth thing from where the mule's head would be. And

106
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,880
 it's red hot. It's super, super hot. Maybe white hot even. But you have to grab it and take it off.

107
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,200
 If you do, this is your reward. This is a quote from the website where I got this information.

108
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:49,600
 "Removeal of the curse is a great relief for the woman because the curse includes many trials."

109
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,280
 I'm assuming that's the horrible shapeshifting pain that happens every night. And probably just,

110
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,480
 you'd probably get tired because you'd be running around Brazil every single night and then you

111
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,360
 got to go home and like do dishes. Sorry, let me go back. "Removeal of the curse is a great relief

112
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,480
 for the woman because the curse includes many trials. So the grateful woman will usually repent

113
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:15,600
 her sins and marry the benefactor." So you can find the woman of your dreams by removing this red

114
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,600
 hot bridle from this creature's mouth and she turns back into a woman and says, "Thank you.

115
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,400
 So many trials. My legs hurt. I have been able to poop because there's a tail sticking out my

116
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:30,560
 butthole. It's been an awful, awful couple years. Let's get married." So you do get that. However,

117
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:37,680
 I do like that they included the word usually. Usually. So imagine a man chasing down this

118
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:44,160
 haunted mule looking for love and he finally is able to trick it. He covers up everything shiny

119
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,760
 in his pocket. He's a goth teen so his fingernails are already all black. That's not a giveaway.

120
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:56,000
 He just wears a mask over his face. A goth mask. And anyway, so he is able to take down the headless

121
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,560
 mule, pull the bridle out of the mouth and she looks at him and goes, "Thank you. Thank you,

122
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:08,800
 good gothic traveler. But you're like a brother to me and I can't imagine you not being there for me.

123
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,320
 I'm gonna go back to town. I'm gonna go talk to that priest again. I think the idea of getting

124
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,640
 friend-zoned by a cryptid might be the worst possible outcome ever. If you and your buddies

125
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:27,280
 got kidnapped by bigfoots and your buddy gets dragged off and becomes like they're breeding,

126
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:32,560
 starts impregnating all the female bigfoots and you just get to watch, that might honestly be the

127
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:38,240
 most humiliating fate ever. I mean, if me and my buddy both got abducted by aliens and he's the

128
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,400
 only one getting anal probed, I'm gonna feel a little left out. I'm gonna feel like it's me.

129
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:49,840
 I'm gonna feel like I'm not good enough for them. Getting friend-zoned by aliens or ghosts or cryptids

130
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:54,320
 might actually be the worst thing that anyone will ever have put on their tombstone. So you go

131
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,200
 through this whole process. You grab the hot bridal out and she just walks away. It goes finds a

132
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,720
 hot young man. Get it? Hot? Actually, I didn't plan that fun. She goes into town. She finds some hot

133
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:11,520
 dude and you're stuck there with horrible burns on your hands. But before you go, Jason, that's

134
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:17,840
 worth the risk. I am willing to burn my hands. I'm willing to get friend-zoned by a Brazilian cryptid.

135
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:23,760
 Let me tell you a little bit of what happens after she turns back into a human. She's totally naked.

136
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,560
 Yeah, Jason, you didn't even have to tell me that part. I assumed all of her clothes ripped off.

137
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:37,280
 She's sweaty? Yeah, double good. Double, double good. Got this naked, sweaty woman standing

138
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:42,640
 in the middle of the Brazilian jungle or forest, whatever's out there. It's just me, her, and the

139
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:48,400
 horrible scars and burns I have all over my hands and wrists. She's naked, she's sweaty. She also

140
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:55,360
 smells of sulfur. That might be the biggest boner killer of all time. I can't imagine

141
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:01,840
 finally meeting Brittany Spears and her smelling like rotten eggs. She could have B.O. She could smell

142
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:10,160
 bad, but if she actually smelt like hell, sorry, Brittany. Sorry. Not still do her, but the point

143
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,520
 is, is that you would really have to overcome that horrible, horrible scent and it doesn't necessarily

144
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,720
 say it goes away either. So you could have little babies that have smell half like sulfur and half

145
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,560
 like you, whatever you smell like, hopefully better than sulfur. And before you guys get too excited

146
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:32,240
 and go, okay, so you have this horse that bangs a priest, so that means she's good to go, and she

147
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,280
 turns into this horse and then I horribly scar myself or just wear oven mitts. I'm sure there's

148
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:42,240
 a way around melting your own hands. I pull the thing out of her mouth. She turns back into a

149
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,280
 hot sweaty woman who stinks, but you know, I can deal with that. And I'm banging her. That's good,

150
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:52,400
 but to be fair, yes, that is good. I do agree with you on all those points. That's why I presented

151
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,280
 the story that way. However, one other twist, you don't necessarily know how the woman became the

152
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:04,320
 headless mule. There's actually several ways this can happen. One of them is banging a priest.

153
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:13,280
 Okay, again, that just means she's DTF. She can also become this by infant side. Look, I personally

154
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:19,120
 couldn't get with a woman who killed a baby. I mean, your mileage may vary, but that's kind of,

155
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:25,920
 that's, that's a bridge too far. That's like on the third date, she tells you, oh yeah, I have kids,

156
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,160
 well had kids, and you're like, what does that mean? And she's like, oh, that's a fourth date

157
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,960
 conversation. We're not getting to the fourth date. Unless I mean it was like a core accident or

158
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:42,000
 something. But I mean, no, and she, you can also become this thing. That was dark. That was a dark

159
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,680
 moment, dark moment for an otherwise lighthearted show. She can also become, this is fairly more

160
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:54,560
 lighthearted. She can also become this thing by engaging in necrophage, which is eating corpses.

161
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:01,520
 So that's disgusting. Like that's another thing. But to be fair, if a girl told me when she was in

162
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:06,720
 college, she ate somebody's thumb, probably be able to look past that maybe. Well, actually,

163
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,960
 this is a corpse. So if I met a girl and she said, oh yeah, about 10 years ago when I was in college,

164
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:17,520
 I went into a morganate, ate a thumb. I don't know why a thumb, any part of the human body. I guess

165
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:22,320
 the thumb's like the most innocent thing. But if I was with a girl and she goes, oh yeah, no, I, I

166
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,080
 ate some of the corpse once that, that would probably be a deal breaker. Yeah, that would, yeah, that

167
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:34,240
 would be a deal breaker. But it would be, if I had a choice between necrophage, girlfriend, or

168
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,920
 never mind, never mind, never mind. There's no choice. They're both gross. If I had a choice between a

169
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,920
 woman who banged a priest, I wouldn't even consider. I'd be like, oh yeah, and would you do the next

170
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:50,240
 day? Like that wouldn't even pop up on my radar of red flags. But infancyed and necrophage. So

171
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,960
 just letting you know, yes, this segment ended fairly darker than it started, but just letting

172
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:00,880
 you know, before you book your ticket to Brazil, until you pull that metal piece out of that mule's

173
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:07,520
 mouth, you don't know if you're getting a hot chick who's banged a priest or just some disgusting

174
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,440
 women who've done some disgusting things. But to be fair, you're the one who went to Brazil

175
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,960
 to bang a mule. So let's go ahead and move on to our next story. Now our next story is going to seem

176
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:23,280
 a little out of place because I didn't expect that segment to get as lighthearted as it was.

177
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,600
 But it's a story that I've wanted to cover actually before I even started doing the show.

178
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,320
 It's one of those true crime stories that I've come across in my years of looking at true crime

179
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:38,880
 that is always just kind of stuck with me for some very particular elements. The crime itself is

180
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,040
 actually, and I hate to use words like this, but it's actually fairly mundane. So I'm not going

181
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,080
 to spend a lot of time talking about the crime itself. But what we're going to look at is this

182
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:56,720
 happened in 2006. You had three teenagers. You had Brian Lee Draper and Tori Michael Atomic.

183
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,880
 They're both 16 years old, and they had a friend whose name was Casey Jo Stoddart, and she was 15.

184
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,440
 That should tell you where we're going with this because she was 15. And what happened was these

185
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,680
 two kids get together, they'd only known each other for about six weeks. Brian and Tori had only

186
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,120
 known each other for about six weeks. They immediately become good friends. They're really

187
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:21,840
 into movies and movie making. They went to Pocatello High School in Pocatello, Idaho. So that's

188
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:27,760
 where this story takes place. So in the year 2006, for six weeks, these two people meet, and they just

189
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:35,360
 really bond very, very quickly. And so one of them was idolizing the Columbine killers,

190
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,960
 and the other one was a huge fan of Scream and horror movies in general. And both of there's a

191
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,720
 little bit of bleed through with the two. They both liked horror movies, but one loved Columbine

192
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,960
 more than the other, and one loved horror movies more than the other. But they started getting

193
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,480
 it in their mind that they wanted to be famous. They wanted to kill someone, and they specifically

194
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,240
 wanted to reenact Scream. They wanted to be those cool edgy teenagers who are going around

195
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,080
 killing people in town, because it wouldn't make them famous. It wouldn't make them powerful. It

196
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:11,200
 would make them somebody. In a world full of invisibles, they would be somebody. So they

197
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:17,280
 hatched this plan, and they begin going out, and this came out after the trial, but they begin

198
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,880
 going out, and they surveilled eight people, eight different people, eight different times,

199
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,160
 waited outside their house, looking for the perfect opportunity, but every single time

200
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,800
 there was multiple people in the home. So they always had to kind of brush off their stuff. Now,

201
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:38,400
 they video, they were huge into movies and huge into making films. So they videotaped a ton of

202
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,600
 their stuff. So we have basically videotaped confessions of them sitting outside these people's

203
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:49,200
 houses and planning the murders and stuff like that. But what happens is they eventually find out

204
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,480
 that Casey Joe Stoddard, who wasn't just some average girl, it was their friend, and Brian had

205
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:01,920
 a crush on her, but she ended up dating somebody else. And he says, "She's my friend, but she has to

206
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:08,640
 die." They needed their victims. So, and I'm not just, I'm paraphrasing that, but here is an actual

207
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:15,280
 audio clip that I'm going to play of them discussing the murder of Casey Joe Stoddard.

208
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,800
 So what I'm going to do right now, because they recorded a ton of the stuff, I'm going to play

209
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:24,480
 you an audio clip from one of their video recordings where they are discussing the murder of Casey

210
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,120
 Joe Stoddard, because they're basically making a documentary about the crime they're about to commit.

211
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,920
 There should be no odds against killing people. I know it's a wrong thing, but

212
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:39,600
 hell, you restrict somebody from it, they're going to want it more.

213
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:47,120
 We found our victim and as it may be, she's our friend. But you know what? We all have to make

214
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:53,280
 sacrifices. Our first victim is only to be Casey Stoddard. She's going to be alone in a big,

215
00:19:53,280 --> 00:20:00,400
 dark house out in the middle of nowhere. How perfect can you get? I mean, like, holy shit, dude.

216
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:08,560
 I'm horny just thinking about it. Hell yeah. I was 950, September 22nd, 2006.

217
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:17,360
 We know there's lots of doors and there's lots of places to hide. I locked the back doors. That's

218
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:23,440
 all a lot. Now we're just going to wait. So what happens is they find out, like they said in the

219
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,120
 clip there, and that was all recorded. It was recorded at different times during the day,

220
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,880
 but that was all recorded the day they committed the crime. They found out she was house-sitting

221
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,000
 for a relative and she was going to be there with her boyfriend and they originally thought,

222
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,920
 "Well, just kill them both." But because they're friends with these people, they're actually invited

223
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:46,000
 over to the house and they sit around and they watch a movie for a bit. And then Brian and Tori say,

224
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,640
 "We want to go see a movie at the movie theater." So they leave, quote, unquote, leave. And then the

225
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,520
 power goes out of the house. And KC is freaking out, obviously, because, you know, they're in the

226
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,520
 middle of nowhere. It's late at night. They're in this house and they look around and the power comes

227
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,440
 her and her boyfriend are kind of looking around to see what happened. And the power does end up

228
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:09,680
 getting turned back on. But at that point, that was Brian and Tori killing the power so they could

229
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:16,560
 sneak back into the house. So they're in the house now, unknown to KC and her boyfriend. And at one

230
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,640
 point, the boyfriend calls up his mom, because these are like 15-year-olds, 16-year-olds. The

231
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,400
 boyfriend calls up the mom and said, "Hey, can I spend the night with KC at this house?" And the

232
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,040
 mom's like, "Of course not. I'm coming to pick you up." So the mom comes and picks him up. So now

233
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:34,080
 KC is alone. KC, Kassie, I think it's Kassie. I'm sorry if I've been pronouncing it wrong.

234
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,600
 Kassie is in the house alone by herself. Well, she's not because they're those two teenagers.

235
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,920
 I just killed Kassie. We just left her house. This is not a fucking joke. I stabbed her in the

236
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:51,920
 throat and I saw her life. This body just disappeared. Dude, I just killed Kassie.

237
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:58,240
 Fuck. That felt like a foot name for real. I mean, it went by so fast.

238
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,160
 Shut the fuck up. We gotta get her out of the street.

239
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:09,360
 Now, that audio clip I just played was Brian and Tori driving away from the crime scene.

240
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:15,040
 It's fairly self-explanatory. They ended up stabbing her 30 times.

241
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:21,200
 And from what they can gather is they chased her around the house a bit and she was totally

242
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,920
 freaked out. Now, they had said during their trial that they were simply trying to scare her and

243
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:31,120
 things got out of hand, but stabbing someone 30 times is really getting things out of hand.

244
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:37,680
 So she died. She was found by her 13-year-old cousin. That horribly mutilated body was found by

245
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:42,400
 Kassie's 13-year-old cousin when they came home from wherever they were at. That's where she was

246
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,840
 house-sitting. And Brian and Tori were arrested five days later. It's a very, very short amount of

247
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,080
 time because her boyfriend, they immediately go to the boyfriend and say, "Hey, you're the last

248
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,680
 person with her." And he's like, "Oh, yeah, me." And then these two other dudes came over. So then

249
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:00,960
 the cops went to talk to them and they totally cracked. Now, this case, again, that's a fairly

250
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:06,000
 standard true crime story. There's a lot of video evidence for it. I'm like, people talking about it.

251
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,600
 What I think is odd is I've never heard, because I followed this story pretty closely for a while,

252
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,800
 I'm surprised they didn't videotape the murders. I'm glad they didn't, but I'm wondering if they

253
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,200
 didn't. It's just that it's never been revealed to the public because they don't want anyone

254
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,280
 filling out Freedom of Information acts or something like that to try to get that videotape.

255
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:30,080
 I find it odd that they videotape for weeks and weeks leading up to the murder and then start the

256
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,600
 video camera as they're leaving the murder, but we've never seen that they videotape the murder

257
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,760
 itself. It's considering they were into videotaping everything. I've always thought that was kind of

258
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:47,280
 odd. They did both get sentenced to life without parole. And this case actually went to the

259
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,560
 Supreme Court. And the Supreme Court ruled that in 2012, the Supreme Court ruled,

260
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:59,680
 minors cannot be sentenced to life without parole. You cannot do that. So this case ended up changing

261
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:05,120
 the law. And I think they haven't really had their sentences reduced yet because the state's like,

262
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,520
 no, no, no, there's no way we're letting these dudes out. They're like, no, we're not letting

263
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:16,000
 these guys out. So that's still going on. But it's all a fairly mundane thing. But the reason why

264
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,400
 this story is always kind of stuck with me is because there's a documentary called Lost for

265
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,280
 Life, and it's about minors who are in prison for the rest of their life. And these two guys are

266
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:31,040
 featured in it because their case ended up going to the Supreme Court. And in the documentary,

267
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:37,760
 they're talking to Brian in prison. And I've read true crime stuff all my life. And I've never

268
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:44,880
 heard such a description from a killer before, the aftermath of a crime. Brian and Cassie were

269
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:51,120
 friends. They knew each other. And most murderers know their victims. But here's his quote. This is

270
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:58,320
 what he says. "After it happened, I had horrific dreams. Bad dreams where she was there and just

271
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:04,720
 graphic, gruesome dreams about her dying. I would wake up in the night and I'd be scared, terrified.

272
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:12,160
 Now I have dreams of her at school and everything's good. She's always smiling. But I always know in

273
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:23,200
 the dream that I killed her. And those dreams are the worst." And I find that absolutely fascinating.

274
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:32,160
 I find that absolutely fascinating because you have this young man who killed this woman and

275
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,840
 almost a... They'd been planning for about six weeks, but for the most part it came out of nowhere.

276
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,160
 Like it wasn't this, he was killing cats for a long time, doing all this stuff. He takes this

277
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,720
 woman's life. And you could hear how panicked they were in that second audio clip. He takes this young

278
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,320
 woman's life. And then he has those normal nightmares of guilt where he's like reliving the

279
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:57,600
 crime and he's like... He can't... He's not in control of his body. When he falls asleep, he sees himself

280
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,160
 committing the crime over and over and over again. And no matter how much he mourns during the day,

281
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:08,800
 no matter how regretful he is during the day, when he falls asleep, he has no control over his

282
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:14,240
 dreams and he's back and he can't help but killing her. But that's not the dream that terrifies him.

283
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:20,240
 The dream that terrifies him is when he's in class and Cassie is sitting in front of him and she

284
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,120
 turns around and she smiles. She goes, "You gonna do good on the test today?" "Oh Brian, I can't wait.

285
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:31,280
 I can't wait till summer. I'm gonna do so much stuff." "Yeah, I actually just got... I'm going to that

286
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:35,440
 horseback riding camp. I know it's kind of lame and very little girlish, but I don't know, it's just

287
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,840
 gonna be fun to get out of the area for a while." And in those dreams where she's just talking about

288
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:45,440
 life and her hopes and what they're gonna have for lunch and the new movie coming out, and in those

289
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:53,520
 dreams Brian is just sitting behind her in class, no knife, no blood, just knowing that all of that

290
00:26:53,520 --> 00:27:00,400
 is over, knowing that he's already murdered her. Those dreams are the worst because in those dreams

291
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:08,320
 she's still alive and she's still happy and full of life and has a future and he knows the truth.

292
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:16,560
 She's already dead and he killed her. Whether or not his sentence is reduced from life because he

293
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:23,040
 was a minor when he committed the crime is irrelevant. He will always be a prisoner in his head of this

294
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:31,520
 crime. Those dreams will always pop up. People really seem to idolize killers to the point where

295
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:37,600
 they will openly brag to someone that they barely know that they could take a human life.

296
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,440
 Because we can argue whether or not you could physically actually kill up someone.

297
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:50,880
 We can argue that point. But mentally, no. Mentally you will be imprisoning yourself for

298
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,920
 the rest of your life. You'll always be having those dreams and those thoughts and they will haunt you

299
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:01,680
 until the day you die. It might sound like a bit of a downer way to end an episode,

300
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:06,800
 but just think about that the next time you engage in some risky behavior that can get somebody else

301
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:13,360
 killed when you decide to start a fight with someone or finish a fight that didn't need to be a fight

302
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,560
 in the first place. When you find yourself with your back up against the wall and you can't stand

303
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:23,280
 it anymore and you just want to go across the street and teach that punk kid some lesson,

304
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:30,480
 think about it for one extra moment because that extra moment may be what spares you

305
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:52,960
 from a lifelong nightmare.

306
00:28:52,960 --> 00:29:10,640
