00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 When eight sailors board a Brazilian battleship on its way to the scrapyard, they have no idea they're about to end up in a museum, in space.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 And then we take a look at a story that should send a terrifying chill down anyone's spine.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 When seven friends go camping, they quickly realize someone is missing.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 The only problem is, they can't decide who to look for.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 [Music]

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Hope you guys are having tons of fun as the seasons change and the hot days turn to cold days.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 It's coming up to spooky season. Halloween is two months away, but still, you can feel the spookiness in the air.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Someone who's always in the air, or at least breathing it.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now, everyone give it up to our newest Patreon supporter,

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 YMOP QueenMav.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Woohoo! Yeah, come on in QueenMav. Walk on into Dead Rabbit Command.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 QueenMav, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally get it. I really, really do.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Anything you can do to help the show grow, I really appreciate it.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 YMOP QueenMav, let's go ahead and give you the keys to the Hare Hovercraft.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 We haven't used this vehicle in a long time.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 We're leaving Dead Rabbit Command. We're headed all the way out to Swampy.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Swampy, Florida.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 [Humming]

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 That is supposed to be hovercraft. It's not a vacuum cleaner.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 It's perfect vehicle, right? Florida, the land of swamps.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Specifically, we're headed out to Miami, Florida. It's January 1970.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 We're in Miami, Florida. We're going to meet this dude, this student,

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 at the University of Miami. His name is Ron Card.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 We see Ron Card walking across campus, and I have to point him out.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 He looks just like any other student. I'm like, "That's the dude, bro.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 That's the dude I'm going to be talking to. He's totally sees me pointing.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 He's like, "Oh, campus police. Who are those weirdos?"

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 I'm pointing at Ron Card. I'm like, "That's the guy we're going to be talking about today."

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 We see him walking around campus, and then all of a sudden,

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 this Mustang convertible pulls up alongside of him.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 The driver's going, "Yo, Ron, get inside. Get in the convertible.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 We've got a place to go." Ron looks from side to side. He's like, "Okay."

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 He gets in the convertible.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 [Humming]

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Red Mustang convertible. I don't know if it was red.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 I just really like red Mustang convertibles.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Color nonwithstanding.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 We see Ron get in this convertible, and they drive away, and I go,

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 "Well, what do you think?"

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 I'm pointing up the dust that this car's kicked up, and you're like, "Wait, what?

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 That's the story of college student gotten a Mustang convertible?

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Are you secretly doing an ad for the Ford company?

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 What does any of this have to do with true crime? Does he get butchered?"

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 And I'm like, "Well, not no. Unfortunately not. That would have been a cool thing."

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 I want to do a whole series about people killed in Mustang convertibles.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 No. If you had looked closely at the driver of the Mustang convertible,

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 it was an alien.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 An alien was driving that vehicle.

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Now, you might think that it's pretty audacious, right?

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 If you're an alien, you're an undercover alien on Earth.

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 It's probably not good to be in one of the most visible vehicles possible,

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 aka one without a roof.

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 There was an alien driving that vehicle, and you go, "Well, it looked like a person."

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 I said, "Yeah, it's one of those lame aliens that looks just like you and me."

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 He's not a cool alien. He's not an insectoid or reptilian or a great...

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 But that dude who picked up Ron Card is an alien who's been visiting Ron Card for years.

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Apparently these aliens were coming down and chatting with this dude.

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 And on this particular occasion, he actually picked up Ron in this Mustang convertible,

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 and they drove around town, and then the driver goes, "Hey, Ron, you know what?

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 You want to see something cool? We've seen all the sights of Miami.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 We saw the drug dealers have that shootout in that parking lot,

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 and then we saw those drug dealers have that shootout on the beach.

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 You've shown me enough of the local life of Miami.

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Why don't we go check out my UFO?"

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Ron's like, "Dude, that's totally dope."

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 As he's bleeding to death, he got shot by a bunch of Miami gangsters.

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 He's like, "They take Ron aboard this UFO and give him a tour."

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 "Hey, look at that. Yeah, see these control panels? Oh, that's really dope.

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Yeah, see these seats you can sit on? We invented those people."

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 People are like, "No, humans invented those too."

76
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 "No, we invented them. We gave them to the humans."

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 And then he's walking. They don't take him by the place where they're doing all the human experimentation.

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 These mutated babies floating in vials. They didn't show him that room.

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 But they gave Ron a tour of this UFO.

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 And then it did this story. It's so funny because these aliens are such idiots.

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 This is a real event. This is a real event. This is covered by one of the leading experts in UFOology.

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 He's written a ton of books, but for whatever reason, this is the story that fell on my lap out of all of his research.

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 The guy who covered this, his name was...

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 You guys may even know it if you watch a lot of, like, History Channel stuff.

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Wendell Stevens. He's a very famous UFO researcher.

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 He talked about the time that the aliens rented...

87
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 They didn't buy this car. They didn't build it. It wasn't a space car.

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 It went to, like, a rental car service.

89
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Rented a Mustang convertible, picked up Ron Card, who was being contacted by these aliens, these group of aliens, over the course of years.

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 This one particular moment, they rented this car. They drove Ron to their UFO, gave him a tour, and then made Ron...

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Made Ron return the rented car. The aliens, like, "Okay, I'm kind of pooped out from all of that tour guiding."

92
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 He threw Ron the keys and said, "Can you take that back to the dealership for me?"

93
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 "It's an alien! Just make it teleport or just build a car in the first place, you lazywom!"

94
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 He makes Ron return the rented car. He does say, "Listen, I already paid for it up front.

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 I'm not gonna make you pay for it as well with your Earth money."

96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 But yeah. So then, Ron, after this adventure, after being given this tour of this UFO, now he's just, like, driving a car through...

97
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 What a letdown, right? You're like, "Oh, man, why can't we take in the UFO to the dealership?"

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 He drives this... Well, you know, it is a good ending, 'cause he's driving a Ford Mustang.

99
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 This has become an advertisement for Ford. I love those guys.

100
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 He's driving a convertible Ford Mustang through Miami. He takes it back to the dealership.

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 So that's not the whole story, though. That's not the whole story, though.

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 I would have been totally satisfied with just selling that story, 'cause it's so bunkers.

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 There's also... 'Cause Ron had so much communication with these aliens.

104
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 This is a question I think would come up, right? If you met an alien, you weren't in good terms with them.

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 If they're not currently probing you or something like that, you wouldn't be talking with them at that point.

106
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 You would start to ask questions like, "What do you know about Bigfoot?"

107
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 I think the first questions would be stuff like, "Is there life after death? Are there cures to all these diseases?"

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 Kind of like the heavy questions. But then I think you would start asking, like, "What's the truth behind Bigfoot?

109
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 What's the truth behind the Bermuda Triangle? Like, all of these things we kind of associate with aliens?"

110
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 Not really Bigfoot so much, but you wouldn't want to know, 'cause they're flying around.

111
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 I'm sure they saw the furry fellow walking through the woods one day.

112
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 But you would ask, like... And Ron did. He goes, "Hey, what's up with all those missing planes and boats in the ocean?

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Do you guys really have anything to do with that? Bermuda Triangle and everything?"

114
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 And his alien friend said, "You know, that's an interesting question. Yes and no."

115
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 He says, "For the most part, when boats and planes go missing, we have nothing to do with it."

116
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 This is alien eyeshift from side to side. He goes, "Most of the time we don't have anything to do with it.

117
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 However, I do know of a time that we did, that we actually stalled a battleship."

118
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Let's go back to the year 1910.

119
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 In 1910, the country of Brazil wanted to start to project its power out into the oceans.

120
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 It was starting to become a big center for exports of rubber, and I believe oil as well.

121
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 But it started to become this international power, and it wanted to be able to flex its naval muscles.

122
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 So it started ordering dreadnoughts, these giant battleships that were the most powerful battleship of the time, to be constructed.

123
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 And they had a couple built, and one of them was the Sao Paulo. The Sao Paulo.

124
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 The Sao Paulo was actually cursed from the beginning.

125
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Almost immediately, here's a quick timeline of what happened.

126
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 It came into service in 1910. It got involved in this wide-scale mutiny called the Revolt of the Lash,

127
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 where the rank-and-file sailors were rising up against their commanders, because working conditions were terrible.

128
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 The food was so bad, they were getting these horrible diseases caused by a lack of vitamin B,

129
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 and they were getting whipped when they did bad things. They were like, " quit being sick!"

130
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 So there was this wide-scale mutiny. The Sao Paulo was almost immediately taken over by its crew.

131
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 They began attacking cities, they began shelling cities in Brazil, and then the mutiny was put down.

132
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 That was really the first time that this new dreadnought ever saw any service.

133
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 After the Revolt of the Lash, World War I starts, and Brazil asks Britain,

134
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 "Hey, do you want to borrow our battleship, our Sao Paulo battleship?"

135
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 Come and check it out, dude, it'll be totally awesome during World War I.

136
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 They weren't calling it World War I, they weren't waiting for this equal.

137
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 When the British came out and tested the boat, they go, " dude, this boat sucks, it's super slow."

138
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 We're fighting for the future of our empire, but we don't want to use your junky boat.

139
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 And Brazil's like, "oh, it's our favorite boat."

140
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 After that, a couple years after that, there's another mutiny on the boat,

141
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 and then the sailors take it to Uruguay, and Brazil's like, "come on, dude, can this boat do any good?"

142
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 And eventually it did, it became a training vessel.

143
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 And then it became the boat where everyone learned how to become a sailor.

144
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 And then after it stopped being a training vessel, they say, "you know what, let's just scrap it."

145
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 We'll get better use out of it by just selling the iron and all the steel and everything that was made out of.

146
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 So November 6th, 1951, the Sao Paulo is being towed across the ocean,

147
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 it's headed off to Portugal to get scrap.

148
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 It's being towed across the ocean by these two barges, these two like tow barges,

149
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 and you had the Sao Paulo have a crew of eight men on it.

150
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 They're making sure that everything is fine on the boat, I guess they're probably there just in case.

151
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 Right? I'm really surprised it still floated at this point.

152
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 These eight people, man, were really taking a risk. They weren't doing much.

153
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 These two boats were pulling it.

154
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 And then during this journey, a huge storm hits.

155
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 [waves crashing]

156
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 And they said the waves were so high that the two tow barges had to make a decision.

157
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 They actually had thought about this ahead of time.

158
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 They say, "listen, if we start to lose control of this big giant battleship,

159
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 one of us is going to cut our line and then the other one will tow it for a short distance,

160
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 and then when the storm, because you can't have it flying in all these different directions,

161
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 you basically only have it flying in one direction.

162
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 One of us will cut our line, you'll be able, you other tow barge, keep it on course,

163
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 or just at least keep it stable for a little bit, and then when the storm breaks,

164
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 we'll actually go and we'll fix the line."

165
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 So that's what they do.

166
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 This storm, the dreadnoughts just going up and down, and the two tow barges,

167
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 whoa, dude, they're going up and down in different times too.

168
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 And so the ones like, "nope, we're doing it." They cut their line,

169
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 so now this giant dreadnought is just kind of being tossed aside in this storm,

170
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 but it's still being held by this second tow line,

171
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 and the line, the tow line actually gets caught in one of the tugs propeller,

172
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 and it just cuts it, it just completely shreds the tow line,

173
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 and now nothing is holding the Sao Paulo in place.

174
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 But it's a boat, right? It's just going to float there.

175
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 That's what boats were built to do.

176
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 But that's not what happens.

177
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 These two tugs are watching this battleship go up and down in their waves.

178
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 The storm is crashing all around them.

179
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Eventually they lose sight of the battleship,

180
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 but they can still see this red navigation light on the Sao Paulo.

181
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 They can watch this red navigation light go up and down and up and down,

182
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 and then disappears.

183
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 The two tugs are trying to get the Sao Paulo on the radio,

184
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 nothing's working.

185
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 But it doesn't make sense.

186
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 It's only been a few minutes since this tow line got cut.

187
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 The boat was stable enough to float.

188
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Where did it go?

189
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 But it did disappear.

190
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 And they called in rescue teams,

191
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 and they sent out air rescue teams and sea rescue teams,

192
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 and they searched the area, and they never found the battleship.

193
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 And to this day, they've never found it at all.

194
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 It went down off the coast,

195
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 it was hundreds of miles off the coast of Portugal,

196
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 but it went down and the tugboats filed that report.

197
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 We watched it and then it just disappeared.

198
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 That story is 100% true.

199
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 That story is documented everywhere in newspapers,

200
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 and there's websites that are all about naval history.

201
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 There's whole websites about missing boats.

202
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Not paranormal side, but boats that go missing, things that go missing.

203
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 The story, I just told you, is 100% true.

204
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 And it is a weird story.

205
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Where did this battleship go?

206
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Now, when I was looking at this, it still seemed seaworthy.

207
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 If it wasn't able to get tugged across the ocean,

208
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 going from Brazil to Portugal is quite the journey.

209
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 If they didn't know if it was going to get there on its own at all,

210
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 they would have had to figure out another way to scrap it.

211
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 So how did this battleship...

212
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 And yeah, sure, there weren't enough people to fully operate this battleship.

213
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 But still, they said the storm was like a couple hours that went on.

214
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 That tow line was only cut though for a couple minutes, and then it just disappeared.

215
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 And the only thing they can think of is it sank, but they've never been able to find its sense.

216
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 So that alone is kind of an interesting mystery.

217
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 The story of a cursed battleship, right?

218
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 It never really got to see its goal of killing people in a war.

219
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 It never got to do that.

220
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 It constantly was a source of mutinies, and then eventually just became a hunk of junk, and then disappeared.

221
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 But let's go back to Miami.

222
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 Because when Ron Card asked one of these aliens, "Hey, do you have anything to do with missing boats?"

223
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 The alien says, "You know, that's a really interesting question."

224
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Before I answer it, do you have any relatives who live in Brazil?

225
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 He says, this alien says, he goes, "Yeah, actually, we did take a battleship once."

226
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 He goes, "There is this thing, and I can't really tell you what we needed it for."

227
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 He was very, very clear with Ron that he wasn't going to give him all the information.

228
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 He goes, "Listen, we needed a battleship made of metal that had armaments, had the ability to fire projectiles."

229
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 And Ron's like, "Why?"

230
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 And the alien goes, "Sorry, I can't tell you why we needed it, but we needed it."

231
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 So something that was made of wood, like an old galleon, that wasn't going to work for us,

232
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 it needed to be made of metal, and needed to have guns.

233
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 And so we looked around for one, and obviously there's a ton of them sitting around, right?

234
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 But you don't want to just walk up to a naval port and just vanish a boat.

235
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 People would notice that.

236
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 So we wanted one, but we also wanted to get one that people wouldn't notice was missing.

237
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 So we began to look for that.

238
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 And we found out that the Sao Paulo was going to be transported across the ocean for scrap.

239
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 So we were tracking that.

240
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 We had a UFO tracking that.

241
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 Once it got into a proper distance where there wouldn't really be any interference, we caused the storm to appear.

242
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 We had everything perfectly managed.

243
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 We caused the storm to appear, and then we took possession of the battleship.

244
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 We basically abducted the entire dreadnought.

245
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 So that was us, that battleship's missing.

246
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 And Ron's question, you know, we know that there's a crew of eight on it.

247
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 Ron goes, "Were there anyone on the battleship? Was it just floating there?"

248
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 And the alien goes, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, there was one person on the battleship."

249
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 There's only one person on the battleship, and we actually had pre-contacted him before through his subconscious.

250
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 We were communicating with him subconsciously, and he gave us permission to abduct him.

251
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 So after this guy gave us permission to abduct him, we then tracked the Sao Paulo, and we caused the storm, and we took the ship.

252
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 And we used it for what we were going to use it for.

253
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 Which again, we will not tell you what that was.

254
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 We had to send it off to an alien world.

255
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 It served its purpose, and then after that, we took the Sao Paulo, and we placed it in this thing

256
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 called the Museum of Space.

257
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Which again, he does not really go into detail what that is, but apparently, there is a museum in space

258
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 that is about space stuff, the Museum of Space.

259
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 And that is where the battleship sits to this day.

260
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 Now, it's an interesting story. When Ron heard his alien buddy tell this story, you know, I was reading about this.

261
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 I was kind of out about this by reading, thinking about it, docs.com, and then I did some more research.

262
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 My first question was, does this boat exist?

263
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 And that's when I found all these Wikipedia articles and stuff like that.

264
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 So that really got me juices firing, just like a Ford Mustang 5.0. I was ready to go.

265
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 When I found out this was real, I started digging in all this historical stuff.

266
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 Ron also goes to fact check this, and he ends up coming across the article in a magazine called "Pagent Magazine".

267
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 It was kind of like just a general interest magazine of the time.

268
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 And in the magazine article, he is able to verify some of this stuff, right?

269
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 The Sao Paulo did go missing.

270
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 So that made him think that, yeah, maybe his alien buddy did play a part in this.

271
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 It's interesting because historically, we know there were eight people on the boat.

272
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 The alien buddy says there was only one that they had contacted.

273
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 There was only one guy on the boat.

274
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 And the "Pagent Magazine", although it uses the word "crew",

275
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 it does make it seem like there was only one guy on the boat, and they named him as Mr. Ferrier, or something like that.

276
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 It was a scanned article. I had a hard time reading the name.

277
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 But it's an interesting story, right?

278
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Is it true? We don't know, obviously, with all of these stories. It's just one witness.

279
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 There's some stuff that does make the story suspect the fact that the aliens come from Venus.

280
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 Which I didn't reveal until now.

281
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 It's suspect, you know, obviously people go, "Well, there's nothing on Venus, so how could an alien come from Venus?"

282
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 We know now, in the 1970s, we thought there was life on Venus. Now we know that there's not life on Venus.

283
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 I think if you're willing to accept the idea that aliens exist,

284
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 I think you can accept the idea that if we did discover life on Venus, it would be covered up,

285
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 or they could be living in the inner parts of Venus.

286
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 I don't take the fact that they're from Venus as an instant, the story's made up.

287
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 That's just my personal thing, just because they're from Venus. But I didn't want to add that in there.

288
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 But yeah, the idea that you could take a battleship and use it for undisclosed purposes,

289
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 that's always the interesting thing. Like, if somebody's making up a story,

290
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 they wouldn't make up what it was being used for, and it would be something totally cool, right?

291
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 "Oh, we need to fight a battle, but we need to use a human battleship to do it."

292
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 And no, he just goes, "What do you need it for?" And the alien kept going,

293
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 "I'm not going to tell you what we're going to use. I'm not going to tell you that."

294
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 But I will tell you, it will safely end up in the Museum of Space,

295
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 and we contacted someone on board and they said it was okay for us to abduct him.

296
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 Now what's interesting is, the alien story, there's only one person on board.

297
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 Historically, we know there were eight people on board.

298
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 So the alien also seems to not only be hiding information, but lying.

299
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 They're a very interesting story of a man meeting a...

300
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 a... a Martian? A non-Martian? A Venussian?

301
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 And being told this story and driving around in a Mustang and having all these wacky adventures,

302
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 but that's all the fun stuff. At the end of the day, eight people were abducted,

303
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 and who knows what happened to them, right?

304
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 We don't know what they used the battleship for,

305
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 and even then, if we did, they just ended up in a museum.

306
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 The idea of humans being trapped in some sort of museum or space,

307
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 that's also very common, and really an early UFO lore.

308
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Right? But again, a fascinating story where we have the world of the paranormal

309
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 blend with the world of real life, and this was such an obscure missing boat, too.

310
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 I figured if he was ma... if he was making it up, he could have set it in the Bermuda Triangle.

311
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 He could have taken a very popular mystery at the time of those Air Force planes.

312
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 It just... it was like a platoon of them or whatever you call them, a bunch of planes together.

313
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Seven of them just disappeared over the Bermuda Triangle.

314
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 Like, you could have taken something like that, not something that was so obscure,

315
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 it was really only reported in the pageant magazine by the 1970s.

316
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 So I find it a very fascinating story, and aliens, if you're ever going to come and abduct me,

317
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 do it in a Mustang. Do it in a Mustang, Convertible!

318
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 I will willingly go if you let me do donuts in a Mustang, Convertible on a nice summer day.

319
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Why mop Queen Mab? Let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the Carboner Coptor,

320
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 where you'll leave behind Miami. We are headed all the way out to a camping site.

321
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 [imitates camping site sounds]

322
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 The year is 2022, so this is a pretty recent story. It's springtime.

323
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 And this dude, we're going to call him Norman, and his six friends decided to go on a camping trip.

324
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 They were like, "You know what would be totally awesome? You, me, trees, squirrels, dirt, tent, camping."

325
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 And everyone's like, "Dude, that's a great idea. That's totally awesome."

326
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 And almost immediately, you know, they've come up with the idea, we're going to go on a camping trip,

327
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 they set a schedule, people are bringing their cars, you're getting them all packed up,

328
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 they get to the designated area of where they're going to leave from.

329
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 You know, everyone's kind of assembling at one location to take the trip together.

330
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 Once they get to this location and they're packing their car up and everything like that,

331
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Norman gets the feeling that they're missing somebody.

332
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 He kind of is looking around, everyone, you know, they're consolidating to just a few cars

333
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 and they're throwing their gear in the back. And Norman's kind of looking around and goes,

334
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 "He's not here yet."

335
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 "Hey, Norman, are you ready to go?"

336
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 "Yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm ready to go. I'm ready to go. Let's go, let's go."

337
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 Shut the trunk, everyone gets in the cars, the cars begin driving off to their destination.

338
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 So, I'm at a gas station.

339
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 "Hey, man, who wants Twinkies? Oh, no, no, I'm getting giant 32. Go after these guys into the most obese, lazy bums."

340
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 They're like, "2 32 ounce sodas at the same time."

341
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 Glug, glug, glug, glug. They're sitting in a tub of lard.

342
00:23:50,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 They're walking around the gas station and Norman's sitting there and he's buying his daily allowance of 500 Twinkies.

343
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 And he goes, "That's so weird. Like, why do I keep getting this feeling that somebody else should be on this trip?"

344
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Like, I'm standing in this gas station and I can't understand why I keep looking around because I know somebody's missing.

345
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 I know, I have this feeling that somebody should be here.

346
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Now, there's seven of us in total. There's Norman and six friends.

347
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 But I keep believing there's an eighth person that we're missing.

348
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Norman said this kept happening. Like, as they're on this journey, whenever they would stop somewhere, whenever something would kind of change the rhythm of just driving in the cars,

349
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 he would become flooded with this idea that somebody is missing.

350
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 He goes, "Listen, we had a bigger friend group than just seven people, so...

351
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 I mean, like, you could figure, well, maybe we're missing Jerry from accounting, but that's the point. I didn't know who we were missing.

352
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 We went on this trip and I can't figure out what's going on, but someone's missing."

353
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 When we would go to the gas station to pick up snacks and then we're headed back to the car and getting buckled in and everything like that,

354
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 I would have this overwhelming feeling that don't leave yet someone's in the bathroom.

355
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 Someone's in the gas station bathroom. They'll be out in just a minute. Don't leave yet.

356
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 But no one ever came out of the bathroom. Of course, no one was going to come out of the bathroom. There was only seven of us.

357
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 And I know there's only seven of us, but I had this unmistakable feeling that there was an eighth person and I could not remember who it was.

358
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 We'd be setting up camp. We'd be camping for the night.

359
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 We'd be packing everything up to move on the next morning. And as I'm packing the car, I'm thinking,

360
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 "Is he still at the campsite? Maybe he's still at the campsite. Maybe..." But no, there is no one at the campsite.

361
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 But he felt that one of their friends was still back at the campsite. One of the friends was still back at the gas station bathroom.

362
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 He's like, "No, that was 100 miles away." He kept having the feeling that somebody should be there that wasn't there.

363
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 And he goes, "At one point, it was driving me so insane, I did a headcount. I had to sit there and go one, two, three, four, five, six, seven."

364
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 And he knew only seven people went on the journey, but he also believed that somebody was missing.

365
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 And this really came to a head on one night. They were sitting around. They were going to play a game of cards.

366
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 And all seven of them are seated at this table and the dealer is dealing out all the cards.

367
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 And then everyone had their cards and they're just kind of sitting there for a second.

368
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 No one's doing anything until someone finally goes, "Oh! Oh, everyone's here."

369
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 I thought we were missing somebody.

370
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 So it wasn't just Norman. Other people in this group, they all believed during this trip that somebody was missing,

371
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 but this was the first time someone had set it out loud. They actually all sat there with their cards waiting for somebody else to show up.

372
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 They didn't want to start their game until all of them were there, but all of them were there.

373
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 And what's interesting is that as they're sitting around this table talking about it,

374
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 it was only six of the seven people said that. Six of the seven people said, "Yeah, this whole trip I felt like I was missing somebody."

375
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 "Yeah, me too." And it went around, but there was one person who goes, "I haven't had that feeling at all. What are you guys talking about?"

376
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 They all felt like somebody else should have been there. The fact that they couldn't determine who it was is what made it so odd.

377
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 If they could have said, "Yes, it's Johnny," then this wouldn't be a paranormal story.

378
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 It would just be a bunch of friends who accidentally left their friend Johnny back at home.

379
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 That's not the case. They couldn't figure out who it was. But they all knew somebody was missing.

380
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 It's an interesting story. It's one of those paranormal stories that has really low stakes.

381
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 Like, at the end of the day, who cares if these guys left someone behind, but that's not the point.

382
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 They didn't leave someone behind. And as their journey continued, every time they stopped, it was basically every time they were transitioning from one activity to another.

383
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 Leaving the gas station, leaving the campsite, packing the car, that's when they go, "Wait, someone's supposed to be here."

384
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 And you have to ask all sorts of questions about this. You really do like, "What could this phenomenon be?"

385
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 This name's not going to give a bunch of gradients to the story, but this was posted online by a guy who goes by the name Norman Quacks.

386
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 345. So do they still use that term for a crazy person? That guy's Quackers.

387
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 Quack is an old term for someone who's crazy or a bad doctor or something like that.

388
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 I'm officially a baby boomer. I was born in the year 1945.

389
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 Norman Quacks 345 posted this. He posted this online and he got a lot of really good responses on it.

390
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 People started talking about the Mandela Effect, which is interesting because that would be a very, very personalized Mandela Effect, right?

391
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 It just only affects your friends group. Like, if someone else walked in, they don't know any of you guys, so they wouldn't feel the phenomenon at all.

392
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 But localized Mandela Effect could be a possibility. Quantum immortality that everyone slid to a universe where the eighth person didn't exist.

393
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 There's all sorts of things you can think of. A ghost? But see, I think even a ghost, part of the idea of a ghost is wanting its presence to be known.

394
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 If a ghost doesn't want to be known, then it just doesn't do any spooky stuff, right?

395
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 If a ghost doesn't float around your living room or stand behind you while you're taking a shower, it just isn't there, right?

396
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 The ghost would be the best to be like, "I don't want anyone to pay attention to me," and they just want to haunt stuff.

397
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 But that snagging feeling that somebody should be there and them not be there, that does kind of make it seem like some sort of dimensional split.

398
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 But in the new dimension that they're in, that person doesn't exist.

399
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 It's interesting, and I wonder how--this is one of those stories that when I read it, I go, "This phenomenon where you have a group of people hanging out and then believing that there is someone missing,"

400
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 and again, it's not someone that they know. Someone's missing and they can't put their finger on it.

401
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 This seems to me like it could be a much more common phenomenon.

402
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 This thing--it's so mundane that this is something that you could start seeing pop up in paranormal lore.

403
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 And when it's put out there, people may go, "You know what? That's so weird. I had that feeling once. I remember once in grade school, we all played four-square, and there was only three squares.

404
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 Who was the fourth person? We never figured out. The ball, they just kept bouncing it over there, and that person was always out."

405
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 It would be interesting if this is a more common phenomenon, but people just don't talk about it because it's so mundane, and if you felt this feeling, would you ever tell anyone else?

406
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 Right?

407
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 These people, they seem to have this over--you know, we're hearing this story from Norman's point of view. It's just kind of this overwhelming feeling.

408
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 I think it's very interesting, too, that he notices it during the transitions.

409
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 For the most part, when they're camping, he's not noticing it. He's saying when we're packing up, I kept thinking, "Oh, we can't leave yet.

410
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 Someone else is still at the campsite getting their gear, and he'd wait a while, and no one would come," and he'd go, "Oh, yeah, of course no one's there.

411
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 There's only seven of us," and then they would drive, and then when they stop at the gas station, when they get ready to leave, he goes, "Oh, we can't leave yet. Someone's still in the bathroom."

412
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 It was during these transition periods.

413
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 It's an interesting story. I think the fact that the one person doesn't remember, or the one person doesn't notice that somebody's missing is an interesting detail.

414
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 Does that mean that that one person just didn't have that insight to see the world of what could be going on?

415
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 That's a really interesting detail, too. The story for me is that the phenomenon didn't seem to affect one person, which could mean that they were just mentally busy, right?

416
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 They were focusing on other things, and if that thought popped in their head, they completely dismissed it.

417
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 The other one is that maybe they didn't have the psychic insight to sense it.

418
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 You know what I mean? You can put 10 people, walk them through a haunted house.

419
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Not everyone's going to be able to tell that it's haunted unless there's a ghost jumping out from behind a bush or something like that.

420
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 But I find that very interesting. And then just the phenomenon itself, it's interesting. What could this have been?

421
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 What happened? Was this a localized Mandela effect? Was this some sort of dimensional shift or glitch in the matrix?

422
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 And then what happened to that eighth person? I think from what we can gather is that...

423
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 I think my theory is that somebody... there was an eighth person when the trip began.

424
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 And then they just blinked out of existence, and the people were still... they had no frame of reference.

425
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 This person stopped existing, yet they still knew that they were eight people going on the trip with them.

426
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 But they couldn't place who stopped existing. They stopped existing. How are you going to figure that out?

427
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 It's a fascinating story. And it's terrifying because on the one hand, we're hearing it from Norman.

428
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 He's posting the story, but on the other hand, what if you were the eighth person?

429
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 You know, like, what happened to them? Where did they go?

430
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 It's possible they stayed in a universe where they existed and they went on this lovely camping trip, and they won a bunch of money playing poker.

431
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 But we don't know. Right? Was it... if that... that wouldn't make sense if it was some sort of quantum immortality shifting over or some sort of Mandela effect.

432
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 But what if the universe just forgot this person existed? It was a glitch.

433
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 These stories are always fun when we look at it from the point of view of the survivor, or the witness, the person who's alive to tell us the story.

434
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 But for the eighth person, their story will never be told.

435
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 Because they have no story. They never had a story.

436
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 Every interaction they ever had on planet Earth has been erased to the point that six of their friends sitting around couldn't even tell you their name.

437
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 At least when you die, there's a memory of you, right? And whether it's a good memory or a bad memory, that's kind of up to you.

438
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 But then there's also the whole breadth of your interactions with the world.

439
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 Every cat you gave a little pet to, scratch this little tummy. Every cashier you talked to when you were buying something.

440
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 Every time you were walking down the road and decided whether or not to step on a worm or jump in a puddle, you're like chasing them on three.

441
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 Well, it wouldn't matter. Even what you were doing when you were three. All of that stuff would have been erased.

442
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 Every single moment that you ever had on planet Earth was erased to the point that people don't remember you.

443
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 It's not that you died and they don't remember you fondly. They don't remember you existed.

444
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 And if you cease to exist, would that mean everything that you ever did also ceased to exist?

445
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 Every decision you made was undone.

446
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 The cat went that day with no one scratching its belly.

447
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 That worm made its way home to its mom.

448
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 That puddle remained unsplashed.

449
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 And then you know all the other stuff, all the other relationships you had with humans along the way.

450
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 Fascinating story. It's one thing to disappear during a camping trip and become part of paranormal lore.

451
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 But does this mean that this person was actually erased from all of history?

452
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 They existed. They lived a full life. They made friends. They planned to go on a camping trip.

453
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 But before those cars showed up and all the gear was loaded into just two or three cars and the camping trip made its way out of town,

454
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 you ceased to be.

455
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 It's a fairly mundane paranormal story when you just look at it in one way, but once you look at the ramifications of it,

456
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 it's terrifying.

457
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 Is it possible to simply cease to exist?

458
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 Any moment of any day, everything you did on Earth is instantly undone.

459
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 And not a single person remembers you.

460
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 Except for maybe a simple passing thought one day when one of your friends is loading up their car.

461
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 They sit there and they kind of look around and shrug their shoulders and go,

462
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 "Huh, I thought I was going to meet somebody today."

463
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 But, guess not.

464
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 That is the last legacy left for the man who stopped existing.

465
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
