1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,500
 A man is on the hunt for lizard people living underneath the streets of Los Angeles.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:14,480
 And then we take a look at the legend of the guide trash, a black spectral dog, sometimes

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,460
 a shapeshifter, that haunted parts of England for nearly 200 years.

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,960
 Is this dog real?

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,040
 And by calling it just a dog is a little misleading.

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,760
 It wasn't a dog.

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,760
 There were hundreds of these things today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:40,120
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,120
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,120
 I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,040
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,560
 Just a quick reminder, if you missed yesterday's episode, we will be taking a break at the end

13
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,840
 of season two and season two ends on Friday.

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,840
 So we're going to do our Friday episode and then we're going to take a break and we will

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,840
 be back.

16
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,040
 I don't have my glasses on so I can't see my calendar from here, but I think it's April

17
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,720
 22nd, I think.

18
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,560
 But anyways, let's go ahead and move on to our first story.

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:14,280
 Now our first story, we're going to go to sunny, sunny Los Angeles, place of movie stars.

20
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,880
 I think I've used this intro before, but place of movie stars and sexy, sexy people who don't

21
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,880
 have any movie stars.

22
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,600
 What is it about waiters?

23
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,720
 Not waiters, let me back up here.

24
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,000
 What is it about waitresses that is so hot?

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,520
 Like a lot of times you go in to a restaurant and you'll see like some hot women dining

26
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,520
 there.

27
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,920
 But what is it about waitresses that make them so hot?

28
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,920
 Is there uniforms?

29
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,360
 Is it the fact that they're serving me?

30
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,800
 I don't know.

31
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,760
 But waitresses are generally the hottest people in the building.

32
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,040
 So we're going that long segue side.

33
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,800
 We're going to sunny, sunny Los Angeles.

34
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,600
 So let's just walk there.

35
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,740
 Let's just walk.

36
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,680
 It's a nice walk from Oregon to California.

37
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,680
 We can do it.

38
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,680
 The settlers did it.

39
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,840
 They had horses and wagons.

40
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,280
 But let's, okay, that's enough.

41
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,280
 That's enough.

42
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,960
 Let's go to Los Angeles.

43
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,880
 And that is where we are going to explore the mystery of the man who tried to find reptiles

44
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,720
 underneath the city streets of Los Angeles.

45
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,080
 Back in the year, imagine you are in the year 1934.

46
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,640
 You pick up a copy of the Los Angeles Times, the esteemed newspaper, the record for the

47
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,920
 city of Los Angeles.

48
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,000
 And you open it up and on the front page it reads this headline, "Lizard People's Catacombe

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 City."

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,400
 You're like, "What?

51
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,240
 Why is this in the front page of the Los Angeles Times?"

52
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,160
 But this was actually an ongoing thing in this city.

53
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,200
 So what happened was there was this guy named George Warren Shufelt.

54
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,000
 And he thought, well, he believed, he didn't just think it.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,360
 He wasn't like, "Oh, I got a theory."

56
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,480
 He truly believed that there was a race of ancient humanoid lizards living underneath

57
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,720
 the city of LA.

58
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,480
 He had heard an old Native American legend from a friend of his.

59
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,440
 So I mean, that's always the best way to get your information.

60
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,500
 And he invented this device called a radio x-ray machine.

61
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,560
 So basically he was taking it around town and he said it was like a ground penetrating

62
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,760
 radar, but radar didn't exist.

63
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,720
 So he was just saying that this is what it does.

64
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,240
 It's going underneath the ground and it's showing that there's these huge catacombs

65
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,240
 underneath the city.

66
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,360
 Now, nowadays, not only would that not be in the front page of the LA Times, that guy

67
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,960
 would be regarded as a total kook.

68
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,160
 He'd have his own website, but he would be regarded as a kook.

69
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,680
 It wouldn't get any mainstream press.

70
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,040
 But back then, people were, he went to the county border supervisors and said, "Hey, do

71
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,900
 you mind if I start digging up parts of LA to find the secret catacomb system?"

72
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,900
 And they approved it.

73
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,420
 They said, "Yeah, sure, dude.

74
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,140
 There's nothing else going on."

75
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:51,180
 And now to be fair, Los Angeles wasn't the booming city it is today, but it was still

76
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,020
 fairly large.

77
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,620
 But they gave him permission.

78
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:59,340
 They said, "Yeah, we don't want you digging up Hollywood and Vine, but you can dig up

79
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,580
 in certain areas where the business owners give you permission and stuff like that.

80
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,860
 We're totally fine with it."

81
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,020
 The reason why everyone was fine with it and it was kind of going along with it, because

82
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:12,240
 George Warren was saying that, this was what he was told, that a bunch of lizard people

83
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,320
 lived on earth a long, long time ago, and then a bunch of meteorites started coming

84
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,440
 down and they ran underground.

85
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,720
 They had this special chemical that melted rock, like hot butter.

86
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,160
 Hot butter doesn't melt.

87
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,120
 Melt rock like pouring hot water on butter, I guess is what I was looking for.

88
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,320
 And the county border supervisors, like that analogy makes no sense.

89
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,320
 And he's like, "No, no, no.

90
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,320
 Just go with it."

91
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,300
 And then they escaped down into the underground.

92
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,820
 And this city wasn't just in LA.

93
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,780
 It stretched all over Arizona and into Mexico and all that stuff.

94
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,500
 He said when they escaped, they took a bunch of gold with them.

95
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,380
 So everyone's like, "Oh, gold.

96
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,380
 Now I'm interested.

97
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,740
 Now I'll approve your digging procedure."

98
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,200
 He had a ton of people working for him.

99
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,660
 He had digging equipment.

100
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:01,020
 And according to who you believe as far as, like the record keeping goes, he dug between

101
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:06,480
 250 feet down to a thousand feet down looking for this stuff.

102
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,320
 So again, it wasn't a couple guys out there with shovels and pickaxes.

103
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,920
 These guys were using boring equipment, which is actually quite exciting, to dig through

104
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,720
 the earth deep.

105
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,640
 Even 250 feet down is pretty deep in the middle of a city.

106
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,640
 Now of course, he didn't find anything.

107
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,320
 At least that we know of, because if he had found something, then it would be big news,

108
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,520
 a giant lizard city underneath the city, and there's all this gold everywhere.

109
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,820
 But he ended up coming up empty handed.

110
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,260
 There's been a couple things from this.

111
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:39,060
 One, some people think that the story that he heard was mistranslated, because it was

112
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,180
 a Native American story.

113
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,780
 His buddy was Native American.

114
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:46,140
 There's a guy named Chief Greenleaf, which is who I used to buy my weed from.

115
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,220
 But they think that the story actually wasn't about lizard people.

116
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,860
 They think that something was mistranslated.

117
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:58,780
 And it was actually the story of Lemuria, the people leaving the island of Lemuria coming

118
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,200
 to the continent of America and going underground.

119
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,440
 And that's interesting, because we just covered that in the Mount Shasta conspiracy.

120
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,880
 When we talked about the people leaving their island and going underground and living under

121
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,800
 Mount Shasta and having no-- so people say that he may have gotten the lizard part wrong,

122
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,480
 but the old legend of people fleeing from a continent because it was undergoing some

123
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:26,280
 sort of cataclysm going underground into America, that matches up to other legends that were

124
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,720
 in that area.

125
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,420
 The second thing to come from this story is that some people believe that this is where

126
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:37,260
 the idea of reptilians based on taking over the world comes from.

127
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:42,260
 They think that this may-- this guy may have been inadvertently of starting the rumor of

128
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:47,660
 shape-shifting reptilians, of reptilians trying to dominate the planet, of a hidden race of

129
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,060
 humanoid reptiles.

130
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,980
 And they think that really it may come from this.

131
00:06:52,980 --> 00:07:00,080
 And as far as I can remember, humanoid reptiles aren't super common in old school mythology.

132
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,040
 They may be a one-off villain popping up here and there.

133
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:08,180
 They may be the guys that Hercules smashes their backs and breaks their spines and stuff

134
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,180
 like that.

135
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:17,040
 But overall, you'd have humans with a reptile head or talking snakes or creature like dragons,

136
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:23,300
 but the idea of an actual human like a full-on human looking like a reptile that stands up

137
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,060
 right like a human walks like a human, stuff like that, that's not super common.

138
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,620
 I may be wrong on that.

139
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:33,340
 And some people may say there's this example, there's this example, but overall that's not

140
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,480
 a real common mythology.

141
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,180
 People who are part reptile, yes.

142
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,460
 Or reptiles with human characteristics, yes.

143
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:47,520
 But a humanoid reptile is not as common in folklore or in religion or myth or however

144
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,520
 you want to put it.

145
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,760
 So, outside of maybe one or two examples out there.

146
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,680
 So they're thinking that this may be why the reptile thing popped up.

147
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,960
 So I mean, some people think because this idea of there's a race of humanoid reptilians

148
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,000
 that are secretly trying to take over the planet is fairly recent, it had to come from

149
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 somewhere.

150
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,380
 He was talking about this underground city, he never found any proof.

151
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,860
 He swore up and down there's reptiles living underneath LA and up and down all over the

152
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,180
 Southwest.

153
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:23,980
 This may have been the start of where eventually 80, 90 years later you have David Ike writing

154
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,540
 about shape-shifting reptilians and tons of reptilians on YouTube.

155
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,140
 Not literally, videos about reptiles on YouTube.

156
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,180
 This may be where it started.

157
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:38,720
 But the big question I have from this is, we know that you don't find a city and I

158
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,360
 don't believe in shape-shifting reptilians taking over the planet.

159
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,480
 But I do have one huge question about this.

160
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,200
 In that, front page of the LA Times by the way, I have to remind you.

161
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:54,000
 In that same edition, the January 29th, 1934 edition of the Los Angeles Times front page,

162
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,640
 right underneath this article saying that there may be reptiles living under the city

163
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,840
 of LA or at least their dead civilization.

164
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,180
 Here's a headline for you.

165
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:08,460
 Effort to save kite may cost child life.

166
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:14,260
 Little kid was flying his kite, got caught in a power line, went to go get it and got

167
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:18,940
 electrocuted and the article in saying the child is in critical condition.

168
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,940
 What?

169
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,180
 Now I'll never know if that kid ever survived.

170
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,180
 That is a whore of that, that's a cliffhanger.

171
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,900
 I know we didn't find reptiles.

172
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:30,300
 I find it odd again, talk about a slow news day in LA if that's on your front page.

173
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,120
 A tragic story, not making fun of the kid.

174
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,920
 Just bizarre that that would be front page news.

175
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,040
 And it also makes me think that it definitely was a slow news day if that is on the front

176
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:45,280
 page along with some guys digging in your backyard looking for reptile bones.

177
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,200
 But we're gonna go ahead and leave LA and I hope that kid's okay, but again, I'll never

178
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,200
 know.

179
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,000
 I don't think they have a follow up to it.

180
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,240
 I guess I could check the next day of the newspaper actually.

181
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,120
 But daily podcast, I got a lot of stuff to do.

182
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,100
 You know I'm wondering if that was in the newspaper because how long had electricity

183
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,100
 been around?

184
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,460
 Like power lines in cities?

185
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,460
 Maybe like 20 years?

186
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,980
 Nah he's probably not the first kid who got his kite stuck in a power line.

187
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,740
 Okay let's go ahead and move on to the next story.

188
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,220
 Now for the next story.

189
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,220
 But we leave sunny sunny Los Angeles.

190
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,820
 You're like that's weird, the auto quality changed.

191
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,060
 Yeah that's because I recorded those segments at different times.

192
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,980
 We leave sunny sunny Los Angeles.

193
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,180
 We say goodbye to the beautiful waitresses that we met down there that served us so

194
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,180
 honorably and valiantly.

195
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,380
 It's not D-Day, they're just giving us food.

196
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:33,240
 But anyways, now it's off to England.

197
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,620
 That's why I saved the Carbindercopter because we really needed, we can't walk across the

198
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,780
 ocean as much as awesome as it would be to like walk along the sea floor.

199
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,900
 We can't do that.

200
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,680
 But we are off to merry old England.

201
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:49,640
 We go a bit back in time to around, let's say, we're gonna go back to the 18th century.

202
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,820
 So early 18th century, we're gonna go back to when this started.

203
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:57,260
 Up in the Carbindercopter, go back in time.

204
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,580
 And now we're hovering over a little town.

205
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,700
 Now again, it's Britain, I don't really know how their principalities are set up.

206
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,660
 I don't even know if that's the correct word.

207
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,180
 But we're flying over, let's say Yorkshire.

208
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,340
 Yorkshire I think is a county.

209
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,980
 But anyways, we're flying somewhere over there.

210
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,420
 Hovering, we're in stealth mode.

211
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,060
 It's old timey town beneath us.

212
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,460
 Everything's made of wood and brick.

213
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,180
 And we see the city street below us.

214
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,500
 And it's kind of bustling.

215
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,220
 You know, it's seven o'clock at night.

216
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,460
 I'm surprised that this many people are out, but people are still wandering around the

217
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,460
 town.

218
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:33,340
 And you hear some guy go, "Oh, look over there what your people's going up.

219
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,340
 Look over there."

220
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,100
 And everyone's like, "What's over there, British dude?"

221
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,140
 And he goes, "It's a guy trash!"

222
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,140
 And everyone runs away.

223
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,140
 And we're like, "What?

224
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,140
 What's a guy trash?"

225
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,140
 And we're looking around.

226
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,140
 We don't see anything from our angle.

227
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,580
 We don't see anything at all.

228
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,820
 But we do realize something, that whatever this thing is, they're scared of it.

229
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,980
 You superstitious people are very scared of this thing known as the guy trash.

230
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,100
 Now, a guy trash.

231
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,100
 This was an interesting one.

232
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,060
 This one was actually a recommendation on Facebook from Alexandra.

233
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,380
 Alexandra recommended this to me.

234
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,180
 She's actually in Britain.

235
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,180
 I don't know if she's in Britain right now.

236
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,180
 I don't...

237
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,740
 If you're listening to this podcast three years from now, if you go there looking for

238
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,180
 her, I don't know if you'll find her there.

239
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,900
 But she sent me this story and she sent me an interesting follow up after she sent me

240
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,900
 the story.

241
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,900
 We'll get to that.

242
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:27,100
 This is basically your standard devil dog, your standard spectral spirit in the form

243
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,180
 of a big black dog.

244
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,860
 Those are fairly popular in Europe, specifically in England.

245
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,900
 And we even have a lot of legends like that over here in America.

246
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,500
 And thanks for the recommendation too.

247
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,500
 Thank you.

248
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,540
 But this one's actually a little more intriguing than just the ghost dog.

249
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:47,540
 Its abilities and features are quite odd.

250
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,900
 Now a lot of times you'll hear stories about, oh there's a black dog that's roaming around

251
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,860
 Virginia and eats chickens and poops on your lawn, whatever.

252
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,820
 Just normal stuff that you would imagine a canine spirit to do.

253
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,740
 So you either go, well it's a hoax and someone doesn't have a really good imagination or

254
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,220
 it's the ghost of a dog.

255
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,340
 And there's stories about hellhounds and stuff like that that are like these demonic type

256
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,660
 creatures.

257
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,220
 And then there's the dog creatures that I encountered when I was having my dealings

258
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,220
 with the shadow people.

259
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,460
 And I discussed that quite a few episodes back.

260
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,900
 It was like episode 97 or something like that.

261
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,220
 No it was even further, 88 I think it was.

262
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,620
 But anyways, they all behaved like canines.

263
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:31,100
 What's interesting about the guide trash is that its set of abilities far exceed anything

264
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,500
 that any dog could do.

265
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,340
 Even Scooby Doo would be hard pressed to beat this dude.

266
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:40,740
 And again it's funny because I'm going to keep referring to it almost as a singular entity,

267
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,740
 but it's not.

268
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,780
 There's a lot of fascinating aspects to this.

269
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:48,700
 But let's go ahead and talk about what a guide trash is.

270
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,140
 And specifically in its dog form.

271
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,100
 It's a spectral black dog, so it's a phantom.

272
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,940
 It usually has a chain around its neck and it's the size of a small bear.

273
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,020
 Which is quite huge, goes without saying.

274
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:05,740
 I mean, I don't think they're talking about like a cub, which would be kind of cute.

275
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:10,340
 A grown bear but like a small one.

276
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,340
 That makes sense.

277
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,540
 Like a normal bear but he's like the runt of the litter but he's not a cub.

278
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:19,420
 Which would match up again to the phantom dogs that I saw, which were easily bigger than

279
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,380
 me and I'm like 6'7", 6'8".

280
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,820
 So I'm not really.

281
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,340
 But so that would be the size of a small bear.

282
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,420
 I'm often confused with the small bear myself.

283
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,180
 My friends call me Ursa Minor.

284
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,620
 It also had giant eyeballs like saucers.

285
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,780
 So I just imagine that it's perpetually startled like zoinks.

286
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,940
 Like these giant round eyeballs.

287
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,100
 But it doesn't specifically say that.

288
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,700
 They're like bulging out of its head like it just saw a hot chick.

289
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,620
 Just so they're quite big.

290
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:54,500
 And it had a unique, technically the word was unusual roar unlike that of any animal.

291
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,460
 So like *roar* *roar* *roar* *roar*

292
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,100
 So you're thinking, okay it's a monster.

293
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,580
 Makes a weird monster noise and has monster features.

294
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,580
 Okay, there's it.

295
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,180
 Now we're going to get into the distinctive qualities.

296
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,900
 Now this description came from a dude.

297
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,220
 I didn't know who he was.

298
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,900
 I kind of figured it out from his last name.

299
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,900
 There's this dude named Branwell Bronte.

300
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,700
 And I was like, oh he must know Emily.

301
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,900
 He must be related.

302
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,580
 Emily Bronte wrote "Wuthering Heights".

303
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,980
 I'm pretty sure it was one of the Brontes.

304
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,980
 And I didn't know this.

305
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,860
 While I was researching this, him and his sister might have been banging each other.

306
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,700
 Or she wanted to bang him or something.

307
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,340
 Like there's this whole conspiracy theory that "Wuthering Heights", which again I've

308
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,340
 never read.

309
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,820
 And what if I knew this?

310
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,820
 That Emily Bronte wanted to bang her brother.

311
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,020
 And so she wrote "Heat Cliff".

312
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,020
 Who's in the book.

313
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,540
 Not the cartoon character, but there's a guy.

314
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,900
 There's a romance character named Heath Cliff.

315
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,540
 He's in this book called "Wuthering Heights".

316
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,340
 And I don't know if Cliff is a pun on the Heights.

317
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,260
 I'm assuming it's not.

318
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:58,740
 But anyways, Heath Cliff is trying to like, is like a total jerk to this chick in the book

319
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,820
 named Anna or something.

320
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:05,060
 And then I guess he digs up the corpse of his dead lover in the book.

321
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,060
 In the book.

322
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,060
 In real life.

323
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,500
 Heath Cliff digs up the corpse of his dead lover.

324
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,500
 What is in this book?

325
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,460
 I always was like, now I'd rather read a Dean Coons novel in high school because we got

326
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,140
 to pick our own books.

327
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,140
 But then it turns out that people think that she may have been trying to bang her brother

328
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,500
 that they did bang.

329
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,100
 And that's all based on her.

330
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,580
 She based her book on Heath Cliff.

331
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,860
 And then other people are saying, no, that's not true.

332
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,700
 They didn't bang, but they wanted to.

333
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,020
 Super bizarre.

334
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,780
 Teachers need to say that stuff in high school.

335
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,100
 And the teacher says, here, this book is called Weathering Heights.

336
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,460
 We think the author banged her brother.

337
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,460
 I would have read it.

338
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,700
 Here, here's this book, Animal Farm.

339
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,820
 The author was having sex with animals during this book as he was writing it.

340
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,420
 They need to tell us this backstory.

341
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,420
 I would have read it.

342
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:49,300
 But anyways, that's enough of probably 50% correct Bronte history.

343
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,740
 Branwell Bronte wrote the description I just read you.

344
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,460
 Also he was mentally ill and an alcoholic.

345
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:57,500
 So I should have told you that before this description.

346
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,900
 But he's not the only one who's seen these things.

347
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:04,460
 And this is where we get to the unusual features of the guy trash.

348
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:10,220
 When it walks, it makes a noise, which is incredibly unusual for any sort of ghost.

349
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,100
 Like yes, ghost rattling chains, jingle and doorknobs.

350
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:21,380
 But remember, this is such a common thing to see that these existed in almost every single

351
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:26,940
 town and in some towns they had multiple versions of these living on different streets.

352
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,220
 It was incredibly common.

353
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,540
 It wasn't like you have to go out to the graveyard and walk around a grave three times and say

354
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,140
 "Boo-ga-boo-ga" and then something comes out.

355
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,940
 You'd be going to go grocery shopping and you'd see one of these crossing the street and you

356
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,300
 turn around and go home.

357
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,180
 So these were everywhere.

358
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:44,020
 They were mostly in northern England where these were situated.

359
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,780
 But anyways, I keep going off in tangents.

360
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,340
 There's just a lot of weird information.

361
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,620
 Well not the Bronte stuff, but I could have cut that.

362
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:59,820
 As it walks, it made a noise that went "chh" and the noise was so noticeable that one of

363
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:04,220
 the slang terms for it was called the padfoot or the padded foot because it would make the

364
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,780
 noise like it was walking on pads.

365
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,580
 So it wasn't just one person heard the noise.

366
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:13,700
 They all heard the noise and some people said they should call it the padfoot.

367
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,380
 And you think why did they call it the guy trash?

368
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,980
 This is a weird detail as well.

369
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:21,580
 And Alexandra said this was her favorite part of the story.

370
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,340
 The guy trash as it moves through the town.

371
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,420
 It would be watching you.

372
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:32,420
 But if you noticed it and started walking towards it, it would begin walking backwards staring

373
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,420
 at you the whole time.

374
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,380
 You couldn't get close to the thing.

375
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,020
 Sometimes right when you looked at it, it would simply take off.

376
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:45,100
 And it would be noticed to jump into water so it'll jump into a well, it'll jump into

377
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,660
 a river, a pond, anything.

378
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,420
 You got a guy trash in it now.

379
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:55,740
 But the reason, and again this was such an oddity to all that stuff like seeing a spirit

380
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,940
 and having it jump into the water.

381
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,540
 Water is generally very connected to the spirit world.

382
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:05,020
 This was very interesting to me and it kind of trips you out when you think about reality.

383
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:10,100
 Sometimes the guy trash instead of running to the nearest water source would run towards

384
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:14,540
 you and then jump and dive right at your feet.

385
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:18,180
 So you think you're about to get mauled by this creature, but before it gets you it would

386
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:24,340
 jump and dive right by your feet and it would disappear as if it was diving into water that

387
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,140
 you're standing on top of.

388
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:30,340
 And it did that so often that that's why it's named the guy trash.

389
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,460
 Some people say that's the reason why it's called the guy trash.

390
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,420
 Not that it would jump in there and guy trash would appear.

391
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:38,420
 Because that noise guy trash.

392
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:42,340
 As it jumped and disappeared right at your feet it would sound like someone dropped a

393
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:47,420
 heavy stone into a lake.

394
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:52,460
 That is so bizarre to have such a noisy spirit that is so common.

395
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:57,300
 Because we don't call ghost chainies because they rattle chains all the time.

396
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,460
 You have other names for them, but this one if that story is true and they think that

397
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,620
 that's where the name guy trash comes from because they can't really find any other evidence

398
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,420
 of why that name is that.

399
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:11,220
 Is that so many people had experienced that and it would jump and it would splash into

400
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:16,100
 the solid concrete at your feet as if it wasn't concrete back then it was dirt but

401
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:22,860
 it would jump into the earth and it would make a noise and it happens so often people

402
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:27,700
 would be like what is that thing that's chasing us down the street and trying to go get some

403
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:32,060
 milk that happens so often people just started calling it the guy trash.

404
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,060
 Super bizarre.

405
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:39,020
 It has a lot of elements that really set it apart from normal cryptids or normal ghosts.

406
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:43,460
 The fact that everyone can see them is not really known among cryptids.

407
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,460
 Normally they hide.

408
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,620
 I mean these things will disappear when you start to interact with them but you know what

409
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:52,940
 I mean like it's kind of on the border between like the fairy lore, the elves and stuff like

410
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:57,020
 that where people interacted with them and they were obviously like harmful to people.

411
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,820
 You know gnomes were creepy.

412
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:03,700
 It borders on the ghost because it has a ghostly presence they constantly referring it to as

413
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,300
 a specter.

414
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:10,260
 And then it borders on the modern day cryptid where it's a creature that defies all logical

415
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,260
 explanation and it's kind of living in that realm.

416
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:21,100
 And it's funny because it's happening at the time when society is becoming more industrialized.

417
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:29,140
 It's like the last phase of the Fae legends and moving to the cryptid legends.

418
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,180
 Very very interesting creature.

419
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,820
 So you ask okay is the dog running around it's making this weird noise.

420
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,820
 What does it do?

421
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,900
 Which was really my question when I was reading the article.

422
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,900
 I was like okay so what does this do?

423
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,660
 This is interesting but if it just kind of like walks around town and splashes that's

424
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:47,380
 just kind of a weird illusion.

425
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,300
 Well it can attack you and it has been known to attack people.

426
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,860
 Ah I got my people's governor I can't see.

427
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,980
 But most likely seeing one is a bad omen.

428
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,980
 Now I can't think of anything.

429
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:00,020
 I mean it's pretty much a bad omen.

430
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,300
 If you get attacked by something you're like oh I should have seen this coming.

431
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,100
 I saw the bad omen and then it attacked me.

432
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:10,300
 But generally it meant that you or someone in your family was going to experience something

433
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,300
 really bad.

434
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,940
 Most likely a death soon when you saw one of these creatures.

435
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:20,940
 And remember these things are seen so consistently all over the place that people are constantly

436
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,500
 it basically in a state of fear.

437
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:28,820
 Everyone seeing them that stuff is happening all the time is really really tough to live

438
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,420
 back then.

439
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:33,300
 Imagine if every time you opened the door you saw a bad omen.

440
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:39,220
 But because these things were around for so long they were seen between the 18th and 19th

441
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,220
 century.

442
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:44,100
 They really were able to kind of zone in on...

443
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:48,500
 It's almost like they were able to study these things from a zoological perspective.

444
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,140
 They were able to come down to this is what it looks like, this is what it does, this

445
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:56,660
 is what happens when you startle it, this is what happens when you chase it.

446
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:00,540
 This is how it gets away, if there's no water available this is how it gets away.

447
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:04,340
 It's quite detailed, we don't even know that stuff about Bigfoot.

448
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:07,700
 What do you do if you run into Bigfoot, what does Bigfoot do when it runs into you, how

449
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,700
 does it get away?

450
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,060
 I mean they can just go, well he walks away.

451
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,580
 These ones actually have exit routes for this thing.

452
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:18,140
 They've also been able to zone in exactly where it tends to show up.

453
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,220
 This is cool, I didn't know this phrase before until I read this article.

454
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:26,420
 It said that it shows up in liminal places which are basically gateways.

455
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:31,620
 It would show up at thresholds, it would show up at gates, it would show up at tunnels,

456
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:36,340
 it would show up outside like the gate of a graveyard or outside the archway of a church.

457
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:41,100
 It's very very interesting, they were really able to go when they see it, you're like

458
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:46,240
 "Hey, probably shouldn't have walked by that open doorway because I didn't want any bad

459
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,780
 omens tonight and there is a guy trash."

460
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,820
 Now it also should, and you go "Okay, well I'll just stay away from all arches, stay

461
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,780
 away from McDonald's, don't go anywhere near where there's an opening."

462
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:00,540
 So liminal also includes, I mean liminal really is like borders.

463
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:05,820
 So it could show up at a street crossing, it could show up at a county line.

464
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,460
 You could be walking and you could cross your property line into your neighbor's property

465
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:17,140
 line and you look over there and there's this hulking black dog with giant eyeballs just

466
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,140
 staring at you.

467
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,740
 So that's why they were everywhere.

468
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:26,940
 Because boundaries is what makes up society and these creatures would be where there

469
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:32,380
 are boundaries and so generally you would have, some towns had a guy trash and they

470
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:36,660
 would be like "Oh and then there would be at the same time another guy trash in a neighboring

471
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,660
 town."

472
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:42,500
 But like I said earlier, some of the towns were so populated by these things, individual

473
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,100
 streets had its own guy trash.

474
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:48,700
 So you could have someone seeing the main guy trash down at the city hall while there's

475
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:53,260
 just a guy trash that walks down your street, which is the worst.

476
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:56,580
 That means you basically live in the worst neighborhood possible where there's a bad

477
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,700
 omen constantly just like hanging out in your front yard.

478
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:05,900
 He's also a shapeshifter, which again isn't out of the realm of the fantasy and the fortien

479
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:10,380
 and stuff like that, but the shapes that this guy seems to take are quite odd.

480
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,060
 Because I was like "Okay he's a dog, maybe he turns into a hot chick, maybe he turns

481
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,140
 into a frog, something like that."

482
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:21,900
 These are the other forms that, and I don't know how they knew it was the guy trash or

483
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,540
 a guy trash in this form.

484
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:28,260
 I'm assuming that it's the appearance that it took or the presence that it gave you,

485
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,820
 because some of these are really weird.

486
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:34,260
 It showed up once as an evil cow and terrorized the people of this town to the point where

487
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:38,580
 their guy trash basically just always stayed as an evil cow.

488
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:43,940
 Once and this was another, I think it was Bronte again, in between being and his sister,

489
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:51,140
 he noticed that in his area sometimes the guy trash would turn into a burning barrel

490
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,500
 rolling down a hill, which is so specific.

491
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,500
 And I imagine if you're in the middle of nowhere, which was basically how you would

492
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:02,420
 describe Eileen back then, and you looked out your window, if you saw a burning barrel

493
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:07,020
 rolling down the hill, the first thing you do is to roll over and wake up your sister

494
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,500
 and be like "Hey, wake up, Emily, look at this."

495
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,100
 And you would think it was a weird event.

496
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:17,220
 But if you kept seeing it and then you weren't seeing the normal spectral dog running around

497
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,500
 your neighborhood, you probably connect, "Hey, maybe that might be the guy trash."

498
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,260
 Maybe it started rolling up hill or doing weird stuff or chasing people around the neighborhood.

499
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:28,260
 And that is actually not as odd as the next form that it took.

500
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:32,100
 It also took a rabbit, so that's kind of cool, but it's not even the oddest form that it

501
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,100
 took.

502
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:39,980
 In one town, the guy trash became a dirty white rag on a branch.

503
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:45,300
 So it was just like a branch and there's a white rag hanging from it, dripping, and

504
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,340
 people are like "It's a bad old man, that's the guy trash."

505
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,220
 That's such a bizarre form for it to take, but the people believed in that area that

506
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,220
 that was the guy trash.

507
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,100
 But maybe it stayed up there for weeks or months.

508
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,100
 I don't know.

509
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:01,740
 It would seem, that to me seems like pure superstition.

510
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:07,100
 The rag one, it could have actually been a shapeshifting creature, but that more seems

511
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:11,380
 like one day I looked out and I saw a white rag on a stick and I had bad luck.

512
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,380
 I fell and stung my toe the next day, therefore that might be the guy trash.

513
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:17,940
 And then no one wanted to take it down because they were afraid it was the Smithical Monster.

514
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,380
 That sounds a lot like a complete superstition.

515
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,860
 But the guy trash did eventually disappear.

516
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:28,580
 And some people say it was related to the people in the areas getting more educated.

517
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:34,620
 Some people say that it was related to electricity, more lighting in the neighborhoods.

518
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,620
 Scared them off.

519
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,380
 It was no longer their hunting grounds.

520
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:42,980
 It's interesting to think that living in a rural area tends to get really dark at night.

521
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:46,420
 But it's interesting to think there was a time where there was masses of people living

522
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:50,580
 together and it was like, unless you're in front of a candle it was pitch black.

523
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:56,500
 And then oddly enough one author, not Bronte, but one author said that he said that the

524
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:04,140
 guy trash left Horton when the district was incorporated as it had grown jealous of the

525
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,140
 policeman.

526
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,140
 It's kind of weird.

527
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,700
 I didn't know it was Batman.

528
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,660
 Maybe it figured the idea that the policemen were now patrolling the area, but the guy

529
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:17,020
 trash wasn't like a silent guardian.

530
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,020
 A dark knight.

531
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:22,980
 He was just like this jerk that kind of caused bad luck and sometimes attacked you.

532
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:26,740
 So you're like, okay, there is the legend of the guy trash, but what's interesting is

533
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:32,380
 there is actually a recent news article where a woman was taking a photograph of a man walking

534
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:38,540
 up a stairway into an NA tunnel so it's like a tunnel that has a stairway into it for whatever

535
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,540
 reason.

536
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:42,620
 And she takes a photo of the guy for whatever reason.

537
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,620
 She's a total creeper.

538
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,140
 She has her own website.

539
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:51,500
 And in the corner of the photo right at the threshold of the tunnel is a guy trash.

540
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:59,420
 Now that's what the photographer says and that's what the newspaper is claiming it to be.

541
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,460
 It looks like a pile of trash.

542
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,540
 It doesn't look like a spectral dog.

543
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:08,380
 I mean, I guess if you really squinted you could see it.

544
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:14,460
 But I looked at the photo for quite a long time and I just couldn't make out the really

545
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,940
 make out the details.

546
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:19,460
 It was big and it was black and it was lumpy.

547
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:22,960
 And if that's what dogs look like over there, then I think they have bigger problems than

548
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,180
 mythical black omens running around.

549
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:32,100
 I wonder if spirits can go extinct.

550
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,020
 That's going to sound like a weird thing and I'm using the word spirits in kind of a general

551
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,820
 catch-all phrase.

552
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:41,980
 I think I've always been to the, I think I've always had the understanding that like if

553
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:47,560
 elves were real and gnomes were real and all this stuff that they did exist for a time

554
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:52,700
 alongside humanity and these little alcoves and humans would run into one from time to

555
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,180
 time and that's where a lot of these legends come from.

556
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:59,580
 Little shape, you know, babies being shape shifted and stuff like that.

557
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,140
 And I never, I just always assumed and then they left.

558
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:06,340
 I have always had this idea that it's been this kind of Lord of the Rings thing where

559
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:11,500
 basically once the age of man came, then they just set out this place as a forest and they

560
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:16,780
 either went deeper into hiding or they left our realm or whatever.

561
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,780
 Assuming they existed.

562
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,940
 Assuming they existed at all.

563
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:25,020
 I've always kind of had that childlike idea that maybe they just, you know, said, "Okay,

564
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:29,660
 we're going to leave, we'll leave England now as little fairy folk and we'll find another

565
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:32,340
 realm to live in, another dimension."

566
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:41,300
 Little fairy people and their black spectral dogs and gnomes and unicorns, man.

567
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,300
 I never really thought about them going extinct.

568
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:48,180
 I never really thought like there was a last unicorn, which is a great movie, but I never

569
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,340
 really imagined like there was a last unicorn that was like killed by a hunter.

570
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:54,140
 I imagined eventually the unicorns just left.

571
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:59,900
 And I don't know if that's very childlike of me, but it's funny to bring it back to this

572
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:05,500
 is like imagine that the guide trash these creatures were real, that it wasn't just mass

573
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,460
 elucination from ergot poisoning.

574
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:13,340
 And then they lived there long before humans spread to that area, but no one was around

575
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,340
 to notice them.

576
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,420
 And then the humans built up their little towns there and they're like, "We're not

577
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,420
 going anywhere."

578
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:24,140
 And they stayed there and it was still technically their place.

579
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:31,520
 But then nighttime started to become daytime and the darkness that was their home that

580
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:37,380
 comforted them was being taken away block by block by block.

581
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:44,500
 It's weird to think that out of all the species and all the civilizations that humanity has

582
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:49,060
 waged war against and the species have died off and those empires have fallen and their

583
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:52,420
 history completely forgotten.

584
00:31:52,420 --> 00:32:01,100
 Alongside all of that chaos, maybe there are like unknown graveyards of these creatures

585
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:08,780
 that either were slaughtered or simply just ceased to exist.

586
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:13,420
 I guess really the reason why I'm kind of having this realization now is until I really

587
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,140
 got to the guy trash, I never really thought of these things.

588
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:21,220
 They've always been more in the realm of fantasy than reality.

589
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:25,500
 And I'm not saying I believe the guy trash is real, but I find it interesting how much

590
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,580
 specific information they have on these things.

591
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:34,340
 As opposed to stuff like the Pombero or Unicorn or La Lorna or whatever, they're always just

592
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:38,300
 kind of these things that pop up and people make up a legend about it or they hear something

593
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,740
 and da da da da and everything's kind of left very vague.

594
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,820
 These things are so specific.

595
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:47,660
 It really makes me think that they could have existed in a logical fashion and if that's

596
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:54,340
 true, then we may be responsible for the extinction of a species from another dimension simply

597
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,660
 by turning our lights on.

598
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:02,060
 It really makes you wonder what the world was really like at night two, three hundred

599
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,660
 years ago.

600
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:11,660
 When the sun set and the world fell dark, what lived in that darkness?

601
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:15,660
 What humanity for hundreds of thousands of years?

602
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:20,780
 That we now regard as simple fables and legends?

603
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:27,740
 It's hard to imagine, even when you live in a rural area today, how dark the entire world

604
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:31,660
 was a short time ago.

605
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:36,900
 Did the darkness and the unknown create these myths and legends?

606
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:43,660
 Or were all these stories of creatures based on what people were really seeing on the edges

607
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,740
 of their civilization?

608
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:52,380
 I guess we'll find out if the lights ever do go out again.

609
00:33:52,380 --> 00:34:00,540
 Some horrible catastrophe, some nuclear war, and once again power is removed from the planet.

610
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:07,380
 When the sun sets on that first night and the world again is bathed in darkness, we will

611
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:17,580
 know then how true these stories of monsters and the dark really are.
