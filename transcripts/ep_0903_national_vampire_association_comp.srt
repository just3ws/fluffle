1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
 For decades, there's been a conspiracy called the Clinton Body Count, a conspiracy that

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,120
 says people close to Bill and Hillary Clinton have an unfortunate habit of dying.

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,160
 This conspiracy theory is so popular it's often featured in memes, so why is it that

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,160
 their latest associate who committed suicide in one of the most bizarre ways is not even

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,880
 being talked about in the conspiracy theory community?

6
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:34,600
 And then we meet a young woman in Boston who believes that she stumbled upon a nest of vampires.

7
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,840
 Well this isn't just a few old monster men hanging out in the city, no.

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,360
 She's discovered the National Vampire Association, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:57,840
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,080
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day, I hope you guys are having a great

11
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,240
 day too, I hope you guys had a great weekend, we got a ton of stuff to cover so we're gonna

12
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,880
 get started.

13
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,720
 First off, walking into Dead Rabbit Command, longtime contributor to the Patreon, longtime

14
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,040
 supporter of the show, one of the earliest listeners of the show, give it up for Cantillians.

15
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,480
 Woo yeah, come on in buddy, come on in, Cantillians.

16
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:28,120
 Cantillians, a really really cool dude and he is in this episode because he sent me a

17
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:33,760
 box of Bigfoot stuff, that's a Bigfoot call alarm.

18
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,240
 So I just do that, right?

19
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,680
 That's only going to be the sound effect on the show from now on and he sent me some

20
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,920
 Bigfoot post-it notes and he sent me a Star Wars best dispenser, I don't know where the

21
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,360
 Star Wars best dispenser came from, he sent me a bunch of cool stuff, a little Chewbacca,

22
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,680
 that's a Bigfoot dude.

23
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,200
 Cantillians, thank you so much, these types of presents always light up my day.

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,760
 Cantillians, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode, if you guys can't send

25
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,280
 me Star Wars best dispensers, that's fine too, just help spread the word about the show,

26
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,120
 that really really really helps out a lot, I also gotta say this, this is the last week

27
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,160
 of season 18.

28
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,800
 So after this week, I will be taking a two week hiatus, feel free to peruse the back

29
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,240
 of the catalog, I will just be laying on the couch like a big old lump taking a break from

30
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,240
 the show.

31
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,880
 But oh, however, I will still be putting out daily TikTok, so subscribe to the YouTube

32
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,720
 channel, the TikTok Instagram, wherever you want to look at this stuff, that's not going

33
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,640
 away because it'll take like five minutes to do.

34
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,920
 So I'll still be doing daily updates on the YouTube channel and all that, those one minute

35
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,240
 true crime videos that are really blowing up, they're really really doing good.

36
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,480
 Cantillians, let's go ahead and touch the keys to the Jason Jalopy, we are leaving behind

37
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:52,680
 Dead Rabbit Command, we are headed all the way out to Arkansas, we're headed out there

38
00:02:52,680 --> 00:03:00,080
 because this is an old school conspiracy theory, I remember back in the 90s, my stepdad totally

39
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,440
 100% believed in the Clinton body count, this is an old school conspiracy theory that people

40
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:12,200
 close to the Clintons having nasty habit of dying in very odd ways.

41
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,520
 And like I said in the intro, this has become a meme, you can a lot of times show like a

42
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,680
 picture of a van on fire and it said they were on their way to deliver some tapes from

43
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,280
 Hillary Clinton and they blew up, it's a meme, you'll find a lot of memes about people being

44
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,040
 associated with Bill and Hillary Clinton dying.

45
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,840
 And you have everything from, I think there was a couple of plane crashes that happened

46
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,080
 with people who were connected to them and that's when conspiracy theorists were kind

47
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,280
 of like hmm that's kind of interesting.

48
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,920
 How many private plane crashes can you have in a row that of all these people Bill and

49
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,400
 Hillary Clinton are parachuting down?

50
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,080
 And I want to say here too, I mean despite that Hannah Barbera cartoon version of their

51
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,120
 friends dying, I'm not even getting into the politics of this thing, I really don't care

52
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,720
 about the politics, just looking at the conspiracy theory, just looking at this particular conspiracy

53
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,520
 theory, I'm basically accusing them of multiple murders but I'm not talking about politics.

54
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,720
 The Clinton body count, it came to my attention and I think this is when it really hit the

55
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,560
 mainstream was when Vince Foster, a very close personal friend of the Clintons, specifically

56
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,200
 Hillary Clinton, I read a big write, I'll see if I can find it in the show notes but

57
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,640
 years ago I read a big write up about Vince Foster.

58
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:27,080
 He was the one, he was a close personal advisor of the Clintons and he got caught up in something

59
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:32,600
 called Travelgate which was basically the conspiracy, this was the Clintons came into

60
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,800
 the White House, fired a bunch of people so they could hire their friends to be in charge

61
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:42,440
 of the travel bureau of the White House and this got in the media and it was a big controversy

62
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,440
 and apparently he was telling people he was depressed, he didn't want to go back to Arkansas,

63
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,280
 holding his head in shame that he got caught up in this so he shot himself.

64
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,640
 That's the official story, now you'll hear that he shot himself twice in the back of

65
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,000
 the head or he shot himself with two different calibers of guns, that's what I remember hearing

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,600
 back in the 90s, I remember my stepdad hated the Clintons, he hated their guts so if a

67
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,440
 leaf blew the wrong direction he's like "ahhh" so I remember and back then we didn't have

68
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,400
 access to the internet, it didn't exist and so you just kind of heard you read stuff in

69
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,880
 conspiracy zines or conspiracy books and stuff like that.

70
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,280
 I think again the official story is that he shot himself once through the mouth and that

71
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,560
 he was telling people he was depressed and the conspiracy theory is like "no that was

72
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,480
 a cover" he actually killed himself multiple times but that's just the setup for the conspiracy

73
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:37,960
 body count is this meme and this conspiracy theory supposedly, a bunch of people have

74
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,240
 died associated with the Clintons, I'm not denying that but the question is are they

75
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,920
 responsible for them?

76
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:51,160
 Long standing boomer conspiracy theory, it'll be around long after they have passed on,

77
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,400
 that's why I find this so interesting because it's such an old conspiracy theory and a new

78
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:05,080
 meme that this story I'm about to tell you is jaw-droppingly not reported anywhere in

79
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,120
 the conspiracy theory community.

80
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,400
 Nowhere and I also think this is interesting because this is an example of the Streisand

81
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,280
 effect, I would never have heard of this if a lawsuit had him enfiled trying to cover

82
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,520
 up this story.

83
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:26,560
 So on May 7th, 2022 in Perryville, Arkansas, so what is that like last month?

84
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,000
 Perryville, Arkansas, this is nuts, you guys are not going to believe you have not heard

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,360
 this before in the conspiracy community.

86
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,120
 Mark Middleton, he was a close advisor to Bill Clinton, he worked with him when Bill

87
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:49,600
 Clinton was in the White House, very very close to the president and a man who was responsible

88
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,040
 for letting Jeffrey Epstein into the White House, inviting Jeffrey Epstein into the White

89
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,680
 House seven times.

90
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,160
 It was Mark Middleton.

91
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,720
 Mark Middleton was basically the middle man between Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Clinton when

92
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
 he came to the White House.

93
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:13,960
 Now, Jeffrey Epstein apparently visited the White House 17 times and seven of those times

94
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,680
 was Mark Middleton was bringing him into the White House.

95
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,680
 Okay?

96
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,680
 Weird.

97
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,360
 We all know Jeff Epstein's a monster, anyone connected to him?

98
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,360
 Weird.

99
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
 Right?

100
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,200
 Him being in the White House with President Bill Clinton, weird, totally unsavory, right?

101
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,000
 Makes you think about a bunch of stuff.

102
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,080
 Bill Clinton was on the low lead express and all that stuff.

103
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,680
 But that's not the craziest part of the story.

104
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,600
 Because we know those two guys hung out.

105
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,880
 We know that Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Clinton hung out.

106
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,000
 Mark Middleton was the guy who would bring him into the White House seven out of these

107
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,520
 17 times recorded.

108
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,520
 Right?

109
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,080
 He knows how many times he came and this wasn't recorded.

110
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,120
 But anyways, Mark that, now making no side conspiracy theory that they don't write down

111
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,520
 everyone's names when they visit the White House.

112
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,800
 Mark Middleton on May 7, 2022 killed himself.

113
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,320
 He killed himself 30 miles away from his home.

114
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,880
 He lived in Perryville.

115
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:11,280
 He 30 miles away, he went to a place called Heifer Ranch or Heifer Ranch, you know, like

116
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,040
 the, that big cow from Rocco's modern life.

117
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,040
 I think it's Heifer.

118
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,280
 Heifer Ranch.

119
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,440
 And the authorities, when they get called out for this suicide, they asked, did he,

120
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,440
 was he invited here?

121
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,440
 And they're like, no, he wasn't even supposed to be here.

122
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,920
 We just found him like this.

123
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,400
 And they're like, does he have any connection to this place?

124
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,640
 And Heifer Ranch is like, no.

125
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,360
 Like he might have visited at some point, but why he chose here to kill himself.

126
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,880
 We don't know.

127
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,400
 But that's not even the weirdest part.

128
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,840
 The weirdest part isn't that this guy, he personally knew Jeffrey Epstein and introduced

129
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,440
 him to Bill Clinton at least seven times.

130
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,600
 The weirdest part isn't that he drove 30 miles to a place that wasn't his home.

131
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,880
 The weirdest part is this.

132
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,560
 The Vince Foster thing, the official report is he shot himself once through the mouth.

133
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,000
 And the conspiracy theory is that he shot himself several times or there was two different

134
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,240
 calibers of guns.

135
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,760
 There was one gun located, it was like a 38 snub, something like that, that he used to

136
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,280
 shoot himself and it was next to his body when he was dead.

137
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,280
 That's the official report.

138
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,400
 And you can say Jason, no, no, no, that's not the real story.

139
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,560
 But that's the official report.

140
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,840
 The official report for this story is that Mark Middleton, 59 years old, husband and

141
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,640
 father, this is how he killed himself.

142
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,680
 He brought a table out to somewhere on this ranch.

143
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,800
 So he wanted to be disturbed.

144
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,440
 So he brings a table and he has an extension cord, not a rope.

145
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:44,680
 He takes an extension cord and wraps it over a tree, wraps around his neck, pulls out a

146
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:53,040
 shotgun, shoots himself in the chest and then hangs himself.

147
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,880
 That's the official report.

148
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,600
 That's insane.

149
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,160
 That is conspiracy theory fodder.

150
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,160
 Now here's the thing.

151
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,240
 I am not 100% sane that, oh, this means that the Clintons killed him and this is another

152
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,080
 member of the Clinton body count and I'm not even saying that.

153
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:16,080
 What I'm saying is I'm surprised no one else is saying that.

154
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,760
 That's what I find really, really shocking.

155
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:26,680
 This was reported, originally it was reported on radar online.

156
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,680
 It's a gossip site.

157
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,320
 It's a celebrity gossip site.

158
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,040
 And their headline was quote, he was murdered.

159
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:39,640
 It was their headline and then it goes on to say, "Bombshell claims surround makeshift

160
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:45,320
 gallows, death of Clintons, special advisor who lets sicko Jeffrey Epstein into White

161
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,320
 House."

162
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,560
 So there's a little editorializing in that headline, but it's fine.

163
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,200
 Radar online is a rag.

164
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,520
 That was published like two months ago and nobody picked up on it.

165
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:02,680
 The only reason I knew that this had even happened was the Daily Mail, which again is

166
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,840
 a total gossip rag, covered this.

167
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,760
 And the reason why it was in the news then is the family of Mark Middleton says we want

168
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,640
 an official lock.

169
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,560
 We want to seal all the documents regarding this.

170
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,760
 We don't want photos getting out.

171
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,600
 We don't want video getting out.

172
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,240
 We don't want drawings getting out.

173
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,440
 We want to tamp this down because they said they were getting harassed by conspiracy theorists

174
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,080
 over this.

175
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,280
 But I live in this conspiracy theory world.

176
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,440
 I stumbled across it one morning reading the news.

177
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,440
 I might have even been on Drudge Report, which is fine.

178
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,480
 I want this news to be out there, but the conspiracy theory...

179
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,600
 I always find it so interesting what the conspiracy theory community focuses on.

180
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,040
 Now again, I'm not necessarily saying he's a member of the Clinton body count.

181
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,000
 There is a logic behind doing this.

182
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,840
 These are both gossip rags, but they're both quoting police documents.

183
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,840
 They're not saying...

184
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,120
 And then Elvis, who's still alive, came out of the bushes and said this.

185
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,400
 They're quoting police documents and the police are like, "We think he wanted to guarantee

186
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,320
 that he died."

187
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,720
 So he shot himself with a shotgun and then if that didn't work, he would be hung.

188
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,240
 There's a twisted and dark logic behind that.

189
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,400
 And trust me, I feel really bad for this family and I can understand why they want to seal

190
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,400
 these documents.

191
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,600
 I'm not saying 100%.

192
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,720
 I've always been like, maybe the Clinton body count, maybe there's something behind it.

193
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,720
 Maybe not.

194
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,720
 I don't know.

195
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,560
 Like you can just read lists of things and it looks overwhelming.

196
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,320
 I've never been like a super supporter of it or a super denier of it.

197
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,920
 It's just because there's so many conspiracies out there.

198
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,040
 You've got to kind of pick your ones.

199
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,040
 You want to be interested in.

200
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,040
 I'm just surprised no one else is talking about this.

201
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,280
 That's my thing.

202
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,760
 It's super weird.

203
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:55,520
 This is something that people were accusing previous deaths relating to the Clintons 2B.

204
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,080
 These just absolutely bizarre.

205
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,280
 It's mostly planes falling out of the sky.

206
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,440
 They're very easy to sabotage a plane.

207
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,200
 And Vince Foster, one where he shot himself multiple times with two guns, tied up and

208
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,200
 shot himself.

209
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,680
 I heard all sorts of variations.

210
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,040
 And then here's one.

211
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,280
 The actual police report is so weird.

212
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,680
 He shot himself with a shotgun and then hung himself.

213
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,040
 That any conspiracy theory, they should have been all over this.

214
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,000
 And that's what I find so fascinating.

215
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,320
 There's always been that conspiracy theory about conspiracy theories that Flat Earth

216
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,600
 is there to take a bunch of people away.

217
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,480
 People who would otherwise be looking into other conspiracy theories.

218
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,920
 They're looking at dumb stuff like Flat Earth.

219
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,400
 Monkeys don't exist.

220
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,400
 Trees are mountains.

221
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,480
 And they just get wrapped up in that stuff.

222
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,200
 And stuff like this just goes on the radar.

223
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,320
 Again, I don't know if there's anything to it.

224
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,640
 It could just be a man in a moment of desperation killing himself.

225
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:54,200
 What I find weird is that no one else is talking about something this weird.

226
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,640
 And something that's well known.

227
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,960
 The Clinton body count is a meme at this point.

228
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:05,520
 People who would never ever know the name Vince Foster can see the image of the van

229
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,280
 on fire and being like, "We have secret evidence on Hillary Clinton."

230
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,400
 And there's just a picture of a van on fire.

231
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,920
 They know that this should be fought.

232
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,520
 And it's funny because on the one hand, I find it odd that conspiracy theory community

233
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,520
 isn't talking about it.

234
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:24,560
 And on the other hand, for the family, it's probably good that they aren't.

235
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,560
 Because you know what I mean?

236
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,440
 Their family is going through this tragedy.

237
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,800
 But fascinating.

238
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,760
 The conspiracy theory community, man, if they're anything, they are unpredictable.

239
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,360
 You can never really guess what they're going to talk about.

240
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,520
 They'll talk about end of the world every single month.

241
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,760
 You'll see it just take over whole sectors of the conspiracy theory community.

242
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,760
 This happened two months ago.

243
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,760
 Nothing.

244
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,760
 Nothing.

245
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,760
 Nothing.

246
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,760
 Tragic story.

247
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,880
 Tragic story.

248
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,520
 And I would never heard of that.

249
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,360
 I never would have heard about it if they weren't suing to keep those documents closed.

250
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,400
 So that's what we call the stricent effect.

251
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:05,400
 When the harder you try to keep the lid on something, the more likely it is to get out.

252
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:12,480
 Absolutely bizarre mystery, personal tragedy, and just an interesting look at how the conspiracy

253
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,800
 theory community works.

254
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,760
 What they cover and what they don't is very, very telling.

255
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,760
 Very, very telling.

256
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,760
 Cantillians.

257
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,720
 Cantillians, his corpse, he's been burned.

258
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,800
 Oh no!

259
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,360
 We covered a Clinton story and they got to him.

260
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,320
 Hey, as long as they got to him and not me.

261
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,160
 We're going to reanimate him.

262
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,200
 We're going to tie strings to his charred corpse and we're going to make him walk onto the

263
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,960
 carbon helicopter and we're going to leave behind Arkansas.

264
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,520
 We are headed all the way out to Boston, Massachusetts.

265
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:50,160
 The carbon helicopter did break down a couple of times in midair but we were able to keep

266
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,400
 it going.

267
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,400
 The truth needs to get out.

268
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,440
 The truth about this vampire story, I don't know why we would be added to the Clinton

269
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,440
 body count.

270
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,320
 All we want to do is talk about some vampires.

271
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:06,120
 But in typical Dead Rabbit radio fashion, are we really talking about vampires or are

272
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,880
 we talking about something far scarier?

273
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,320
 No, not mummies.

274
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,320
 We are kind of talking about vampires.

275
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,120
 But we're going to take a look at this young woman.

276
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,520
 She doesn't give her name in her posts but we're going to call her Pamela.

277
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,440
 She goes by the name Butter My Toastitos.

278
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,680
 That's her username but we'll get to the end.

279
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,480
 At the end she has some toastitos and she's like, "But I have no butter."

280
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,240
 We'll get to the end and we'll talk more about the user herself in a second.

281
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:44,480
 And Pamela is someone who is special.

282
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,960
 Pamela is someone who has a special ability.

283
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,680
 Now we all want to be special in our own way, right?

284
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,840
 I think that's part of the human condition but Pamela is definitely more special than

285
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,240
 you or me.

286
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,720
 She's psychic.

287
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,120
 She can read people's minds.

288
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:06,200
 This ability to read people's minds has let her stumble upon something known as the National

289
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,080
 Vampire Association.

290
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,520
 Pamela tells us this story.

291
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,400
 One day she's in Boston and she's walking by Suffolk University.

292
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,680
 There's a crowd of people just walking down the street, cars driving by, birds in the air,

293
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,840
 sun, high in the sky.

294
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:29,840
 And all of a sudden her psychic powers detect a voice.

295
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,560
 A voice above all others in the crowd.

296
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,520
 But see, not a voice voice.

297
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,720
 It was a telepathic voice.

298
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,520
 She heard a voice in her head.

299
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,200
 I'm sure you can already see where this is going.

300
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,280
 She heard a voice in her head and she turns and she looks.

301
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:56,360
 And she sees a man walking down the street and she hears him in her head going, "I want

302
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,440
 to eat you up.

303
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,040
 I want to drink your blood but I can't."

304
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:13,760
 The National Vampire Association told me, "I can't eat you."

305
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,960
 The guy walks on by.

306
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,720
 She turns and she looks and it's just a normal man among all normal people walking through

307
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,720
 Boston that day.

308
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,520
 But now she knows the truth.

309
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,600
 He telepathically told her about the National Vampire Association.

310
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:39,080
 She said once she was walking through Boston, mixed among a sea of ordinary humans, homo-sabians,

311
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,880
 some may call us, she hears a voice in her head.

312
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:49,440
 She looks over and she sees a man standing there.

313
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,640
 Maybe he's checking his watch, maybe he's hailing a cab, maybe he's...

314
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,080
 Other things you can do just standing there?

315
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,240
 But she can hear the voice in her head.

316
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,240
 His voice.

317
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,480
 It's not like she's going crazy or anything, right?

318
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,040
 It's not like these voices are in her own head.

319
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,720
 It's not like she's schizophrenic or something.

320
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:16,320
 She hears this voice in her head saying, "I want to have sex with you.

321
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,520
 I want to have sex with you.

322
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,520
 I'm an old vampire."

323
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,400
 I promise you I said this part first.

324
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,040
 I'm an old vampire.

325
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:29,520
 I know I look like a normal person just standing here checking his watch but no.

326
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,640
 I'm an old vampire and I want to have sex with you.

327
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,520
 You know whenever I do stuff like that I'm always afraid I'll end up in some dubstep remix.

328
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,320
 Perfect sample.

329
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,120
 Her stories are this.

330
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,840
 She's walking among people.

331
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,840
 Totally normal.

332
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:51,880
 None of them ever walk up to her and says, "How do you know about the National Vampire Association?"

333
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,880
 Who told you?

334
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,280
 How do you know?

335
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:59,760
 It's always her standing next to normal people and then them telling her how much they either

336
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,040
 want to have sex with her or how much blood they want to drink from her.

337
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:11,400
 It's constantly going on and she believes that she's psychic and she believes she stumbled

338
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,880
 upon this nest of empire.

339
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,280
 She says another time she's walking through Boston.

340
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,800
 This guy's walking down the street and he says, "Oh, how I want to drag you into the

341
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,000
 alley and drink your blood.

342
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,280
 You're so tasty.

343
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,600
 I want to drink you up."

344
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:36,040
 But the National Vampire Association told me I couldn't confound them.

345
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,040
 This is creepy.

346
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,800
 We've covered a lot of this type of stuff on the show, right?

347
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,640
 But a lot of times it's gangstalking.

348
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,000
 A lot of times it's like the military beaming stuff into people's heads.

349
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 I can't really think of a time where the gangstalkers themselves are supernatural.

350
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,680
 These people aren't necessarily gangstalking her, but what she's created or what this mental

351
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:10,680
 illness has created is a worldview where she is such a tasty bite that random vampires walking

352
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,960
 down the street want to eat her.

353
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,880
 She's hearing them and she's able to look at someone and go, "I'm reading his mind."

354
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,040
 It's not like she just hears the voices in her head.

355
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,160
 She is hearing the voices in her head, but she's also projecting it on this guy and she

356
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,720
 goes, "That guy wants to eat me right now.

357
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,400
 That guy wants to drink my blood."

358
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:38,000
 One point she goes to Japan and she's in Osaka, Japan and she meets these two people at a

359
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,800
 bar and they telepathically tell her they want to cut her wrist open and make her strip.

360
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:52,840
 It's interesting because she keeps going back between the violent death of the victim of

361
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:59,360
 a vampire and sexuality and raw sensual activities.

362
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,320
 Her brain goes back and she's connecting these pathways and that's a really bad place to

363
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:12,720
 be in when you start connecting violent thoughts, sexual pleasure and just random people.

364
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,800
 I'm pretty sure that's a recipe for a serial killer.

365
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,200
 So anyways, she's walking around, she's telepathically hearing all of these voices.

366
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:26,880
 At one point her friend is with her and a vampire passes them.

367
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,760
 This is the only time we kind of get an idea.

368
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:33,040
 She says she was 17 in this story in this little anecdote.

369
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:39,560
 Later on she's at college, so I think she's probably in her late teens, you know, 18,

370
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,320
 19, maybe up to 22, something like that.

371
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,000
 But when she was 17 she was still able to detect these vampires and her and her friend

372
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:54,040
 are walking past this random guy and he goes, "Oh, I want to eat your friend up."

373
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,880
 And she goes, "Why not me?

374
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,880
 Why not me?"

375
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,960
 She telepathically sends that back to him and then the man, the quote unquote, the voice

376
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,480
 in her head responds, "She eats vegetables.

377
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,480
 She's a vegetarian.

378
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,480
 She tastes better."

379
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,720
 And I'm like, "Hmm, interesting.

380
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,960
 Interesting tidbit that my mind has fooled me into believing?"

381
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:19,440
 Here's the thing, here's the thing, she definitely is suffering from some sort of mental delusion.

382
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:25,440
 And right now in this story that she's written, she's thinking random people are vampires.

383
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,360
 It's alarming because she thinks the vampires either want to drink blood from her and she

384
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,720
 doesn't seem particularly afraid of that or have sex with her or both.

385
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,080
 So unless she's watching like, Buffy 24 hours a day, I don't think she's going to snap in

386
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,320
 the sense that she has to hunt these vampires down.

387
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:46,320
 She doesn't seem particularly perturbed that these vampires exist or that they constantly

388
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,960
 want to keep drinking her blood because in the end she's special.

389
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,480
 Right?

390
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,760
 Imagine being so special that not only are you psychic, that you are protected by the

391
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,600
 National Vampire Association.

392
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,880
 Basically she's Belle.

393
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,000
 Is it Belle or Bella?

394
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,560
 Who was the girl from Twilight?

395
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,560
 I don't remember.

396
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,560
 Whatever her name was.

397
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,560
 Tracy?

398
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,560
 Her.

399
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:16,760
 You're that character from Twilight and everyone wants to eat you but nobody can because you're

400
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,760
 special.

401
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:23,360
 Obviously an undiagnosed mental illness is only going to get worse, right?

402
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,200
 With treatment a lot of them can get better.

403
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,360
 But if you're not even getting treated for this stuff and if you start to believe that

404
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,400
 it's true and you think that these random people are sending you these thoughts, what's

405
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,400
 the end result?

406
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,400
 Well let's jump ahead.

407
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,840
 It's really interesting too because you can go Jason, you've talked about vampires, you

408
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,120
 kind of believe in vampires, you believe that it's possible.

409
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,120
 Yeah, sure.

410
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,120
 I used to play Vampire the Masquerade.

411
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,440
 I love that role-playing game.

412
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,600
 I do love vampires, right?

413
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,480
 It would be awesome if vampires existed.

414
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,200
 It would be awesome if there was a National Vampire Association.

415
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,840
 It would be dope.

416
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,480
 Don't get me wrong.

417
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,120
 I believe in psychics.

418
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,200
 I believe a lot of them are scam artists but not all of them, right?

419
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,560
 I believe in psychics.

420
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,440
 I believe in telepathy.

421
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,840
 So it has all the elements of stuff that I actually believe.

422
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,080
 Why are you so dismissive of this young woman?

423
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,080
 Well let's jump ahead.

424
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,520
 This is actually her last post.

425
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,420
 She posted that about two years ago.

426
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:22,680
 And then one year ago she posted this.

427
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,160
 This is the headline of this post.

428
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,440
 "I'm coming here for help."

429
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,200
 She actually tried posting this on a couple different subreddits.

430
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:37,640
 She was posting this on the conspiracy subreddit but she also tried posting it on the DID subreddit

431
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,840
 which I think is Disassociative Identity Disorder.

432
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,160
 So this point she knows something's wrong.

433
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,160
 Remember the start?

434
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,600
 Probably before 17 she realized she was psychic.

435
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,840
 She's doing the psychic thing for a while.

436
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,640
 She thinks it's totally normal.

437
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,720
 Two years ago she wrote the one about the National Vampire Association.

438
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:03,600
 One year later and one year behind us she wrote, "I'm coming here for help.

439
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,160
 I've been possessed by the United States Air Force."

440
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:18,120
 I don't want to laugh but that's just a great title.

441
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:24,080
 If I was in an alt rock emo band I think that might be the name of it.

442
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,720
 But I've been possessed by the United States Air Force and she goes on to say that what

443
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:36,560
 has happened was since November 2019 what happened was she lost control over her body.

444
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:42,040
 Now not all the time and not total control but it was enough for her to be worried.

445
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,840
 She was no longer able to move her arms and her legs when she wanted to.

446
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,960
 It was almost like she had to ask permission.

447
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:53,160
 It was almost like she had to fight against something and she is telepathically told that

448
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,360
 she's getting these thoughts beamed into her head when she's like, "Why can't I move?

449
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,360
 Who's doing this?"

450
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:03,560
 The voice said, "We're the United States Air Force and you belong to us now."

451
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,280
 She's all walking in a recruiting center.

452
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,720
 She's like, "No, no it's trying to make her salute."

453
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,840
 Next thing you know she's flying a fighter jet.

454
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,720
 The United States Air Force has possessed her and so here we go.

455
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,560
 This is what we were worrying about when this young lady was saying telepathically vampires

456
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:25,000
 are saying they wanted to kill her but she's just like, "Oh you monsters.

457
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,200
 The National Vampire Association won't let you do that."

458
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,160
 And they're like, "Oh Zoinks foiled again."

459
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:40,600
 Now she says that the United States Air Force possessed her and made her drive 125 miles

460
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,880
 an hour down the road.

461
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,880
 You got a need for speed.

462
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,880
 The Air Force is going to do anything.

463
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,380
 They're going to make you drive fast.

464
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:52,160
 They made her drive 125 miles an hour down the road and crash her car.

465
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:58,600
 She survived, which is good, but she said the United States Air Force did that.

466
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
 That wasn't her.

467
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,160
 She even, this is weird, right?

468
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,640
 She's typing this out on the conspiracy subreddit.

469
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,040
 They took it off the DID one.

470
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,920
 They just said, "Go get help.

471
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,400
 This isn't the place for this.

472
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,240
 Go get some mental help.

473
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,320
 This is like a reddit, right?

474
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,560
 This is not a replacement for real medical help."

475
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,460
 The conspiracy subreddit, they put up all sorts of stuff.

476
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:23,740
 But anyways, she says when she's writing this post, she goes, "I'm not even typing out this

477
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,180
 post.

478
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,900
 Like I've lost control of my fingers.

479
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,380
 The Air Force is making me write this."

480
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:34,020
 This is interesting, right?

481
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,740
 We talk about memetic diseases.

482
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,740
 We talk about curses online.

483
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,420
 Like was the United States Air Force making her write this post?

484
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,420
 This is so absurd.

485
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,200
 How did I start saying it out loud?

486
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,960
 Is the United States Air Force making her write out this post so if other people read

487
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,160
 it, they also get possessed by the Air Force?

488
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,560
 I don't know.

489
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,560
 Probably not.

490
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:58,360
 I don't actually think this woman was possessed by one of the five branches of the US military.

491
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,760
 It's weird too, right?

492
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,000
 I can understand believing in vampires.

493
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,280
 Vampires existing, wanting to drink your blood, wanting to have sex.

494
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,680
 That all fits the vampire mythos.

495
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,360
 Why would the United States Air Force possess you?

496
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:14,260
 I mean, again, it makes you special, right?

497
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,460
 But why would they do that?

498
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:21,940
 Well, apparently, they're just doing it as like a flex.

499
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:25,460
 They're doing it to just show how powerful they are.

500
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,380
 And then she goes, "It's not just me, by the way.

501
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,820
 It's not just me that they're possessing.

502
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:34,060
 They also possessed my friend."

503
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,060
 Now this is interesting.

504
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:39,260
 I don't know if this is a, what do they call it, a folly, a do, which is a mental illness

505
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,040
 shared by two or more people.

506
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,600
 And her friend is also suffering from mental illness.

507
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,200
 Or if at this point Pamela is full on hallucinating things.

508
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:53,240
 Because if she can hallucinate a telepathic conversation, she says her friend told her

509
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:57,280
 this, but now that I'm thinking, I wonder if her friend telepathically told her this.

510
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:03,200
 She said the United States Air Force also possessed my friend and made her almost get

511
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,520
 hit by a fire engine.

512
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,800
 Like, there's a fire engine running down the road and tried to make her walk in front

513
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,660
 of the fire engine, but she fought back the air force.

514
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:16,260
 And then she said this, which so what have we faced so far?

515
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:22,380
 High speed, car crash, force to get almost ran over by a fire engine, posting on Reddit.

516
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,420
 Those are all three horrible things, right?

517
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,620
 Those are all three of the worst things you could possibly imagine.

518
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:31,700
 But then her friend, this is also one of her friend's punishments.

519
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,660
 So we'll just read this quote here.

520
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:39,200
 The United States Air Force quote forced, forced her by the way, this was not her, this

521
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,400
 sounds like the greatest excuse ever, forced her, meaning the friend, United States Air

522
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:55,600
 Force quote, forced her to eat a cheesecake piece and forced her to say, I like cheesecake

523
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,640
 to her family.

524
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,640
 Unquote.

525
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,520
 That's kind of a cool possession, right?

526
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,820
 I guess we're going to get possessed to do anything.

527
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,820
 You just eat, just eat cheesecake.

528
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:09,620
 Maybe she was lactose intolerant.

529
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:14,040
 Maybe she was like, oh, my stomach hurts and the United States Air Force is laughing.

530
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,180
 The mom's like, if you like cheesecake, honey, I thought it made you sick, but here's even

531
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:20,440
 more and you're like, no, no, that's possible.

532
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,440
 It's not written down.

533
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,440
 It's not in the details.

534
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,220
 So I just have to assume that she eats some cheesecake.

535
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,660
 That's not a bad punishment at all.

536
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,620
 They're like, Jason, we control you.

537
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,320
 Go to Taco Bell every single day.

538
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:36,400
 I'm like, you monsters with a big smile on my face.

539
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,720
 So we have her wrapped up in this vampire conspiracy theory.

540
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,080
 No one's really being hurt.

541
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,880
 And then we go tour a year after that.

542
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,440
 She's driving a car 125 miles an hour down the road intentionally gets in a crash.

543
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,440
 The United States Air Force did this.

544
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:59,600
 Really her last post, there's two final posts and this butter my toast, Thitos has not appeared.

545
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,580
 Online sense.

546
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,880
 Last post was a year ago or these last two posts were a year ago where people are like,

547
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,020
 you need mental help.

548
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:11,660
 Like the even the conspiracy board, they weren't like, tell us more, tell us more.

549
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,660
 I also don't trust the government.

550
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,580
 They're like, it sounds like you need help.

551
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:18,740
 It sounds like you're going through some sort of mental health struggle.

552
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:23,500
 And this is her second to last post.

553
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,960
 Quote, I don't know what to do.

554
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:32,720
 This person in my body is dangerous.

555
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:39,600
 They threaten to stab me and my family all the time.

556
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:49,500
 Do you have alters you can't physically control that threatened violence?

557
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,880
 So now she now we're talking about homicide and suicidal.

558
00:32:52,880 --> 00:33:00,000
 I wouldn't even say this was ideation like she's trying to fight the urge to kill everyone

559
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 and herself.

560
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,240
 Let's say it's a battle.

561
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,120
 It doesn't sound like it's just like, oh, I wonder what would happen if I killed my girlfriend.

562
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,720
 Type of thing.

563
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,880
 She's trying to stop it.

564
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,280
 And then that this is when people go, you need to go to a hospital.

565
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:18,960
 Like you need to go and the very last post said, I'm going to the ER today.

566
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,400
 And then she hasn't been online since we cover stories like this.

567
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,680
 We've covered a lot recently.

568
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,840
 I hope I'm not falling in.

569
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,840
 We're right.

570
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:34,760
 I find this stuff so fascinating because we talk about true crime most of the time after

571
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,840
 the fact.

572
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:43,920
 And in stories like this, we can see that buildup and we don't know what happened to this person.

573
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,080
 Someone stabbing another person in the city of Boston.

574
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,920
 It's just 3 p.m. on a Wednesday, right?

575
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,560
 It's a violent city.

576
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,000
 Most big cities are violent cities.

577
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,680
 It wouldn't even be in the news.

578
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:00,560
 If a young girl slaughtered her entire family, it'd be in the news, maybe.

579
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:04,280
 But if a young woman grabbed a knife and just started slashing at people and the cops came

580
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:08,840
 and they sprayed her with maize and taster and dragged her out, you would never know.

581
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:15,200
 It might be a local news story, depending on what else was going on that day.

582
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,440
 So we don't know how the story ends.

583
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,920
 She's never posted since.

584
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,120
 She may pop up and start ranting about some crazy stuff.

585
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,960
 She may pop up and be like, "Yeah, I was really dealing with some hardcore mental illness

586
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,280
 for a while, but I'm doing better.

587
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,640
 I'm on the journey for healing."

588
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,640
 We don't know.

589
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:36,040
 We don't know how this story ended in real life.

590
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:41,040
 I just find it an interesting reminder at the look of that precipice.

591
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,920
 Honestly, we are all on.

592
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:52,040
 Because if you take apart everything she said, a lot of us believe in the individual parts.

593
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,400
 All she did was put them together.

594
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:59,800
 Most people who believe in the paranormal believe in stuff like telepathy, psychics,

595
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:07,560
 vampires, possession, experimental government, machinery, conspiracies within the government,

596
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:11,000
 black book projects within the government where they're testing all this stuff.

597
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,720
 We believe in pretty much all that stuff.

598
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:17,320
 I guess I can't speak for you, but individually, if someone said there's a conspiracy theory

599
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:21,360
 that the United States Air Force is trying to build mind control rays, most people wouldn't

600
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,360
 blink at that.

601
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:26,400
 We'd go, "Oh, that makes sense because I don't trust the government."

602
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,000
 And it sounds like something you would do.

603
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 Right?

604
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,280
 Did you know that human bodies can get possessed by some other world entity and can make you

605
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,280
 want to do violent things?

606
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,480
 Hasn't it told me that?

607
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,040
 My head's spinning around and throwing up everywhere.

608
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,040
 I was like, "Nope.

609
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,040
 Never heard that.

610
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,040
 I don't trust the government."

611
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,040
 I was like, "Well, I don't trust the government."

612
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,040
 I was like, "Well, I don't trust the government."

613
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,040
 I was like, "Well, I don't trust the government."

614
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,040
 I was like, "Well, I don't trust the government."

615
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,040
 I was like, "Well, I don't trust the government."

616
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,040
 I was like, "Well, I don't trust the government."

617
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,040
 I was like, "Well, I don't trust the government."

618
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,040
 I was like, "Well, I don't trust the government."

619
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,040
 I was like, "Well, I don't trust the government."

620
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,040
 I was like, "Well, I don't trust the government."

621
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,040
 I was like, "Well, I don't trust the government."

622
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,040
 I was like, "Well, I don't trust the government."

623
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,040
 I was like, "Well, I don't trust the government."

624
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,040
 I was

625
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:16,040
 I was like, "Well, I don't trust the government."

626
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:40,040
 And since we already had, and I'm not judging, right?

627
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:47,040
 I'm not judging, but I'm not judging.

628
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,040
 I'm not judging.

629
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,040
 I'm not judging.

630
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,040
 I'm not judging.

631
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,040
 I'm not judging.

632
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,040
 I'm not judging.

633
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,040
 I'm not judging.

634
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,040
 I'm not judging.

635
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,040
 I'm not judging.

636
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,040
 I'm not judging.

637
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,040
 I'm not judging.

638
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,040
 I'm not judging.

639
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,040
 I'm not judging.

640
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,040
 I'm not judging.

641
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,040
 I'm not judging.

642
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,040
 I'm not judging.

643
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,040
 I'm not judging.

644
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,040
 I'm not judging.

645
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,040
 I'm not judging.

646
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,040
 I'm not judging.

647
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,040
 I'm not judging.

648
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,040
 I'm not judging.

649
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,040
 I'm not judging.

650
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,040
 I'm not judging.

651
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,040
 I'm not judging.

652
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,040

 I'm not judging.

 I'm not judging.

658
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,040
 I'm not judging.

659
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,040
 I'm not judging.

660
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,040
 I'm not judging.
