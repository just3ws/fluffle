1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 The biggest drug dealer in America is finally arrested.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Then we continue Too Good to be True Week with an exploration of the story of the Phantom of the Opera.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Is the story true? Did a crazed, deformed man actually steal a soprano?

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 And, depending on how long I talk about Phantom of the Opera, because I love that story, depending on how long I talk about that,

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 we may get to something else. We'll find out, or I may just talk about Phantom of the Opera for 20 minutes, today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. We may or may not have a lot to cover.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Again, it depends on how long I talk about Phantom of the Opera. So let's go ahead and get started with our non-opera related story.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 This just happened. Fascinating, fascinating story. It's May 13th, 2019.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Members of the FBI begin to move into a mobile home park, because they know in this park is America's biggest drug dealer.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 There's a rookie there, and they're like, "Hey rookie, rookie, come here."

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 And the guy's like, "Me?" He's like, "Yeah, you're the only rookie here. Get over here."

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Inside, see that mobile home? Yeah, yeah, I see it. You see how there's like that built on giant shack attached to it?

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Yeah, yeah, it's kind of odd. No, no, no, it's normal. It's normal. Sometimes people build onto their mobile homes.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 But inside that shack is America's biggest cocaine dealer. Between the year 2013 and 2017, he distributed over a pound of cocaine.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 He's like, "What? That's nothing. I mean, yeah, that's a lot of cocaine, but how does that make him the biggest cocaine dealer in America?"

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 And the FBI agent goes, "You'll see." And then at that point, you hear a beep, beep, beep, as a crane starts driving through the mobile home park.

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 So, 48-year-old Kenneth T. Hicks was arrested for conspiracy to distribute cocaine.

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 And he had a couple of co-defendants. They've actually all pled guilty. He's the only one who hasn't pled guilty yet. He hasn't gone to trial.

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Because he's 900 pounds. And he's just sitting in his house. He can't leave it.

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Now, I have a couple questions about the story. How does 900-pound man who can't leave his house distribute anything?

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 I mean, really, isn't the point of distributing, like, moving it from one location to another?

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Was he literally just, like, passing it from one hand to the next, and that was crossing state lines?

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Yeah, it's one of those story guys. And you know what, I can make fat jokes because I'm still overweight, but I got up to 350.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Like, I was one-third this guy's size, and I was barely ambulatory.

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Did I ever tell you my couch story? Where I bought--my mom bought me a couch when I first moved up here.

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 And it was a second-hand couch. It was a really nice couch, because it's Hood River, so everything's second-hand is still really nice.

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 And over the course of maybe, like, two or three years, the legs gave out.

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 I broke a couch. I broke the legs of a couch. That's how big I was.

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 I would tell people that--you see that in Shrek. I still have the couch, by the way.

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 I still have wooden pallets now, because originally I just didn't have any legs.

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Like, all the legs broke off, so I just still used it. And people would come over and they'd be like, "How do you get off this couch?"

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Because you sit down on it, and your knees are like, to your chest.

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 But anyway, so I put some, like, wood pallets underneath it, so now it's like a normal-sized couch.

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 So I can make fat jokes. I'm allowed to.

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Anyways, let's get back to Mr. Hicks here. He can't leave his house.

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 But obviously, he has to go to trial. So his first hearing was via video.

38
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Now, I don't know why they just didn't say, "We'll do all the hearings via video."

39
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 If you plead guilty or you're found guilty, then we'll figure out what to do.

40
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 But a judge says, "No, you should be in the courthouse for this next part of this."

41
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 And everyone's like, "Well, how do you move a 900-pound man?"

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 So the judge says, "Listen, here's what we'll do. We're gonna have a--you have a ramp at your house, right?"

43
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 If it hasn't been used in ages because you haven't left, he's like, "Yeah, I have a ramp."

44
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 "We'll get a gurney, and we'll just put you on the gurney, and we'll wheel you out the door, and there you're fine."

45
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 And at that point, everyone's like, "I don't think you've seen his house."

46
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 So the judge goes, "Okay, okay, this is actually true."

47
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 The judge says, "If we can't get him out the front door, what we'll do is we'll cut a hole into his wall,

48
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 and then we'll get, quote, "a device capable of lifting the defendant's weight."

49
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 I.e. a UFO tractor beam.

50
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 900 pounds is a lot. You would have to use some sort of crane to move a 900-pound person.

51
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 To move a 900-pound to anything, you would need some sort of crane.

52
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 And people go, "Well, what if that doesn't work?"

53
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Like, they had to work all this out in the court documents.

54
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 And he goes, "Well, if you can't leave the door on a gurney, and we can't cut it--you can't fit through the hole we're gonna cut in his wall,

55
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 what we're gonna do is we're actually going to tear down the ramp, brace the floor, and cut down a bunch of trees

56
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 so we can bring a big enough vehicle in to load him onto."

57
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 And to make matters even worse and/or funny, and then on which side you're on, he's naked.

58
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 He's so big he can't wear any clothing, so they have to hold--

59
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 [laughs]

60
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 They have to hold his trial in the loading bay of the courthouse.

61
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 So they're gonna have to put him either in, like, a semi or the back of a flatbed.

62
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Like, he's a trained dinosaur from Jurassic Park being transported.

63
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 And they're gonna take him to the loading bay of the courthouse.

64
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 This is in Richmond, Virginia.

65
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 The trial is actually Tuesday, and it's open to the public.

66
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Tuesday, May 21st, 2019.

67
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 It's open to the public, so if you want to see a 900-pound naked man, most likely plead guilty for conspiracy to distribute cocaine.

68
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 So they actually got him out of his house.

69
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 I guess I should say that, too.

70
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 The reason why the court order was last week, they got him out of the house, and then he went to the hospital.

71
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 They don't say why.

72
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 They actually--disappointingly enough, they don't say which plan they used to get him out.

73
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 They don't say if they had to knock down trees, like King Kong moving through the forest,

74
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 or if he just went down the ramp going, "Weee!"

75
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 But they don't know. They didn't release that.

76
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 But he did go to the hospital. Apparently he's fine. They just diverted him there.

77
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 And it looks like even if he pleads guilty, he'll be sent to the hospital.

78
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Because how--you know, prisoners all--

79
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Prisons already have a problem with overcrowding, and 900-pound man will not help that situation.

80
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 And also, they do have to keep him under protective custody,

81
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 because Blade is looking for him to interrogate him on the origins of the Blood God.

82
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 But--so, Kenneth, we had a lot of fun at your expense.

83
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 I actually--maybe this is a wake-up call. Maybe you should lose some weight in incarceration.

84
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Conspiracy and distribute cocaine is actually quite of a lengthy sentence.

85
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 So I don't think it's going to be like total club mad, or more like club-fed.

86
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 [laughs]

87
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 I mean, he'll be in there for a while, 900 pounds or not, but, you know.

88
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 And maybe it's time to make some life changes.

89
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 I did it. I lost 90 pounds. People can lose weight.

90
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 If you're struggling with weight, you can find humor in it.

91
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 I've been stuck at like 260 for a while now, but I was 350, and I got down here, so you guys can do it too.

92
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 So that is the moral of the story--oh, the moral of the story is don't distribute cocaine,

93
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 but the second moral of the story is if you're struggling with weight,

94
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 it's always better to pedal backwards than keep putting the pounds on.

95
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 I had to put a little bit of a moral on that, because otherwise it was just fat jokes.

96
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Now, we're going to shift gears here really quick.

97
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 We're going to turn the lights down low.

98
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 I'm actually going to have to set a timer, because I honestly could talk about this forever.

99
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 April 15th, 1927.

100
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Gaston Louraud, French mystery writer, is on his deathbed.

101
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 And as he's being attended to, a nurse walks by, a hot, sexy 1927-era nurse walks by.

102
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 He grabs her, grabs her wrist, pulls her close, says, "It's true. It was all true."

103
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 What? On his deathbed, a lot of the stuff we're going to talk about is alleged.

104
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 But allegedly on his deathbed, Gaston Louraud was saying, "It was true. The whole story was true. I didn't make it up."

105
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 And what he was referring to was the story of the Phantom of the Opera.

106
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Now, let's talk a little bit about Gaston Louraud.

107
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 He was attending law school and he had this super big trust fund and he blew it all.

108
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 He basically, I lost a lot of it gambling, so then he goes, "Oh, you know what? I need to make some money now instead of maybe being a lawyer later."

109
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 He became a journalist. He did that for quite a while.

110
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 Then he started writing mystery novels.

111
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 And he had one of the first big murder-in-a-trap-to-room novel.

112
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 His was one of the beginning of that wave, and it was quite successful.

113
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 But he ended up writing a story called Phantom of the Opera.

114
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 So, and I gotta be fair here, I've never read that book. I've seen the musical and they're pretty closely related.

115
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 And to be fair, I haven't really even seen the musical. I saw the movie version, so there's a few differences.

116
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 But the core is there. The core is there.

117
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 So let me go over real briefly, because I could literally talk about Phantom of the Opera forever.

118
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 The story of the Phantom of the Opera, it's absolutely fascinating to me.

119
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 And again, we're gonna focus mostly on the musical, but again, the story beats and the characters are all the same.

120
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 Phantom of the Opera should basically be called "Eliot Rogers the Musical" or "Incel the Musical."

121
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 It is the story of a man.

122
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 It's the...

123
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 [sighs]

124
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Okay.

125
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 The fascinating thing about the Phantom of the Opera is this.

126
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 It is one of the very, very few movies where the murderous villain is the protagonist.

127
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 In the sense that he had his plans perfectly set out and he knew what he was going to do.

128
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 The Phantom, Eric, is his real name, but...

129
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Eric knew exactly what he was going to do. He had his whole life set in front of him.

130
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 And out of nowhere for no reason whatsoever because of what anybody did, somebody else comes in and wrecks all the plans.

131
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Generally, I mean, you have...

132
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Let's take Star Wars, for example. Luke Skywalker is just living his life.

133
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 He's going about stuff.

134
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 And then the Empire attacks Princess Leia and then she sends the message down and then Aunt...

135
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 Whatever, the aunt and the uncle are killed and all that stuff.

136
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 So then he goes and he wrecks Star Faders' plans. That's normally how this stuff works.

137
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 Normally, even if like, the evil Empire is already set up and everything's running relatively smoothly and then somebody...

138
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 Like, Hunger Games.

139
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Everything's running smoothly for the government, but then they start messing with Katniss' family and she gets involved and it becomes this whole retribution stuff.

140
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 It's never like Skeletor has this totally fine, like, tax system set up and everyone's okay with it, but maybe there's a few outliers.

141
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 And then He-Man just wakes up one day and just starts wrecking Skeletor's plans.

142
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Skeletor, these bad guys do something to instigate the hero involving themselves in the fight.

143
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 John Wick's dog. Type of thing.

144
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 So, that's basically this.

145
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 So, here's the story of the Fandameve opera.

146
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 It's briefly as I can put it.

147
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 There is a young girl named Christine Daille. She is an orphan.

148
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 And she goes to live at this opera house called Opera Populaire.

149
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 At the opera house, it's already a...

150
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 He's probably like a teenager when she shows up.

151
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 And he is a disfigured man who previously worked for a freak show, who ends up living inside of the opera house underneath it where there's a giant lake.

152
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 And because he worked at a circus, he's a master of illusions.

153
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 He actually has some architecture background.

154
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 He's able to build whole...

155
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 I don't know how he got the architecture background from the freak show, but whatever.

156
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 We'll get into that in a second.

157
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 He builds huge walkways, tunnels, all throughout the opera house.

158
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 And he's down there and he's constantly pulling tricks and he's constantly interrupting with stuff.

159
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 People think the place is actually haunted.

160
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 They think that there is a ghost there.

161
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 And what he does is he basically begins blackmailing the people who run the opera house,

162
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 saying if you leave money for the ghost and you leave this box empty,

163
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 box five that overlooks the thing, I will stop pulling tricks on you.

164
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 And when they realize when they pay the ghost, nothing happens.

165
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 And there's a lot of debate in the opera house whether or not the ghost is real or if it's a person or what's going on.

166
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 But anyways, the story really starts off in the opera house is sold to two investors.

167
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 So the two investors bring in basically a third investor who's the vie conk.

168
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 And he's a young man who knew Christine as a little girl.

169
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Because now at this point, Christine's like 18, 19 years old.

170
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 And it's that same night where the vie conk shows up that Christine Diaye has her first performance at the opera house.

171
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Now while she was asleep, the phantom's all disfigured, but he sees Christine and falls in love with her.

172
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 And he teaches her how to sing.

173
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 Again, now there were a lot of in the musical version.

174
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 He teaches her how to sing.

175
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 And she thinks it's a ghost. She thinks a ghost is visiting her each night and teaching her the beauty of music, the passion of music and stuff like that.

176
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 He's teaching her all of these lessons.

177
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Now, he's basically grooming her.

178
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 So he's not a good person.

179
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 He's definitely a villain.

180
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 But his plan was basically to groom her and then to have her fall in love with him and then they'd live happily ever after.

181
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 And it'd be no big deal.

182
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 And everything would have gone perfectly fine.

183
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 If at her first performance, the vie conk did not show up and fall back in love with her.

184
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 Or really fall in love with her for the first time because they were just little kids.

185
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 So at that point, the phantom really starts to lose his mind that he's like, he never would have fallen in love with you if I hadn't taught you how to sing.

186
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 If I hadn't made you the woman you are, you'd be nothing.

187
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 And because I made you this star, now he's in love with you.

188
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 So he goes basically on a murder spree.

189
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 It's fascinating because it's probably, if you watch the movie musical, it's one of the most beautiful horror movies ever made.

190
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 Because that's what it is.

191
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 There's a love component to it.

192
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 It is a love story, but it's a horror.

193
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Because this guy has realized that his caged bird is about to fly.

194
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 And he begins psychologically tormenting her and murdering people around her.

195
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Anyways, in the end, the phantom, she has to choose between the phantom and the vie conk.

196
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 Does she choose the man who infused her with passion, who gave her life meaning?

197
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 She was just a young chorus girl who had no direction until this dark tortured soul showed up and showed her the beauty of music.

198
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Or does she go with the comfortable, handsome guy who's very, very wealthy and can give her a life outside in the sunlight with kids and stuff like that.

199
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Because she can't have that with a phantom.

200
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Fascinating, fascinating story.

201
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 And the thing is, as I remember what, and I told this thing before when I was watching the movie musical,

202
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 I had never seen it before, had no idea what the plot was, I had no idea, I knew nothing about it.

203
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 And I was super baked.

204
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Back when I smoked a ton of weed, I got it from Netflix when they still shipped discs.

205
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 I don't remember even why I got it.

206
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 I put it in two and a half hours later, I'm bawling.

207
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Bawling, I was just blown away by how amazing it is.

208
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 And let me go into the true stories thing, but let me say this real quick too.

209
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 Let me say this real quick too.

210
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 Phantom of the Opera is probably, and I said originally it's like school shooter, the musical, or Ellie Rogers, the musical.

211
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 It is, I remember watching that movie and it took me a while to digest it because it's just such a powerful story.

212
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 And I remember afterwards thinking that is really the true, and this is super important for dudes,

213
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 because most women realize this, but a lot of guys don't.

214
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 That movie really shows, showed me, like I kind of understood it, but it really put it into words I could understand.

215
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Women generally face a choice.

216
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Every woman has this choice.

217
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 She can choose what she, she can choose the passion or she can choose the comfort.

218
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 That, it really solidified that as a thing for me.

219
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Like I go, whoa, this, this is a very clear cut.

220
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 She had a choice between the comfortable life or the passionate life.

221
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 The passionate life would have been probably much more short lived and would have been very comfortable,

222
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 but it would be the equivalent of hopping on the back of your boyfriend's motorcycle and driving off into the sunset and what adventures come next.

223
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Or the house, the picket fence, the family, the two kids, growing old, sipping lemonade, watching your grandkids in the yard.

224
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 That's the choice.

225
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 And obviously the goal is for women to have both.

226
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 They want to have a guy who can provide a comfortable life for them, but they also want to have a guy who is super passionate about them.

227
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 Just, just needs to almost like devour them as a person.

228
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 You know, the balance.

229
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 And that's why books like as a dude, I'm like 50 shades of gray.

230
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 What is this?

231
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 But then I'm always 50, 50 shades of gray.

232
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 He is that guy.

233
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 He's the super comfortable guy because he's a billionaire.

234
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 But then he's so passionate and like possessive of her.

235
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Same thing with Edward from Twilight.

236
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Same thing.

237
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 That family was very, very rich.

238
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 They were like the vampires.

239
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 And then he also just couldn't be without her.

240
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 And Jacob the werewolf, I read all those books.

241
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Jacob the werewolf, they were poor.

242
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 They lived on the reservation.

243
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 It was a very, very low class life.

244
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 So that was the choice.

245
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Very, very fascinating stuff.

246
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Psychology of women and society and all that stuff.

247
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 And my advice to you guys is try to figure out one where you're at in that spectrum and play to that strength.

248
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 If you're like, listen, I'm not the super passionate guy, but I'm all about the comfort.

249
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 The play to that strength.

250
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 But I think that really you should try to be somewhere in the middle there.

251
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 You can say, hey, let's hop in the back of my motorcycle and cruise off into the sunset.

252
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 But in the end we'll be sipping lemonade on grandma's porch.

253
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Like to try to find that middle ground, I think tends to be the most successful.

254
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 You don't want to be super passionate, but you don't want to be so comfortable.

255
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 Your milk toast.

256
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 Anyways, I could honestly spend another 30, 40 minutes talking about Phantom of the Opera and the psychological aspects of it.

257
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 And really go into the minutiae of it.

258
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 And normally when I talk about Phantom of the Opera, all the other people who like to talk about it are total nerds.

259
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 And they're like, yes, when that fat guy hit like note C, it was, I'm like, I don't care about none of that stuff.

260
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 I don't care about none of that stuff.

261
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 I care about the narrative and I care about the interpretations of it all.

262
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 And I could literally talk for another 40 minutes about it, but I'm not going to.

263
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Because that's another point of this podcast.

264
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 The point of this podcast is, is that story true?

265
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 I'll admit when I even got a whiff that the story of the Phantom of the Opera was true, I got giddy.

266
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 It would be the equivalent of if I found out that Cybertron was a real planet.

267
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 That's how much I love that story, the Phantom of the Opera.

268
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 That's how much that story touched me.

269
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 So let's look at it.

270
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 There is, it was based on a real opera house.

271
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 That's not it.

272
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 There's more to that, but it is based on a real opera house.

273
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 It's the Opera Garnier in France.

274
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 The Opera Garnier does have a lake underneath it.

275
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 It actually is more like it's flooded.

276
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 It has a huge flooded area.

277
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 They had to build a giant like brick wall to kind of keep the wall in.

278
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 And now French firefighters use it to swim underwater.

279
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 It's really bizarre, whatever.

280
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 It seems like that's the light.

281
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 It seems like battle beast.

282
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 You have like the fire beast and the water beast and the earth beast.

283
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 You don't have the fire beast swimming in the water and the firefighter.

284
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 When I guess firefighters are the water beast.

285
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 Anyways, it doesn't matter.

286
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 It is weird.

287
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 So that exists.

288
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 In fan with the opera, a chandelier falls down and in the movie kills a ton of people.

289
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 But the chandelier at the opera Garnier did fall at one point and killed one person.

290
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 So again, that's not enough for me to say that it's a true story.

291
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 So let's look at some of the alleged rumors.

292
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 And again, Gaston himself said that it was true.

293
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 There are rumors, these are the rumors, that there really was a man named Eric who was deformed in France at that time.

294
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 I'm sure there are a lot of deformed people in France,

295
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 but this one was particularly hideous, worked for a freak show,

296
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 ended up leaving, getting out of the freak show business.

297
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 You know, there's no room for advancement.

298
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 How do you become more deformed than you already are?

299
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 He ends up going to the Middle East,

300
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 ends up going to Persia and becoming an entertainer for a shaw there.

301
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 And then from connections, you know, working it up,

302
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 ends up getting a job because he was a smart guy apparently.

303
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 If he existed, this is all a legend.

304
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 But he ended up getting a job as an architect's assistant.

305
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 And then after kind of building a bit of a fortune over there and learning the skills of an architect,

306
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 came back to France and got a job at the construction of the opera, Grania.

307
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 And the rumor is, is that there was a deformed guy who helped,

308
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 whether or not he helped build the opera house or he simply worked on the crew,

309
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 there was a deformed guy there apparently.

310
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Now all of this stuff, I should say too, I should have said this earlier,

311
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 a lot of these legends, they take place in the mid-1800s.

312
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 So you figure there should be some records,

313
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 but who's really keeping a record on the deformed employees of an opera house?

314
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 It's not really something you're going to put in your books.

315
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 But anyways, so Eric, this guy Eric working at this opera house,

316
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 because he was an architect, he was able to make false floors and rooms

317
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 that he could move in and out of that he would be undiscovered,

318
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 which would make sense if you were disfigured.

319
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 You wouldn't want everybody to see you like eating lunch.

320
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 You'd want to build a little cubby hole, you go in there, you can eat lunch.

321
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 Because I mean, you could be just kind of, you could have like a lame disfigurement,

322
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 like maybe like a one inch scar right above your eye and you're like, oh my God, the horror.

323
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 Or I mean, you could have a huge hole in his mouth and whenever he ate a sandwich,

324
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 like food was falling out of the side of his face.

325
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 So we don't know, we don't technically know if he existed,

326
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 but the next person we do know existed.

327
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 So there was an opera singer known as Christina Nielsen,

328
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 and it is very, very widely accepted that Christina Nielsen is the inspiration for Christine Diaye.

329
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 Christina Nielsen was an opera singer.

330
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 Before she broke out, she didn't become a big success,

331
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 but before she broke out, she was sent to an opera house to train as a young woman from 1860 to 1864.

332
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 That opera house was the opera grandeur.

333
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 So this is what the legend has been in frames.

334
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 And you'll kind of hear a little bit on the internet,

335
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 but a lot of them go, is the fandom of the opera true?

336
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 They'll go, no, there's no ghost there, but that's not the question.

337
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Nobody's wondering if there's an actual ghost there.

338
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 There was rumors at the time.

339
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 It would actually make sense that there was no news story of this.

340
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 That Christina Nielsen was kidnapped while working at the opera grandeur.

341
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 And after a three-week absence, she reappeared and stated that she was kidnapped by the deformed construction worker, Eric,

342
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 and held underneath the opera house.

343
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 They went to go find him.

344
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 The authorities went to go find Eric.

345
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Couldn't find him at all.

346
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 He was gone.

347
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 And then to make the legend even more tragic, I guess you'd say, later on,

348
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 I think it was like 50, 60 years later, something like that,

349
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 they were doing some construction in the bottom of the opera house,

350
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 and they found a walled up room.

351
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 And when they knocked the bricks down, there was a skeleton of a man in there.

352
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 And the idea is, is that that skeleton was Eric.

353
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 That he did kidnap her and in his heartbreak,

354
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 walled himself up and cut himself off from society forever.

355
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 If he couldn't have her, he didn't want anybody,

356
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 and he basically killed himself by entombment.

357
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 Now, what's interesting, other than my complete 100% acceptance of that story,

358
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 because I want the Phantom of the Opera to be based on something true,

359
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 is that there's really not a lot to back that up, except for the author's own words.

360
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Now, like I said, in that time period, if a woman was kidnapped by a deformed person,

361
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 or willingly went with him and then decided,

362
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 "Now I don't want this, this is too creepy," and left,

363
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 and she's an up-and-coming opera star,

364
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 you're going to do your best as her and her management team to squash that story,

365
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 because you don't want that story getting out.

366
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 It's too gross.

367
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 Really, you're just kidnapped by some hermit,

368
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 and dragged into his underground dungeon.

369
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 It would be better if just nobody knew about it.

370
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Is the story Phantom of the Opera based on a true story?

371
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 I want to think so.

372
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 I want to think so.

373
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 And you're like, "Jason, you are so skeptical about everything.

374
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 You're skeptical about, like, there's photographs of UFOs descending through portals,

375
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 and you're like, "Ah, it's fake.

376
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 You're so skeptical. Why do you want this to be true?"

377
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 Well, two reasons.

378
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 One, I love the story.

379
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 I love the story.

380
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 And hey, man, sometimes you just got to call a spade a spade.

381
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Like, I mean, I get it.

382
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 I am super skeptical, but you know, there's certain things I want to hug,

383
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 certain things I want to cuddle with.

384
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 And two, because this story has a dark twist at the end.

385
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 You know, the whole story of the Phantom of the Opera,

386
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 he was this illusionist, he was this maniacal man

387
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 who would do anything he wanted to get what he wanted.

388
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 And just when he thought he was dead or gone, he would pop back up.

389
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 A long time after this supposed abduction.

390
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 So 1864 is when she left opera grandeur.

391
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 She ends up going to an opera house.

392
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 I believe it was in New York, but I'm not for sure.

393
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 But she's on tour now as a big act.

394
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 She's left Eric behind in his little dungeon.

395
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 No one could ever find him, presumed dead.

396
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 And she becomes a giant star.

397
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 There is, she's putting on a concert that's full of 50,000 people.

398
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 And a rumor starts to move through the crowd.

399
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 A whisper first.

400
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 And then a yell.

401
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 That the building next to the opera house is about to collapse.

402
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 The scaffolding is going to give out.

403
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 And the people begin to stampede out of the opera house.

404
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 19 people are crushed to death in the chaos.

405
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 Many, many more wounded.

406
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 And they have to turn the lobby of the opera house into a triage center.

407
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 This is totally true.

408
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 And Christina walks into the lobby.

409
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 After all of this is done, she walks into the lobby

410
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 and she sees all of these mangled people, these dead bodies,

411
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 of people who came to see her scene, to hear her lift their spirits up.

412
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 She walks into a room full of bloody, broken and dead people.

413
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 And she said that experience never left her.

414
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 She always remembered that.

415
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 And I read that and I thought, the phantom did that.

416
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 A man twisted by rejection and revenge.

417
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 Hiding behind a mask, sneaking through the darkness of an opera house

418
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 and hearing the beautiful voice of the woman who spurned him.

419
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 Still singing and seeing 50,000 people enraptured by her.

420
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 He doesn't have to drop a chandelier.

421
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 He doesn't have to strangle anyone or do any sort of crazy illusions.

422
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 He just has to spread a rumor and disappear back into the night.

423
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 The building wasn't going to fall down.

424
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 There was nothing wrong with the scaffolding at the other building.

425
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 And nobody knows how that rumor started, because there was no problems over there.

426
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 The rumor started, 19 people died, and Christina was haunted for the rest of her life by what happened.

427
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 Was she haunted because it was a tragic accident?

428
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 Or was she haunted because she knew who was responsible?

429
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 But she couldn't tell anyone.

430
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 Because she had sworn not to tell the story, it would ruin her reputation

431
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 if they knew her past.

432
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 If they knew the truth of her abduction.

433
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 If they knew the truth of the phantom of the opera.

434
