00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
 What would you do if you were having a nice fun time at a summer camp?

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,160
 making wallets going for hikes enjoying nature and

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,880
 Then the aliens decided to join you

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,240
 and

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:19,280
 Then what would you do if one night you were kicking back a few Bruce keys down at the local pub and

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,880
 in walked

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,520

14
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,700

15
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,880
 cum cumquat?

16
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:06,880
 Quamquat? The last quamquat people. Jason, I know you have a hard time pronouncing names. This is a fruit

17
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,960
 This is a super well-known fruit. Quamquat, right? Quamquat.

18
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,880
 The lost Quamquat you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode if you guys can't support the patreon

19
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,160
 I totally understand it just helps for the word about the show that really really really helps out a lot

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,200
 We got some flyers in the show notes. You can print out and pass around town

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,920
 We're actually going to do a redesign on the flyers coming up

22
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,160
 So if you want if you want those classic Dead Rabbit Radio flyers

23
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,760
 Download those images now

24
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,640
 Quamquat, I'm gonna go ahead and toss you the hair hang glider

25
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,520
 We're gonna jump off the highest point of Dead Rabbit Command and we're gonna glide all the way out to Russia

26
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,320
 It's a long it's a long glide. I hope you guys brought some granola bars. I brought mine

27
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:56,680
 And as you're slowly starving by the time we get there you're all emaciated

28
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:02,120
 Luckily we get there eventually it's September 22nd 1980

29
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,640
 Specifically we're in the

30
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:12,840
 Sidar region of Russia and it's evening the sun has set the birds are going to bed the owls are waking up getting ready to

31
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,840
 do their job being spooky and

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,560
 In the Sidar region here in Russia. There's a Russian summer camp actually since September these kids

33
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,560
 They're a little late you guys need to get back to school. It's fall right?

34
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,400
 Sometimes maybe it's a fall camp maybe things are different over in Russia

35
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:33,600
 But anyways, there's this camp and it's mostly these young teenagers most of the campers are like 14 to 15 years old and

36
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,600
 You have camp counselors obviously you have adults there watching the whole situation now

37
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:44,800
 I've never been to camp my family was too poor to afford camp and watch a lot of documentaries about camps like me

38
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,120
 Balls I watched the meatballs movies the one or the alien showed up. I think that was meatballs for obviously I also watched

39
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,520
 salute your shorts

40
00:02:53,520 --> 00:03:01,840
 Winning documentary about camp life. I've never been to a summer camp. I've watched camp rock multiple times though

41
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,640
 This is what I would think camp would be like right you'd go you'd sing a song you'd kiss a girl

42
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,440
 You'd meet an alien and you'd get in a boxing match the alien would levity to you around

43
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:19,360
 Dead rabbit recommends meatballs for whatever meatballs movie that's doing aliens in I don't know how many times I watch that as a kid a lot

44
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,600
 But I assume summer camp is like that. Maybe you make a couple wallets. You're like sewing stuff

45
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,840
 Maybe maybe a zombie named Jason Voorhees kills you but something like that

46
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,960
 Apparently in Russia none of that stuff happens. You don't get to kiss a girl. You don't get to make a wallet

47
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,280
 You don't even get killed by Jason Voorhees on this particular day

48
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:49,680
 In Russia, this is what apparently they do in the camp. They were washing their dishes in a ditch

49
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,160
 In 1980 I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure Russia had indoor plumbing

50
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,720
 They had a ditch they had like this trench dug and these kids are washing their dishes, right?

51
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:08,080
 Grabbing more mud. They're like washy washy washy. They're like, uh, this is why we're still in summer camp in September guys

52
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,840
 Learn to wash your dishes, but these kids are washing ditches in a ditch and then all of a sudden

53
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:28,280
 Aliens showed up just like we both for this UFO shows up and it's hovering over the camp area

54
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,280
 It's actually a bit farther off

55
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,480
 But it's close enough that they can see it. They said it was 50 feet in diameter

56
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,100
 It was this massive object and it lands in a nearby field

57
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:45,680
 So the kids start running they're like we can do the dishes later. We've been watching them for hours

58
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,240
 They're still money the kids leave the dishes in the ditch and they start running to their cabins

59
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,440
 Which specifically in Russia, they're not called camp cabins

60
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,040
 They're called barracks. So I don't know what type of camp this was it might have been a prison labor camp

61
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,560
 But these kids are running from the ditch

62
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,720
 Which would be your natural reaction, right? I think if you saw like a UFO you'd be like, oh dude

63
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,800
 Look at that. Look at that unidentified flying object way up in the sky. What is that?

64
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,880
 But if you watched it land nearby like I think part of me would want to go check it out

65
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,120
 but I'm 14 years old and

66
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,840
 So dumb watching watching dishes in a ditch. Obviously not really thinking things through I'm out of there

67
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,300
 So these kids are running back to their cabins and they tell the camp counselors and they're like, oh do watch out

68
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,500
 Like this big old thing it landed over in that field and camp counselors are smart enough

69
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,500
 They go get in the cabins get in the cabins

70
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:47,260
 They're like they're not cabins. They're barracks. They're like these old stone brick buildings. Whatever just get in them

71
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:56,040
 They're all in these cabins that is when all of the cabin windows just kind of just kind of blow open

72
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,360
 And they're like the shutters right it wasn't like glass flying everywhere

73
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:06,120
 But like the shutters on the windows just kind of blew open and they were saying that there was no wind the previous to this

74
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,040
 There's no wind at all and now this violent force is thrust open the cabin shutters and

75
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:18,320
 You have I think they're all in one barrack at this point. I don't think someone's like, oh, no, this isn't where I sleep

76
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,440
 I need to go to my bed. They're like, no Billy. No, he's running over to his own cabin

77
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,480
 I think everyone from way this story sold everyone is in one building

78
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,080
 And the shutters are thrown open and at this point

79
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,200
 Like everyone the camp counselors believe in something weird is going on there in there

80
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,600
 The kids are in there and one of the kids will call him Joe

81
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,760
 Joe starts walking towards the door

82
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:49,600
 Opens it up and runs outside and he's just running through this now empty camp ground as you have this mysterious force

83
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,160
 blowing the shutters open and

84
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,280
 One of the camp counselors sees this and she takes off after him and she's running luckily

85
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,880
 She's faster than him and she's able to grab him before he's halfway towards

86
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,160
 Where they believe this UFO landed

87
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:13,400
 So she grabs this kid and she's dragging him back and while she's dragging him back

88
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:19,680
 He's kicking and screaming. He's saying quote. I want to be with them. I want to be with them

89
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,640
 I want to be with them and she's dragging him back

90
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:29,840
 And then he breaks free. Oh, I want to be with them. I want to be with them

91
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,680
 Oh, and she's like she gets up and she starts running back after him

92
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,160
 Tackles him again is now finally able to drag him all the way

93
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,600
 I don't know what the other camp counselors are doing at this point

94
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,720
 They're like making bets you're like you think she's strong enough to take that kid down

95
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:52,040
 And so anyways, they bring the kid back once she finally gets close enough to the door and the other counselors are like

96
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,520
 Oh, look at here. Let me help you. They had to tie the boy down with bed sheets

97
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:03,640
 Because he wanted to run out to the UFO so badly that a time down and

98
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:11,600
 He was sitting there struggling against the sheets begging pleading to be let go so he could be with them and

99
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,160
 Then after a period of time

100
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:20,000
 That didn't sound like you

101
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,800
 That didn't sound like it was from another world

102
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,860
 It's not like I ran out of breath during the UFO effect after a period of time the UFO begins to leave

103
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,860
 *Makes weird noises*

104
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,860
 *Bing*

105
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,240
 And then the young boy Joe

106
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,240
 *Sigh*

107
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,240
 Such a pleasurable moan

108
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,000
 I don't think it sounded like that my notes actually just said that he stopped he calmed down

109
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,120
 It didn't say that he went oh my what it what what an erotic adventure it just said he calmed down

110
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,120
 *Laughs*

111
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,120
 That weird noise anyways that

112
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:06,680
 Is from I got that from thinkaboutadox.com. They got it from a source called x library

113
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,840
 UFO Russia and we've talked so much about Russian UFO encounters

114
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,360
 They were covered up for years and years and years

115
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:23,760
 They were never getting out from behind the iron curtain and a lot of these stories weren't even reported because the KGB like you know in America

116
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,280
 We had the FBI and the CIA

117
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:32,720
 Looking into all sorts of people saying that they're seeing these UFOs some of them

118
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,880
 They knew was test equipment you know stuff we were testing and some of it

119
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,280
 They didn't know what it was and then you have the stories of the men in black a

120
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:46,000
 Ultra secret government agency or maybe not even of this world also investigating this stuff

121
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,360
 Russia you have the KGB and if you're like hey, I saw something weird in the sky

122
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,360
 *Laughs*

123
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,880
 Basically got punched in the stomach for a couple days until you

124
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:01,000
 Until you either said you didn't see something in the sky because it was part of their secret

125
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,600
 Warfare their weapon testing stuff or they wanted to know if you were a

126
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:14,440
 US spy or you know you were crazy or whatever like people were not people were not openly admitting they saw UFOs

127
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:20,880
 But once the iron curtain fell once the KGB became they just changed the letters in their name. They're still

128
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,080
 Anyways, I want to get beat up. Who are they now grew? I think it is GRU

129
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,080
 But yeah, they they stopped punching so much. I think nowadays now

130
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,400
 I think they only just go with a right hook for a while and then they let you go

131
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:41,280
 But you would now that the iron curtain has fallen the Soviet Union has fallen. We're getting a ton of stories out of the

132
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:47,920
 Russia region, which is cool for us, but let's take a look at this one in particular

133
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,040
 When I read this I thought

134
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:57,200
 You we covered a story recently about a guy who went crazy during a UFO encounter and wanted to like join the aliens

135
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,800
 I'll try to find that episode in the show notes. It was late last season

136
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,640
 I'm trying to remember what what the exact details was but I think it was two friends and one of them wanted to stay and he had

137
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,680
 To be like forced or one of them wanted to go with the aliens and he had to be forced to stay

138
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:16,320
 Something like that and then I had this story as well and I thought how stressful must this be?

139
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,520
 Like how the situation of already being confronted with something

140
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,720
 That yeah, sure

141
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:31,280
 I believe in aliens and I think the recent poll was like 52% of Americans believe that

142
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:38,120
 Extraterrestrials exist, but a big amount of those numbers are sure. Yeah, somewhere in the universe. There's alien life

143
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:45,120
 Like that's a huge chunk of that to actually the people actually believe were regularly being visited by aliens the numbers much smaller

144
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:54,240
 So even if you I you know, I believe in aliens, but if all of a sudden I'm confronted with an alien life form

145
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,400
 I would imagine it'd be very very stressful. You notice on a lot of these alien stories

146
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,120
 We just covered one yesterday the first the alien say is be calm

147
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:12,020
 Calm down that is almost always the first thing the aliens say even the ones that appear in human form say hey chill

148
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,680
 Okay, be cool

149
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:20,480
 Because it would be extremely stressful to meet an alien because all of a sudden you have your whole paradigm shift

150
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,000
 Even if you believe in aliens now, it's proof and if you mildly believe in aliens

151
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,620
 It's proof of something that you kind of considered and if you don't believe in aliens at all this world shattering

152
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,560
 It could destroy your entire way you look at reality

153
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,080
 So that's already stressful enough now imagine

154
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,640
 Experiencing it with total strangers or people you know kind of well these campers

155
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,400
 They forged friendships along the way camp counselors

156
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:51,640
 They might not even like some of these kids. They're just doing the job. It's just kind of a regular assemblage of people and

157
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,200
 Then this happens

158
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,200
 And you're thrust into this life-changing event that you don't know how it's gonna end

159
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,680
 I mean we're reading the story later and it's just something that I'm talking about in a haunted closet

160
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,760
 But it's a moment in time. They have no idea how it's going to end

161
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:12,440
 Is this the first wave of an invasion? Is everyone gonna get nuked off the area? Is everyone gonna get abducted?

162
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,520
 You don't know so there's that level of stress

163
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:20,440
 You're being confronted with the unknown in front of a bunch of people that you barely know which would make it even worse

164
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:27,960
 And then one of the one of these Nimrods decides to make the situation worse by running towards them

165
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:34,040
 Like there's all just such a level of stress to this story that I find fascinating and that young

166
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,840
 Woman running out after him grabbing him and dragging him back. Like I don't know if I would

167
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:43,720
 I mean, I guess it is her job to keep him safe. She's a camp counselor, but

168
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,920
 So you have all of that you have all of that stress on there, right?

169
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:56,920
 Someone trying to actually go towards this unknown force and then really the ultimate question is what was prompting him to do that

170
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,120
 It could have been two things. It could have been

171
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:06,200
 The idea that the aliens were communicating with him, which again is very common in UFO lore

172
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,640
 You have aliens sending telepathic messages and selecting people

173
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:17,000
 A lot of times they say aliens only appear to you if you are chosen. That's why not everyone sees UFOs and then

174
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,920
 There's even a time we've covered couple stories like this where the aliens

175
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,320
 Choose you and then they run a test on you and say no, you're not going to meet our needs and they leave you

176
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,440
 So there does seem to be some sort of selection process was he selected

177
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,480
 But then also you got to wonder if his brain just broke

178
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:40,120
 Like if he wasn't selected the aliens were there for some other reason and this kid confronted with something

179
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,440
 1980 Russia even in America in the 1980s

180
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,760
 Like we were aware of little green men and it was more of a jokey thing with aliens

181
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,480
 Like people who believed in aliens when I was a kid were considered cuckoo

182
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,600
 cuckoo like total wackadoodle they'd write these books and stuff like that in tinfoil hats

183
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:03,960
 And that and that was in a place where you had freedom of press and people were putting out these books like chariots of the gods

184
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,960
 And you were able to watch these shows

185
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,360
 Like in search of Leonard Nimoy's

186
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,080
 Documentary and all that stuff

187
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:16,920
 Imagine in a repressive government where information is completely controlled and you didn't have that stuff

188
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:22,200
 You probably didn't even have star trek. You were vaguely aware of aliens. Maybe

189
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,480
 in 1980s Russia

190
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,800
 And you're being confronted with this if we saw a giant

191
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:35,560
 Vehicle descend from the sky at least we can put it into context mean like oh that might be aliens

192
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:42,040
 But if you had no concept of aliens you're 14 15 years old growing up in this area, it would totally break your brain

193
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,560
 I think you wouldn't be able to I think I think it would break your brain

194
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,400
 Even if you didn't know about aliens if you're a valiant. I've seen a couple episodes of the x-files

195
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,080
 Great alien watch your room. You're not gonna be like hey, what's up? How's molder doing?

196
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,240
 It's still gonna affect you but imagine if you didn't have any context for it and you saw that happening

197
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,720
 So was this kid actually being contacted by the aliens or did was the event so traumatic?

198
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,440
 He broke

199
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:10,120
 I think I lean more towards the telepathic thing because when the vehicle left he seemed to return to normal but

200
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:17,080
 My thing is if the aliens we've seen their power level before if they wanted him they would have marched right into that camp and taken him

201
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:22,200
 They would have frozen everyone in the camp the kid would have been gone missing

202
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:28,440
 Right right from the bedsheets. We've seen the power level of these things. So maybe he just went nuts

203
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,360
 Which is again a very terrifying answer because how can you really

204
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:38,520
 How do we know how we're really going to react to when we're placed in a situation such a stressful situation like that?

205
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:43,320
 Will we be able to kind of keep our wits about us or will we find ourselves running towards?

206
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,120
 the unknown because

207
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,600
 At this point everything's unknown everything you ever thought about the world is

208
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,560
 wrong

209
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,680
 You see this giant ship land and you realize that

210
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,320
 everything you've been told that rationally

211
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:07,320
 Happens and rationally exists just doesn't the rules of the universe has changed creepy telepathic communication or did the kid go insane?

212
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,600
 We don't know

213
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,400
 But an interesting story and i'm glad I could share it with you the last kwam kwat

214
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,560
 Let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the carbonic copter. We're leaving behind russia

215
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,440
 We are heading all the way out to

216
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,320
 a small town

217
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,320
 On the edge of the woods

218
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:36,920
 I found this story on the export so as much as I love the export it does have the limitations of

219
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,320
 Everyone they're post anonymously

220
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:45,560
 We don't have names. We don't have dates. We don't even have a location for this story, but that's fine

221
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,240
 Right, it's still I think a very very interesting tale

222
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:56,680
 But I from what I can put together there's a key detail that makes me think this story takes place somewhere in

223
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:01,640
 Western europe it could be totally wrong about that it doesn't affect the story too much but just

224
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,520
 Because kwam kwat's flying the carbonic copter. I think we're going to be somewhere in western europe

225
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,080
 Because we're going to be visiting a bar

226
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,520
 That is centuries old

227
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,760
 In america america is only about 200 and some odd years old

228
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:21,640
 So I don't think it takes place in america. I think it takes place somewhere in britain or france or something like that

229
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:27,320
 So just fly the carbonic copter and we're just going to jump up jump out of the carbonic copter somewhere around this region

230
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,520
 And we're going to meet a young man named mark. That's your real name just a guess

231
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,560
 but mark

232
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:42,680
 Is at a crossroads in his life when the story takes place. He's 23 years old. He's in between jobs

233
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,560
 He doesn't seem like he's had a very pleasant experience

234
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,600
 in life

235
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
 He says that his dad was kind of a jerk

236
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,400
 And taught him, you know never back down from a fight never turn your back on someone

237
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:03,480
 Always got them fist raised if someone's challenging you and those while those may be good lessons in context

238
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:09,720
 They can also serve you very very poorly if your boss is like mark where's your reports?

239
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,600
 Come on. Don't make me fire you and you're like what'd you say to me?

240
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,040
 I'm like there are certain times where you have to be like, uh

241
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:21,080
 But mark does have a caveat to that because again you sometimes do have to back down from fights

242
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,840
 One thing he also learned

243
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:28,280
 Because this kid seems like he goes out a lot to a lot of clubs a lot of drinking and he's been in a lot of fights

244
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,080
 Mark said one thing that I've learned is I take my social cues

245
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:37,560
 From my friends. So if we go out to a club and some guys talk in trash

246
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:44,360
 And all my friends are like, let's just get out of here. Whatever this club sucks. Anyways, he goes all go with my friends

247
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:50,040
 He goes if we're there and they want to square up and fight i'm down

248
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:55,320
 I'll be the first one to fight but he's not going to put his friends in a situation where

249
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,440
 They don't want to be in basically he goes if they're ready to go. He's ready to go if they're ready to fight

250
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,440
 He's ready to fight but

251
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,640
 If he's not getting those social cues

252
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:12,200
 It's almost like his dad is whispering in his ear. Don't back down

253
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,680
 Mark he's in between jobs and in his best friend

254
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,120
 He says mark, you know what, you know, you're not doing anything right now

255
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:25,080
 Why don't you come and hang out with my family for a couple weeks? I'm gonna go back visit my family

256
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,480
 We live out on the outskirts of the forest

257
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,200
 Some sort of fairy tale gingerbread village. We live out in the boonies

258
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,040
 But once you come to hang out with us, my family's really cool. They'd love to have you

259
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,880
 And so mark and his friend we'll call his friend peter

260
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:46,120
 Mark and peter go out to see peter's family and mark is impressed. His family is super cool

261
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,800
 He's exactly kind of what he needed right now. He just kind of didn't need

262
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,520
 some chill time

263
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,600
 But peter's grandpa while seeming like a cool guy is

264
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,720
 quiet

265
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:05,400
 But not quiet in the way that he's shy before he says something you can tell he

266
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,000
 Thinks about what he's going to say. He considers

267
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,960
 the phrases he uses

268
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:17,880
 Doesn't speak all the time, but when he speaks it means something

269
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:26,040
 And when that first night they're all hanging out grandpa turns to mark and says, you know, you're a city boy

270
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,520
 so

271
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,520
 Make sure you're in the house

272
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,520
 before nightfall

273
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:39,080
 mark thinks this comment's kind of weird, but he understands he is coming from a city and here's this old man

274
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,160
 Who's lived his entire life in this region?

275
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,480
 mark says, you know

276
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,800
 That's nice. That's nice that you're warning me and all but don't worry about me. I'm not just a city boy

277
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,520
 I've actually been hunting. I've spent some time in the woods

278
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,960
 And the grandpa looked at mark and said

279
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,920
 Not these woods

280
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,040
 And mark thought this comment was kind of odd

281
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,400
 And it made him really curious, right? Here's this old man

282
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:11,000
 Doesn't speak of things lightly. All right. This is just the presence that this grandpa gives and mark asked

283
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,400
 What do you mean about that?

284
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,360
 And as the grandpa begins to mention

285
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,280
 Something about the woods something being in the woods

286
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:25,480
 The rest of peters family kind of cuts off grandpa changes the subject

287
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,840
 And the grandpa just drops it

288
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,880
 One night all the men in the family go out to this local bar

289
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,600
 So you got mark you got peter you got grandpa

290
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:44,280
 And then you have peter's dad and peter's uncle and they're going out to this bar

291
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:49,560
 And they make sure to tell mark thought this was another odd thing as they're going to the bar they kept

292
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:57,160
 Making sure that mark knew how old this bar was. They said the bar we're about to go to is older than your great

293
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,880
 great grandpa

294
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,040
 This bar is centuries old

295
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:07,240
 Mark's like, yeah, okay, you know, I don't know if like you're warning me the plumbing doesn't work or anything

296
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,640
 He goes they really really kept emphasizing how old this bar was

297
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:18,120
 Mark didn't really think anything of it a neat piece of trivia. Sure, but you only got to say it once you don't got to keep

298
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,760
 reemphasizing it

299
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,080
 Walks into normal bar

300
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,320
 Right. I mean it is old

301
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,960
 But you know barkeep

302
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:33,480
 patrons tables and most importantly alcohol kind of what you need for a bar

303
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,440
 So mark's sitting there with peter's family. They're sitting around drinking

304
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,480
 Talking having a good time

305
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,080
 And then at one point in the night

306
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,560
 Mark is drinking his beer and he looks over at peter and peter

307
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,000
 Is nervous

308
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,040
 He's giving off this energy right now

309
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:05,000
 That he doesn't want to be here anymore and mark picks up on it right away and he looks and sees what

310
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,280
 Peter's looking at and then peter immediately looks down at the table

311
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,520
 But mark is now looking across the bar

312
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,040
 and what he realizes is

313
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:24,360
 Everyone is gone. The bar is empty now save for this group of men

314
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:30,760
 And a dude sitting by the door

315
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:36,440
 Even the bartender is gone

316
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:47,400
 Mark looks at this figure sitting by the door and he sees kind of a

317
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,320
 He looks like a big guy not overly large, but

318
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,280
 And before he can really take in any more detail he feels

319
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,480
 grandpa's hand dig into

320
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,360
 his bicep

321
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,000
 Grandpa has mark's arm in a death grip

322
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,040
 And he turns and he looks back at grandpa

323
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:15,800
 And grandpa while holding mark's arm squeezing it is staring down at the table

324
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:22,760
 Mark is looking at the table that he's at and everyone is just staring down at the table

325
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,560
 No one is moving the room

326
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,200
 is tense

327
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,600
 And mark thinks maybe this guy's like some super high level criminal in the area right?

328
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:37,080
 He's not familiar with this area. This could be some big drug runner. It could be

329
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:41,800
 No one hit man in the area some sort of organized crime guy, but

330
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,640
 This feels different

331
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,520
 Sure people may be deferential towards a crime lord and their area are just scared

332
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,000
 But something is different here

333
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,080
 And he turns to get another look at the man

334
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:04,200
 And grandpa squeezes mark's arm even harder so hard now

335
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,400
 It's hurting him

336
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,960
 And that is when peter nudges

337
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,040
 mark

338
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,040
 And hisses don't

339
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,040
 look

340
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 And right when peter says that

341
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,120
 The man at the door gets up out of his chair

342
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,000
 And begins walking towards the table

343
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:31,880
 Mark is sitting there and he looks up at this guy

344
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,600
 As he's walking towards him and he gets a better look at him. He has

345
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,400
 Shockingly red hair

346
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,560
 He's young ish. He's a youngish man broad-shouldered

347
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,120
 But normal looking

348
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:51,880
 Not covered in these crazy tattoos doesn't look like he's been in a thousand bar fights. Doesn't look like some sort of crazy criminal

349
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,680
 Just a normal looking guy

350
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,640
 walking towards them

351
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,400
 And mark is drunk at this point

352
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:09,560
 And he's looking at the table of his compatriots and he's wondering what do I do?

353
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,720
 He's looking for that social cue

354
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:19,320
 Now if everyone at the table said let's get up and leave he would have got up and left with him

355
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:24,760
 And he can tell that there is obviously something going on at this table. They're scared of him

356
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,320
 But what do I do?

357
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,000
 This guy's walking towards us now

358
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,240
 Do I look down at my drink like that doesn't make sense to me? He's walking towards us

359
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,880
 Mark is sitting there at the table. He makes direct eye contact with the man

360
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,480
 And the man stops in the center of the bar

361
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:52,520
 Mark looks deep into the stranger's eyes and says

362
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,640
 What are you looking at?

363
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,920
 When he says that

364
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,560
 grandpa lets go of mark's arm

365
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:09,000
 And everyone at that table is just pretending that none of this is happening. They're just silently staring

366
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,740
 down at the table trying to ignore

367
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:15,880
 Reality

368
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,480
 Mark gets up

369
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:25,160
 He's holding his beer in one hand. He walks over to the stranger and says we got a problem

370
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,760
 Stranger's just staring at mark

371
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:34,520
 And now for the first time this evening

372
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,600
 Mark feels it

373
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,960
 He feels like he's

374
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,600
 tapped into this energy that everyone else

375
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,400
 was feeling

376
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,400
 Something is wrong here

377
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:54,760
 Mark is staring at this young man and mark starts to wonder

378
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,360
 Is this guy even human?

379
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,720
 He's terrified

380
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:06,120
 He's petrified in a way. He's never been scared like this before

381
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:11,960
 But he doesn't know how to back down. He's almost too terrified to even move

382
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,400
 So what he does is the same bombastic

383
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,160
 Comments that you always make in a club when you're getting ready to fight

384
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,040
 It's time for you to leave buddy

385
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,520
 Trying to

386
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:28,280
 Bluff his way out of this trying to get the guy to turn around and walk away

387
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,640
 But all mark wants to do

388
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,400
 is walk away

389
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,160
 He feels like he's going to piss his pants right there his pride

390
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:41,080
 And his fear are colliding in this moment

391
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,800
 He can't back down

392
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,120
 But he just wants to disappear

393
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:54,920
 And when pride and fear collide it makes you make dumb decisions and mark raises his right fist

394
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:58,440
 He's just going to do what he always does. He's going to knock this stranger out

395
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,560
 And as he raises his fist to throw a punch

396
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,200
 The stranger catches his hand

397
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:11,560
 And immediately mark's skin begins to burn

398
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:18,520
 He said the guy got a hold of his right wrist. He just grabbed it

399
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:24,760
 Mid punch and this guy's grip is holding right onto him and he goes it felt like his skin was acid

400
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,120
 I could feel it burning my skin

401
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:35,320
 I didn't know what this dude was. I didn't know I couldn't even comprehend what could actually be happening

402
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:40,760
 Was this guy was this guy like a chemical worker? Was he secreting some sort of caustic fluid?

403
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,800
 and almost

404
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,880
 The the pain was so intense

405
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,920
 My brain was just kind of not working. I'm screaming in pain

406
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:58,200
 And I also remember at this point. I'm holding a beer in my left hand and I smash it against this guy's face

407
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:05,160
 I let out this deep roar and I just lay a left right into this dude's face

408
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:09,480
 And the dude let me go

409
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,600
 When that beer smashed into the stranger's face

410
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,320
 He released my right wrist

411
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,120
 turned

412
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,120
 silently walked away

413
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,240
 And then he left the bar

414
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:28,280
 But my wrist continued to burn

415
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,960
 I'm looking down at my wrist

416
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:39,400
 Trying to figure out how he did that trying to figure out when this pain would go away when the bar keep walks back in from a back room

417
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,400
 Pretending like none of this ever happened

418
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,280
 Peter's family gets up from the booth

419
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,760
 They're immediately asking is everything okay. How's everything going? Are you fine?

420
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,520
 And I bluff yeah

421
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,000
 Yeah, I'm fine. Just need another drink is all

422
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,120
 But I'm terrified

423
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,160
 And they know I'm terrified

424
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:07,880
 We go back to Peter's family's house

425
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,680
 drinking

426
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,680
 playing cards

427
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,760
 Just talking

428
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,760
 We stay up

429
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,760
 until the sun rises even grandpa

430
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,640
 stayed up

431
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,640
 till the morning

432
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,480
 Which is good because I didn't want to go to sleep

433
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,040
 And we drank and we played cards and we talked

434
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,920
 But we never talked

435
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,480
 about what happened in that bar

436
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:43,720
 Life goes on, you know, I was just visiting for a couple weeks

437
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,520
 I go back to the city

438
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,560
 Start looking for work just continue my life

439
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,960
 but

440
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,720
 To this day

441
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,720
 Mark's wrist

442
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,960
 Is numb

443
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:04,520
 He says right where that guy touched me. I have no feeling in that part of my wrist. It's completely numb

444
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,280
 He said I went to the doctor get a check down and he had this little pin

445
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:13,240
 And he kept poking it. He says he poked it 10 times. I can't feel anything and the doctor goes

446
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,000
 Based on your symptoms. I think you had a mild stroke

447
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,400
 But you definitely have no feeling you definitely cannot feel anything in your wrist

448
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:27,240
 And he's told this story. He was talking about one of his girlfriends. He said that she was just a weirdo

449
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,320
 When she would bite it she would bite his wrist as hard as she could

450
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,880
 He wouldn't feel it

451
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:39,720
 And he told her about what happened at the bar, but she just said I think the doctor is right

452
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:45,160
 I think he just had a mild stroke. I don't believe anyone could be carrying acid on their skin or whatever

453
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:49,000
 Maybe another bite on your wrist will persuade me

454
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,240
 And he says

455
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:57,960
 When I look back on that situation, I think that I came out of it on sheer luck

456
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,840
 This thing could have taken me apart

457
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,560
 But I escaped

458
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,200
 Just out of

459
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,360
 luck

460
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,960
 He didn't overwhelm it with physical force. He didn't scare it away

461
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,960
 The thing

462
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,160
 Decided not to kill him. It wasn't because of anything

463
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:23,160
 That mark did his life was literally in this stranger's hands

464
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:29,960
 And he says he's asked his friend because obviously his friend was familiar with this person

465
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:35,560
 Right friend was nervous the second he realized this guy was in the bar. He asked his friend

466
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,880
 He's asked him a couple times. Hey, what was that?

467
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,800
 You know now that he's safely at home and life has returned normal

468
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,360
 What was up with that guy at the bar and his friend?

469
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:48,120
 Responds when he asked this question his friend responds quote

470
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,960
 It doesn't matter now

471
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,720
 And it's better you don't know

472
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:59,640
 Unquote

473
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:10,760
 It's fascinating story obviously the idea of cryptids being in the woods being on the outskirts that is as old as humanity the werewolf in between towns

474
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:20,360
 But when you it would make sense that you would have some of these beings interacting with us in our

475
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:24,520
 infrastructure in our big cities would be perfect for cryptids to hunt

476
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,800
 sewage sewage systems

477
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,040
 Obviously subways things like that

478
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,760
 But bars as well

479
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:40,040
 Right and you think this was a some sort of cryptid that came out of the woods something old and ancient that the people in this area knew of

480
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,280
 And they knew to avoid

481
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:47,960
 And I keep using the word cryptid but I actually have another theory for what this could be

482
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:52,280
 Recently, I think it was a week or two ago. I did an episode the missing 411

483
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:58,440
 multidimensional man-bear demons versus the us army and in that one we were talking about the nephilim

484
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:04,680
 We were talking about giants living up at where was it mount sin helens mount shasta one of the two

485
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,680
 giant

486
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,280
 red-headed

487
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,480
 nephilim

488
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,600
 right

489
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:16,840
 And the idea of the red hair being connected to the nephilim is very very common in

490
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:22,520
 Modern nephilim lore. I don't think it's actually in the bible where it's specified. They have red hair

491
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:30,360
 But on a lot of modern accounts that are connected to giants or to the nephilim the nephilim are when an angel and a human woman have a child

492
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,240
 It's

493
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:36,280
 known as the nephilim red hair is very commonly connected to we did an episode about

494
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:44,200
 Do the nephilim look like clowns? Is that why people find clowns so terrifying because they have pale skin and red hair?

495
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:49,320
 And i'm wondering if that's what this could have been as well

496
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,960
 Now nephilim they're usually these giant eight foot tall people

497
00:36:53,960 --> 00:37:00,040
 But again, that's kind of a misnomer in the bible. It says the nephilim these men were giants heroes of renown

498
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:04,680
 um, and it may be not necessarily a giant physical stature

499
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,760
 But a giant reputation a character like hercules for example

500
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:14,040
 Was not physically eight nine feet tall, but he was giant in the sense that

501
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,600
 Everyone knew who he was. He was a hero

502
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,040
 So is that what he faced down?

503
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:25,800
 This man this human looking person with red hair, but the heart

504
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,600
 of a corrupted angel

505
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:36,760
 A creature something not of this world or of heaven or of hell, but something else

506
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,200
 All of them and nothing at the same time

507
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,200
 That operates in this area

508
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:51,880
 And the people in town know well enough that when he walks into this bar or when he walks anywhere in town

509
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:56,680
 That part of town shuts down and you just pretend that he's not there

510
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,600
 But he is

511
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:06,200
 A terrifying story because it could have gone either way whether this guy was ecripted

512
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:11,560
 Whether this guy was a nephilim or just some lunatic drug lord who happened to shoot acid out of his hands

513
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:18,760
 Uh mark could have easily just disappeared right and the fact that this town was so terrified to even acknowledge the sky's existence

514
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:23,080
 Had this guy ripped mark apart in front of all these witnesses and then left the bar

515
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,640
 Mark would have just disappeared

516
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:32,760
 They would have cleaned up the area and they would have kept a code of silence like they already keep a code of silence

517
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,680
 This is a town of secrets

518
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:40,200
 And whoever this individual was

519
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:46,360
 His identity was known to the people in the town or at least his reputation was

520
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,400
 They knew this guy was not

521
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,280
 from around here

522
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,880
 And they kept this secret

523
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,040
 They hoped when they took mark out to the bar that they would never even meet this guy, right?

524
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:04,680
 But he did show up and an outsider had an encounter with him

525
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:08,280
 He didn't know the rules. He didn't know how you're supposed to deal with the stranger, but

526
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,120
 To everyone else in town. This wasn't a stranger. It was

527
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:15,320
 A phenomenon they knew

528
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,960
 to avoid

529
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:24,040
 One of the things that I think's easy to forget about stories like this is they are told by survivors

530
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:29,800
 And there are countless stories where people go missing or people die

531
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,480
 And we are left wondering what happened

532
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,840
 And we never know

533
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:44,360
 We don't know if it was a natural death or a natural disappearance falling down a crevasse or something like that

534
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:51,560
 Because the only time we know that it's paranormal when someone survives it and says man, you won't believe what happened

535
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:55,160
 I was out at a russian summer camp and the ufo showed up

536
00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:03,800
 Or I went to a bar and I ran into someone who wasn't quite human because this town was so good at keeping secrets was so good at following

537
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,040
 the rules

538
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:12,840
 To avoid these things that had mark lost this fight had this creature completely

539
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,720
 decimated mark

540
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,040
 They would have just cleaned up the mess

541
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,920
 and gone on with their lives

542
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,880
 peter would have a horrible secret

543
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,080
 He invited his best friend to hang out with him

544
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,120
 And he got his best friend killed

545
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:35,000
 But the world would never know this story

546
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,040
 It would just be one more secret

547
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,240
 In a town full of secrets

548
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,920
 But we know about this story because mark survived

549
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:51,240
 The world of the paranormal is only known

550
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,720
 Because of people who make it back alive

551
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:00,520
 So think about that

552
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,400
 Before you hope to someday see proof

553
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:11,480
 That aliens or ghosts or cryptids exist

554
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:16,680
 Because you may find proof but

555
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:23,560
 You may not be lucky enough to live to tell the tale
