1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
 A man is the victim of a horrible crime and 911 puts him on hold.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,760
 What?

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:13,360
 A small town in Brazil uncovers a disgusting pile that may lead to a dark conspiracy.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,360
 It's a pile of what?

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,360
 Who knows?

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,360
 You have to keep listening.

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:24,040
 And then we stay in Brazil to look at a man who had a close encounter of the burned kind.

8
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:36,280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,280
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,280
 I'm having a great day.

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,400
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,760
 First off, it's weird the past couple of nights.

14
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,560
 I get this weird feeling in my bedroom.

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,280
 I have to use the bathroom a lot because I'm old.

16
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,520
 When the older you get, the more you have to use the bathroom.

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,920
 Plus I drink a lot.

18
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,560
 I go in to use the bathroom.

19
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,560
 It's my bedroom.

20
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,760
 I don't want to come out for the past couple of nights.

21
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,640
 I don't want to turn my back to the like, it's getting creepy bro.

22
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,520
 I sleep in my living room because it's just the weird thing that I have.

23
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,520
 Sleep in the living room.

24
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,880
 I've been most of my time in the living room.

25
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,880
 Sun goes down.

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,200
 I have to still go to the bathroom.

27
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,640
 I go into my bathroom.

28
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,640
 It's creepy.

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,640
 I don't know.

30
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,640
 I don't know if it's just me.

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,920
 I don't know if it's just stress.

32
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,400
 Most likely is both of those things rather than some sort of phantasm trying to get me

33
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,880
 after urinating.

34
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,320
 But yeah dude, it sucks.

35
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,320
 So I'll keep you guys informed.

36
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,040
 I'll keep you guys informed of my impending nervous breakdown because I think there's

37
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,720
 a goblin in my bedroom is how it would be the best way to say that.

38
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,760
 Also let's give a shout out to our newest Patreon supporter.

39
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,760
 We got Sean in the house.

40
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,400
 Sean, thank you so much for supporting the show.

41
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,400
 Really, really helps out a lot.

42
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,880
 You're going to be our pilot.

43
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,840
 You're going to be our captain this episode.

44
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,840
 Really, really means a lot.

45
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,040
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too guys.

46
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,200
 Just help get the word out about the show.

47
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
 Really, really helps a lot.

48
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,200
 I really, really appreciate it.

49
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,600
 Sean, I'm going to flip you those keys to the carpenter copter.

50
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,280
 First off, we are flying out to Macon, Georgia.

51
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,240
 We're coming over.

52
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,280
 I imagine Georgia has lots of trees.

53
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,280
 Right?

54
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,280
 Florida is all swampy.

55
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,440
 Georgia has a bunch of trees.

56
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,320
 Tennessee, I imagine is all bunch of hills and stuff like that.

57
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,840
 I don't know.

58
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,360
 I don't know anything outside of 10 miles of where I'm currently living.

59
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,080
 We're flying over the trees of Georgia.

60
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,200
 It's May 19th, 2020, so super recent.

61
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,240
 This was a couple days ago.

62
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,880
 Now, this specifically, if you live in Macon, Georgia, you can actually visit this location.

63
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,640
 This may be a new, like, true crime hub.

64
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,120
 Guys, if you live in Macon, Georgia, I know I'm, isn't it Macon?

65
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,720
 Macon, Macon, whatever.

66
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,160
 If you live in Macon, Georgia, get ready to go out there and start tearing down street

67
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,800
 signs because this is going to be an amazing spot for history.

68
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,960
 It's on Forest Hill Road and Northside Drive.

69
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,880
 I guess there's, like, a CVS pharmacy in the area.

70
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,880
 There's a hotel in the area.

71
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,120
 We're going to meet a man named Chris Key, so let's land our helicopter in the parking

72
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,120
 lot of this hotel.

73
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,600
 We're, like, crushing cars and stuff.

74
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,360
 We all jump out of the carpentry copter just in time to see Chris Key.

75
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,520
 He's 56 years old.

76
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,520
 He's a teacher, married teacher.

77
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,120
 He's a normal dude, right?

78
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,240
 If you're not a teacher and you're not married, you are abnormal.

79
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,240
 So we're all abnormal.

80
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,680
 We're the freaks, the chuds crawling out of the helicopter.

81
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,680
 Chris Key's.

82
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,680
 He's a teacher.

83
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,680
 He's married.

84
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,280
 He's at the CVS pharmacy doing normal person stuff.

85
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,280
 He's buying stuff.

86
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,080
 He's trading money for goods and services.

87
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,800
 So after he's done doing normal stuff, he gets in his car and right then two dudes walk

88
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,800
 up and they're like, "Yo," put a gun to his head, "drive to the hotel."

89
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,840
 And he's like, "Oh, I'm just a normal person.

90
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,840
 I'm a teacher.

91
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,840
 I'm married."

92
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,840
 And they're like, "We don't care."

93
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,840
 Actually, I've heard a tip.

94
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,000
 If someone ever has a gun on you, don't say I have a wife and kids or don't be like, like

95
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,600
 pleading like that because a lot of times the people who have the gun may have like

96
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,400
 a crummy life and they're like, "What?

97
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,520
 I don't have wife or kids."

98
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,480
 Like don't, you can be like, "Yo, I'll give you all the money and stuff like that.

99
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,480
 Like here you go."

100
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,640
 But don't be like, "No, my life's totally awesome.

101
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,800
 Please don't kill me.

102
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,800
 Everything's perfect."

103
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,920
 Don't just, you're supposed to humanize yourself but don't brag.

104
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,200
 I guess it would be the, what, I have, not only do I have wife and kids, my wife is Brainy

105
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,280
 Spears and my kids are millionaires.

106
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,280
 Anyways, you should humanize yourself but don't brag.

107
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,360
 That's a tip if you ever get taken hostage.

108
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,720
 That's a dead rabbit radio tip.

109
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,280
 Anyways, I'm a normal person.

110
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,400
 We'll continue the narrative.

111
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,400
 We don't care.

112
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,680
 We're taking you to the hotel and they take them to the hotel and they rob them.

113
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,680
 They take us cash.

114
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,680
 Give us, give me that money.

115
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,800
 Take $70 in cash and they leave.

116
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,840
 Now Chris is like, "No, my normal life has now been destroyed.

117
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,680
 I've been robbed a single time in my life."

118
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,880
 He calls up 911 and for one hour nobody shows up.

119
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,880
 911, what's your emergency?

120
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,880
 Air quotes, emergency.

121
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,880
 We don't, no, no, no, I just got robbed.

122
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,880
 Yeah, whatever.

123
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,880
 We don't believe you.

124
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,680
 So he's doing that for an hour.

125
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,760
 Finally the cops show up and the cops go, he tells the cops the story.

126
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,760
 "Look at me.

127
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,760
 I'm totally normal person.

128
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,760
 I got robbed."

129
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,960
 The cops go, "Sir, listen, what do you think we are?

130
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,960
 Cops?

131
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,560
 What do you think it's our job to go arrest people?

132
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,560
 We can't catch this guy and even if we caught the guy, there's nothing we can do with him."

133
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,960
 Or them, because there's two of them.

134
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,880
 There's nothing we can do.

135
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,400
 So we're not even going to look into this.

136
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,320
 Now Chris is like, "No, this is some, even though I'm a married teacher, this system

137
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,320
 is stacked against me.

138
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,320
 No!"

139
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,640
 Now Chris tells that story.

140
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,520
 That story is all well and good.

141
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,400
 And I think the fact that I've referred to it as a story twice in 10 seconds should let

142
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,880
 you know what's happening.

143
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,000
 He tells the story and it goes viral.

144
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,520
 Some woman with some friend of his posted on Facebook that whole story being like, "You

145
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,080
 won't believe what happened to Chris Keyes."

146
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,040
 I don't think she mentioned him actually, but she goes, "You won't believe what happened

147
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,040
 at the local CVS."

148
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,520
 And she says, "I had a friend who was robbed at CVS a couple months ago and this has happened

149
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,960
 again and the police wouldn't show up and when they finally showed up they said they

150
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,480
 weren't even going to investigate it and if they didn't investigate there's nothing

151
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,480
 you can do."

152
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:03,720
 When you guys go out in public, know who you're going with, make sure you know the surroundings,

153
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,720
 run a buddy system.

154
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
 That's all good advice, right?

155
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,280
 The story wasn't true though.

156
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,520
 And I'm going to tell you this right now.

157
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,880
 Here's another Dead Rabbit radio trip.

158
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:16,640
 If you're going to lie about something like this, don't say the cops are much idiots.

159
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,600
 Because what happened was the post went viral and people started complaining to the police

160
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,680
 department.

161
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,480
 So the chief is like, "Do we have a report of this happening?"

162
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,360
 And the cops are like, "No, we were never called out there."

163
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,960
 Chief goes, "Okay, you need to find out what happened because either this guy's faking

164
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:35,640
 this story or he didn't report a crime, but either way he's making us look bad."

165
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,440
 So if he had just told that story and be like, "I got robbed and I bother not to call the

166
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,240
 cops, there's only 70 bucks, I'm lucky I got away with my life."

167
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,000
 The post still made it went viral, but the cops would have been like, "Well, it's his

168
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,640
 choice whether or not to investigate it."

169
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,640
 The fact that he says it took an hour for the police to show up, they refused to help

170
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,240
 me and they said they're powerless even if they did help me.

171
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,040
 The police obviously look into this.

172
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,840
 Now the real story comes out.

173
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,040
 Chris Key's married teacher, he wants to have gay sex.

174
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:08,200
 So he decides to put an ad on Craigslist and says, "Meet me at this hotel room."

175
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,680
 So he goes to the hotel room, two dudes come in with guns and take 70 bucks from them and

176
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,280
 bounce.

177
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,360
 Now this episode is becoming a lot of Jason advice.

178
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,240
 One, don't cheat on your wife, right?

179
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,240
 That's pretty tacky.

180
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,480
 So don't cheat on your wife.

181
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,480
 That's rule one.

182
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,480
 That's life lesson two.

183
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,060
 Two, if you are going to cheat on your wife, you should use the buddy system.

184
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,840
 You should bring a friend with you in case you get robbed.

185
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,080
 It's funny because all of the advice the girl said at the ending of her post, or she's

186
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,080
 like, "Know the area you're in.

187
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,640
 Know who you're talking to.

188
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,640
 Have the buddy system."

189
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,560
 If he had followed that advice, he never would have gotten robbed in the first place.

190
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,360
 But anyways, he wants to cheat on his wife with another dude.

191
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,480
 He puts it out on Craigslist.

192
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,480
 Dude shows up, robs him.

193
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,760
 He doesn't have the buddy system.

194
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,120
 The robber has a buddy system.

195
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,800
 The robber has another dude with him.

196
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,920
 They take his money and bounce.

197
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,040
 The easiest thing would have been to do is to not told anybody.

198
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,040
 Right?

199
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,280
 I've been a victim of a billion crimes that I've never reported because it's not even

200
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,920
 worth my time to report.

201
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,360
 Now that actually made me sound like I'm a big old wimp.

202
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,360
 But you know what I mean?

203
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,360
 Stuff happens.

204
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
 You get a car accident, whatever.

205
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,280
 I'm not going to call the cops.

206
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,280
 Stuff gets stolen.

207
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,280
 I've had tons of stuff stolen.

208
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,400
 I've never called the cops.

209
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,040
 People breaking into my car, unless I was trying to get insurance out of it.

210
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,560
 If I didn't have insurance, I never called the cops.

211
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,240
 Or insurance that would fix my windows.

212
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,240
 I didn't care.

213
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,080
 Oh man, someone broke into my car, took my bag.

214
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,440
 I cared and I would look for my backpack and I was very, very angry, but I didn't involve

215
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,440
 the cops.

216
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,320
 This guy, he's now in jail for solicitation of sodomy.

217
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,720
 Which I didn't even know was a crime.

218
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,800
 So that's like their solicitation for prostitution.

219
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,720
 Then this one specifically for sodomy.

220
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,520
 He's like, "No, we're only going to do mouth stuff."

221
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,760
 No, no, but it doesn't matter.

222
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,680
 That's the charge.

223
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,160
 He could have just gone home and said, "Oh yeah, I lost $70.

224
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,640
 I tried playing the Lotto and I lost or I left my wallet somewhere."

225
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,960
 She's like, "That's where you still have your wallet."

226
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,840
 He's like, "Oh, but I found my wallet and there was no cash."

227
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,200
 The fact that he then, the fact that he made up the story that the police department of

228
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,800
 Maycon, Georgia is completely incompetent.

229
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,560
 They don't know how to do their jobs.

230
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,760
 Ends it up busting him in the end because it does turn out they do know how to do their

231
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,480
 jobs and they arrested you.

232
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,360
 Now he did get robbed.

233
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,680
 He did get robbed.

234
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,720
 So that part of the story is true.

235
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,680
 The woman who posted it was like, "You know, be careful.

236
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,280
 People are getting robbed in this area."

237
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,440
 Although now I'm thinking her friend who got robbed a couple months ago.

238
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,320
 He might have been at that hotel too.

239
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,320
 So who knows?

240
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,120
 Maybe it is an ongoing mystery.

241
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,600
 But that is now a true crime hub.

242
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,080
 If you live in Maycon, Georgia, I want a photograph of that street corner.

243
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,960
 Send it to me, deadraviradiojmail.com.

244
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,160
 Sean, I want you to fire back up that carbonar copter.

245
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,200
 We are headed out to Brazil now.

246
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,560
 This is a story that was actually sent to me by Bennett.

247
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,240
 I got a huge email from Bennett the other day.

248
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,840
 He's always sending me gold.

249
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,800
 He sent me this big project that we'll be talking about coming up.

250
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,080
 I kind of forgot the best way to present it, but he's definitely done a lot of good stuff

251
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,080
 for the show.

252
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,080
 Really appreciate it.

253
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,080
 This is from Bennett.

254
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,080
 We're landing in Sao Lorenco, Brazil.

255
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,520
 So let's bring that helicopter nice and low flying over the jungle.

256
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,760
 We're going to a bunch of different biomes today.

257
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,160
 We're landing on like a road and we're hopping out.

258
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,680
 It's August 2015.

259
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,520
 Now we're on this like dirt road.

260
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
 That's not racist.

261
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,520
 I saw a photo of it.

262
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,520
 It's dirt.

263
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,520
 I'm not saying all the roads in Brazil are dirty.

264
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,800
 There's like a dirt road.

265
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,480
 And there's a big carnival going on in town.

266
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,800
 Everyone's like...

267
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,400
 We can hear the music from super far away, right?

268
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,240
 And you wish we were at the festival, but I had Sean land the helicopter here.

269
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,240
 We're just in this field by this dusty road.

270
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,640
 And off to the side, we see like a big old pile of stuff.

271
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,720
 And I go, dude, I'll give you five bucks if you run blindfolded and jump into that pile

272
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,720
 of pile of...

273
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,040
 Jump into it like it's a pile of leaves.

274
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,400
 And you're like, is it a pile of leaves?

275
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,840
 And my eyes go from side to side.

276
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,120
 I'm like, yeah, leaves as in a verb.

277
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,600
 Someone left to something and you're like, that's kind of weird.

278
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,280
 But you do it anyways, because you want to have fun on this episode of Dead Wrap Radio.

279
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,800
 So you run and I'm in control of what you do.

280
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,400
 You run and you jump into this big pile.

281
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:16,080
 Now what you have jumped into with or without your permission, I made your body do this.

282
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:24,760
 150... you're now neck deep in a pile of 150 cat and dog tails.

283
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,320
 Jason, get me out of here.

284
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,320
 Get me out of here.

285
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,680
 And then I allow you to move out my mental powers, even the ability to walk you crawl

286
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,680
 out of these.

287
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,020
 Now it's 150 tails of cats and dogs.

288
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,000
 These piles are found all over the area.

289
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,440
 Sometimes there's up to 300 tails in a single pile.

290
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,160
 Sometimes the piles are smaller.

291
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:50,960
 Piles of 800 cat and dog tails are found on roads leading to Sao Lorenco.

292
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,960
 Now there's photos of this.

293
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,080
 I don't suggest looking at them, but there's photos of this stuff.

294
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,440
 This is some sort of urban legend.

295
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,240
 The first suggestion is someone must have been selling animal meat at the festival.

296
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,840
 And they just disposed of all the tails on their way to town to sell the meat.

297
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
 But here's the thing.

298
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,160
 I gave you an incorrect timeline in the beginning just because I wanted to do that little musical

299
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,160
 interlude.

300
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,960
 The tails were actually found after the fair.

301
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,680
 After the carnival is when the tails were found.

302
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,680
 So people go, "Wait a second.

303
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,480
 If people were dropping the tails off as they were coming to town with the meat, we would

304
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,960
 have found the tails as people were also coming to carnival.

305
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,200
 We didn't find them until days after the festival ended."

306
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,600
 So what happened?

307
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,500
 So then people go, "Well, maybe the animals were collected locally, still sold as meat."

308
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,680
 And as the people were leaving town counting their money, they were throwing tails out

309
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,680
 behind them.

310
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,560
 "Binnie, what do you want me to do with these tails?

311
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,280
 We're done with them already.

312
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,000
 Just throw them around.

313
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,440
 Let's sell Lorenco deal with them."

314
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,200
 As their little cars are driving away.

315
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,520
 But people go, "That doesn't make sense either because none of our animals are missing."

316
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,080
 They did a census.

317
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,800
 No one was reporting cats or dogs missing from the area.

318
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,600
 So now they're thinking, "So wait, these aren't our cats and dogs.

319
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,400
 They must have come from another area.

320
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,640
 But why are they being dropped off on our roads?"

321
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,080
 Two suggestions pop up.

322
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,680
 One is the commercial slaughter of animals.

323
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,320
 So they're still going down that route.

324
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,160
 The other one is black magic.

325
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,920
 Someone is sacrificing animals.

326
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,680
 They're dropping the tails off here for some reason.

327
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:28,400
 But again, they can't account for 800 tailless animals or even 800 animals missing in the

328
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,400
 first place.

329
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:34,120
 They actually put a box in the middle of town and they go, "Listen, we know one of you guys

330
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,640
 is killing cats and dogs.

331
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,640
 And it's okay.

332
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,240
 We're not going to do anything to you.

333
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,400
 We just want to know who it is."

334
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,120
 So we're going to put a box in the middle of town.

335
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,880
 There's a reward of $620.

336
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,200
 Anyone can drop a letter in there.

337
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,080
 No one has either admitted to it or rat it someone out.

338
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:55,000
 No one in town knows where these tails are coming from or why they're there.

339
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,840
 And that happened back in August of 2015 and there's been no update to this story.

340
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,200
 It's one of those weirds, and thanks Bennett for sending us that.

341
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,080
 It's one of those weird stories that can be either or.

342
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,480
 It could be a financial motivation.

343
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,320
 Someone just has a bunch of junk laying around.

344
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,960
 They've sold all the meat and they're just throwing the tails out of the cars or driving

345
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,960
 away.

346
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:18,680
 The other one is someone is ritually sacrificing all of these animals and leaving the tails

347
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,960
 is part of the ritual.

348
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,880
 But who knows?

349
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,440
 Nobody knows for sure where these animals came from, why someone's dumping them off

350
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,800
 or what they're doing with the meat.

351
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,040
 But I'm sure that in other parts of Brazil, the mystery continues.

352
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,560
 There may be other villages along the road that they wake up, "Oh, it was having such

353
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,560
 a great day!"

354
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,560
 And they look in the mirror.

355
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,960
 They don't look in the mirror yet.

356
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,960
 Hold on.

357
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,720
 They're brushing their teeth.

358
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,960
 And then they look up and standing behind them is, I don't know, a giant tail.

359
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,960
 That was going to be my joke.

360
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,360
 You look up and there's a giant tail standing behind them in the mirror.

361
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,680
 It doesn't really work.

362
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,960
 They go, "Here's a better one.

363
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,960
 Here's a better one."

364
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,680
 Now that I'm trying out material on my show.

365
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,720
 There's another town, five weeks later, there's another town in Brazil.

366
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,560
 They haven't heard about what happened in this town yet.

367
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,000
 Carnival hasn't reached them.

368
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,400
 This guy goes to lay down in bed and he's like, "Good night, honey.

369
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:13,040
 I'm not going to look at you in the lights off and I'm going to crawl in a bed."

370
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,360
 And then he's snuggling up to her and he goes, "Oh, you're more furry than normal."

371
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,640
 And you feel more detached and a little bit more bloody than you normally do.

372
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,760
 And he's hugging his wife and he starts making out with her.

373
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,760
 And then the light turns on.

374
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,400
 Why am I even continuing this stupid thing?

375
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,520
 The light turns on and his wife's like, "Oh!"

376
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,720
 And then he realizes that his wife is standing at the doorway, turning on the light, and

377
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,520
 he's making out with a bag of cat and dog tails.

378
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:45,440
 And then there's some dude walking through the city with, I don't know, I want him.

379
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,480
 Some dude walked through the city with a hood on and he has a bag of cat and dog tails and

380
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,480
 he's like, "I don't know.

381
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,200
 I don't think I'm officially lost my mind.

382
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,200
 But let's go on.

383
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,200
 What was that?

384
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:03,480
 Let's go ahead and move on to the next story while I still have some semblance of a thought

385
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,480
 process.

386
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,960
 Sean, I want you to fire up that Jason Jalapi.

387
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:12,160
 We're leaving behind the man with the bag of cat tails who's also causing people to

388
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,040
 have sex with him somehow.

389
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:19,640
 We're going out to a town known as Araki Gama.

390
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,520
 Araki Gama, that's in Brazil.

391
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,480
 Now a lot of this story, there's a couple stories on this, but I got the bulk of my

392
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:31,360
 information from an article called "Burning Man of Brazil" written by Dr. Abner Malady.

393
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,440
 I don't think he's a real medical doctor.

394
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,680
 This is from a website called Warmwood Chronicles.

395
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,560
 So thank you, Dr. Abner Malady.

396
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,480
 Again, I want to see that.

397
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,080
 I want to see where you got your medical degree.

398
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,200
 This is a story that takes place on March 4th, 1946.

399
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,000
 It's fairly well documented.

400
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 There's been a couple different versions of the story and there have been witnesses that

401
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,800
 have come forward and things like that.

402
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,520
 Sean pulls up to this town.

403
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,480
 It's a population of about 7,000 people, so it's a pretty big town.

404
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,840
 But on this particular night, on March 4th, 1946, on the outskirts of this town, the way

405
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:08,440
 outskirts of this town, about 2 miles away, there is a house and it is populated by the

406
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,120
 Philho family.

407
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,120
 And there's a carnival going on.

408
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,720
 There's a lot of carnivals in this episode.

409
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,520
 There's a big carnival going on.

410
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,320
 So his family is not home.

411
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,440
 The family of Jau Prestes Philho.

412
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,440
 Jau?

413
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,440
 How?

414
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,440
 How?

415
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,440
 How?

416
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,440
 Mr. Philho.

417
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,040
 Mr. Philho's family is not present.

418
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,160
 They're at the carnival.

419
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,440
 So Mr. Philho had just gone fishing with his buddy and his buddy and him were walking through

420
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,080
 the jungle alone.

421
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:40,280
 Then the buddy peels off to go to his house and Mr. Philho goes home to his house alone.

422
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,280
 Door's locked.

423
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,320
 Oh, are you kidding me, dude?

424
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,040
 My family's 2 miles away.

425
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,560
 I don't have the keys.

426
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,480
 I didn't really plan this out well.

427
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,200
 But I'm skinny enough I will crawl through my window.

428
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,400
 So he crawls through his window and he's now in his pitch black house and then he sees

429
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:03,760
 a bright light outside of his house.

430
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:09,560
 Automatically draws his attention and he turns and looks and this fiery orb comes into his

431
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,160
 house and then torches him.

432
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:18,840
 He feels a heat beam hit the entire upper half of his body.

433
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,720
 In an instant he's burning.

434
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,200
 He's not on fire.

435
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,760
 But his skin is fried.

436
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,760
 Ah!

437
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,760
 Ah!

438
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,760
 He begins screaming.

439
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,600
 But there's no one around to hear him.

440
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,840
 There's no one around him for 2 miles.

441
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,000
 The orb disappears.

442
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,640
 And he looks down at his hands and they're burned into claws.

443
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,760
 He can't even move his fingers.

444
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,760
 It's just torched.

445
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,760
 Ah!

446
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,880
 He can feel the burns on his face.

447
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,240
 He can feel the burns on his upper body.

448
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,960
 He doesn't have a phone.

449
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,040
 He doesn't have a car.

450
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,640
 He can't even put his shoes back on because his hands are all melted and stuff.

451
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,640
 No!

452
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,680
 I shouldn't have taken my shoes off immediately.

453
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,680
 He thinks.

454
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,680
 But then he also thinks, "Ah!

455
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,320
 I'm burning!"

456
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:13,320
 He has to walk for 2 miles barefoot along this dirt path to get to town.

457
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,760
 And you're like, "Jayson the dude just got horribly burned."

458
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,560
 I don't think he's like, "Ouch!

459
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,200
 He stepped on a rock.

460
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,680
 But I hate stepping on rocks."

461
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,080
 So when I read that I was like, "Ouch!"

462
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,040
 It's funny because it's hard for us to be empathetic of pain.

463
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,640
 Getting your arm chopped off with a chainsaw, that hasn't happened to me.

464
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,080
 So I'm not like, "Ooh!"

465
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,680
 But watching someone get like a splinter or peel back a nail, that really...

466
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,320
 Some of you guys had to add a reaction when I said that too.

467
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,800
 So we've all walked barefoot and stepped on rocks.

468
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,400
 I've never been torched by a...

469
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,400
 Whatever this thing was.

470
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,400
 We'll get into it in a second.

471
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,600
 Actually, we'll get into it right now.

472
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,480
 As he's walking these 2 miles, he believes he knows what got him.

473
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,000
 You see, in this area of Brazil, and it's actually all over Brazil, but...

474
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,400
 There's a thing called a "boitata."

475
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
 A boitata.

476
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,400
 It's a fire spirit.

477
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,600
 It's a malevolent fire spirit.

478
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,720
 And it's basically a lot of times it will attack you if you disrespect nature.

479
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,440
 Sometimes they'll just fly by in the sky.

480
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,960
 They won't really affect you.

481
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,240
 But other times they're like, "Uh-uh, I'm messing this dude up."

482
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,640
 And they'll burn you.

483
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,240
 When he was younger, he was once leading a donkey thing.

484
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,240
 Like a donkey cart.

485
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,200
 It was a cart full of donkeys being pulled by another donkey.

486
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,160
 And he sees one of those boitatas.

487
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,400
 He sees this flaming ball of light streak down from the sky.

488
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,140
 And he said, "It came so close to him and the donkeys.

489
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,480
 He felt that he was radiating off the orb."

490
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,840
 So we'd seen these things before.

491
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,880
 Now near the town, there was the mine known as the Moro Velho.

492
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,600
 It was one of the deepest...

493
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,480
 It's still one of the deepest mines today, up until the year 1918.

494
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,040
 It was the deepest mine in the world.

495
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,920
 Nowadays it's about 9,800 feet deep.

496
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,280
 So a lot of people have died there.

497
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,760
 A lot of people have talked about it, you know, like drilling into the earth.

498
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,440
 What spirits are being unleashed.

499
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,720
 So these boitatas would be seen in the area.

500
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,760
 Some people believed it was actually the ghost of dead miners.

501
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:14,800
 But whatever they were, miners as in people mining, not dead kids, people would say,

502
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,640
 "We see this phenomenon."

503
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,000
 Now this is 1946.

504
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,280
 This is before we even have mass UFO sightings in anywhere.

505
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,880
 You had World War II pilots talking about food fighters.

506
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,520
 But we hadn't had the term "flying saucer" had not entered the consciousness, none of that stuff.

507
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,400
 So this even predates all of them.

508
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,440
 So they're immediately thinking of some sort of spirit.

509
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,640
 They see them in the air.

510
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:41,040
 But none had been attacked by one in this area until now.

511
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,440
 Now Mr. Velho was thinking of that.

512
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,400
 And when he gets done with that chain of thought, he looks up and he sees town.

513
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,400
 He's like, "Oh, that was convenient."

514
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,400
 And he walks into town.

515
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,560
 He's like, "Ah, I've been burned.

516
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,080
 I've been burned."

517
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,280
 And they take him to the hospital.

518
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,240
 And the doctors are looking at him and they go, "Yeah, you're right.

519
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,160
 You are like horribly, horribly burned."

520
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,040
 Now there's a version of the story that seems to be the most popular version that when he

521
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,320
 gets to the hospital, he's burned up.

522
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,800
 And the doctors and the nurses are trying to treat him.

523
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,160
 And as they're treating him, they see his skin begin to dissolve.

524
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,400
 And then eventually he begins to fall off like soup out of a paper bag.

525
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,280
 It just seems to just drip off of him.

526
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:26,400
 And then they watch his muscle tissue get soft, then rot, and then begin to slip off

527
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,360
 like chicken at contemporary chicken.

528
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,520
 And then he just has bones.

529
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,960
 He's just like a skeleton, chattering his teeth, playing his xylophone.

530
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,440
 He's just a skeleton there.

531
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,440
 They're actually watching this man rot in front of them.

532
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,040
 And he didn't seem to be in any pain.

533
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:44,440
 He's just sitting there and his like tongues melting and his skin's melting.

534
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,840
 His hair was perfectly fine.

535
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,760
 His clothes weren't burned.

536
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,800
 But he eventually just melted away.

537
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,160
 And they declared him on his death certificate he died of cardiac arrest.

538
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,640
 So that's one version of it.

539
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,280
 But the way I ended that story, I was suspicious when I first read it.

540
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,280
 I go, "Wait a second.

541
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,680
 The doctors watched the man melt."

542
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,200
 And they go, "But what really killed him was heart attack and not like everything being

543
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,120
 exposed to the open air."

544
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,120
 A witness case.

545
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,520
 So that story's been going around for a long time.

546
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,600
 This story is a true story.

547
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,080
 But he didn't melt.

548
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,600
 Because a witness came forward later, a witness known as Virgilio Alves.

549
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,600
 He said he was here.

550
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,680
 He goes, "He didn't melt.

551
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,680
 I was there.

552
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,680
 He didn't melt.

553
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,240
 He did show up to the hospital.

554
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,000
 He was severely burned.

555
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,880
 When we asked him what happened, he said a boy Tata got him.

556
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,480
 He tells the exact same story.

557
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,480
 He broke into his house.

558
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,560
 This thing comes through the window that he had just previously broken through.

559
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,560
 Shoots him with this beam.

560
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,560
 He walks two miles.

561
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:46,000
 So the only difference between the sensational account is how he died.

562
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,160
 The more grounded account was something that did blast him.

563
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,680
 And doctors there said it looks like he'd been hit with some sort of radiation.

564
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:57,560
 1946 was long enough after Hiroshima and Nagasaki that doctors were familiar with what radiation

565
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,560
 damage would look like.

566
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,080
 They go, "It looks like he's been blasted with something."

567
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,200
 His clothes weren't burned.

568
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,360
 His hair wasn't burned.

569
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,640
 But he was horribly burned.

570
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,840
 He couldn't move his hands.

571
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,720
 He didn't seem like he was in any pain whatsoever.

572
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,600
 Except he kept complaining that he stepped on a bunch of rocks.

573
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,400
 It wouldn't make sense because at that point, so many nerve endings are burned up.

574
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,480
 They classified him.

575
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:24,640
 If you look at the real death certificate, it's classified as cardiac arrest after receiving

576
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,160
 first and second degree burns.

577
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,840
 So I mean, the dude was burned by something.

578
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,440
 The investigators, obviously they're not thinking, "Oh, he was killed by a ghost."

579
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,600
 They went out to his house.

580
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,840
 Nothing in his house was burned.

581
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,320
 They said they noticed some chairs had been knocked over.

582
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,960
 Window had been busted, but nothing was on fire.

583
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,760
 His clothes weren't on fire.

584
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,760
 And he died.

585
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,760
 He died that night.

586
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,280
 Now, it's one of those stories that you actually have a lot of different people looking into.

587
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,760
 UFOologists say it was UFO, of course, right?

588
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,800
 A big phoetologist would say it was Bigfoot with a flamethrower.

589
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:59,040
 The UFOologists have looked back and said, "We believe because the radiation burns it

590
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:04,200
 might have been an after thruster or an engine from a UFO blast."

591
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,200
 I mean, maybe.

592
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:11,200
 The fact that it was flying around in his house, unless it was that little Martian from Flintstones,

593
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,760
 I don't think I've really encountered a UFO that can fly through somebody's house.

594
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,260
 That's that small.

595
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:24,400
 But because it's labeled as radioactive damage, the UFO community got all over this one.

596
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,120
 The people in the area believe that it was a boy tata, that it was a spirit that for

597
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,400
 some reason was angered by him.

598
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,560
 Chased him down.

599
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,440
 Another logical answer is ball lightning.

600
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,840
 And a lot of people have said it could have just been -- it classified as ball lightning.

601
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,240
 Ball lightning is seen in Brazil.

602
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,040
 Could have came through and shocked him, burned him horribly.

603
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:48,560
 The pushback on that is that usually people who die of ball lightning, they die immediately.

604
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,160
 I guess you should explain what ball lightning is.

605
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,680
 My great grandma saw ball lightning.

606
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,240
 Ball lightning is one of those phenomenon that's so rare that for the longest time people

607
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,240
 didn't believe it.

608
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,760
 My grandma was younger.

609
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,760
 My great-grandma.

610
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,360
 She was born in 1906.

611
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,360
 She's passed away now.

612
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,440
 She lived to be like 93.

613
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,040
 She said when she was younger, she was sitting in her house and a ball of lightning just

614
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:13,160
 shh came in through a window and just moved through the house and then hit a door and

615
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,160
 like went out the door.

616
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,080
 "Oh my stars and garters!

617
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,620
 No one would believe that story.

618
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:21,400
 No one believes stories like that for the longest time because it was so rare.

619
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,440
 But it's literally a ball of lightning that will just float around.

620
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,440
 Don't get near it.

621
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,440
 It's not cuddly.

622
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,800
 It's just because it's a ball doesn't mean you can go dribble it.

623
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,800
 It will blast you.

624
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,800
 But normally it's like people don't normally get struck by lightning.

625
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,800
 It's funny.

626
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
 Now I'm going to tell another story.

627
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:42,600
 My great-uncle was once walking through a field with two cans, two tall boys.

628
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:47,080
 No, he's walking through a field with two buckets and there were two pigs walking under

629
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:51,320
 each bucket and he's walking through the field and he's holding a bucket in each hand and

630
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:56,640
 a bolt of lightning hit him, went through him, went through the buckets and killed both

631
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,000
 the pigs and his hands were fused to the buckets.

632
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,040
 To this day, we still call him Bucket Hand.

633
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,040
 No, he's passed away too.

634
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,040
 We never got on Bucket Hand.

635
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,360
 They did have to work on getting his hands open.

636
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,120
 I mean like they just froze onto the metal.

637
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,000
 I wonder if that would be weird if my family like, maybe my family has a lightning.

638
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 Maybe I'm going to send them to Zeus.

639
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 Who knows?

640
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 But probably not.

641
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 Probably not.

642
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,080
 Probably not just a member of a fictional character, but you never know.

643
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,360
 But anyway, so, ball lightning will kill it.

644
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:29,160
 This is an interesting story because, one, it involves a dude getting fried by something

645
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,680
 completely unexplainable.

646
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:34,480
 If it is the ball, and they checked for like, because they were thinking, could it have

647
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,880
 been an industrial accident?

648
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,000
 One, his house had no electricity.

649
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,800
 There's no electricity in his house.

650
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,120
 They go, it's possible that he could have got electrocuted at the mine, that he was goofing

651
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,480
 off at the mine, got electrocuted and then walked two miles.

652
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,000
 But again, they're thinking, what would he have been doing there?

653
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,520
 Maybe he was meeting some people he met on Craigslist.

654
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,720
 That's how you construct a lie.

655
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,520
 They're like, dude, how'd you get electrocuted?

656
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:03,160
 He's like, I wasn't with two dudes in a hotel room, if that's what you're asking.

657
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,040
 He could have gotten electrocuted at the mine and then walked two miles.

658
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:10,440
 But again, they're thinking that type of electrical injury probably would have killed him.

659
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,880
 So what was it?

660
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,480
 Radiation has a more lingering death.

661
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,480
 What is it?

662
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,400
 So now that I think about it, why did the melting story get started in the first place?

663
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,240
 It almost seems now that I'm talking about it, seems like disinformation.

664
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:26,240
 I mean, it could be the fact that somebody wanted to make the story extra gross and then

665
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,480
 that's the version that gets passed on in all these other paranormal communities.

666
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,840
 He melted, he melted, he melted.

667
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:34,080
 But when you look back on it, it's probably not true.

668
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,240
 It could be that the melting story makes it easier to dismiss.

669
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,240
 That's fantastic.

670
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:45,360
 But the idea of someone getting irradiated and then walking and slowly dying, that's

671
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,360
 more believable.

672
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,680
 So you would start the faker version of the story as disinformation.

673
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,360
 When I was reading the story, I had a theory, my personal theory, and some of you guys may

674
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,600
 have picked up on this too.

675
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,880
 We've covered stories in Brazil specifically before.

676
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:07,400
 It was Operation Plate where the US government may or may not have been using alien or technology

677
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,360
 that looked like alien to do experiments on people in Brazil.

678
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,520
 Operation Plate and the Brazilian military got involved and the US military stepped in

679
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,200
 and all the investigations were ended.

680
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,040
 I think that was like episode 80 or something like that.

681
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,880
 That's a really interesting episode if you guys want to hear that Operation Plate.

682
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:27,800
 But I thought, secret weapon, I thought someone's testing something out in Brazil.

683
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,920
 They saw a guy walking around and they're like, "Light them up."

684
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,180
 And all he would see is that bright light coming at him.

685
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,880
 That to me is the most reasonable answer.

686
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,400
 The ball lightning, you figure it would kill him.

687
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,520
 Could be a spirit coming out of the mind because we exist in the world of paranormal.

688
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:49,240
 Whether or not it's real, we definitely entertain those thoughts.

689
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,120
 Probably wasn't an industrial accident because there would be no reason for him to cover

690
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,200
 that up.

691
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,760
 But my scenario, or it could be a UFO again, but the fact that it's in the house, my scenario

692
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:05,080
 was that there were people in the vicinity that wanted to test out one of their new toys

693
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:09,300
 and they saw a guy all by himself in the, really in the middle of nowhere.

694
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,300
 No one was around.

695
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:14,020
 His house was there, but there was nothing else within two miles.

696
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:18,660
 And someone, US government or some other government agency or some sort of black book, private

697
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:24,300
 organization, whatever, out in Brazil with a brand new toy, sees a man in the middle

698
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,340
 of nowhere, shoots him.

699
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:30,460
 He turns around and he just sees a bright light.

700
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,380
 And then the next thing he knows, his upper body is completely burned.

701
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,200
 To me, that's the most realistic scenario.

702
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,800
 To me, that's the most terrifying scenario.

703
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:42,360
 Because ghosts and goblins coming out of a mine or UFOs that are just passing from our

704
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,000
 Earth to the next solar system.

705
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,920
 Yeah, I mean, they're scurry in a metaphysical sense, but the idea that humans test weapons

706
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:55,840
 on other humans to me is far scarier and proven time and time again.

707
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:02,680
 So it's possible that this man was the first victim of a death ray that just turned out

708
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:06,060
 to be too unpredictable, didn't kill him on impact.

709
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:10,220
 Couldn't use it in any sort of battle capacity because anyone you shoot with it would still

710
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:14,660
 be able to walk around for two miles, go home and still tell where you were, what you were

711
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,420
 hit with.

712
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:20,620
 The thing that killed Mr. Philho maybe sitting in a laboratory somewhere.

713
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,620
 Not made on another planet.

714
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,340
 Not from the veil beyond our dimension.

715
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:29,620
 Not a rumbling spirit from a deep, dark mine.

716
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:35,560
 But from the mind of a human invented specifically to injure, to kill another human.

717
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,880
 An invention that is sitting on a shelf somewhere.

718
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:45,920
 Just waiting for the right opportunity to be used again.

719
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,480
