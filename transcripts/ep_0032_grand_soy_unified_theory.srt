00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
 It's all food conspiracies today, culminating in the most dangerous conspiracy we've covered to date.

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,680
 The grand soy unified theory. Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:20,000
 Hey everyone, welcome to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,960
 Barbender. Hope you guys are having a great day. I'm recording this at 11. That's kind of par for

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,000
 the course. I'm really tired though. We had a performance tonight. I've mentioned before that I

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,240
 do plays here locally. If you're in the Hood River area, you always come out and see a play.

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:42,080
 Hit me up, deadrabbitradio@gmail.com. We'll see what we can do. Meet up somewhere. I actually

8
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,160
 know Scratch that because you might kidnap me. You know, I was talking on the street today and a

9
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,960
 car rolled up to me. It was like, I don't really know cars that well, but it was like a solid black.

10
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,720
 I don't know. Chevrolet was old. It was like from the 60s or something of that. There was this young

11
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,040
 man in the car and he had like a bunch of tattoos on his arm and he goes, "Hey man, you need a ride?"

12
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,120
 And I was like, "No, I'm cool." And he goes, "I see you walking all the time." Which I do walk all

13
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,040
 the time. And I was like, "No, I'm cool. You know, I enjoy walking." He's like, "Okay, have a great day."

14
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,800
 And he drove off. Now two things struck me there. One, what a nice young man. Secondly, I never get

15
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,920
 in a car. I never get in a stranger's car ever. Now it's possible that he saw me walking around

16
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,720
 all the time and people have pulled over like owners of, you know, like local businesses. You

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,200
 know, I've been walking around for years. I've had them give me rides like an inclement weather.

18
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,280
 But generally, I won't take a ride. And even the business owners, I kind of know because I

19
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,920
 patronized their business. But if the young man was being nice, hey, thank you. That's kind of how

20
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,920
 I took it. I took it that he was being nice, but he could have also been a serial killer or an agent

21
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,560
 of Deep Soy. They could have known I was going to record this episode tonight.

22
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,360
 And we're going to go ahead and get into the grand soy unified theory in the end.

23
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,200
 Keep you waiting. But first, we got some other interesting food based conspiracies to kind of

24
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,160
 wrap this week up. The first one I want to cover, and this was a fairly famous video when it came

25
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,520
 out. I'm going to include the link, but most of you guys have probably seen it before. So they took

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,440
 an octopus or a squid or something with more than two legs. And what they did was they cut its brain

27
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,280
 out or cut the top of its head off or something like that. And then they poured soy sauce on it,

28
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,280
 and it starts dancing. Oh, you know, it's not dancing, but it's like jerking around. And people

29
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,560
 were up in arms saying that was cruel. And then other people were saying it's already dead and

30
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,120
 we're going to eat it anyways. Like, what's the problem? It's disgusting either way. Like, I don't

31
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,440
 want to see my food move around like that. I can eat bloody food, but that's pretty gross. My question,

32
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,800
 though, when I saw that video was, I took a human and cut the top of their head off. How much soy

33
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,360
 sauce would I need to make them move around? Because technically, you could have an army of

34
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,040
 the undead. Think about how terrifying that would be. You're in the middle of Afghanistan.

35
00:02:53,040 --> 00:03:01,120
 You're a Taliban soldier. You're watching your post. And you see a bunch of your former

36
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:10,880
 clansmen, herky jerky walk-in across the landscape with huge bubble, like astronaut bubble things

37
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:17,520
 on their heads, helmets, I guess is the word, and with huge helmets on them full of soy sauce.

38
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,560
 Hey, that actually plays into the next story. I didn't make that connection. I'm incredibly tired.

39
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,560
 So you outfit them with backhacks of soy sauce and it's just like pumping into this helmet. You

40
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,080
 just see these bodies like just moving across the desert. That would terrify anybody. And it would

41
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,040
 terrify you because you would think, oh, if the military, if the US military kills me, they're

42
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,360
 going to turn me into one of those abominations. Like, am I really dead if my body's moving around?

43
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,040
 I wonder, and you know, the article goes on to say that it's an element in the soy sauce. I think

44
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,360
 it's the salt or something. Then you can tell it's well researched. I did read the article,

45
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,240
 to be fair, I did read it, but that it had something to do with the way that the chemicals

46
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:01,280
 are interacting with the muscle ending. So could you do that to a human? And if so, has anyone

47
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,560
 done that before? I think it would be a very effective weapon of war, just because it'd be so

48
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,360
 terrifying. I'm sure the Geneva Convention wouldn't have, wouldn't really like it that much, but you

49
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,480
 know, they're usually buzz kills anyways. The next story, you can tell we're just moving along,

50
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:22,000
 because I kind of want to get to this grand soy unified theory one, because I put a lot of research

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,360
 into this, a lot of research. This story kind of popped up. I just thought it was interesting.

52
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:34,320
 It's pretty brief. It is. Things, foods that you thought were vegan that weren't. There's some

53
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,280
 interesting ones. Now, you know, I used to be vegetarian back in the day, because I wasn't,

54
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,520
 you know, the cruelty to animals things was like my main reason. It just got too expensive. The economy

55
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,240
 fell apart back in 2008, and all the prices went up, and I had to go back to eating meat.

56
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,840
 But you know, I knew back then not to, you know, eat certain candies like Mamba, which I

57
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,960
 loved Mamba growing up that has Jell-o-tin, which is basically horse hooves. It's bone,

58
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,760
 bone matter. And a lot of candies have Jell-o-tin. A lot of candies have Jell-o-tin in it, so I say

59
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:12,320
 with that Jell-o, obviously. But I came across some interesting ones. So, Frosted Mini Leeds

60
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:21,200
 also has Jell-o-tin. Apple Juice has elements of fish bladder in it, and that's what gives it kind

61
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:28,320
 of its smoky, kind of like, makes it look like a natural cider, the brown, like, you know,

62
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,920
 kind of the wavy stuff. And that's fish bladder stuff. That's disgusting. Painfuls contain Jell-o-tin.

63
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:40,480
 Oh, this is a weird one. This is one that I didn't expect to see on this list. Tattoo Ink.

64
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:49,840
 Most black inks are made from charcoal that's made from burning animal bones. Crazy. So, if you

65
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,000
 ever see someone who's lecturing you about being vegan and how it's all health-conscious, you could

66
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,320
 say, "Well, do you have a tattoo?" I can see, "Oh, yeah, I have a tattoo." You could be a jerk and

67
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,920
 say, "Well, you know, there was animal bone made in that tattoo." But, you know, I think probably

68
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,640
 the better place to just kind of smile to yourself and know it, because you don't know. They may end

69
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,680
 up chopping their arm off or something because they don't want any animal in them. They probably

70
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,160
 won't believe you anyways, but tell them you heard it on a podcast called Dead Rabbit Radio,

71
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,640
 and they will also subscribe and listen to me. I don't think so. But, you know, you always could.

72
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:29,840
 And then they hear this episode and they'd hate it. Okay, just buzzing along here. Buzzing, buzzing

73
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,400
 along. It's funny, before I get started on that, though, before I forget this, I thought it was

74
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,680
 interesting conversation. I was having a conversation with someone on the internet the other day,

75
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:45,760
 and they were talking about the NASA photos of Earth are photoshopped, and that's proof that

76
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,000
 NASA's lying to us. Now, it's common knowledge that, yes, the photos you see of the Earth are

77
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,160
 photoshopped. Don't worry, this is food related. But the photos you see of the Earth are photoshopped,

78
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,720
 and NASA, they will say that. Yeah, they're photoshopped. The way that we take photos,

79
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,280
 it's a big planet. We can't just go out there and like click a picture. And the thing is, is that he

80
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,840
 was like, "Well, why do they do that? Why do they do that?" And I said, "You know, here's the thing.

81
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:14,080
 Those pictures we see of Earth are made to be posters and lithographs. They're made to be things

82
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:20,000
 that you sell. They're not supposed, they're not scientific pictures. Scientists don't have photos

83
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,040
 of the Earth coming from NASA on their walls, and they sit around in their little lab coats and

84
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:32,480
 taking notes. That's not what they're there for. They're for consumers. When you go into a Taco Bell

85
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:38,960
 and you look at a picture of a Nachos, when you look at a picture of Nachos, Nachos Belgrande,

86
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:46,880
 and they have everything perfectly spaced out. The chips are all perfect. The beans, the meat,

87
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:53,280
 the cheese. I hate tomatoes, so those, I pretend those aren't on the picture. That set of Nachos

88
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,920
 never existed, ever, ever existed. Someone used Photoshop to take the perfect Nachos and go in

89
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:05,840
 and put the ridges exactly where they should be, and then put the beans in just the right smooth

90
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:13,200
 area and then put on the clumpy, glistening meat and sprinkle the cheese in perfect dimensions,

91
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,520
 and the cheese hasn't even melted yet. You can still see those strings just before it melts.

92
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:25,360
 And then they take that photo to a focus group, and they go, "What do you think?" And they go, "Well,

93
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,520
 it's kind of yummy, but do this. Maybe add this." It doesn't mean Nachos don't exist. It doesn't mean

94
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,600
 Taco Bell is then selling us hamburgers. It just means that they're trying to present their best

95
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:45,360
 foot forward of Nachos. That's what it's for. And that's the same thing with the cabbage in

96
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,840
 the other episode, the fake cabbage in the Bellray Surge. That fake cabbage was made to show the

97
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:57,360
 perfect representation of food. We do it too. We just do it with photographs. So yes, just because

98
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,200
 there's beautiful photo, and they do have real photos of the earth, and it looks like a big

99
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,720
 mudball. It looks like a big pale blue gross mudball. And even then, they're like looking at

100
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,920
 this picture that had to do several passes with this satellite, but it looks gross. It's not

101
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,560
 something you would want hanging on your wall. That's why those photos are photoshopped. It's

102
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,800
 not because the earth is flat. It's not because NASA is lying to you, because they will tell you,

103
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,160
 "Yeah, these photos are photoshopped." That is common knowledge. If you ask them, it'll be on

104
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:32,960
 their websites when you look into it. So if anyone ever says, "Why are these clouds like copy and

105
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,040
 paste it?" It's because they were lazy, and it was a Friday, and someone just needed to get out of

106
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,640
 there, so he just copy pasted some clouds. They're not meant to be scientific instruments. So

107
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,040
 I just wanted to get that out there before I end our food week.

108
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:54,080
 Grand Soy Unified Theory. How this started off is this is one of our conspiracies that came off

109
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:02,000
 of our conspiracy list. This was the conspiracy that I've had to do the most research on. That I

110
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,320
 was successful. I, like I said, I've been trying to find sexual assault missiles for probably about

111
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,320
 half a week now. I can't find anything, so I think it's a joke. If it's not a joke, it's pretty awesome.

112
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,320
 It might be related to the gay bombs we developed, but we'll do that another time.

113
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,120
 I think most people know about the gay bombs, anyways. The bombs that are supposed to turn the

114
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,920
 enemy gay. They're from the 1990s. It's totally legit. We'll cover that some other time. We'll

115
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:33,360
 cover wacky weapons of war, but Grand Soy Unified Theory. People go, "Oh, it's just a joke. That's

116
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:44,480
 just a joke." I think I've found just enough information, maybe not to prove, but to suggest

117
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:51,680
 that it's more than a joke. First off, what we look at. You have to break it down into certain

118
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:59,360
 questions. The first question is, "Is soy sentient?" This is something we talked about on the episode

119
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:06,480
 Oil and Water with Dr. Emoto looking at glasses of water and going, "You're beautiful. I love you.

120
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,240
 You're so great." Then it creates beautiful ice crystals. If you look at the water and you're like,

121
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,320
 "Oh, you suck. You're terrible. I hate you so much and you smell like spaghetti." We dismiss the

122
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,880
 water as sentient thing because it can't really be controlled. The question is, now we're going to

123
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:30,960
 move it. Is soy sentient? If you talk to a soybean, if you talk beautifully and you treat the plant

124
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:38,640
 well with great emotional energy, will the plant sprout better? The idea of playing music for plants

125
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:46,240
 is well known. People have said, "Yes, plants can respond." The science may be a little shaky,

126
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,560
 but the theory is that plants can respond to the mood of the people around them. You treat them well,

127
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,720
 you talk to them, you play music, they grow better. The initial question of, "Is soy sentient?"

128
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:05,840
 I'm going to say yes. That led us down a deeper path because that was only just one part

129
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:12,560
 of the soy conspiracy list. On the conspiracy list, there's several elements. Soy keeps popping up.

130
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:21,360
 The second question is, "Is soy intelligent?" Now, we're going to table that for just a moment.

131
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,320
 We're going to go ahead and move on to another theory. See, the reason why this is the grand soy

132
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,400
 unified theory is that all of these theories combine into one, like a Voltron, deep soy.

133
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,480
 Deep soy would be similar to the deep state, which is a term that we've heard a lot since

134
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:45,440
 Trump became president. It's a shadow government within the main government that tries to pull

135
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,360
 the strings. They get stymied a lot, but because they have all of these assets in the field and

136
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:56,400
 all of these projects off the books, sometimes they think that they can run the government.

137
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,800
 And maybe sometimes they do. Maybe during the Reagan administration, you had elements,

138
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,200
 Ren and Iran, Contra and stuff like that. That would be considered deep state. So what's deep

139
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,840
 soy? How does that play into it? Well, deep soy is a step away from the plan itself. And that's

140
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:16,080
 where we have companies like Monsanto genetically modifying soybeans. Because soybeans are one

141
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,120
 of the-- I probably should have started with this-- but soybeans are one of the most valuable

142
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,760
 crop on the planet. Now, yes, wheat is the most-- it's wheat growing on every continent,

143
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:30,240
 except Antarctica. It's the most-- it's been the oldest plant that we've grown. We grow it all

144
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,000
 the time. But soybeans, it started off about-- and they really don't know, but about 5,000 BC

145
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,480
 in Asia. And it's funny because they can actually trace the soy-- I know so much about soybeans now.

146
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:49,360
 It's all useless information after this podcast is recorded. They can trace soybeans in America

147
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,120
 to an actual person. What happened was there is a Japanese sailor whose boat wrecked, and he was

148
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,160
 rescued by some American sailors. And this was back in like the 1800s. And he goes, "Hey, thanks for

149
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:07,440
 rescuing me. Here's some soybeans." So we can trace it back that we have their names. I don't

150
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,160
 remember them. But anyways, they'll be in the article. And then they brought the soybeans to

151
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,240
 America. They began planting them. And then George Washington Carver, who-- I don't know if they

152
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,080
 talk about him in school anymore. When I was in school, they always had a little segment on George

153
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,440
 Washington Carver and the peanut and all that stuff. He was actually the one who was like, "Man,

154
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,000
 we could use these things for oil. Like, these things would be great lubricant."

155
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,680
 And then Henry Ford actually, in every car he made, a bushel of soybeans were used

156
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,760
 to assemble that car. A lot of the plastics in that car were made of soybeans. And at one point,

157
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,640
 he actually made an entire car frame out of plastic that was generated from soybeans.

158
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,680
 Soybeans today, what we use them for is we use them as a lubricant. And we also use them as a

159
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:04,640
 food source for animals originally. And then we use them as food for us. Now, part of the problem

160
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,680
 is that there's mixed science on whether or not-- okay, it's not mixed science. The science is

161
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,720
 pretty conclusive that soy is relatively good for you. But there's mixed opinions on whether or not

162
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,360
 soy causes too much estrogen in people. And it causes girls to go through puberty younger. And

163
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,840
 it causes men to have health problems like cancers that are usually alleviated with a higher amount

164
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:32,880
 of testosterone. So deep soy comes into the fact. So after that overview, deep soy is where you have

165
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:41,200
 Monsanto actually trying to control the supply of soybeans. And if you can control the soybeans,

166
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:48,880
 you can control all of those other industries. So soybeans have been genetically modified soybeans

167
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,680
 that have gotten loose into the wild and then begin planting and choking out the natural soybeans.

168
00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:00,240
 There have been times where they've created a soybean and it's gone through the safety process

169
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,520
 where they're like, this soybeans totally fine. And they released it. And then scientists have

170
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:10,800
 discovered that there's extra DNA in these soybeans. The soybeans now have unknown DNA. They can't

171
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,640
 figure out why it's there or what it's doing or what health effects it has on humans. And Monsanto

172
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:22,240
 is like, oh, no, no, it's totally cool. It's totally cool. And the European agency that discovered

173
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,920
 this is like, it has extra DNA. However, you just waving it off and saying, that's cool and putting

174
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,960
 on your sunglasses and skateboarding off to the ice cream store. Like it's not cool that it has

175
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:41,840
 extra DNA. So Monsanto would be considered deep soy. Control the beans, control the world.

176
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:50,240
 Now they've talked about things like weaponized soy. And that would be the equivalent of

177
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:57,280
 creating the soy to either germinate in areas and choke out the natural soybeans. So eventually,

178
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:03,760
 the only beans are out there are Monsanto beans. And you will have to buy more beans from Monsanto

179
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:09,520
 to keep your soybeans running, your soy farm running, soybean farm running. And then there's

180
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,080
 the theory that coins are being sprayed with soy. Now I know that sounds ridiculous at first,

181
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:22,960
 but hear me out. If soy does cause trouble with the human species, and actually like raw soybean

182
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:30,560
 flour can kill you, it causes pancreatic cancer, raw soybean flour before it's produced, and just raw

183
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:36,800
 soybeans themselves, they're, they're, they're, they will make humans sick. They have to be prepared,

184
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,920
 according to the research I've done. I'm going to put it, dude, the amount of links I have just

185
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:49,120
 soy being related is ridiculous. But anyway, so I want to make sure that I'm sure that I'll have

186
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:55,440
 to keep updating it because I, oh, I forgot this article, but so is soy being sprayed on coins?

187
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,920
 The point of that would be is to make sure that every man, woman, and child is getting dosed with

188
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:10,960
 soy to have these health effects. Now, and the thing is, is like soy itself may be affecting our

189
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,320
 brains, not just our body, but our brains, to make us want to consume more soy. Now we know that

190
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,600
 there's sugar addictions, and what's crazy is that you have the addictive thing in your brain,

191
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:29,120
 but your body, if you eat carbs and you eat a lot of sugar, your body, in your stomach, flora,

192
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:37,040
 no, it's fauna will grow that causes you, that feeds only off sugar and carbs, and it's in your

193
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:44,880
 guts. And that sugar craving you have isn't in your brain. It's the fauna in your stomach,

194
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,560
 in your intestines, releasing chemicals into your bloodstream to make you crave sugar, because

195
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:56,480
 without it, with, if you go 48 hours with no carbs, that fauna begins to die. And like anything of

196
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,240
 your starving, you're going to start dialing dominoes. Dominoes comes to your house. The fauna

197
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:08,560
 in your gut will say sugar, sugar, sugar. And unless you can try this part of the keto diet,

198
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:14,800
 unless you can control that chemical release, and it is hard, that's why you crave that sugar,

199
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:20,480
 you're at there's actually almost like an alien, alien to your body, life form in there, that's

200
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,360
 making you crave that sugar, you can go 48 hours without sugar and carbs, you're totally fine,

201
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,960
 you don't crave it anymore, you don't look at a Snickers and go, oh man, I really want that.

202
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:35,520
 But in that initial 48 hour period, you do want that Snickers. It's crazy. So we know that sugar,

203
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:42,080
 you can have that craving for carbs and sugar. What if that same type of mechanism is developing

204
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:48,720
 in us for soy? Now again, soy's really only been cultivated in the past 5000 years, and we've been

205
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,480
 around for what, 100,000? Longer than that, and before we could process it, we couldn't eat it.

206
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:02,960
 And it's only been in the Western world since about like the 1600s. So what if it is now

207
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:11,600
 making our bodies crave soy? So we grow more soy, so we eat more soy.

208
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:18,640
 And whoever is trying to weaponize soy or spray it on coins or put it into our water system,

209
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,840
 they would be part of the deep soy system. They're trying to create, you're constantly

210
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,280
 surrounded by soy, you're touching it, and then you're touching your mouth, even if you don't

211
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:33,280
 think you're eating soy, you're craving more soy, you're getting soy all the time, all the time

212
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:39,200
 in your system, which makes you crave more soy. So you're going to buy more soy, and soy is going

213
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:45,760
 to be growing more. Now I know what you're thinking, Jason, that's all genius, and that's partially

214
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:52,080
 true. But I know what you're also thinking, what does any of this have to do with the point you

215
00:20:52,080 --> 00:21:00,640
 left out? Is soy intelligent? I looked into this and looked into this and looked into this. I was

216
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,520
 trying to find if soybeans released chemicals where they could talk to each other. I was trying to

217
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:11,520
 find if soybean roots touched so they could talk to each other. I was trying to find any sort of

218
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:17,840
 communication methods for soy, the soybean plants. I did learn that their roots can grow up to four

219
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:25,280
 feet deep, which is much deeper than most vegetables, and definitely much, much deeper than almost any

220
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,320
 other bean, I think any other bean, actually four feet deep. It's like a fifth grader.

221
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:40,160
 And then I decided I had a little stroke of, stroke of inspiration. And I thought,

222
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:49,280
 I did an episode a while back about a giant mushroom, a giant fungus, that was so big and so

223
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,640
 old is the largest life form on the planet and has that mycelium underneath and how it can use

224
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,800
 itself to communicate. It can send signals from one end of it to the other. The mycelium is made

225
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:06,240
 to absorb nutrients and water and create the life form, but it also, it's basically a neural network.

226
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,880
 And I started to look that up and I was seeing articles saying that plants can communicate

227
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,440
 through fungus. If plants have this neural network, they can communicate through fungus.

228
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:28,000
 That, that is when I had my Pepe Silvia moment. Now Pepe Silvia

229
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,560
 is a character who may or may not have existed in the world of its hoist and in Philadelphia.

230
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:39,760
 Technically, he did exist. We just never saw him. But he was the core of the conspiracy

231
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:48,160
 that Charlie was trying to figure out. Who is Pepe Silvia? I googled soybeans mycelium.

232
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:55,040
 The soybeans are infested with it in America. Infested with it. They don't know where it came

233
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:03,040
 from. They don't know why it grows. And a soybean plant with the mycelium spread out underneath the

234
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:15,360
 ground can still produce soybeans and it takes over entire fields, entire crops. So in that field,

235
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:23,200
 it can pass messages from one soybean plant to the other. They can talk.

236
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:37,360
 They can gain intelligence and they can plan their maneuvers. They're sentient. We've checked that.

237
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,000
 They're intelligent. They have a neural network. There are companies and groups on the outside

238
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:50,400
 like Monsanto who has made it their goal to spread the soybean. And through both outside factors like

239
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,960
 greedy corporations making sure that soybeans are in every type of food, that making sure that

240
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:04,880
 their genetically modified soybeans are infesting otherwise fertile lands and growing. And who knows?

241
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,960
 Maybe it's the maybe that's part of the extra DNA. Maybe they have engineered the soybean to have the

242
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:18,480
 mycelium to create the neural network so the soybeans can talk. Because maybe it's not Monsanto

243
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,120
 running the soybean farms. Maybe it's the soybean farms infesting us

244
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:30,800
 and making us eat more of them. Making us become vegan. Making us become health conscious.

245
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:38,240
 Making us go through puberty earlier. Trying to get us to a stage where we just want to eat

246
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:46,240
 nothing but soy. Nothing but soy. And that is how it controls us. That is the grand unified soy theory

247
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:54,240
 from the initial beans being picked 5000 years ago. All the way to today. All the weird coincidences.

248
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,520
 Like what are the chances of them finding a Japanese guy who happened to have a bunch of

249
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:03,200
 soybeans on his back? To George Washington Carver figuring out all this great stuff. To us not only

250
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:09,840
 using them for food but using them in the production of automobiles and petroleum. We want we need

251
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:16,400
 the soybeans. If the soybeans disappeared civilization would fall apart. That is the grand soy unified

252
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:24,240
 theory. Well that wraps it up for this episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I hope you had a fun time

253
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:34,480
 learning the truth about soy. I know I did. Now everything I said except for maybe three things

254
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:41,120
 was absolutely true and could be backed up with evidence. Monsanto has made soybeans when they

255
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:46,240
 genetically modified them. Now there's extra parts of DNA and missing parts of DNA and all of that.

256
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,720
 The history of the soybean. How it being brought to America was just a guy with soybean on his back

257
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:56,880
 so maybe he was controlled by soybean. But then the opinion jumped in. Is soy sentient? There's no

258
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,680
 nothing to back that up. The only place I found that out was on deleted a reddit post that someone

259
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:09,200
 quoted. The fact that mycelium is some sort of neural network that allows soybeans to plot the

260
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:17,040
 overthrow of the world. Mycelium can be a network that lets plants communicate. But it doesn't let

261
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:24,480
 them you know by step evolution become a brain controlling bean. Soybeans have been found in

262
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,000
 humans to cause absolutely no changes in the brain structure or no measurable changes in the brain

263
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,720
 structure except for elderly Italian women which is odd. And even then it had something to do with

264
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:45,440
 their existing dementia. Monsanto trying to be deep soy. I do think Monsanto I think companies do

265
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,800
 want to corner the soybean market because it is so valuable. And there's all the stuff about Henry

266
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:55,840
 Ford in the car and the soybeans and that's all true. Those are all true pieces of information.

267
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:02,960
 But what I did spend a week researching this and what happened was I went into it and I wanted it

268
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:10,560
 to be real. I wanted grand soy unified theory which is an actual term to be real. I wanted deep

269
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,400
 soy to be real. These are some of the most requested stories that I've gotten. People want to know

270
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,920
 because this is all on the conspiracy list. I go into this stuff I wanted to be real.

271
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:24,560
 And even I was like halfway through my research is like I said I'm finding nothing. I had to start

272
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:30,800
 then looking at where soybeans can grow. Can they grow anywhere? No there's very certain.

273
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:38,000
 I went in with the hypothesis that soy is sentient, intelligent and it is evolving to basically

274
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,160
 take over. That was the hypothesis I went in. Did I go in believing that hypothesis? No. No. That was

275
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,800
 just the most entertaining hypothesis and I could find no information to pack up anything that I

276
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,480
 found. I could just find bits and pieces of scientific articles in history of the soybeans

277

00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:58,240
 back Monday and we'll start another week of Deadrabbit Radio. I'll see you guys later.
