1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
 The Sonic War against the homeless has officially begun.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,360
 Why you should be very very careful who you hang out with.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:15,440
 And then we go back to school to meet a young teacher who wants to show us some great things about life.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:24,320
 Specifically, we're infested with demons and the only way they can get out of us is letting her cut us open today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:32,320
 *music*

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,320
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:44,320
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. It's close to midnight here. It's kind of spooky out there. It's always spooky around here.

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:51,320
 We got a lot of stuff to cover though, so let's stop building the atmosphere of my apartment, a place you'll never be.

9
00:00:51,320 --> 00:01:00,320
 And instead we're going to my old hometown, Sacramento, California, Sack Town, Sack Potatoes, we're headed out there.

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:07,320
 In Sacramento, there is a McDonald's. In Midtown Sacramento to be exact, there's a little McDonald's there.

11
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,320
 In the neighborhood, people go there, they're loving it. But, the bagpipe music.

12
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,320
 I know that's more of a trumpet thing, but I can't really make a bagpipe noise.

13
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:27,320
 Okay, I'll stop. You know what bagpipe music sounds like. And they're pumping this out. They originally were pumping it out 24 hours a day.

14
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:34,320
 Nothing but bagpipe music. Bagpipe music all the time. The reason why keeps the homeless away. Sacramento has a big homeless problem.

15
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,320
 Most cities on the West Coast, big cities at least, have a homeless problem. The Portland Airport has a homeless problem.

16
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:49,320
 There's a lot of homeless people, okay? So when they're filling up your airports, like the zombies attacking the Tel Aviv Airport and World War Z, you got a problem.

17
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,320
 I don't think they're climbing up on each other to get to the roof of the airport, but I don't know. I haven't been there in a while.

18
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:02,320
 The point is, a lot of homeless people. So this McDonald's in Sacramento has an idea. Let's blast bagpipe music to keep the homeless people away.

19
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:13,320
 Now, the problem is, this McDonald's is located in a neighborhood where there are home people. You have the homeless people who are like, "Ugh, fine, I'll go to the Southern McDonald's down the street."

20
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:20,320
 But there are actually home people who own homes that are like, "Ugh, I have nowhere to go." They're becoming homeless.

21
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:26,320
 They're just like, "I'd rather sleep in my car eight blocks away." This one guy says, "They were able to get a concession."

22
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:33,320
 First thought they were playing the music 24 hours a day. People begin complaining. So now they only play it 16 hours a day or 8 hours a day, whatever it is.

23
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:40,320
 It's still very loud and it's still very long. This one resident was saying he put on his headphones and was blowing leaves.

24
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:45,320
 Out in his front yard and then he shut off the leaf blower.

25
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:53,320
 And underneath his headphones, which were designed to keep out the sound of a leaf blower, the second he shut off his leaf blower, he heard the bagpipe music.

26
00:02:53,320 --> 00:03:01,320
 That's how loud this stuff is. People are saying, "I'm sitting in my house trying to watch Transformers 2, Revenge of the Fallen."

27
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:06,320
 And I just hear it. Bagpipe music. This doesn't make sense. This is not an exact quote, but I just imagine people are watching that movie.

28
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:15,320
 Bagpipe music all the time. Here's this quote. "It sticks in your head when you're going somewhere else, not even in this neighborhood, because you've heard it for so long."

29
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:21,320
 So remember that snappy bagpipe song you heard? You're like walking around. You're like, "Oh yeah, dude, that jam."

30
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:29,320
 Like, it's stuck in your head. I don't think it's like Bagpipe's greatest hits. I'm thinking it's just the same bagpipe song over and over again.

31
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,320
 But even if it was a collection of 10 of them, eventually the tune's going to get stuck in your head.

32
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:40,320
 The best part about the story, though, isn't the fact that McDonald's has unleashed a Sonic weapon to keep the homeless people away.

33
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:49,320
 It's not that they unleashed it in a residential neighborhood, so the people who have homes, who have nowhere to go, are also being assaulted by this.

34
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:59,320
 Reporters came out for CBS Local Channel up there. They came out to the McDonald's. They talked to three different managers at the McDonald's and asked them about the bagpipe music.

35
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:05,320
 And all three managers said the exact same thing. "What bagpipe music?"

36
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:16,320
 They just went back to work. "What are you talking about? There's no bagpipe music coming from here." That is genius. That's perfect.

37
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:23,320
 That might be the best example of gaslighting I've ever heard. "What? No, that bagpipe music? Oh, that? That just started when you showed up."

38
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,320
 "You're the one playing the bagpipe music?" "No, I'm not. No, I'm not. Yeah, it's you. It's you."

39
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,320
 So yes, the Sonic War on the homeless population has begun. You know what, actually, you know what I should do?

40
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:45,320
 I should try to get people to play my podcast at top volume to drive people away. I guess that's not going to advertise even further podcasts.

41
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:51,320
 People are like, "I never want to listen to this again. What's this podcast called?" "Dead Wrap Radio." This sucks. That's super loud.

42
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:59,320
 But think about it, if you lived like six or seven houses down, you might really enjoy it. 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

43
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,320
 Let's go to move on to our next topic, since that plan, that marketing gimmick, failed.

44
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,320
 I'm going to contact the government and see if they'll play me in Guantanamo Bay.

45
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:16,320
 This next story, man, you know what? I had this ready to go and I was kind of like, "Uh..." That's a ringing endorsement, isn't it?

46
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,320
 So now that I don't think the story is good, I think it's really interesting. I think it's kind of depressing.

47
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:28,320
 Last Friday, I did that story about a bear eating a bunch of kids. That was depressing as well. It's kind of in the same vein.

48
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:41,320
 No kids get eaten. There's not a bear. But let's go to Maurice, Michigan. Morris, Michigan. Morise, Michigan.

49
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:48,320
 Doesn't matter where I'm going to be here that long. Population in 900 people. It's a tiny little town. And it's Christmas Day.

50
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:54,320
 Family sits around. They're ready to eat the morning meal that accompanies Christmas. Everyone's like, "Mmm, yummy."

51
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:02,320
 Past the bacon. And their last name is the bacon and they all laugh at that joke just like they've laughed at that joke for the past eight generations.

52
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,320
 Someone's told it. This is the bacon family. And they have a son named Kevin Bacon, which I'm sure...

53
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:15,320
 Why you would do that? I have no idea. If my kids... If my last name was Shyamalan, I would not name my kid M.

54
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:21,320
 But I wonder what M. Night... That was a dumb joke. But I wonder what the M stands for. I'm not so curious to look it up.

55
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,320
 What if it's... No, actually, I'm curious. I'm going to look it up.

56
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:32,320
 What if it stands for Mid? So Mid Night Shyamalan. Let's look this up. I don't think I've ever wondered about this before.

57
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:41,320
 Man-Manage. Yeah, that wasn't... Anyways, let's go ahead and move on with what I was originally talking about.

58
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:48,320
 It should be Mid. So his name was Mid Night Shyamalan. What am I talking about? Oh, yeah, yeah, Kevin Bacon.

59
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:57,320
 So, Kevin Bacon is not at the morning meal. He can't be there. He can't... He's not there in the morning. Forget all that stupid segue.

60
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:02,320
 He's not in the morning. Kevin's not there. Family gets concerned because he's supposed to be here. Call the cops.

61
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:10,320
 Cops start interviewing people. Cops knocking on doors. Hey, you know Kevin Bacon. And people are like, "Do I know Kevin Bacon?"

62
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:16,320
 I'm not asking you, officer. Do I know the cops shut the door? They're like, "Ding it!"

63
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,320
 The cops go to people they know who actually know Kevin Bacon. They go, "Hey, do you know where he's at?"

64
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:28,320
 And they're like, "Well, he did meet a guy on Grindr. The gay dating app." We met a guy on Grindr.

65
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:35,320
 And he was really excited about going out with him. And at this point, the cops are looking at each other and they're like, "Oh, great."

66
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:41,320
 Because basically, the easiest way to get away with killing someone is to kill a complete stranger.

67
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:46,320
 Very, very hard to catch because a lot of times, police have to look for connections. And when people are using dating apps,

68
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,320
 names can be fake, addresses can be fake, everything can be the photo can be fake.

69
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:59,320
 And if you happen to run afoul of somebody who's not good on a dating app, it's much harder for them to figure it out.

70
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:05,320
 But they actually were able to track down this dude. So that all hit. He went missing on Christmas Day.

71
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:12,320
 On December 28th, they were able to find Mark Latunski. Mark Latunski.

72
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,320
 Kevin Bacon was 25. Mark Lanuski is 50 years old.

73
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:23,320
 It's funny, I saw a review on a podcast the other day and they said, "I'm done with this podcast."

74
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:31,320
 They mispronounced a city. It's Naperville and the host called it Napperville and then made a joke about people taking naps.

75
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:38,320
 I cannot handle that podcast. I read that review and I thought, "I could like to join my podcast."

76
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:47,320
 That's nothing compared to what I do. Anyways, Mark Latunski, 50 years old, cops go to his house.

77
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:52,320
 "Hey, let us in. We want to talk to you. Do you know Kevin Bacon?"

78
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,320
 The guy's like, "Do I know Kevin?" They're like, "We're done with that joke."

79
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,320
 "Let us in." And the guy's like, "Yeah, sure. Come on in, officers."

80
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:06,320
 And the officers walk into his house and the guy's like, "Oh, yeah, Kevin? Yeah, he's actually here."

81
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:14,320
 "Come here. Come with me. Let me show you." They go in the other room and Kevin Bacon is there.

82
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:23,320
 He's suspended from his ankles, tied up to like a beam, dead, with no testicles.

83
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,320
 And he's like, "Oh, yeah, I totally just killed that guy a couple days ago."

84
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,320
 And you see where that missing, we see that point.

85
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,320
 And the cops are like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't touch it. Don't touch it."

86
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,320
 Yeah, that, those testicles? They're in there.

87
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:45,320
 Mmm-mmm. I ate them. I ate them. They're in my tummy. I ate his testicles.

88
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:51,320
 Now, he was very... He was very forthcoming.

89
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,320
 He totally admitted to killing Kevin Bacon and eating his testicles.

90
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:00,320
 That wasn't a bit. He actually did devour this dude's balls.

91
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,320
 He said that he stubbed him in the back and then slid his throat and then ate his balls.

92
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,320
 So at least he was dead first. And I mean, it's still gross.

93
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,320
 It doesn't make it any less disgusting. I'm like, "Oh, you killed him first? Well, then go on, good sir.

94
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,320
 Eat all the testicles you want. All the testicles in the world are yours."

95
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:27,320
 Like, no, I'm not saying that. I mean, it would be worse if you, like, if he ate your testicles while you're still alive, right?

96
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,320
 Like, we're in agreement on that. This guy was arrested for it.

97
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,320
 And he actually had gotten in trouble before because some dude ran out of his house, bloodied,

98
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,320
 and this Mark guy was chasing him when the cop showed up.

99
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:45,320
 And the guy's like, "Yeah, that guy attacked me." And Mark goes, "Oh, no, no, no. I attacked him because he stole my kilt.

100
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,320
 That's my kilt." And the guy in the kilt didn't want to press charges, which we saw in the Dahmer case as well.

101
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,320
 We've seen that a lot of times, too, with prostitutes and stuff like that.

102
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,320
 Just press charges, guys. I get it, the first guy probably was closeted and he was with this guy,

103
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,320
 and now all of a sudden he's in a kilt getting chased and he doesn't want to get...

104
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,320
 He might have had a wife and kids or girlfriend or just been straight and he was experimenting, whatever.

105
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,320
 You should have pressed the charges because now this young man's dead.

106
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,320
 So, yeah, you're sank and chased, and I don't use a dating app.

107
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,320
 Well, I'm not gay either, but I don't use a dating app, whatever.

108
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:25,320
 The point of the story isn't that you have to be the exact demographic of Kevin Bacon.

109
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,320
 The point is, whether or not you're Kevin Bacon, whether or not you have testicles,

110
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,320
 the point of the story is be careful of weirdos because they are out there.

111
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:41,320
 I'm not trying to make you paranoid, but this guy existed for 50 years

112
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:47,320
 and the only thing that was suspicious about him before this event is he chased a man in a kilt a couple months ago.

113
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:53,320
 He had a job, he worked, he drove his car next to you, Hong Kong, wave, you're waving at him,

114
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,320
 and you're like, "Why am I doing that? It seems like an affable fellow."

115
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:02,320
 You're standing in line behind him at a Starbucks, not knowing that on Christmas Day,

116
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,320
 he is going to eat a young man's testicles.

117
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,320
 So, just be careful of who...

118
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,320
 There's been a lot of stories recently about people going home with the wrong people,

119
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,320
 that one girl, Peyton Houston in Alabama, left the bar with two guys,

120
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,320
 texted a friend, "I don't feel safe, something's going wrong."

121
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,320
 They find her body, what, two weeks later.

122
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,320
 Just be careful.

123
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,320
 It doesn't mean you have to be a hermit, but follow your guts.

124
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,320
 Not your guts, follow your guts.

125
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,320
 Make sure you don't get in those situations.

126
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,320
 Okay, let's go ahead and move on to...

127
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,320
 You're like, "That's depressing."

128
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,320
 Don't worry, this next story is less depressing and more creepy.

129
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,320
 It's kind of spooky.

130
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:49,320
 So, we are leaving behind Michigan, and we are headed out to St. Petersburg, Florida.

131
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,320
 Yes, we're going to get some sun.

132
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,320
 You're going to rub some suntan lotion on my back?

133
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,320
 You're like, "No."

134
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,320
 I say, "Yeah, yeah, you are."

135
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,320
 I'm imagining you do it right now.

136
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,320
 Law of attraction.

137
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,320
 I'm visualizing it, and you're like, "I can't help myself."

138
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,320
 Your hands start to just dig into my body.

139
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,320
 "Oh, yeah.

140
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,320
 Yeah, just rub it in.

141
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,320
 Rub it in."

142
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,320
 You're like, "Jason, you haven't even had me putting the lotion on yet."

143
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
 And I'm like, "You will."

144
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
 And you just rub my shoulders.

145
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,320
 "Oh, that feels so good."

146
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,320
 We're still in Michigan, by the way.

147
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,320
 We're right outside the police station.

148
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,320
 They're processing this guy.

149
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,320
 You're like, "Jason, just get in the car."

150
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,320
 So, I'm going to let you drive.

151
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,320
 I'm going to let you fly the carpenter copter, for giving me that awesome back rub.

152
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,320
 I'm going to sit in the back and just relax.

153
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,320
 And you're just sitting at a bank of control panels.

154
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,320
 You're like, "I don't know how to fly this thing."

155
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,320
 Just believe that you can.

156
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,320
 Just like I made you give me a back rub.

157
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,320
 You're like, "I thought I was rubbing suntan lotion on."

158
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,320
 No, no, no.

159
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,320
 I made you give me a back rub.

160
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,320
 So, you stare at the control panel and then we call a taxi.

161
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,320
 Because you just can't figure it out.

162
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,320
 We end up in St. Petersburg, Florida.

163
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,320
 You're paying for the taxi, by the way.

164
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,320
 It's June 2012.

165
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,320
 We're standing outside a suburban house.

166
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,320
 My back's all relaxed.

167
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,320
 I made you give me a back rub the whole way.

168
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,320
 Your hands are all cramped up.

169
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,320
 You got a carpal tunnel now.

170
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,320
 Standing outside this suburban house.

171
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,320
 And you're like, "So what are we doing here?"

172
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,320
 And I go, "Well, we are about to investigate a very, very interesting incident."

173
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,320
 For lack of a better word.

174
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,320
 So let's hide in the bushes.

175
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,320
 This is super stupid.

176
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,320
 Get inside in the bushes.

177
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,320
 Just listen.

178
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,320
 Just listen to a big pop of rabbit.

179
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,320
 We're hopping the bushes.

180
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,320
 And we see a teenager sitting on the couch.

181
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,320
 And you look at me, you're like, "How creepy is this story to..."

182
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,320
 Shhh.

183
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,320
 Petting your head.

184
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
 Be quiet.

185
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,320
 Another teenager walks into the living room.

186
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,320
 "Hey, did you hear about what happened the other night?"

187
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,320
 And the guys sitting there playing video games.

188
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,320
 2012, so what is that?

189
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,320
 PS3?

190
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,320
 Playing video games?

191
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,320
 [imitates game sounds]

192
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,320
 Apparently playing Galaga.

193
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,320
 [imitates game sounds]

194
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,320
 And he goes, "Hey man, did you hear about..."

195
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,320
 "I heard there's rumor at school about what happened last night."

196
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,320
 And the buddy's like, "Dude's playing video games on the couch trying to ignore him."

197
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,320
 And the friend's like, "No, no, like you gotta tell me what happened."

198
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,320
 "Because there's just some weird stuff going on."

199
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,320
 "Did you end up getting with that teacher?"

200
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,320
 And the kid shuts off the video game and he stands up and he goes,

201
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,320
 "Listen, I'm gonna tell you something, but you can't tell anybody."

202
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,320
 "You can't tell anybody."

203
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,320
 "Sit down, take a seat."

204
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,320
 And the dude starts telling his friend what happened the other night with the teacher.

205
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,320
 And we kinda look at each other and we're like, "Uhhh, that's not good."

206
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,320
 And then the friend goes home, he leaves his buddy to try to beat his high score in Galaga.

207
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,320
 He goes home and he tosses and turns in bed.

208
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,320
 And he goes, "I can't live with myself knowing this secret."

209
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,320
 "Now we're in this kid's closet."

210
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,320
 "I can't."

211
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,320
 We see him toss and turning, getting all sweaty.

212
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,320
 "I can't sleep thinking about this."

213
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,320
 "I gotta tell this kid's parents."

214
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,320
 So then he goes to the kid's parents the next day.

215
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,320
 "Let's them sleep."

216
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,320
 "Let's them have a good night's sleep."

217
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,320
 Knocks on the front door.

218
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,320
 "Mr. and Mrs. Galaga."

219
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,320
 "I need to tell you about your son."

220
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:04,320
 "Your son and some of his friends from school had a run-in with Daniel Harkins, their teacher at school."

221
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,320
 Now, who was Daniel Harkins?

222
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,320
 35 years old, she was a literacy teacher.

223
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,320
 So I mean, English, I'm assuming.

224
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,320
 This was at a school called the Leland and Asian Neighborhood Family Center.

225
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,320
 It was mostly, like the name implies, a lot of Asian students there.

226
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,320
 And I don't know if they were like first generation or something like that,

227
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:26,320
 but it's kind of weird that the name of the school is like somebody's last name

228
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,320
 and the ethnicity that goes there.

229
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,320
 Where did you go to high school?

230
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,320
 Oh, I go to Eisenhower and Black Student School.

231
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,320
 Like it's kind of weird that that's the name of it.

232
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,320
 But anyways, that's the name of it.

233
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,320
 I mean, it's not a made-up story.

234
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,320
 It's a real place.

235
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,320
 She teaches at Lealman and Asian Neighborhood Family Center.

236
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,320
 So there's a lot of Asians that go there.

237
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,320
 Now, she's married with two kids.

238
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,320
 And before you start thinking this is some gross sex thing, it's not.

239
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,320
 I know that was kind of-- that was unintentional.

240
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:58,320
 As I was telling the story, it seemed like I was setting it up that she's banging these students.

241
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
 And I don't cover stuff like that.

242
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,320
 I think that's gross.

243
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:07,320
 But not that this story isn't disgusting, but it's disgusting in a different way.

244
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,320
 So no, don't worry about that.

245
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,320
 That's not going to happen.

246
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,320
 What happens is weird, though.

247
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,320
 So anyways, yeah, that's not what I'm leading up to.

248
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,320
 She is married with two kids, though.

249
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,320
 And she's had issues with her family.

250
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:26,320
 Just in her family life, she'd actually gotten herself charged with sexual violence

251
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,320
 and her husband got charged with domestic violence.

252
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,320
 Both charges were dropped, but they are getting a divorce.

253
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:40,320
 And when she's getting a divorce, her friends and family start to realize that she's not all there.

254
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,320
 I.e., she's becoming super religious.

255
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,320
 Now, that is going to happen from time.

256
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,320
 And I'm not saying that being religious is wrong.

257
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,320
 I'm religious.

258
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,320
 I'm not saying that at all.

259
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,320
 But you do have a tendency with people who have huge life changes.

260
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,320
 It could be that they're getting over addictions or getting out of prison

261
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,320
 or they're currently in prison or something like that.

262
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:05,320
 They've lost the loved one to turn to religion and turn it up to the nth degree.

263
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,320
 So it's not just that they go to church.

264
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,320
 It's that they go to every church.

265
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,320
 They're going to like 10 different denominations.

266
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:15,320
 They're going to every single possible service you can go to.

267
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,320
 And again, fine.

268
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,320
 But you know what I mean.

269
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,320
 Some people take it too seriously.

270
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,320
 Same thing.

271
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,320
 Some people just want to build a model train.

272
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,320
 And then other people, that's where they spend all their time

273
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,320
 and all their money is building model trains.

274
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,320
 They take it too seriously.

275
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:34,320
 So, yes, I just compared worshipping a deity to building model toys.

276
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,320
 But the point is, is that she went 10 toes deep into this ultra religious.

277
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:45,320
 And the weird thing is, is that people couldn't really figure out what religion it was.

278
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:50,320
 It seemed to be some just kind of vague mashup of religions.

279
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,320
 But she starts talking about demons.

280
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,320
 She starts talking about creatures from another world,

281
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:03,320
 not cool space aliens, but dastardly interdimensional rebellious angels.

282
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,320
 One day she was talking to a neighbor, having normal conversation.

283
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:12,320
 And then Daniel kind of looks at her and goes, "You're okay.

284
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,320
 You don't have any demons."

285
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
 Then leaves.

286
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
 You're like, "What?"

287
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,320
 Yeah, I know she's kind of getting a little too religious, but that's weird.

288
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:28,320
 Like, what if she had thought I did have demons?

289
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,320
 Neighbor just kind of puts it out of her mind.

290
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,320
 Going through a rough patch in life.

291
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,320
 June 9th, 2012.

292
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,320
 Daniel Harkins gets some of her favorite students together and says,

293
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:46,320
 "Guys, we gotta meet up. We gotta do something outside of class."

294
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,320
 "Why don't you guys?"

295
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,320
 And the kids are like, "Yeah, yeah, you know, like we really like you. You're a good teacher."

296
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,320
 And that doesn't sound suspicious at all.

297
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,320
 That doesn't sound weird. One bit.

298
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
 You want to go Chuck E. Cheese.

299
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,320
 You want to go to Pizza Hut.

300
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,320
 You want to go to Fud Rockers.

301
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,320
 Apparently one of the kids is really hungry.

302
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:10,320
 And she goes, "No, no, no, no, no. We're going to go out to this area."

303
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,320
 It's like a parking lot.

304
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,320
 "I'm just going to hang out by my car."

305
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
 That's what adults do, right?

306
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,320
 Like, you guys are adults?

307
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,320
 "Come and hang out at my car."

308
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,320
 Again, not suspicious at all.

309
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,320
 They have no reservations against this.

310
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,320
 So she must have been a really cool teacher.

311
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,320
 Like, dangerous minds level of cool.

312
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,320
 Kids really believed everything she said.

313
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,320
 "I'm not teaching you. You guys are teaching me."

314
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,320
 They're like, "You're right. We are teaching her."

315
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:45,320
 We're teaching her how to be very suspicious and trick us to go into an abandoned parking lot with her.

316
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,320
 So the night comes, the friends show up.

317
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:53,320
 She's standing outside her car and there's a little, she started a little fire on the parking lot.

318
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,320
 Again, the students, not suspicious at all.

319
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,320
 They're like, "Hey, Mrs. Harkin. Hey, Mrs. H, how you doing?"

320
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,320
 She's like, "Oh, I'm so glad you guys came. I'm so glad you guys came."

321
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:08,320
 "You know you guys are my favorite students, fire crackling."

322
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:15,320
 "I love you guys so much, but you have demons in you, all of you."

323
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:22,320
 "Just one demon each, but they're in there."

324
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,320
 And these all kids are all like early teens, early teens.

325
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,320
 I think like 15, 16.

326
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,320
 Kids look at each other. Here's this adult figure, someone who's more than twice their age,

327
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,320
 telling them, someone they respect and they've learned so much from,

328
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,320
 and they're also, these kids are also stupid, because they went, I shouldn't say stupid,

329
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,320
 they're manipulated to coming out here.

330
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,320
 Because obviously something nefarious was going to happen.

331
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:54,320
 There's no reason why an adult teacher should be inviting minor students to hang out outside of the school.

332
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,320
 Either there's going to be some drugs and alcohol, they're going to do some sort of Reservoir Dog style heist,

333
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:04,320
 something sexual, like there's no reason why the teacher should be hanging out with them outside of school,

334
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,320
 outside of any sort of extracurricular thing in the middle of nowhere.

335
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,320
 So the kids, none of these red flags are going off. She has these kids in thrall.

336
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:17,320
 So when she's telling them that they have demons in them, they don't book it.

337
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,320
 They don't kick bricks, they stay there and listen to her, and she goes, "You have to get them out."

338
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:25,320
 And the only way to get them out is through cutting.

339
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:30,320
 You have to hurt your body to get the demon to jump out, right?

340
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,320
 I mean, that makes sense. If you were in a car and the car caught on fire, you would get out of the car.

341
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,320
 So the demon has to think that your body is in danger, the demon will leave your body.

342
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:44,320
 And at that point, she stands there and goes, "So hurt yourselves. Get the demons out of you."

343
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:50,320
 Now, this is when the kids start to become rational and think, "That's no, we're not going to do that."

344
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,320
 We're not going to hurt ourselves like Mrs. H.

345
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,320
 We're not going to... That doesn't make sense.

346
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:05,320
 And at that point, Danielle gets a lighter. She started the little fire, so the foreshadowing that she has the ability to create flame.

347
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,320
 She grabs a lighter and tries to set one of the kids on fire.

348
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,320
 "What are you doing? What are you doing? Stay away from me."

349
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:19,320
 Doesn't work. The lighter goes out, but then she pulls out perfume, sprays it on the kids' hands and lights them.

350
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,320
 His hands catch on fire.

351
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,320
 To the point where it's not like a YouTube video where you're like, "Ah, put it out," and you're like, "Nice one, Mrs. H."

352
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,320
 Second-degree burns, really, really serious burns on portions of his hands.

353
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:37,320
 At that point, she takes a broken bottle, smashes it on the ground, and slashes the kids back.

354
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:46,320
 Then turns, cuts the kids' neck, takes out a key, heats it in the fire, and then cauterizes the wound in his neck.

355
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:53,320
 Now, obviously, these kids, I think there was like five or six kids, they definitely outnumber her, but she's doing this damage to them.

356
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:58,320
 She set one on fire, she stabbed one in the back, she slashed her dude's neck, and then he was there a lot.

357
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,320
 "Ow, what are you doing?" And then she's like, "Oh, I'll take care of it. Let me get this key red hot."

358
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:08,320
 He's like, "Okay." And then he lets her do that. This is how we get the demons out.

359
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,320
 And that's all we know about what happened that night.

360
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:21,320
 Because this is how the story started, with the friend saying, "Hey, what happened? I heard something."

361
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:30,320
 One of the kids tells his friend, "Yeah, I was out the other night with the teacher, and she told us we had demons in us, and the story I just told you."

362
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:42,320
 And the friend goes to that kid's parents and says, "You're not gonna believe this. This is gonna sound like the stupidest thing ever, but your son was part of a thing where just the other night they were getting slashed up by this teacher."

363
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:51,320
 And demons are in him. Did he mention that? And the parents are like, "No, we wondered why he was wearing Michael Jackson gloves on both hands. It was weird. I mean, we get one."

364
00:24:51,320 --> 00:25:00,320
 But the parents start asking, and they figure out these kids had been attacked by this teacher. And when they'd asked the kids, "Hey, can I-- let me see your hands."

365
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:07,320
 "Uh-huh." Takes the gloves off. They're burned. How'd you get those burns? I don't know. I'm not telling you.

366
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:13,320
 What burns? Kid/neck, a little scar from the key. What happened? I don't know. Nothing.

367
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:20,320
 Is it true that you-- Daniel, your teacher, said you had demons? Nope. Nope, not true. Never happened.

368
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:29,320
 Everyone who was at that ceremony, 'cause that's how it was described, apparently after all of this, they started dancing and chanting, and other people did begin hurting themselves.

369
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:39,320
 But it's very-- we don't know. There are very, very vague details on that. The only version of the story we know is the version that the kid told his friend.

370
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:48,320
 The friend told the parents, and then eventually the police. All of the kids said, "We're not saying anything." They completely clammed up. None of them would fess up to it.

371
00:25:48,320 --> 00:26:03,320
 The teacher ended up getting arrested. She says nothing. The kids say nothing. The police only have to go off of a second-hand account and scars, burns, cuts. That's all they have. And that's enough. That's enough.

372
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:13,320
 The second-hand testimony wouldn't be enough. But when you're sitting there with second-degree burns on your hands, which is amazing, he didn't end up going to the hospital, but she gets fired from her job, obviously.

373
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:24,320
 She gets charged with one count of child abuse, one count of aggravated battery, which would be the one guy who told his friend. Everyone else, no one said anything.

374
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:35,320
 She gets after this story, because basically everyone else is going, "No, no, no. What? I burned myself with this key. I was born like this. This is a birthmark."

375
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:45,320
 They could only charge her with the one story that they knew, which was that story that the friend said. Six months in prison. That's what she got. Or jail, however it works out. Six months.

376
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:55,320
 She gets out, disappears. Now, the articles at the time said we were unable to find her after she got out. We went to the door, knocked on the door, no one came in the house.

377
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:07,320
 Articles since then have kind of made it look like she's mysteriously disappeared from the area. It could just be the reporters never found her, and then the story just kind of died, because what it seems like the town wants this story to die.

378
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:18,320
 It's such a bizarre story. Nobody wants to fess up to it. It makes this town look bad. You have a teacher who's doing a bunch of weird stuff, so the town doesn't want to talk about it.

379
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:27,320
 The kids don't want to talk about it, other than that one friend who heard the story. And he must be going through some stuff, because he's like, he must feel like he's being gaslit.

380
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:38,320
 He must feel like this whole story is just bagpipe music, and everyone else is a McDonald's manager saying, "No, it didn't happen. No, it didn't happen." But he knows he heard the story from his friend one night.

381
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,320
 And then even his own friend was like, "No, I never told you that story. It didn't happen."

382
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:56,320
 To me, she almost sounds demonic, keeping these kids in thrall to her, injuring them, convincing them that they need to hurt themselves to release these demons.

383
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,320
 To me, that sounds like something an evil person would put out into the world.

384
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:07,320
 And what's creepy about this is, one, the woman who did this, six months in custody and is completely out.

385
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:18,320
 You have this group of kids who are willing to lie to their parents, and lie to law enforcement officers, and ultimately to themselves about what happened that night.

386
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:30,320
 And they're still able to communicate with each other. She may or may not be in that area, but you have to figure that they can still get a hold of her and she can still get a hold of them.

387
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:37,320
 You basically have the beginnings of a cult, a cult that is going so far in its first moments.

388
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:42,320
 Most cults don't make you start cutting yourself open till way later.

389
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,320
 Jim Jones and the show would say, "Hey, everyone, drink Kool-Aid. That was long into the process."

390
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:53,320
 And you have someone who can get people to cut themselves, to hurt themselves.

391
00:28:53,320 --> 00:29:00,320
 First, she hurts them, but they take it, and then eventually they begin hurting themselves as well.

392
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:09,320
 What is that group of people doing today? Have those kids gone on to have normal lives in eight years since this has happened? Who knows?

393
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:16,320
 Is this woman teaching somewhere else under another name, or building another group? Who knows?

394
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:29,320
 But what we do know is you have a woman out there who believes that demons can be exercised from you through pain and blood and flame and fear.

395
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:35,320
 And she successfully tricked a group of kids into believing that as well.

396
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:43,320
 What happens when that woman is lost in society? You don't know where she's at. You don't know what she's up to.

397
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:54,320
 It's possible that she also has realized the error of her ways, and that it was foolish to believe that people have demons in them, and this is the way to get rid of them.

398
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,320
 But it's also possible that she's continuing this plan.

399
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:09,320
 It's possible that she has the ability to convince you that there is something dark inside of you, and only she can help get it out.

400
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,320
 And she's still out there.

401
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:20,320
 You may run into her today and you go, "Jason, that doesn't concern me. Some woman comes up to me and starts talking to me about demons being inside of me. I'm too smart to fall for that stuff."

402
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:31,320
 But again, that message sounds demonic in and of itself. You may not be able to be convinced by a divorcee, mother of two, passing through your town,

403
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:40,320
 but if that woman, if she's the one possessed by a demon, you might find yourself being a little more persuaded.

404
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:50,320
 You may think that you're too smart to fall for it, but with dark forces behind her, you may find yourself looking in the mirror one night,

405
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:59,320
 remembering the words she said to you briefly as you passed her in a parking lot, looking in the mirror and thinking,

406
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:09,320
 "I can see the demons now. She was right. How much do I have to hurt myself to free me from this darkness?"

407
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:21,320
 And let me say right now, don't hurt yourselves. Don't. Don't. That was a spooky ending for a spooky story, but don't do that.

408
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:29,320
 No self-harm. I'm not endorsing that at all. I was trying to give it a little Twilight Zone spin. Don't hurt yourselves. That's stupid.

409
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:36,320
 These kids were just more idiots for doing it, but you know, I like to end it on a spooky element, but sometimes you got to be responsible too.

410
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,320
 Don't hurt yourselves. Don't commit suicide. Be excellent to each other.
