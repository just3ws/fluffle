00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,900
 Human laziness causes a ghost to be born, the most annoying case of first contact,

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:17,000
 and then we've all heard the story of the Garden of Eden of Adam and Eve.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 But did you know that the gravesite of Eve, mother of all humanity, has been found in the Middle East?

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 The location has been known for a thousand years, and she's gigantic today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenterder.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 We've got a lot of stuff to cover, so we're going to get started.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 But first off, I got to say thank you to our newest Patreon supporter, Thomas Redacted.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Yes, his last name has been redacted, so he just has to go by the name Thomas.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Now, Thomas, thank you so much for supporting the Patreon. He's actually, the reason why his name is redacted,

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 he's currently working on an SCP VR game. He's building it himself.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 So that's pretty cool, man. I love it when you guys are creative and doing creative things and always working on stuff.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 So, SCP, the game is called SCP Secure Contain Survived, and it should be coming out when he finishes it.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 No pressure, Thomas, but thanks for supporting the show. If you can't support the Patreon, that's okay.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Just help get the word out about the show. Really, really helps a lot.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Leaving reviews wherever you listen to podcasts really helps a lot.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 We have flyers in the show notes you can download to put up around your town.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Everything helps so, so much. Let's go ahead and get started here. Thank you, Thomas, for your support.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 We're going to give Thomas the keys to the Carpentercopter, and we're flying out to Alabama.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 And, Thomas, right there, hit that time travel button. We're going back to the very nonspecific era of the early 1800s.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Now, I know what you're thinking, Jason. Wait a second. We're going to Alabama. It's the early 1800s.

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Does this story involve a bunch of slaves? Of course it does.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Helicopter or flying back in time, we're flying over Alabama.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Now, again, usually I'm super skeptical of stories that are just early 1800s. They couldn't even give us a decade.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 But we're going to land this helicopter, we land it in this doots field. This guy comes out to greet us.

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 He's Dr. John Purefoy. Hello, people. Welcome to my farm.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Don't look over there. Don't look over the slave quarters. That will make me be a bad human.

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 No, look over here at all of this other stuff. We're like, dude, there's slaves over there, too.

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 No, no, no, those are servants. It's a difference, my friend. Come, join us. Servants, fetch them some lemonade.

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Now we're drinking lemonade, and he's like, welcome to my estate.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Anyways, I'm a doctor, and I'm going to change my voice back to normal voice.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 I'm not irritating. That's the next story he's irritating.

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Dr. Purefoy tells us this, hey, guys, listen, malaria is sweeping the region.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 But I'm really good at carrying it. I'm really, really good at taking the air out of malaria and it suffocates and dies.

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 And we're just like, we're like, we kind of chuckle as he's like, a Shireenie's too big servants to come be to supper.

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 That was funny. And he's like, okay, servants, you can leave. Anyways, he's trying to relieve malaria.

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 And he's treating these patients at his house, which he really should have warned us about before he invited us on the porch for lemonade.

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 But right in the door next to us, we hear all these people dying.

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 But he has this well in his backyard. Apparently, this is a true story. Apparently, John Purefoy was a doctor.

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 He was treating malaria patients and he had a well in his backyard, but the well goes dry.

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 So he tells his servants, according to the terminology used in this story, servants, you need to start going down to the river and bringing me back some water.

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Now, the river was down by Savage Hill, which was a mile away.

43
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 So they're like, are you serious? He's like, dude, I got these people dying of malaria.

44
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 You know some of these guys, you know, Thomas, now Thomas is no longer piloting the helicopter now. He has malaria.

45
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 He's melting in the bed on the other side of the wall as we're still drinking lemonade. Jason, no, don't make me.

46
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Don't make me part of this story. And Dr. Purefoy goes, yeah, look at Thomas. He's dying here.

47
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Go walk a mile away, servants, and get buckets of water. You got to bring him back.

48
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 They need a lot of water, guys. They're like, oh man, they're all walking, walking to the river.

49
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Oh man, stupid malaria. I wish I had malaria. I could lay in bed all day long. I wouldn't have to walk a mile.

50
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 They start getting buckets of water. Now, the servants come up with a plan. Dude, this sucks. This is the worst job ever.

51
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 So let's go tell Dr. Purefoy that we can't get the water.

52
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Now, their servants, so they just can't like quit or put in their do-ease notice, they have to come up with a plan.

53
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 They have to have an idea. So they go back to Dr. Purefoy with a bunch of empty buckets.

54
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Because he's like, dude, people are dying here. You can't be glally cagging. I sent you guys out.

55
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 And they're like, hey, listen, this is what happened, man. So we were walking with the empty buckets to go get water.

56
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 And there's like this fence. But yet you have to walk around to get to the Savage Hill.

57
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 And he's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know the geography of the area.

58
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 He goes, but on the other side, the servant goes, but on the other side of the fence was a witch. What? There's a witch out there now?

59
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Yes. Maybe she's causing malaria. I don't know. I'm no doctor. But there's a witch on the other side of the fence.

60
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 And when we walk around the fence, like so we walk around the fence, we get the water.

61
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 And then when we're coming back, the witch is jumping out and scaring us and making all the water fall out of the buckets.

62
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 And then we came back here to tell you this again. This is supposedly a real story. This is a local legend in this area.

63
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 I didn't say this earlier. It's in Furman, it's in Furman, Alabama, Furman, Alabama is the name of this place, which is hilarious.

64
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 So anyways, this is supposedly a true local legend. And I believe John Purfoy is a real person as well. But anyways, the point is, is that this real real person or not real person or a local legend,

65
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 John Purfoy is obviously not happy. The fact that he's sending his employees out to go get water and a witch is attacking them.

66
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Now he obviously doesn't believe there's a witch out there. He has way bigger things to worry about, i.e. his house full of dying people.

67
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 So he goes, "Listen, okay, that's fine. There's a witch out there or whatever. You have two choices. You can go bring back water, witch or not, but you're going to scare me."

68
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Okay, then don't, if you know the witch is behind the fence, it's only going to work one time. Second time you're not going to be scared.

69
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 But anyways, you can either do that or you can go in the backyard and dig me another well. But I need water. These people are dying.

70
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 So the servants go, "I will dig you another well." And he goes, "Fine, fine, fine."

71
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 But he realizes that they don't know how to dig a well. They've never dug a well in their lives.

72
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 So he has to leave. Thomas is like, "No, no, more medicine." And Dr. Purfoy gets up and goes into the backyard.

73
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 The store's taking a lot longer than I thought it would. Dr. Purfoy is now standing in the backyard.

74
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Now he's directing his slaves, because that's what they are. They're not servants. He's directing his slaves to dig a well.

75
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 And the whole time he's like, "This is how you safely dig a well. You have to put these bracing all along the side.

76
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 You dig down, you move the brace down, you keep digging down, you move the brace down. This is how you safely do it."

77
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 And he stood up there and he goes, "Do you guys...?" Like, they've dug half the well at this point.

78
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 And he goes, "Do you guys have this...?" You guys are going to do this safely, right?

79
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 And they're like, "Yes, we are, sir. Yes, we are." And he goes back and to take care of Thomas, who's in the final stages of malaria, poisoning, or whatever it is.

80
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Dr. Purfoy walks away and after about an hour the slaves go, "Ah, this sucks. This has taken too long. We don't need the safety things on the side.

81
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 We can just continue to dig the well." And then, supposedly, it'll fill up with water and then the guy who's down there will just flow to the top, done and done.

82
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 So they keep digging the well and they stop using the side braces because it did take too long and then...

83
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 That's not a motorcycle coming. That's not a guy going, "Ugh, you can't see what I'm doing." It's not a guy shaking his jowls.

84
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 That's the sound of the well collapsing. "Oh no, Bobby!"

85
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 A bunch of dirt falls in on the guy at the bottom of the well. "Ugh, Dr. Purfoy." Damn it! It comes running out of the house because he hears it.

86
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 What happened? There's no one down there, right? And everyone's like, "Uh, define down there."

87
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 And he's like, "Is there a human being trapped in this collapsed well?" Yes. Yes, there is. So they start digging. Start trying to dig this guy out.

88
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Hours later, hours later, they're still digging and they can start to hear him crying from this collapsed well.

89
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 And they dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, never find his body. And you're like, "Jason, come on, this story's 100% made up, dude. How can you not find a body?"

90
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 And you're like, "Oh, let me finish. Let me finish. Let me finish." They dig, dig, dig, dig, dig. His body disappeared 100 years ago, two nights.

91
00:09:48,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 And the well was in your backyard. No, they dig, dig, dig. They can't find his body. And then they're like, "Oh, well, we better start going to the river again because all these people are dying."

92
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 But to this day, this is where it gets super spooky. You're like, "Jason, a human being buried alive is pretty darn spooky." You're right.

93
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 But even to this day, the place where that well is, there's like a depression in the yard. There's like a big dip, right?

94
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 And no grass grows, which that part isn't technically scary because there's a lot of places there's no grass.

95
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 Oh no, the desert, it's cursed. There's no grass that grows right over where this well hole was. And then sometimes like, so you're...

96
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 The Purefoy House is a real house. This is a real location you go visit. So if you're ever in Furman, Alabama, you can go to the Purefoy House.

97
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 And you can see this little well indentation in the back. And sometimes the ghost of the man buried in the well will appear, like just sitting there.

98
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 And he'll cry, "Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh,

99
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 And he shoots out in two giant streams, like sprinklers. It's an interesting visual. It would make you think that he's being tormented somehow because tears are cool, but if it's burning...

100
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 I get it, but it's completely illogical. The idea of a ghost sitting on top of an indentation of the dirt, I can buy that.

101
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 His tears having the ability to scorch life, I find absolutely ridiculous.

102
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 So he sits on top of the hole and then you'll hear him sometimes late at night. You're walking around the Purefoy House and you'll hear him go and get me out here. Please, please get me out.

103
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Which is creepy because again, it builds the idea that how you die is how you're tormented. Interesting story.

104
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Now, I would be more concerned about, okay, so you go visit the Purefoy House and you're like standing, it's late at night, and you're looking out the window, looking in the backyard, and you see like the ghost of an old slave sitting on the ground going, "Help me, please, get me out of here."

105
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 And you're like, "Man, that was creepy." And then you turn around and you're confronted with a ghost of 30 people who died of malaria just standing behind you, sunken eyeballs, sweaty skin, hands reaching out towards you.

106
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 "I shouldn't have found my back to this malaria hospital."

107
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 Interesting story. I can almost tell you what the breakdown is. I bet you there's a house, really called the Purefoy House, with an odd indentation in the back and this story was reconstructed about it.

108
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 I'm sure that Purefoy was a real doctor. He probably was treated malaria patients in his room. I think everything else is a fable. I think it's a fable for one of two reasons.

109
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 One, we have no accurate detail of when this story actually took place other than the early 1800s, which is a huge swath. That's everything from 1800 to 1850.

110
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 And if there was some sort of paranormal event, if this area was some sort of vortex for ghosts or whatever, dying in a hole, that's horrible.

111
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 But also dying in a disease-ridden house with your family dying next to you because everyone has malaria is equally horrible.

112
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 So you think there would be ghosts in both locations. But the house itself probably isn't creepy. There's probably just some weird geographical formation.

113
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 No grass grows in this area. And people have made the story up since. But an interesting story nonetheless.

114
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 So let's go ahead and move on to our next story. But first off, let's take a moment of silence for Thomas Redacted.

115
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 He died of malaria during that story and he gave his life. So we may continue on.

116
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 So thank you, Thomas. We will carry his ashes around in this vile-- Whoops! Built it. Sorry, Thomas.

117
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Oh well, I appreciated your Patreon donation as you flowed away in the wind.

118
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Now we're going to hop back into the Carbentercopter. We are headed to Montauk Point, Long Island.

119
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 So that's in the New York area. Montauk area, Montauk Island, I don't know exactly what it's called, has a long history of being connected to conspiracy theories.

120
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 I guess that's what Stranger Things is kind of based on. I've heard some whispers that Stranger Things is based on a true story.

121
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 I'll have to do some more research on that. It's just a weird kind of-- It's kind of like an Area 51, but less famous and more bizarre.

122
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 So we'll cover that in a future story. Now that you got excited, you're like, "What do I want to hear about that?"

123
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 Hold on, hold on. Today we're going to hear about a story from 1988.

124
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 Now I've been going through my 1988 file. They're basically short little blurbs that I find fairly interesting.

125
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 Let's take a look at this one. It's winter 1988, so not a specific date. That always makes it a little more odd, but we're not really focused on the details.

126
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 This one is a story that I want you to imagine you've spent your whole life waiting to see aliens, and this is the one you meet.

127
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 There's a couple people walking through the woods, and we're going to join them, so we're walking alongside of them.

128
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Thomas is back to life, but he's made of dust now. He has the powers of dust, which is just the power to lay there on flat surfaces.

129
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 We're walking through the forest with these people. It's late at night, and then--

130
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 [humming]

131
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 We see these multi-colored lights shining through the trees.

132
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Hey guys, come over here. Look at this. We start walking through. I'm assuming it's snowing because it's New York. It's winter.

133
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 [shushing]

134
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 That's us walking through the snow. Apparently, the snow is made out of crepe paper.

135
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 [shushing]

136
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 Super loud. We see these flashing lights.

137
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 [humming]

138
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 And then we see a creature we've never seen before. Almost no human has probably ever seen before.

139
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 It's nine feet tall. Whoa, look at that thing.

140
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 [growling]

141
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 It's kind of moving slowly through the forest.

142
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 So let me read you this description from the website. Think about it, docs.com.

143
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 They could only make out its shape, not its features, since it was covered or made out of some kind of orange and yellow neon fluid.

144
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 There were no eye sockets or mouth that they could see.

145
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 [growling]

146
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 So that's pretty alien, right?

147
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 Like, you're looking at it and it almost looks like--

148
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 [stammering]

149
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 How would you even-- I mean, I think an orange and yellow neon fluid. So was it very--

150
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 like, did it look like a hot lava monster? Like, you imagine when it was a kid? Was there any sort of dripping?

151
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Did it look like it was undulating? Did it look like it was just some sort of mass?

152
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Or did it have a defined humanoid shape?

153
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 But there's something about it that gave it the appearance of not being a solid, but of being a fluid.

154
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Very, very interesting description of an alien, and I can't think of anything we've talked about that's come close to that.

155
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 The Conformers, which was a silica-based alien, is the only thing that's vaguely close to it.

156
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 This one is a fluid walking creature alien cryptid.

157
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 But it turns and looks at us.

158
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 [gasp]

159
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 And then it lets off a noise.

160
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 And I'm gonna read this quote again from thinkaboutitdocs.com.

161
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 It let out a whale. I'm gonna tell you this too, guys.

162
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 If you're listening to this on headphones, be prepared, okay?

163
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Because we got it. I had to replicate this sound.

164
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 But I'm gonna give you-- I'm just giving you a warning now to start taking the headphones off.

165
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 It let out a whale that sounded like a combination of an air raid siren and grading metal.

166
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 [air raid siren]

167
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 The creature then begins running towards us. Full speed!

168
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 We turn, we run, we're running through the forest, it's running after us.

169
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 And we start to see it run by power line cables, and each time it passes one--

170
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 [air raid siren]

171
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 [air raid siren]

172
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 The power line cables spark.

173
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 Now, absolutely bizarre story. Apparently these people got away because they lived to tell it.

174
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Fascinating story, terrible vision of an alien race we would never want to meet.

175
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 That sound effect would have-- that--

176
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 You want to talk to aliens.

177
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 If aliens came down and they just like looked at you and were like, "Eh."

178
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 And just kept going, it would still be cool that you saw an alien, but I think the thing about First Contact,

179
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 people want to meet aliens. They want answers, they want to be able to trade technology, or go to war with them like me.

180
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 I want to be able to engage in open warfare with something that I don't care if they die or not, which would be me versus aliens.

181
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 So, that. If I though had First Contact with this--

182
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Like, I would be like, "Fine, keep the secrets of the universe."

183
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 "Oh, you have the cures to all known to season?" "Nah, nah, it's fine."

184
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 "No, dude, seriously, no, no, no, no, you're cool, dude."

185
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 "Just, you can go take that." "We'll figure it out on our own, bro."

186
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 "No, no, okay, no, no, no, no, you're good, you're good."

187
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 That would be the most flat-out annoying alien to talk to.

188
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 I'd rather hang out with Alph. I'd rather have Alph as a Siamese twin, and I'm eating the cats than hang out with that dude.

189
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 So, sorry, neon liquid man. You did scare us, you gave us a good scare, you chased us away.

190
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 This story may or may not be true, but you would be the most annoying alien to hang out with.

191
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 Let's go ahead and move on to our last story. Our last story is actually a request, and it's surprisingly short.

192
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 Surprisingly short, because there's not a ton of information on it. I looked around a lot.

193
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 This is a request from a listener named Ennio. He sent me a bunch of stuff.

194
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 A bunch of really interesting stuff, so I really, really appreciate that. We're leaving behind Montauk.

195
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 We're flying away. Montauk, we are headed to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia.

196
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 And we're walking around. Now, in Jeddah, there's a neighborhood called Alblad.

197
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 And in Alblad, there is just this nothing. It's just like, it's the literal nothing. It's the Varian existence.

198
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 It's this, just like kind of like a flat area, and it's like there's nothing there.

199
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 And I'm like, here it is, guys. Get out your pitchforks and your shovels.

200
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 And everyone's like, what? I thought we were going to visit a graveyard.

201
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 And I go, well, we are. And I point out at this vast expanse.

202
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 Now, this is an interesting story. Sami Nawar. Sami Nawar. This is this guy.

203
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 He's the Jeddah's general director for the city's cultural and tourism department.

204
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Summed it up best. Summed up this whole story. It's best. Quote, "It's a legend, but it's one mentioned by many scholars."

205
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 So it's something people just go, yeah, yeah, it's probably fake, but everybody talks about it.

206
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 And what it is, is that supposedly, in Jeddah, is the grave site of Eve.

207
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 So, this is one of the stories that I never really even considered. So you have Adam and Eve.

208
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Now, I guess I never really thought about them having grave sites.

209
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 I have no idea where Adam's buried, but it's supposedly Eve. The mother of all humanity is buried in Jeddah.

210
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 So, why isn't there like a theme park built around her grave?

211
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 Come on down, Garden of Eve, and the big old slide. You like go up the slide, and then you eat an apple,

212
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 and then it descends all the way into madness, darkness, and death, and then you get back off.

213
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 You're like, oh, let's do that again. You walk around naked, and then you, I don't know, eat more apples the whole thing.

214
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 It's just apple-themed. And then you get a little leaf put on you. Whatever.

215
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 The point is, is that, why wouldn't this be a big tourist destination?

216
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 Why wouldn't you have every scientist in the world?

217
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 Well, I know why you wouldn't have every scientist in the world down there, because they don't believe the story's true.

218
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 But why wouldn't it be a big tourist destination? Well, apparently.

219
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 So, let's go back in time a bit. We're not going all the way back in time to the beginning of humanity,

220
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 but the earliest mention we see of this being Eve's grave site is the 9th century AD.

221
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 So, here's the thing. That's already way later than she would have died.

222
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 So, that's a little bit of a red flag that we never hear of who see this written about until the 9th century.

223
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 But we do see people start talking about this after that.

224
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 And it was also in the English translation of "1001 Arabian Nights"

225
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 this is mentioned that this is the site of Eve's grave.

226
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 But, like churches do, we'll see it in Catholicism, we'll see it not so much in Protestantism or Protestants.

227
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 They seem to be, because it's so fractured, they seem to be more consistent.

228
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 But Catholicism and Islam will do this. You'll see these shifts.

229
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 You'll see these shifts in theology in the way things are interpreted.

230
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 Later on, Islam goes, "You know what? We don't want to venerate the dead.

231
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 We don't want to have tombs for people." I guess there's, and I didn't know this either, there's not a lot of graveyards in the Middle East.

232
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 It's just like they're dead, they're somewhere else, we're not going to have, we're not going to have graveyards.

233
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 So, no, they have graveyards. The bodies just aren't sticking on the street, but they don't do tombstones.

234
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 They don't do mausoleums.

235
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 So, when word gets out that Eve has a giant, and we'll get to that in a second, a giant gravesite,

236
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 and theology is changing, people in Jedago, "Pave it over, get rid of it."

237
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 What? This is the mother of all humanity.

238
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 We don't believe that they should have a mausoleum or a marker for their body.

239
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 So, why would Eve even get one?

240
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 The February 27th issue in 1928 of Time Magazine, there's an article saying, "Supposedly this is the resting place of Eve,

241
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 but the government of Saudi Arabia is destroying it."

242
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 So, this wasn't a local legend. This was something that was, again, not everyone believed Eve was actually in there,

243
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 but people believed that this place existed. This wasn't a well in someone's backyard that may or may not have been a hole.

244
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 This is something that people from the 9th century to 19- even today said this is a gravesite.

245
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Most likely the gravesite of Eve, but there definitely is a body buried underneath here.

246
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 In the February 27th to 1928 issue of Time Magazine, they talk about the actual structure, the headstone and all that stuff being destroyed for it, the marker.

247
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 And then in 1975, they encased the whole area in concrete.

248
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 And that's what we're looking at now. It's just basically a parking lot that you can't put cars on.

249
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 So, a gravesite of supposedly the mother of humanity is now encased underneath all of this concrete, and you go,

250
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 "The interesting story! Interesting story. Probably not true. It would be weird that none of this was ever mentioned until the 9th century."

251
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 But possible, right? Possible. You could have her buried and we've seen societies rise and fall and records rise and fall and get destroyed and stuff like that.

252
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Stuff could be discovered, rediscovered and all that. So, it's possible, however unlikely.

253
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 I guess the main thing is whether or not you believe Eve existed in the first place.

254
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 However, there is another interesting twist to this.

255
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 This grave, this grave, right? 426 feet long, 9 feet wide, 19 feet high.

256
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 So now we're looking at this concrete flattened area and you go, "You're telling me that underneath this is a casket that's 19 feet high? 420 feet long?"

257
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 I throw my arm over your shoulder and I go, "That's not even the weird part."

258
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 Now, of course, a pharaoh buried in a pyramid isn't as big as the pyramid. I have a risen knock off all of the bricks.

259
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 The size of the grave doesn't necessarily equal the size of the person inside of it.

260
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 That would be awesome, but that's not the case. But that grave has grown over time.

261
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 Here's this quote. This quote is actually interesting for two reasons.

262
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 Here's this quote. This quote was in 1928. This is when they were first getting ready to knock down all the markers for the grave site.

263
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 This is from Sardar Iqbal Ali Shah. He was a historian. He was a Muslim historian.

264
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 "Eve must have been a lady of formidable proportions. For the original grave, I was told, was some 8 feet long."

265
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 So, when he was told that when she was originally buried, the grave was 8 feet.

266
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 And now it's 428 feet. So, we have two takeaways from that.

267
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 One, she was definitely 8 feet tall, or let's say she was 7 feet tall.

268
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 Because you want to have some room, right? She's the mother of all humanity.

269
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 You don't want to cramp it up in a box. But she could have been at least 7 feet tall.

270
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 But over the centuries, the casket keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.

271
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 Now that makes you think either, one, the story's totally fake.

272
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 Two, people keep adding to the grave site.

273
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 Or three, she's magical and she's continuing to grow.

274
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 Like Rita Rupulsa hit her with some beam. She's getting bigger and bigger.

275
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 And her grave site's getting bigger and bigger. And eventually she will.

276
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 I have arisen and break out of Jeddah and just start smashing people.

277
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 So the monument grew. But even originally it was this big box.

278
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 But let me continue this quote.

279
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 Eve must have been a lady of formidable proportions.

280
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 For the original grave, I was told, was some 8 feet long.

281
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 It was as well, therefore, that she had not survived to welcome us in the flesh.

282
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 For although this is, I've never heard this stereotype before.

283
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 I'm a 43-year-old man. I've heard almost every stereotype in the books.

284
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 I have no stereotypes that are so obscure most people have never heard of them before.

285
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 This one I've never heard before.

286
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 For although it is rumored that we Muslims have an eye for ladies of heroic proportion,

287
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 we draw the line at the Titanic.

288
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 Is that a thing? Do Muslim dudes like giant women?

289
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 Is that an actual, apparently in 1928 the rumor was going around,

290
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 "Oh dude, you see that guy over there? Yeah, he's Muslim."

291
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 Oh that explains why he's with that WNBA star.

292
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 "Oh yeah, dude, living up to the stereotype. Oh man, no, I love her for her personality."

293
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 Not for the fact that her knees come up to my waist.

294
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 "Oh come on man, come on."

295
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Is that a stereotype? Does that stereotype still exist?

296
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 I am extremely interested if people still get, if people, is this a thing?

297
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Apparently at least in 1928 this was a thing.

298
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 Back in time, Scotch people were known to be really stingy.

299
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 Maybe around the same time Muslims were known for dating giant women.

300
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 But they draw the line at the Titanic.

301
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 I can date a woman that's 8 feet tall, but there's no way I'm dating a woman that's 428 feet tall.

302
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 No way. I don't care what your personality is like.

303
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 And then we go back to this.

304
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 He says, "It is rumored that we Muslims have an eye for ladies of heroic proportion,

305
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 we draw the line at the Titanic.

306
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 But I was told that the grave had mysteriously extended itself by the time I arrived

307
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 to its present gigantic proportions."

308
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 So, a whole host of questions.

309
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 And a whole host of questions that nobody's really asking.

310
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 The most important one is, is Eve actually buried under there?

311
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 But because the city of Jeddah is like, there might be some, what grave?

312
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 What grave?

313
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 I just see a parking lot buddy.

314
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 Move along.

315
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 Unless you want to get parked there too.

316
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 You're like, "Huh?"

317
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 Is Eve actually buried there?

318
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 Is anyone buried under there?

319
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 Is she gigantic?

320
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 And the most pressing question, is she growing?

321
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 Right?

322
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 I mean, that would be the main question you would want to answer.

323
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 If you open it up and you found the first woman of all humanity, you'd be like,

324
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 "Whoa, the stories are true."

325
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 If you opened it up, if you opened up the grave and you found her big toe was the size of a Tesla,

326
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 you'd be like, "Run. Run now. Get out."

327
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Two very interesting questions, both coming from the same story,

328
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 and nobody's asking these questions.

329
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Once I learned about the story, and again, thank you, Ennio,

330
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 because again, I never thought about it.

331
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 I was like, "Whoa, Eve's tomb? People have an idea of where it's at?"

332
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 Not a lot of people are asking these questions.

333
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 And I think it's because the questions are really so absurd.

334
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 Right?

335
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 It's just absolutely bizarre.

336
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 And it's a question that I never, never asked myself before.

337
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 Where would Adam and Eve be buried?

338
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 And when I started looking into that, I never thought,

339
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 "Is Eve slowly growing over time?"

340
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 If she was 428 feet tall in the 1970s, how tall is she today?

341
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 I don't know.

342
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 I almost have no way to end this episode.

343
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 And in this episode, otherwise, it's so particularly bizarre

344
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 that this grave is growing.

345
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 If it is, if it's even growing at all,

346
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 I think I've basically broke my brain on this story.

347
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 And I just recently did a story about Chester Cheetah running around

348
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 in Mexican bathrooms.

349
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 So I don't know if it's just the end of the week.

350
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 I don't know if it's the fact that I've never considered this topic,

351
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 and it's more bizarre than I ever could've thought.

352
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 But I have no other way to end this episode,

353
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 except to say DeadRabbitRadio@gmail.com

354
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
