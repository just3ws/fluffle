1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
 A bizarre alien sighting in the middle of nowhere forces us to ask the question, "Wouldn't

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,920
 it suck to be stuck on planet Earth?"

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,600
 And then finally we travel to Brazil to take a look at a terrifying story of a family that's

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,260
 under assault from a violent poltergeist.

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,480
 What does this evil spirit want with the family?

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:32,560
 It turns out the answer to that question is more horrifying than you could ever imagine.

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,120
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:46,280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,280
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenterder.

10
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,280
 I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,760
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,880
 I hope you guys are having tons of fun out there in the world doing all your stuff.

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,720
 Everyone who I know always has fun, more fun than anyone else.

14
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,080
 Walking into Dead Rabbit Command is one of our long time Patreon supporters.

15
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,880
 Everyone give it up for Garrett Rice.

16
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,880
 Woohoo!

17
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,880
 Yeah!

18
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,880
 Come on into Dead Rabbit Command.

19
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,240
 He's walking on in.

20
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,520
 You can already tell this is the funnest dude ever.

21
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,520
 Garrett, you're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode?

22
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,000
 You guys can't support the Patreon.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 That's fine too.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 It really is.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,080
 I don't just say that.

26
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,120
 Just helps read the word about the show.

27
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,880
 That is another way you can really help the show grow.

28
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,760
 Garrett, let's go ahead and toss you a little engineers outfit, a little wooden whistle.

29
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,520
 Hop on board the Carboner Caboose.

30
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,480
 We're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command.

31
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,920
 Chug, chug, chug us all the way out to Brazil.

32
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,520
 Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug,

33
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,280
 going down the mighty railway.

34
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,240
 You all know the one railway that leads from the Pacific Northwest straight to Brazil.

35
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,440
 We're actually doing a Brazil Toof-er.

36
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,760
 Two different stories in Brazil.

37
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,480
 Let's start off in the country of Brazil.

38
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:59,320
 Specifically, we're headed to Boa Vista do Tupam in Brazil.

39
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,400
 So what this story is, is one night, August 16th, the night of August 16th in Boa Vista

40
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:11,880
 do Tupam, a group of people saw a short man standing there, just kind of standing in a

41
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,440
 field, right?

42
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,000
 He's three feet tall, wearing a tight fitting grain cover all.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,280
 He's just standing out in the field with his arms raised up to the sky.

44
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,360
 He's staring off into space, his arms held up high.

45
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,680
 He was also wearing a transparent helmet, and he had this circle on the chest of his

46
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:43,040
 coveralls that was glowing.

47
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,000
 So there's this little three-foot guy just standing there, and his arms are outstretched

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 to the heavens.

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 He's looking up into the night sky, and his arms are just reaching out, a wide embrace,

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,440
 staring into the darkness of the universe.

51
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,320
 Now that's the whole story.

52
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,320
 That's the whole...

53
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,840
 He doesn't do anything.

54
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,520
 He's not chasing around tentacles.

55
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,600
 He doesn't put someone in a wheelbarrow and push them down a hill.

56
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,760
 He's just standing there, staring off into the universe.

57
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,680
 He's like, "Jason, it's going to clearly just be a tiny three-foot guy."

58
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,560
 Maybe, but most three-feet people don't have a little glowing chest on them.

59
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,880
 Don't have a little glowing disc.

60
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:33,440
 Now one or two of them might, but if they did, would they be staring into space?

61
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,440
 Huh?

62
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,440
 You skeptic?

63
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,440
 That's the whole story.

64
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,840
 Yeah, he doesn't have tentacles.

65
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,520
 He doesn't have laser beam or anything like that.

66
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,840
 But I do find this story...

67
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,840
 Intra...

68
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,640
 I love the visual of it.

69
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,880
 Like when I first read this story, I found it on ThinkAbout@Ducks.com, one of my favorite

70
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,160
 websites.

71
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,600
 And they got it from a group called GEPUC Brazil, which is a UFO investigation group.

72
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:59,920
 The imagery struck me, right, of this little guy standing out there just reaching out into

73
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,400
 the vastness of space.

74
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,000
 And I thought...

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,840
 That dude's boned.

76
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,720
 I thought that little guy got left behind.

77
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,480
 And he's looking out and he's like, "Oh, he's like, "Come back!

78
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,480
 Come back!"

79
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,400
 He knows there's no way they can see him, right?

80
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,520
 Despite their advanced technology.

81
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,520
 He's...

82
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,520
 They're gone.

83
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,440
 He's not walking on a UFO.

84
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,920
 He's not surrounded by a bunch of other three-foot tall people with lit up chests.

85
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,920
 They're gone.

86
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,960
 Now, what's possible, I guess you could...

87
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,560
 I guess this is an optimist story, right?

88
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,880
 This is just pessimist.

89
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,800
 You could think, "Well, maybe he knows that his space brothers are coming down."

90
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,040
 And he's like, "Here I am, people.

91
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,040
 Here I am."

92
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,400
 And he has his arms reached out in a sense of joy.

93
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,880
 But you could also be like, his arms are reached out and he's like, "Aw, man!"

94
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,760
 Because he's now been left behind on planet Earth.

95
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,400
 I'm like, you can decide.

96
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,880
 I'm generally an optimist, but when I read this, I go, "He is just like...

97
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,480
 defeated in a sense."

98
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,520
 And we've talked about this on past episodes.

99
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,320
 I'll see if I can find those episodes for the show notes.

100
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,920
 We haven't talked about it a lot, but I imagine for being an alien, getting stuck on Earth

101
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,680
 would be a punishment.

102
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,040
 If it was accidental, it would be a sucky punishment, but I could see them honestly

103
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,120
 doing this on purpose.

104
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,840
 To people they just don't like.

105
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,600
 Other aliens, other members of their crew they don't like.

106
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
 Because Earth...

107
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,520
 Listen, man, I'm Earth-first all the way, baby.

108
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,640
 I love the planet Earth.

109
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,360
 But on a galactic scale, we're totally backwater.

110
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,620
 And we hate...

111
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:47,400
 We hate other humans who are slightly different than ourselves.

112
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,480
 So imagine if you were an alien stuck on this planet.

113
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:56,280
 You know the best case scenario is you're in hiding for the rest of your life and you

114
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,280
 can totally stay out of everyone's view.

115
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,360
 Like you're eating chickens, stealing them out of farms, maybe fashioning some sort of

116
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,480
 shelter super far away from civilization.

117
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,920
 The next best scenario is you get spotted a couple of times and people think you're

118
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,200
 encrypted, but for the most part people don't think you exist so they're not actively looking

119
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,160
 for you.

120
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,400
 Every other scenario is literally the worst case scenario.

121
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,600
 People know that you're real and they're trying to hunt you and kill you.

122
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,760
 They're trying to take you to some sort of government laboratory where they can interrogate

123
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,840
 and then kill you.

124
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,280
 They're trying to do autopsies on you and then keep you as long as they can.

125
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,280
 What is it?

126
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,920
 Vivisection when they're still alive, right?

127
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,240
 Do a vivisection and then kill you.

128
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,560
 Like it would be a bad place to be caught.

129
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:51,640
 So your best case scenario is you're just living on the land from 7 billion people, right?

130
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:57,840
 It would be horrific because there is no scenario where you make it more than a couple months.

131
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,600
 If you don't completely stay out of the cities, if you're on some government's radar or even

132
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,920
 some ranchers' radar, you're boned.

133
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,280
 You're going to get a shotgun to the face at best.

134
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,760
 At that point your best case scenario is you're still in someone's chicken and they blast

135
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,640
 you with a shotgun and then photos of you end up on the Daily Star and people go fake.

136
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,920
 That's totally fake.

137
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,800
 Worst case scenario is you get captured by the government and they do the vivisection,

138
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
 right?

139
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,600
 They're keeping you alive as long as they can and torturing you and stuff like that.

140
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,040
 It'd be horrific.

141
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,640
 It'd be an absolutely horrific thing.

142
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,440
 So imagine what must be going through this dude's head, right?

143
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,640
 Like he's standing out there and he realizes he is...

144
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,640
 Because you...

145
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,640
 How...

146
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,760
 I mean, unless he has some sort of communication device or something like that, he may not even

147
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,760
 be able to rendezvous with his people.

148
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,200
 They might have left him there on purpose.

149
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,680
 They might have done this on purpose.

150
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,720
 It wouldn't be the equivalent of being like, let's say you were a Spaniard, right?

151
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:58,080
 You were in the age of exploration and you got lost somewhere in South America.

152
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,080
 Just yourself.

153
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,120
 A conquistador in South America.

154
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,480
 That would be preferable to this dude.

155
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:12,080
 Because at the end of the day, sure, you may take a couple arrows to the chest and die.

156
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,920
 But there was a chance, though, that you could find a tribe that was starting to ally themselves

157
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,720
 with the Spanish Empire against another larger tribe.

158
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,320
 Tribe's not the right word if we're talking about the Aztecs or something like that.

159
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,600
 You could possibly meet a hot girl.

160
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,520
 Have a couple babies.

161
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,840
 Hang out, be the chieftain's right-hand man.

162
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,000
 You have all of this technology and stuff like that.

163
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,760
 You could probably make a bit of a life for yourself.

164
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,000
 And you would always...

165
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Even if you were left behind by your squadron of conquistadors moving through, there's always

166
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 a chance you could...

167
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 It'd be slight, right?

168
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,160
 You'd have to know where the next galleon was coming with all of these troops and stuff.

169
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,160
 There's a bigger chance of you just staying along the coast always trying to look for

170
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,120
 the giant ships.

171
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,200
 This guy's stuck on Earth.

172
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
 There's no...

173
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,880
 There's beautiful women on Earth, right?

174
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,880
 But he's not being a non-formal.

175
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,200
 He's a laylian, dude.

176
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,160
 All of his experiments have been taking women aboard ships and like injecting them with all

177
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,000
 sort of baby-making DNA fluids.

178
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,120
 I don't know if his equipment even works, right?

179
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,600
 He can't go to the nightclub and be like, "Picking up chicks."

180
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,720
 These three-feet tall wearing a green cover all with a little luminous chest.

181
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,000
 I don't think it would work.

182
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Like, you...

183
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 They would...

184
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,160
 The bouncer wouldn't even let you in.

185
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,000
 You're obviously an alien.

186
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,480
 You're obviously a little alien, bro.

187
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,760
 You got on this big old space helmet and I'm sure maybe he could go get a tux and then

188
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,920
 just look like a normal, like, short man.

189
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,400
 But it wouldn't work.

190
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:41,480
 He would be coming into disadvantage, again, unless he had a space laser, and then the...

191
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,560
 The second he pulled that out on the bouncer, the government's coming in, it would be terrible.

192
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:53,440
 It wouldn't be the equivalent of being a explorer left behind in South America or you're leading

193
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,920
 an expedition through the North Pole and you get lost.

194
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,080
 Well, you're just dead then.

195
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:03,160
 I mean, you can only eat so much penguin before the polar bears get you, but what a horrible

196
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,160
 tragedy.

197
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,760
 And I would assume because we can parallel what we've gone through to what alien life...

198
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,240
 There's so many parallels, right?

199
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,800
 We question what are...

200
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,120
 What is the alien experience?

201
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,800
 Is it interdimensional?

202
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,240
 Is it extraterrestrial, i.e., coming from other planets?

203
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,000
 There's so many parallels, though, between what we do and what they do that there's...

204
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,360
 You can draw some conclusions, right?

205
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:32,320
 And one of them would be, we've had expeditions on Earth go south.

206
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,920
 Not literally not trying to find a way around the South America, but they've gone poorly.

207
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,080
 So you can imagine, even with the most advanced technology, and this is a big part of UFOlogy,

208
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:49,160
 there's crash, people get caught, people get left behind aliens set up bases here and then

209
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,520
 they just get wiped out by humans, things like that.

210
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,360
 So you would have those parallels and you would have those people who are left behind

211
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,080
 on these intergalactic expeditions.

212
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,280
 And it's not like, well, I'll see what I can do.

213
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,440
 I'll try to make a good life here.

214
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,120
 No, it's like I have to spend every waking moment staying away from people.

215
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,040
 Otherwise, I'm going to end up dissected.

216
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,520
 I'm going to have... I went from being in this suit, because even like the Spanish Empire,

217
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,520
 right, they just like had armor.

218
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,560
 They had armor and horses.

219
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,320
 That was like their high technology.

220
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,240
 You could went from armor and having a horse to your bonus South America.

221
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,120
 It's still a pretty chill life down there, right?

222
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,480
 You got tons of food, you got tons of water, you got this hot chieftain daughter that you're

223
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,360
 kicking it with.

224
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:40,000
 This alien guy went from a world of like hyperdimensional travel, holodex, laser beams that could disintegrate

225
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,840
 your enemy and now he's fashioning a spear in the darkness as he hears people rummaging

226
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,480
 through the woods looking for him.

227
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,800
 Like you would go to instant, like it would be the worst.

228
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,520
 It would be the worst downgrade in technology.

229
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,720
 Aspanyard and South America, they're like, "Ah, you know, things are just a bit different

230
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,720
 here."

231
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,920
 It wouldn't have been that big of a drop.

232
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,640
 You're talking about a race that has secured all diseases.

233
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,880
 So now this little dude is getting bit by mosquitoes.

234
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,880
 He's like, "What's a mosquito?"

235
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,160
 I didn't even know these things existed.

236
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,160
 It would be awful.

237
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,880
 It would be awful to be left behind.

238
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,680
 So I don't know what this guy's plans were.

239
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,680
 He could have been here.

240
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,280
 He could have been part of a scouting party to take over the planet.

241
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,240
 We shouldn't feel sorry for him.

242
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,480
 Maybe he was awaiting his space brother's return, right?

243
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,480
 Maybe he was happy to see them coming back and it was just like a short away mission.

244
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:38,720
 Or this little dude back in 1995 got left behind and he was holding his hands up in despair.

245
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:46,800
 Knowing he would never again grace the night sky at the helm of a starship.

246
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,960
 Instead, he would spend the rest of his life smashing two coconuts together, hoping to

247
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,040
 get a single drink of milk.

248
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,120
 And then he gets devoured by a wolf.

249
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,880
 A unfitting end for any traveler, human or alien.

250
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,040
 Garrett, let's go ahead and toss you the keys to the carpenter copter.

251
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,720
 We're leaving one part of Brazil.

252
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,920
 We're still going to be in Brazil this episode.

253
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,800
 We're leaving behind this field in Brazil.

254
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,360
 We're waving goodbye to that guy.

255
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,080
 We're leaving behind this part of Brazil.

256
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:24,280
 Take us all the way out to Jabbo Tocabal, Brazil.

257
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:31,440
 The year is 1965 and we're in the town of Jabbo Tocabal, Brazil.

258
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,240
 Jabbo Tocabal, probably closer.

259
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,520
 I know the guy there's accurate but close enough.

260
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,080
 1965, Jabbo Tocabal, Brazil.

261
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,640
 We're at the Ferraria home.

262
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,840
 The Ferraria family.

263
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:53,000
 Now, we don't have a real idea of how this family was, you know, before these events.

264
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,720
 It could have been a real peaceful family.

265
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,000
 They could have been sitting around the dinner table, eating soup and eat cornbread and stuff

266
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,600
 like that, talking about their days.

267
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,880
 It could have been a chaotic family.

268
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,880
 We don't know.

269
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,880
 But however their life was before these events, a venture cut.

270
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:10,560
 One day, things got out of hand.

271
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:17,080
 A rock materializes out of nowhere and lands right on the floor of the house.

272
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,080
 They're like, "What?

273
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,600
 Where'd that come from?"

274
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
 Everyone's kind of looking around.

275
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
 That's weird.

276
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,880
 That's a once in a lifetime event though, right?

277
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,200
 A rock materializing out of nothing and hitting the ground.

278
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,080
 Happens to every family, at least once.

279
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,680
 What happens though is that this isn't a once in a lifetime event.

280
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,240
 It almost becomes a once in an hour event.

281
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:41,360
 These stones begin to materialize out of nowhere and begin flying around the house.

282
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,240
 Smashing into walls, destroying property pictures and vases.

283
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,400
 They have these rocks flying around.

284
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,400
 Bricks as well.

285
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,440
 You'd see a solid brick just up here out of nowhere fly across the living room and knock

286
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,840
 over a lamp.

287
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:00,200
 And this goes on for a couple days before finally they're like, "Okay, the novelty is totally

288
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,600
 worn off."

289
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,600
 It's completely destroying our lives and our property.

290
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,160
 So the Ferrari family contacts a priest.

291
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,160
 He comes out.

292
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,480
 He comes out and full body armor.

293
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,480
 He's all dodging rocks.

294
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,800
 And he goes, "Tell you what, I'm going to perform an exorcism on the house.

295
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,600
 I believe an evil spirit is taken over the home."

296
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,280
 And he performs an exorcism and then he's like, "I'm out.

297
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,040
 I'm out before I know whether or not this worked."

298
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,800
 And it didn't work.

299
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,920
 In fact, it made the phenomenon worse.

300
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,560
 So now you had more rocks flying around, bigger rocks flying around.

301
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,440
 One of them was over eight pounds.

302
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,080
 Listen, if I came home one day and pebbles were flying around my house, that'd be pretty

303
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,080
 cool, right?

304
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,080
 Dirt, right?

305
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,480
 My apartment's so dirty.

306
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,520
 Anyways, it's so dirty.

307
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,880
 Just like literal dirt.

308
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,680
 Like all the clothes are picked up.

309
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,160
 There's no food stuff laying around, but there's like dirt in my apartment somehow.

310
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,800
 Anyways, there's a little dust devil floating around in my house.

311
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,000
 I would just like close my eyes and be fine with it.

312
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,800
 Boulders, eight pound rocks flying through my house.

313
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,800
 Uh-uh, you can't do that.

314
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,800
 And some of the...

315
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,280
 So I read a couple articles on this and some of them specified that some of the rocks were

316
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,280
 magnetic.

317
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,960
 And I thought, "Okay, that doesn't make it any worse or better."

318
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,920
 I mean, it's kind of a cool novelty, right?

319
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,200
 ICP's like, "Oh, we don't believe this part.

320
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,120
 These rocks, some of them are magnetic.

321
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,640
 What does that have to do with anything they're appearing out of nowhere?

322
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,040
 That's the bizarre part."

323
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,440
 Not like they're like, "Did you know that this rock is Ignatius?"

324
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,160
 I'm like, "It's going out of nowhere.

325
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,480
 I don't care where it came from on the planet.

326
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,600
 Some of these rocks are magnetic.

327
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,600
 They're flying around the house."

328
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,280
 I guess it would be funny though if you were carrying your car keys or like, "Time to go

329
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,280
 to work."

330
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,600
 And then a magnetic rock flew by and your keys stuck to them.

331
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,080
 And then it dematerializes.

332
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,640
 You're like, "Ah, my car keys!"

333
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,680
 Okay, so I understand why they listed magnetic rocks.

334
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:57,120
 But anyways, then almost as soon as it started, the phenomenon stops.

335
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:04,120
 The rocks stop materializing and pelting the family and all of their property.

336
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,120
 There is a brief moment of peace, right?

337
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,240
 They think it's all over.

338
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,680
 These rocks aren't flying around anymore.

339
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:18,120
 Whatever is causing this then begins to pick up pieces of their furniture, whole couches,

340
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,560
 and chairs and flinging them against the wall.

341
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:28,480
 So now all of the stuff that survived the initial barrage of these rocks, they now are being

342
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,480
 lifted up.

343
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,480
 You're like sitting on the couch.

344
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,480
 It's all flying around.

345
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,480
 You're like, "Woohoo!"

346
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,320
 You're like riding like a rodeo bull.

347
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,360
 Now this goes on for a long time.

348
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:43,480
 The entire phenomenon from the very first rock materializing to when it ends, we're talking

349
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,840
 about five years.

350
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,960
 This was going on.

351
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,400
 What a chaotic place to live in.

352
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,520
 Again, if they are already a chaotic family, it's just adding to it.

353
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:57,320
 If they are like a peaceful family, like the Leave It To Beaver people, you can't even try

354
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,000
 to have a normal household when all this stuff is going on.

355
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,760
 This whole story takes place in the span of five years.

356
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,760
 Here's one of the things though, but here's really the main thing.

357
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:16,680
 What the family realized that most of this activity centered on their daughter, an 11-year-old

358
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,160
 girl known as Maria Jose Ferreria.

359
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,520
 This is super common in poltergeist lore.

360
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:30,160
 Most of the time when we look at poltergeist activity, it is tied to a preteen to teenage

361
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,400
 girl.

362
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,800
 There is the theory that all of the emotional turmoil they're going through, all of their

363
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,760
 hormones and everything like that, for whatever reason, this is something that parapsychology

364
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,920
 has been trying to figure out for decades, a hundred years at this point.

365
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,320
 Why is it that young girls?

366
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,360
 Why is it that poltergeist activity centers around them?

367
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:55,760
 They've never been in, a lot of times they do say it's like somehow their emotional

368
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,720
 seesaw that they're constantly on and all of these hormones and stuff, but obviously

369
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:04,480
 there's billions of teenage girls out there and they're not exhibiting this, so what else

370
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,600
 could be the key?

371
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,600
 What's the other factor?

372
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,040
 Well, this story kind of answers that question and the answer is not a good one.

373
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:15,720
 Maria has this poltergeist activity kind of centering around her.

374
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,320
 She is being personally tormented by this force.

375
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,240
 So the rocks are flying around and everybody, it's knocking over everyone's personal stuff,

376
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,640
 the furniture doesn't matter who's sitting on it, it's going to go flying around the

377
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:35,720
 room, but with Maria this invisible force would slap her right across the face.

378
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:42,160
 She would also complain of being bitten and you would actually see bites and bruises on

379
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,360
 her body.

380
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:53,360
 She also was complaining that she could feel needles underneath her skin.

381
00:19:53,360 --> 00:20:00,000
 In fact, at one point, one incident, because you're thinking, "Oh, whatever, do one needle

382
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,960
 in my skin, I can do that, I would go to school, I'd go to school all day long."

383
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,120
 Big wussy.

384
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,480
 Not only did she have these needles appearing in her skin, at one point, one incident, she

385
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:19,800
 had 55 needles that had to be removed, 55 needles all in one ankle.

386
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,720
 That sounds like self-harm, right?

387
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,040
 When I was reading this, I go, "Nowadays, if you just took that stuff, there are people

388
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,360
 who put needles in their skin."

389
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,760
 There's that story of that one woman who kept, I know people are going to throw up when I

390
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,040
 talk about this, I'll find it for the show in a second, but the woman who kept picking

391
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:39,600
 at her scab on her leg or she had self-harm issues and she was picking at her leg and

392
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,840
 she eventually pulled out an entire nerve ending and then they had to amputate her leg.

393
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,840
 That's real.

394
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:53,760
 I read it online, I didn't do that much digging on it, but I guess there's photos, I didn't

395
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,880
 look at the photos, I can imagine and I'm about to eat spaghetti for dinners, I don't

396
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,000
 want to imagine it too closely, but you can self-harm to the point that you lose body parts.

397
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,640
 You think, "Well, maybe she's just outside of the rock."

398
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,520
 Even that, a lot of poltergeist activities, the stories end when a certain person's removed

399
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,000
 from the house and a parapsychologist goes, "Oh, that's because they were the center of

400
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,160
 the poltergeist activity, they were the center of the turmoil," or they were the cause of

401
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,160
 it, right?

402
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,440
 Not in a paranormal thing, but they were throwing rocks around the house, they were flipping

403
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,120
 over furniture and stuff like that.

404
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:31,640
 That's a lot of times the case when we catch people doing voices, like hearing voices in

405
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,480
 the wall and it turns out the girls that people were on the other side of the wall making

406
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,040
 the noises on purpose to fool paranormal investigators.

407
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,440
 We do have stories in like this, but remember this story's going over the course of five

408
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,960
 years, this is going over the course of five years, so it'd be a long time to keep up a

409
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,960
 fraud like that.

410
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:53,240
 Plus, it doesn't seem like it's a particularly famous story, I found about it in a List Verse

411
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,840
 article written by Alan Boyle.

412
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,680
 List Verse is really good because they always got a gumma with ten stories and there's always

413
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,960
 at least one I've never heard of and I've never heard of this one and List Verse is

414
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,280
 really good about citing their sources too, so I can just click on a link and read the

415
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,280
 book that they got it out of.

416
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,040
 Look at news articles they cited.

417
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:15,040
 Anyways, nowadays you would think self harm.

418
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,800
 Maybe, right?

419
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:22,240
 But there was also the time where she woke up with a cup over her mouth and she felt like

420
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,560
 something was trying to smother her in her sleep, trying to stop her from breathing.

421
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,880
 Fine, you can fake that too.

422
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:34,560
 Well, one day she was at school and her clothes started to smolder like her clothing was catching

423
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,560
 on fire.

424
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,840
 I mean, you could fake that too or really cause it yourself, right?

425
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,020
 If she's committing self harm, she could be causing that herself, but the more witnesses

426
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:48,360
 you have, the harder it is to pull off these type of stunts and the fact that they're not

427
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:53,000
 all centered in the house where she could be constantly fooling people.

428
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,320
 Maybe she's putting the needles in her own foot but considering for the past couple months

429
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:02,480
 rocks have been flying around the house, I think we can safely link it to that.

430
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,800
 So this has been going on at this point when her clothes starting to burn at the school.

431
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,400
 I'm sure she was excused from school that day.

432
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,680
 They're like, "Oh, you can just go home.

433
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,480
 We'll send your homework home with a friend."

434
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,480
 This goes on for a year.

435
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:20,360
 At this point we're one year into the phenomenon and Maria goes to see a medium.

436
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,400
 She's like, "Listen, the exorcism didn't work.

437
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,800
 Things are getting personally bad from me.

438
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,720
 I'm almost caught on fire.

439
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,840
 I got needles under my skin.

440
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,640
 Something's trying to suffocate me in my sleeve.

441
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,880
 I'm ready to look for an answer anywhere."

442
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:40,400
 So she goes to a medium and this is terrifying, culmination of the story.

443
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,160
 She goes to the medium.

444
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,720
 She says I'm being plagued by all of this stuff.

445
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,760
 Spirits attacking the house, throwing these rocks around.

446
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,000
 This has been going on for a year, but I've personally been singled out.

447
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 I'm getting attacked.

448
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 "Something's trying to kill me.

449
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,320
 It doesn't matter where I am.

450
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,440
 It doesn't matter what time of day.

451
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,080
 Something's trying to kill me."

452
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:08,040
 And this medium says she knows why Maria is suffering so much.

453
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,880
 There is a dark spirit after her.

454
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,680
 After her specifically.

455
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,360
 The family's getting tormented just out of spite, right?

456
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,400
 The family is not the target for the spirit.

457
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,400
 What happens to be in the way?

458
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:28,520
 This spirit is specifically gunning to torture Maria.

459
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:36,600
 And this spirit is going to torture you for the rest of your life.

460
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,400
 Move away.

461
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,600
 Start your own family.

462
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,880
 Get a good job.

463
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,880
 Doesn't matter.

464
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,840
 Doesn't matter what choices you make in life.

465
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:52,680
 This spirit will personally be following you and it is going to continue to physically,

466
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:59,640
 emotionally, and spiritually cause you pain.

467
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,960
 Maria is like, "Why?

468
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,360
 What did I do, right?

469
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,760
 I'm an 11 year old girl.

470
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,760
 I'm living at home.

471
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:11,480
 What could I have possibly have done to piss a spirit off this much?

472
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,680
 To piss off anybody this much.

473
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,680
 Living or dead.

474
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,200
 What could I have done in my life?

475
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,200
 What could I have done to deserve this?"

476
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:26,640
 And the medium says, "You're right.

477
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,280
 You didn't do anything to deserve it in this life.

478
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:38,960
 But in a past life you were a witch and you killed a man.

479
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:45,280
 You took a man's life and he became a vengeful spirit.

480
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:50,320
 Now why he waited until you were reincarnated into the body of this young girl?

481
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,160
 Who knows.

482
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,800
 But he waited.

483
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:04,080
 Through all that time he waited until you were reincarnated and then he made his move.

484
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:11,120
 Now it's possible that the witch could have easily banished this vengeful spirit, right?

485
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:17,600
 A young girl who has no knowledge of the dark arts, what's she going to do?

486
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:25,400
 This spirit that's so filled with hatred and revenge is after you because in a past life

487
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,040
 you killed him.

488
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,560
 And there is no way to get him to stop.

489
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,000
 He will not stop.

490
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,680
 He will keep coming after you.

491
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:37,340
 You obviously see the level of power that he's at right now.

492
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,800
 That is what hate has given him.

493
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:45,040
 That is what some sort of dark allegiance has empowered him with.

494
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:51,040
 He will not rest.

495
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,760
 Now like I said that happened a year in.

496
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:57,500
 Like I said this story goes on for five years.

497
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,720
 And the torment never ceases.

498
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,000
 This spirit is constantly harassing Maria.

499
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,560
 And to a lesser extent her family.

500
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,440
 I mean throwing polders around is pretty harsh.

501
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,400
 Flipping over furniture but remember most of this is targeting Maria until at the age

502
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:22,520
 of sixteen Maria can't take it anymore.

503
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:27,880
 Maria has been told for the rest of her life that this spirit will torment her.

504
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:35,920
 So at age sixteen she poisoned herself.

505
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:45,880
 After she died all the poltergeist activity completely stopped.

506
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,880
 It's a fascinating story because it touches on so many things that we love about the paranormal.

507
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,160
 And first off obviously a skeptical to go well yeah she was causing all the stuff and

508
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,340
 she was committing the self harm herself.

509
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,800
 So it would make sense that when she died it stopped.

510
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,040
 That would be the skeptical answer.

511
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:05,720
 But from a paranormal point of view we have a poltergeist right which is a it's a specific

512
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,480
 type of ghost or ghostly or paranormal activity.

513
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,480
 However you want to put it it's quite rare.

514
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,200
 Most ghosts are just a sighting or even just a scent or the feeling of a presence.

515
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,440
 That's the majority of ghost sightings.

516
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,240
 Poltergeists are so rare they actually have their own category and most of the time they

517
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,920
 are connected to a young woman.

518
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,440
 Sometimes a young man but usually a young woman.

519
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,560
 That's where objects are flying around the air.

520
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,280
 Think about the amount of energy it would take to do that right.

521
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:38,120
 It would be in anomaly even in the world of paranormal.

522
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,960
 So we have a poltergeist then we have witchcraft we have magic being brought into the story

523
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,960
 as well.

524
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,960
 And then the idea of reincarnation.

525
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,600
 So you have all of this interesting stuff kind of laid out in the story.

526
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,740
 What I find fascinating and ultimately tragic and this is the way we're going to wrap this

527
00:28:53,740 --> 00:29:04,040
 story up is who's to say that her committing suicide stopped the activity.

528
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:11,600
 I mean sure this is specifically what the story said.

529
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:19,600
 But if this dark force could wait for her in between incarnations it would have stopped

530
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,600
 this time.

531
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:28,280
 But when this young girl when Maria is reincarnated once again will the force come back after

532
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,280
 her?

533
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:35,760
 I wouldn't make an effort to say I'm going to get her the very next time she incarnates.

534
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,120
 I don't believe people reincarnate instantly.

535
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,120
 That's my theory.

536
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,440
 I'm still kind of iffy on reincarnation all over.

537
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:48,360
 I do like the theory but I think it's not like you die at 10, 17 p.m. and the very next

538
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,600
 baby born that's you.

539
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:55,200
 I do believe that if reincarnation is real there would be time periods in between.

540
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,200
 Do I have any proof of that?

541
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:03,200
 I don't have any proof of that but if he could wait in between times let's say there's a

542
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,160
 60 and it probably varies between person.

543
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:09,840
 I believe that's where you would have an idea of penance or a purgatory.

544
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,200
 You don't reincarnate right away.

545
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,440
 You don't reincarnate right away.

546
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,960
 There would be a time period where your soul is in some sort of purgatory or some sort

547
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,480
 of learning state or trying to grow.

548
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,480
 Whatever.

549
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,480
 I don't know.

550
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:29,800
 If it could wait between the witch and Maria who's to say that when Maria is reincarnated

551
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:35,680
 at some point that the spirit's just not going to start the activity up again?

552
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,440
 It is interesting that it waited until she was 11.

553
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,080
 What is the symbolism of that?

554
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,680
 Did it need her hormonal energy to feed off of?

555
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,960
 Do the poltergeist needs it?

556
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,680
 And really and that goes to the question we don't know why poltergeist tend to fixate

557
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,600
 on that particular age group but maybe it does have something to do with who they were

558
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,480
 in past lives.

559
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,840
 Because we don't see the majority of young girls when they go through puberty rocks are

560
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,080
 flying around the house.

561
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,160
 If they did then they would just be a natural part of the world.

562
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,160
 It's rare.

563
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,720
 It's exceedingly rare.

564
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,920
 But does it have something to do with the energy that they're emitting and this spirit

565
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:19,720
 just waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and once she is giving off this psychic energy

566
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:25,080
 that it can feed off of that's when it attacks and if it attacked her back in Brazil who's

567
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:31,680
 to say when she gets reincarnated in the middle of China as some farmer's daughter that it's

568
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,920
 just not going to start it up again?

569
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:38,640
 Where she's reincarnated as a baby in the Pacific Northwest?

570
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,080
 Who's to say it's not going to start up then?

571
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:46,600
 And this girl forever for all of eternity or at least as long as the spirit can retain

572
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,600
 some sort of energy.

573
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,320
 We do believe that spirits bound to earth start to lose energy at a certain point.

574
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,560
 But again that's standard ghost lore.

575
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,560
 It's a theory.

576
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,560
 We don't even know if that's true.

577
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,600
 That doesn't calculate poltergeist activity.

578
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:05,400
 She may spend not just this lifetime of Maria these five years under this torment.

579
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,600
 This may be something that just continues to happen to her until the heat death of the

580
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,400
 universe or something like that.

581
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:16,920
 She may after millions of reincarnations end up the daughter of a captain aboard the Starship

582
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:22,640
 Frisco floating out somewhere near the Pleiades star system.

583
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,600
 Little baby born in deep space and there's just some poltergeist floating around on a

584
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,160
 battleship.

585
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:33,560
 Floating around on this giant high tech vehicle.

586
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:37,780
 Just waiting for this little girl to turn 11 and then he can start throwing hurling

587
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:42,120
 boulders around this spaceship.

588
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,440
 Like will she ever be free of the curse?

589
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,440
 Is the question.

590
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,400
 And really based on just this short story.

591
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,400
 No.

592
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
 I would say no.

593
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,680
 It's tragic that she killed herself and I can understand her being so hopeless and this

594
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,360
 is never going to end.

595
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,040
 And what's interesting too is it could have been a standard poltergeist and the medium

596
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,560
 was a fraud.

597
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,600
 Mediums are a lot of times they just make stuff up and the poltergeist activity may have

598
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,240
 been petered out as she moved past Peeferty which is how poltergeist activity normally

599
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,240
 works.

600
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,240
 Right.

601
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,920
 So then you have that tragic ending as well.

602
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:18,600
 The medium may have just been trying to earn a quick buck and made the story up and that

603
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,200
 the girl is like 16 and she's like what's the point of going on this is going to happen

604
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,400
 the rest of my life and she kills herself.

605
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,880
 Or the medium could have been right.

606
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,080
 And it was going to keep going on as long as she was alive and when she reincarnates

607
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,480
 it's going to happen again.

608
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,400
 And again next life and again the next life.

609
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,400
 Terrifying story.

610
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,400
 Terrifying story.

611
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:44,320
 How much hate you would have to have in your heart to hunt someone down through multiple

612
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,320
 lifetimes.

613
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,320
 Right.

614
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:51,440
 This witch did something so now you're tormenting, you're trying to suffocate an 11 year old

615
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,000
 girl while she's sleeping.

616
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,320
 You're shoving metal pins, metal needles into her skin.

617
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,400
 Think about the hate you would have to have in your heart.

618
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:05,800
 And if you can't imagine that level of hate and that level of absolute revenge, absolute

619
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,800
 hatred.

620
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,800
 Right.

621
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:12,200
 It's just a level beyond what I think most people could even understand.

622
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:17,240
 That's the difference between you dying and your soul either going to the afterlife or

623
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,280
 you dying and becoming a ghost.

624
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,440
 That's what would happen to most people.

625
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:32,720
 But to become a poltergeist, to become a spirit of vengeance requires a level of pure insane

626
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:39,600
 hatred that most humans will never understand.

627
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:52,960
 But when this witch killed this man, he felt that level of just raw uncontrollable hate.

628
00:34:52,960 --> 00:35:00,880
 He despises her so much he will use all of that hatred, all of that loathing to power

629
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:11,240
 himself, lifetime after lifetime after lifetime to torture her physically, mentally, spiritually.

630
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,040
 Until the end of time.

631
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:19,800
 A young girl paying the price for a crime she doesn't even remember committing.

632
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,000
 But her victim does.

633
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,400
 And he will never forget.

634
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:53,960
 And he will never ever forgive.

635
00:35:53,960 --> 00:36:11,400
 And he will never ever forgive.

636
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:18,400
 And he will never ever forgive.
