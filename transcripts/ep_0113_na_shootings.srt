1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
 An early UFO encounter changes the way the media looks at the phenomenon.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,080
 We take a look at a Greek philosopher who if he lived today would most likely be described

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,300
 as a troll, not physically, but you know, internet troll.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:22,700
 And then we take a look at a bizarre connection between child pornography and mass shootings

5
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,300
 today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:32,100
 [intro]

7
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,800
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,000
 I'm your host, Jason Carpenter.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,800
 I'm having a great day.

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,800
 I hope you're having a great day too.

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,700
 Hope everything is going really fun for you.

12
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,700
 We have a couple stories.

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,000
 We're gonna do three stories today.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,300
 So we're just gonna again just kind of jump right into it.

15
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,700
 So the first story I want to talk about is just a brief one, but I think it's it's fairly interesting

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,500
 because it really kind of signified the change in the way that the media portrayed UFOs.

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,500
 So we're back in the 1940s.

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,200
 Now at this point, the war's over.

19
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,900
 We drop the nukes and there's been some theories of correlation between that like the nukes

20
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,300
 made the aliens go, "Oh no, they've developed these super powerful weapons.

21
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:13,780
 It's time to come down and float around and not contact them and draw circles in their

22
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,780
 wheat."

23
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,100
 That will show them.

24
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,860
 But anyway, so the nukes drop.

25
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,780
 We start having incidents like Roswell.

26
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,220
 We start having incidents like the UFOs that were sighted around.

27
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,100
 I think it was Mount Adams or Mount Shasta, one of the two.

28
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,300
 But it was kind of the start of the UFO flap.

29
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,020
 And at the time the media portrayed it like, "Oh, look at these little people believing

30
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,020
 the little green men.

31
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,660
 They're getting you for drinking a little too much."

32
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,980
 You know, they, they, they, they very tongue-in-cheek the way that they covered a lot of this

33
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,980
 stuff.

34
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,620
 And there's been theories that the government was the one being like, "Cover it up.

35
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,500
 Don't let anybody know about this stuff."

36
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,500
 But what happened was in 1948 on January 7th, Captain Thomas F. Mantrell.

37
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,100
 He was an Air Force pilot.

38
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,180
 He was a decorated pilot in World War II.

39
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,860
 He was out with his squadron with the Kentucky National Guard.

40
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,420
 The war's over, so what else are you gonna do?

41
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,620
 Go back to Kentucky.

42
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,620
 They're flying around.

43
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,900
 They get a report that there is an unidentified flying object in the area.

44
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,900
 It is large.

45
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:10,260
 Well, it's 100 feet, but I mean, that's, like, I don't know, 30 jasons.

46
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,260
 Wait.

47
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,220
 I'm, what, what would that be?

48
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,820
 We'll just round up to six.

49
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,820
 What's six divided into a hundred?

50
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,020
 What's 100 divided by six would be...

51
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:25,820
 Oh, wait, no, that's not, that's only, like, wait, no, no, no, 'cause 10 jasons would be

52
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,620
 60 feet.

53
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:39,700
 And then we need another five jasons, 'cause that would be five times 30, so if we had 60,

54
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,700
 90.

55
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,100
 So maybe another seven jasons.

56
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,060
 So it would take 17 jasons to be the size of the ship.

57
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,980
 I know that took a while to figure out, but, and it's in diameter, so we'll have to figure

58
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,060
 out some more jasons in there.

59
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,940
 But from point to point, you imagine 17 jasons float in the sky.

60
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,580
 It was consistent with the idea of what people thought was a UFO at the time.

61
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,900
 It was large, metallic, and cone shaped.

62
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,740
 So the Kentucky National Guard, they, their little fleets, like, they're like, "Check

63
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,740
 it out.

64
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,740
 Check it out."

65
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,220
 I don't know why they talk like robots back then, but anyways, the planes are going.

66
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,700
 Now, it keeps ascending into the sky.

67
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,740
 And the jets are flying after it, and eventually they are going too high up, and the rest of

68
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,460
 the team are like, "Dude, we gotta, we gotta call this off.

69
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,780
 Like we're, it's going too high, then we can fly."

70
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,780
 So they start to back down, but Mantrel, Captain Mantrel, is like, "No, I'm gonna get to the

71
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,420
 bottom of this once and for all."

72
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,100
 He continues to ascend at 25,000 feet up.

73
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,300
 The plane starts to spiral into a dive, and it crashes.

74
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:46,940
 What it, the official story is that that was what's known as a skyhook balloon, and at

75
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,300
 that time it was a top secret program.

76
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,420
 Nobody knew what they were unless they really worked on it or had the top secret clearance.

77
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,100
 Was made out of reflective aluminum.

78
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,980
 It was 17 Jason's white.

79
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,740
 So that was the official, that's an official report, 17 Jason's.

80
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:07,980
 So the story's notable because after this, the media stopped really kind of making fun

81
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:13,460
 of the whole UFO phenomenon, because somebody had lost their life because of it.

82
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:18,460
 And it's interesting to look at because when I was growing up, the media was back to making

83
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,020
 fun of people looking at UFOs.

84
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,620
 You know, "Oh, little green man, you're doing it.

85
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,500
 You're hitting that moonshine.

86
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:30,860
 But for a period of time, they stopped joking about it because somebody lost their life.

87
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,860
 So yeah, I just thought it was kind of a little interesting story.

88
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:40,740
 Probably he would be, as far as we know, the first casualty that was involved in a UFO encounter.

89
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,580
 You know, assuming that UFOs aren't abducting people and blowing their brains out with laser

90
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,660
 beams and stuff.

91
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:51,980
 But on the record, Captain Man Trail is the first person to die in pursuit of a UFO.

92
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,860
 And it turned out to just be a skyhook balloon.

93
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,780
 At least that's the official story.

94
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:01,980
 So I thought it was an interesting tale from the old days of UFOs.

95
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,740
 The next story we're going to look at, I told you it was going to be short, the next story

96
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,740
 we're going to look at is also going to be relatively short because it's almost just

97
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,700
 a list of stuff this dude does.

98
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,700
 This was a recommendation.

99
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,960
 So I did a story about Mr. Haji.

100
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,900
 He was the dirtiest man alive.

101
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,540
 I did that story a couple of weeks ago.

102
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:28,780
 There was a YouTube commenter named Emanuel who said, "Hey, this guy, okay, now I'll say

103
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,780
 this.

104
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:35,380
 Okay, I called the dude Herodotus and everyone's like, "No, it's Herodotus."

105
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:40,260
 And again, I don't know if I've said this earlier, "Do you really know his name is Herodotus?"

106
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,100
 Because his name was in ancient Greek.

107
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,740
 And there's no one around who speaks ancient Greek who spoke it back then.

108
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,980
 Like there's people who can like translate it.

109
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:53,500
 But technically for all we know, it sounded like a bunch of crows kind and then just other

110
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,900
 languages he developed.

111
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,900
 I don't know.

112
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,740
 I'm sure.

113
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:04,860
 I'm sure you guys are probably right that it's pronounced Herodotus.

114
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,100
 But it's spelled Herodotus.

115
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,660
 So that is, but I do appreciate the feedback, but I got a lot of comments on that episode

116
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,100
 in real life as well.

117
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,260
 People being like, "I'm out at a party with some people."

118
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,940
 And they're like, "It's not Herodotus.

119
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,500
 It's Herodotus."

120
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,420
 And I'm like, "Well, according to the ancient Greeks, we don't know.

121
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,260
 Maybe they went...

122
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,660
 Like, you know, like they're just clicking and clacking.

123
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,160
 We don't know."

124
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,500
 There's no sound recordings back then.

125
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,260
 So all that being said, in defense of what I'm about to talk about, let's talk about

126
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,260
 deogenes.

127
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:47,380
 Now, deogenes is a Greek philosopher who lived in the 400 BCs.

128
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,140
 So he's around back then.

129
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,380
 I can already hear the sound of history majors pulling their hair out.

130
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,620
 And I had someone try to explain to me how you pronounce his name, but again, it's spelled

131
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,620
 the deogenes.

132
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,980
 And I'm a deo like the rock band, and then genes.

133
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:02,980
 It's very obvious.

134
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:09,780
 But anyway, so deogenes was this philosopher, and he was one of the first cynics.

135
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:14,180
 And cynicism, we know now, like cynicism is kind of like, I could call to cynic every

136
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,180
 once in a while.

137
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,780
 I could call to cynic the other night, actually, but cynicism as a philosophy is basically

138
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:25,460
 that true happiness is not found in material wealth and things around us.

139
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:30,620
 Or being healthy or having political power or things like that.

140
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:37,780
 Cynics doesn't lie in any sort of fleeting things, which I got that definition from Wikipedia.

141
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,500
 And it's a baseline definition.

142
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:46,780
 It's kind of a, but see, what I don't understand is how does that tie into me just being like,

143
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,700
 I just, I don't believe in that.

144
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,620
 I guess that is kind of that.

145
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,300
 But anyway, cynicism, I think, let me actually look up the definition of cynicism real quick.

146
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,260
 I'm highly, highly prepared for this episode.

147
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,260
 How are you guys doing?

148
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:02,940
 I'm using my phone if you're wondering how I'm still recording while I'm doing this.

149
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,700
 You guys having a good day?

150
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,700
 Cynicism.

151
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,900
 I know how to spell it.

152
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,900
 So there's that.

153
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,060
 And I'm pronouncing that right.

154
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,060
 You get some credits for that.

155
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,060
 Oh, okay.

156
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:16,980
 Cynicism, an inclination to believe that people are motivated purely by self-interest skepticism.

157
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,620
 So yeah, same thing.

158
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,340
 Cynic is kind of a philosophical model of that.

159
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,420
 So let's go on with the episode.

160
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:31,020
 So Dio Jeans was this dude who lived in what is now modern day Turkey.

161
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,180
 And the dude from the start was, he's a troll.

162
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,500
 He's an absolute troll.

163
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:42,180
 He would do stuff because he's a cynic, because he would basically look at people who respected

164
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,080
 power and material wealth and all that stuff.

165
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,620
 He was spitting in their face all the time.

166
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:52,100
 And there's a lot of stories about him and a lot of them people go, yeah, that probably

167
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,500
 didn't happen the way that we remember it.

168
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:59,900
 But it's funny that's a fitting tribute to him because he probably wouldn't really want

169
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,100
 to be remembered.

170
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,780
 I think he probably would find it funny that nobody knows the exact details of what went

171
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,780
 on.

172
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,220
 His dad was a moneymaker.

173
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,700
 His dad like minted coins and Dio Jeans would deface it.

174
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,340
 So he got in trouble for that.

175
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,620
 You know, because he's, what's the point?

176
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,740
 You're making this money and you'd like draw little mustaches on it if they had mustaches

177
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,780
 back then I'm assuming.

178
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:24,060
 He would, he basically, and this is why I think he got compared to the dirtiest man in the

179
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,060
 world.

180
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,060
 He just ate onions.

181
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:30,860
 He used to have a single cup to drink water out of until he saw a kid drinking water out

182
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,860
 of his hands.

183
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,000
 Dio Jeans is like, I don't need this cup.

184
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,580
 This kid has it more figured out than I do.

185
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,620
 Now the kid probably washed his hands more than you do, but fair enough.

186
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,620
 He was a bum.

187
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,340
 He was a total bum.

188
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:49,860
 He lived in a giant barrel in the middle of the city, like Oscar the Grouch.

189
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,620
 Some people say barrel, some people say jar.

190
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:54,660
 The point is he lived in a container.

191
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:59,060
 A Dio Jeans sized container is what he lived in.

192
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,260
 And he would just be like, wake up, big birds walking on the street.

193
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:07,860
 He's like, hey, let me masturbate on you because he was a frequent public masturbator.

194
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,460
 At one point, one of the stories about him was he was sitting on the street jacking off.

195
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,580
 And so the dude walks up and goes, hey, Dio Jeans, quit jacking off.

196
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:20,340
 And Dio Jeans, his response was, I wish it was as easy to banish hunger by rubbing my

197
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,340
 belly.

198
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,660
 I'm assuming he finished masturbating.

199
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,020
 But I mean, I guess that does make sense.

200
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,100
 Like wouldn't it be nice if you're hungry, just rub your belly and it goes away just

201
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,700
 like you can be like, you know what, I'm bored.

202
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,940
 I'm going to jack off.

203
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,940
 I'm horny.

204
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,940
 I'm going to jack off.

205
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,060
 This episode is definitely getting explicit filter.

206
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,780
 You'll have to be over 18 to listen to this episode on YouTube as well.

207
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,260
 But so he was just like a troll.

208
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:51,420
 He lived in a barrel or a box or just a Dio Jeans shaped container, which I believe you

209
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,820
 can buy at Bed Bath and Beyond.

210
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:58,060
 But he, when masturbating in public, he would poop in public, pee in public.

211
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,060
 He didn't care.

212
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:04,420
 Now, people were like, they kind of got it to a certain point.

213
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,620
 They're like, you know, he's living freer than I am, but he's also a disgusting, filthy

214
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,620
 human being.

215
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,220
 And he thought that people should be more like dogs.

216
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,820
 He thought dogs had it all figured out.

217
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,220
 It was a very simple way of a living life.

218
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:21,660
 And the word cynic actually, it comes from basically a deviation of the Greek word for

219
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,740
 dog because just live your life simple like a dog.

220
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,380
 I'll get to that in a second.

221
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:31,300
 Eventually, another great thing that he did, so we know of Socrates and we know of Plato,

222
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:36,140
 these great Greek philosophers and people, there's a lot of people who would give their

223
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:42,180
 left arm to be able to speak to Socrates, to speak to Plato, to hear, just to hear these

224
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,260
 great minds think, well, Dio Jeans didn't care.

225
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,460
 Dio Jeans flat out didn't care about these guys.

226
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,620
 I think that he cared about, no, I don't think he cared about them at all.

227
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,100
 I mean, he might have cared a little bit about their philosophy, but he thought it was too

228
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,100
 hoity-toity.

229
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,860
 He was like, oh, they're giving speeches in these big arenas and stuff like that.

230
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:05,020
 If I was a philosopher, I would jack off in front of them while I'm talking about stuff.

231
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,860
 So he would go to Plato.

232
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:13,580
 Plato would have these big seminars like this Tony Robbins type of thing and Dio Jeans would

233
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:17,940
 show up and I'm assuming, I can just, just from reading about this guy, I can imagine

234
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,620
 the smell of him.

235
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,620
 Because why?

236
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,620
 Why would he care about bathing?

237
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,540
 He lives in a bucket for crying out loud.

238
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:30,340
 So he would go to Plato seminars and as Plato was delivering these pearls of wisdom to these

239
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:35,700
 philosophers who have traveled hundreds of miles to sit in front of Plato, Dio Jeans

240
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,740
 would unwrap food and eat it noisily just to distract everybody.

241
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:44,220
 That's master level trolling.

242
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:51,620
 Like that is, you could take the best troll today and he could never live up to sitting

243
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:56,980
 in front of one of the greatest minds of the Western world and eating noisily while he's

244
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,580
 trying to do a presentation.

245
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:01,380
 That is Dio Jeans.

246
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,500
 That is 100%.

247
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,500
 That's great A-Stuff.

248
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,180
 When I saw that anecdote I was like, okay, this guy, I'm going to talk about this guy

249
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,860
 however briefly because that's amazing.

250
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,980
 He ended up getting caught, sold into slavery.

251
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,180
 The, well he got caught because he was running around or something like that.

252
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,380
 I think he had to leave the city because he was doing some stuff, defacing the money maybe.

253
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:25,740
 He gets caught by slavers, sold to someone and ends up teaching his master's children

254
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,540
 because he was a brilliant mind.

255
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,420
 He was just so outside the box.

256
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,100
 If he wasn't living in the box, he was outside of it.

257
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:39,740
 So he goes into this rich dude's house, he's teaching his kids, he starts to gain more

258
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,740
 stature.

259
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,740
 He finds another philosopher who shares the same viewpoints as him and that's really

260
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,380
 where the school of cynicism kind of took off.

261
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:51,340
 And then like, so he finally has some prestige.

262
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,700
 He has a house that he lives in where he tutors these children.

263
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,420
 He's the second hand man to this other famous philosopher who actually like, they see eye

264
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,420
 to eye.

265
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:03,580
 It's all about people being simple and having disregard for these material things.

266
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,420
 And he moves into a jar.

267
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,580
 He moves into a jar.

268
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:13,460
 He's in a brand new city and he has a job and he has all this respectability and he

269
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,420
 just gets a big jar and crawls inside of it.

270
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,180
 And he lives in a jar in this city as well.

271
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,540
 But again, now he has more clout.

272
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,140
 People are like, oh hey, Theo James, he's like jacking off in the jar.

273
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,980
 They're like, oh, you scamp.

274
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,100
 I wonder what Oscar the Grouch does in that garbage can all the time.

275
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,500
 I think there was an episode of Sesame Street and I could have just be a little kid and

276
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,180
 I could have been dreaming this, but I thought there was an episode where they go into the

277
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,820
 garbage can and there's like a full apartment down there.

278
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,780
 I don't remember, but it almost sounds something like I would have dreamt rather than actually

279
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,580
 being real because actually that's kind of creepy.

280
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,140
 That's basically Oscar the Grouch's like murder dungeon.

281
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,380
 There's something underneath the garbage can.

282
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:52,980
 So and again, Theo James goes out in the weirdest possible way.

283
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,300
 They don't know exactly how he died.

284
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,100
 There's one of three ways.

285
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:01,380
 One died of an infected dog bite, which would be ironic because cynics basically want to

286
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,300
 live like dogs, which I guess that's how other dogs died back then.

287
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,580
 They got bit by other dogs.

288
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,020
 Eating raw octopus.

289
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,540
 Now obviously he wasn't like swimming in the ocean and like took a bite out of one, but

290
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:17,140
 you know, just eating raw octopus food or oddly enough, and this is actually physically

291
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,140
 impossible.

292
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,780
 I don't even know why they include this in this list of his possible deaths.

293
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,060
 Eating his breath until he died.

294
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:29,300
 Your body won't let you do that, but maybe held his breath and like fell into some wet

295
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,420
 cement and couldn't breathe anymore.

296
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,660
 And they asked him before he died, not like while he was dying.

297
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,540
 He's facing down in the cement and they're like, "Hey, Theo James, Theo James, how do

298
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,620
 you, how do you want to be buried?"

299
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:42,620
 But they asked him before he died and he said, they go, "What do you want to do with your

300
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,620
 body when you're dead?"

301
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,940
 Because again, he had more clout in this new city.

302
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,740
 He said, "Yeah, just throw it out and just throw it over the city wall.

303
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,740
 The dogs eat it.

304
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,740
 I don't care."

305
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,860
 And they go, "Well, don't you mind?"

306
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:57,140
 And he goes, "I won't care if you do that as long as you give me a stick so I can fight

307
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,140
 the dogs off."

308
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:03,740
 And they go, "Well, dude, if we throw you over the wall, you're dead and we give you a stick.

309
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,380
 Why are you asking for a stick?

310
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,380
 You're dead.

311
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,380
 You can't do anything."

312
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,020
 And he replied, "If I lack awareness, then why should I care what happens to me when

313
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,020
 I am dead?"

314
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:17,020
 I think there's definitely elements from Theo James' life that we can look at.

315
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,500
 Public masturbation is not one of them.

316
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,500
 Don't do that.

317
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,500
 You can't do that.

318
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,500
 You can't do that.

319
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,500
 You can't do that.

320
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,500
 You can't do that.

321
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,500
 You can't do that.

322
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,500
 You can't do that.

323
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,500
 You can't do that.

324
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,500
 You can't do that.

325
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,500
 You can't do that.

326
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,500
 You can't do that.

327
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,500
 You can't do that.

328
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,500
 You can't do that.

329
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,500
 You can't do that.

330
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,500
 You can't do that.

331
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,500
 You can't do that.

332
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,500
 You can't do that.

333
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,500
 You can't do that.

334
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,500
 You can't do that.

335
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,500
 You can't do that.

336
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,500
 You can't do that.

337
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,500
 You can't do that.

338
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,500
 You can't do that.

339
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,500
 You can't do that.

340
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,500
 You can't do that.

341
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,500
 You can't do that.

342
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,500
 You can't do that.

343
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,500
 You can't do that.

344
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,500
 You can't do that.

345
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,500
 You can't do that.

346
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,500
 You can't do that.

347
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,500
 You can't do that.

348
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,500
 You can't do that.

349
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
 You can't do that.

350
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,500
 You can't do that.

351
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,500
 You can't do that.

352
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,500
 You can't do that.

353
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,500
 You can't do that.

354
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,500
 You can't do that.

355
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,500
 You can't do that.

356
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,500
 You can't do that.

357
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,500
 You can't do that.

358
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
 You can't do that.

359
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,500
 You can't do that.

360
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,500
 You can't do that.

361
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,500
 You can't do that.

362
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,500
 You can't do that.

363
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,500
 You can't do that.

364
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,500
 You can't do that.

365
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,500
 You can't do that.

366
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,500
 You can't do that.

367
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,500
 You can't do that.

368
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,500
 You can't do that.

369
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,500
 You can't do that.

370
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,500
 You can't do that.

371
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,820
 So, let's say that the whole thing after the deogenes, jacking off everywhere, now we're

372
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:21,500
 on to this story, which we'll also have to put warnings on.

373
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,140
 So, this theory here came off of the conspiracy iceberg.

374
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,700
 We've talked a lot about that.

375
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:31,100
 The Sentinelese having alien artifacts that came off the conspiracy iceberg.

376
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,540
 It's basically just a list of all the conspiracies.

377
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,660
 And the farther you go down, the more rare they are.

378
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,700
 One of them is just listed as a phrase.

379
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,220
 Nambla shootings.

380
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:46,180
 Now, if you don't know, if you're lucky enough to not know that this group exists, I wasn't.

381
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:49,420
 I've unfortunately been aware of their existence for decades.

382
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,620
 Nambla is a quite disgusting group.

383
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,620
 They fall in and out of operation.

384
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,020
 Sometimes they're around, sometimes they're not.

385
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,860
 But I'm sure they're always functioning on some level.

386
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,860
 Nambla is the North American.

387
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,860
 Oh, that sounds nice.

388
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,860
 North American.

389
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,740
 A lot of good stuff comes from there.

390
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:07,780
 The North American Man-Boy-Love Association.

391
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:14,140
 So, it's a group that encourages pedophilia between adult men and young boys.

392
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,660
 Nambla, it pops up in the newspapers every once in a while, but like I said, they don't

393
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,820
 seem to be as functional as they used to be.

394
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,740
 Here's a little quick history lesson for you.

395
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:29,740
 Back in the day, like in the 60s, first off, when the gay rights community was trying to

396
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:34,540
 fight for their rights back in the 50s, the gay rights organizations and the lesbian rights

397
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,980
 organizations did not get along.

398
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,380
 They didn't communicate with each other.

399
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,020
 They didn't work on the same beat.

400
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:45,340
 They weren't working together because the issues they were facing were completely different.

401
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:52,900
 The lesbians were not facing the same level of aggressive policing that the gay groups

402
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,900
 were.

403
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:59,980
 The main issues with being gay back in the 50s was the police crashing into your gay bar.

404
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,980
 Not literally.

405
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,460
 They didn't have like their cop cars going through the wall, but they would do these

406
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,460
 stings, they would break into gay bars, arrest everybody.

407
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:12,780
 They would arrest men who were cruising for sex because, you know, they're gay and it

408
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,840
 was illegal.

409
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,180
 So basically you'd go out to a restroom and you would try to hook up with someone.

410
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,820
 This was before Grindr, obviously.

411
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,980
 This was before cell phones or probably even phones.

412
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:26,660
 They would show up at a restroom to meet another guy and it would be an undercover cop.

413
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:30,940
 So when the gay rights organizations started trying to fight back, the lesbian groups were

414
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,140
 like, "Those aren't problems that we face.

415
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:37,300
 Like quit going to restrooms and put hanging out at these gay bars or being raided by these

416
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,580
 police and you'll be fine.

417
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,260
 Just be like housewives like us."

418
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:45,900
 But they finally did become a coalition to both of their benefit because, you know,

419
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,300
 strength in numbers, right?

420
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:53,700
 But another group tried to glom onto them early on in the gay rights struggle and that was

421
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,780
 groups similar to Nambla where it was basically they're like, "You know what?

422
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,780
 We're gay too."

423
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,780
 And everyone's like, "Oh, that's awesome.

424
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,780
 You can help in this fight."

425
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,580
 Yeah, we're gay with little boys.

426
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,780
 And it didn't take long.

427
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:10,700
 It took a matter of seconds, actually, for the gay rights organizations to be like, "You

428
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,700
 can't.

429
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,700
 You're not part of this.

430
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,860
 Like that's totally different than what we're looking at.

431
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,180
 That's 100% different.

432
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,300
 We're not going to do that."

433
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,540
 But they've tried warming their way into the sexual rights organizations and the sexual

434
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:27,420
 rights like freedoms, protestants like that for a while.

435
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:32,820
 So Nambla as a group has existed, I think, since the '70s or '80s.

436
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,820
 I haven't done any research on them in particular.

437
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,020
 It's just kind of the knowledge that I've gained about them over the years.

438
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:42,420
 I don't want to type Nambla into Google over and over again like I had to do just to start

439
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,420
 the story.

440
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:47,300
 But so I went in with the assumption that maybe somebody shot up a Nambla meeting.

441
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:51,500
 As much as I despise their ideology, I don't think anyone should go and shoot them up,

442
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,380
 but I didn't find any record of that.

443
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:58,940
 And then I thought maybe it's doing something where they're encouraging shootings, which

444
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,860
 would fall a little more in line.

445
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:09,460
 You know, there's basically this sexual ladder that people tend to descend over time.

446
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:13,220
 I was talking to one of my bosses at one of my jobs.

447
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:17,220
 We were talking about porn and he goes, "Yeah, you know, it's weird how nobody like..."

448
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,940
 He goes, "It's weird how you start off just watching normal stuff."

449
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:26,780
 And then I said, "Yeah, I go, "Nobody starts off with trap porn."

450
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:31,860
 I'm sure some people do, but most guys are like, "Ooh, big boobs."

451
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,060
 And they watch that for a couple months or a year or whatever and then give over time

452
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:42,220
 now they're watching hardcore BDSM or they start to find their fetishes.

453
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:46,180
 They have to find new things to arouse them because they're not getting aroused from just

454
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,900
 big boobs anymore.

455
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:53,900
 And so it wouldn't completely shock me if all of a sudden it came out that pedophiles

456
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:58,220
 also were equally disgusting in other areas of society.

457
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:03,980
 And that if there were pedophiles who got off on kids being killed or mass shootings

458
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,340
 and things like that.

459
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,620
 And so I kind of started an approach from that level.

460
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,500
 And you go, "Well, Jason, that's an extreme jump."

461
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,100
 But I have something to back that up.

462
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,900
 And I'm going to go over this real quick because the last time I recorded this it was like

463
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,100
 20 minutes long and I just read a bunch of facts and it just didn't work.

464
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,020
 So I'm going to go over these relatively quickly.

465
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,180
 The big one to support this evidence is Adam Lanza.

466
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,220
 Now Adam Lanza is the dude who went and shot up Sandy Hook.

467
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:31,420
 Yes, Sandy Hook actually happened.

468
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:35,260
 Adam Lanza was most likely the perpetrator.

469
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,260
 The event 100% happened.

470
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,260
 Kids were killed there.

471
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,460
 The fact that we have to debate that to me is ridiculous.

472
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,860
 Whether or not Adam Lanza was the shooter, I believe he was the shooter.

473
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,820
 But you could argue with me on that.

474
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,420
 But for the sake of this, Adam Lanza, he did go, he killed his mom.

475
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,700
 Yeah, that doesn't make sense.

476
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,460
 If everyone thinks it was like a hit job, why would they go to his house and kill his

477
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,180
 mom first and then fake the whole thing?

478
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:02,820
 Anyways, so Adam Lanza was the dude who walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School and shot

479
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,820
 it up.

480
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,340
 It wasn't the first elementary school shooting.

481
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:09,500
 It's just the most recent and it had quite a high body count.

482
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,700
 And what it came out afterwards was he tried destroying his hard drive, but he wasn't able

483
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,700
 to completely destroy it.

484
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,500
 We were able to recover some documents and not only on his hard drive, but around his

485
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,500
 house.

486
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:26,060
 He definitely had an interest in the rights of pedophilia and advocating for pedophiles

487
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,580
 to have rights.

488
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:31,900
 It's hard to draw the concrete conclusion that he was 100% a pedophile.

489
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:37,020
 They didn't find any child porn in his home, but they did find a script called Love Bound.

490
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,740
 I couldn't tell whether or not he wrote it or someone else wrote it, but they did find

491
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:41,740
 a script called Love Bound.

492
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:45,900
 It is the story of a 30-year-old man and a 10-year-old boy.

493
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:51,060
 People that he spoke to online said that he did what he talked about and he would advocate

494
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:55,620
 like pedophilia is not evil, it's just a sickness and it's something that needs to

495
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,620
 be treated.

496
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:01,860
 Again, there's no concrete proof that he was a pedophile, but it is interesting because

497
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,700
 he did once tell somebody.

498
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,940
 He thought that and when he was talking about this, no one really took it seriously because

499
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:13,580
 they're just a big weirdo, but he made the comment that if you killed children, it would

500
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:20,100
 actually save them and help them escape the brainwashing and harmful influences from adults.

501
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:24,340
 One of the key things that we see in pedophiles, I told you this is not a very funny episode,

502
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:32,340
 but one of the key things we see in pedophiles is they want to retard or completely stop

503
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,140
 a child's development.

504
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,300
 Like you fall in love with an 8-year-old, we as realistic humans are going to go do.

505
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,620
 You know in like 10 years she's going to be 18.

506
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:46,820
 But they want to stop that mental development because they look at 18-year-olds and they're

507
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,820
 like look at all these thoughts running around, look at all these women corrupted, look at

508
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,820
 all this stuff.

509
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,700
 They want to keep them in that childlike state.

510
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:58,080
 Now obviously that's pretty much impossible so they keep going from kid to kid to kid.

511
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,740
 So he's saying, you know, we don't want them brainwashed, we don't want these kids becoming

512
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:05,780
 you know horrible members of society or looking down on me because I'm a big old weird looking

513
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,820
 nerd and all that stuff.

514
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,180
 Just shoot him.

515
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:12,620
 It's weird, it's a weird connection.

516
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:17,180
 But again it's not concrete proof that he's a pedophile, but we can start to draw conclusions

517
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:22,780
 from his weirdo behavior and the weirdo behavior of other people.

518
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:27,260
 Cho Sung Hoi, and I don't care if I mispronounce his name because he's a total asshole, he

519
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:30,260
 was the guy who shot at Virginia Tech, his hard drive was completely missing and he'd

520
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,300
 go well maybe he just wanted to hide some stuff.

521
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,100
 He made public videos talking about his plan.

522
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:41,220
 So if the only thing on his hard drive wore his plans then they would have just added

523
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,620
 to his power level.

524
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,820
 But if he had a bunch of child porn on there it would actually decrease him.

525
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:50,500
 He's no longer the bad boy with the fight against the world.

526
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,860
 He's a big old pervert.

527
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,660
 So it's possible that he had child porn on, it can't prove it, but again we're going to

528
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,780
 keep going here.

529
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,380
 Same thing with Steven Paddock, the dude who shot at Vegas.

530
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:01,980
 We're moving out of school shootings now but he's the guy who shot all those people in

531
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,460
 Vegas, his hard drives were missing.

532
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:06,620
 We have a hard time giving him a motive for that.

533
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:11,740
 But a prostitute did come forward and say that when I was with him he wanted me to dress

534
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:17,220
 up as a preteen girl in a private school girl uniform, so short skirt above the knee, knee

535
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,580
 high socks, little button down shirt.

536
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,900
 And he would talk about how I was a virgin while their role playing having sex, how

537
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:29,260
 I was a virgin, how that was the first dick I had ever seen and all sorts of stuff.

538
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:32,580
 So he's definitely living out these preteen fantasies.

539
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,580
 He had a guy and this is totally alleged because he has not been convicted of this at all.

540
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,700
 But there was a guy named Randall Drake.

541
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,860
 The police were actually investigating him for distributing child pornography, that's

542
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,140
 how he got on the radar.

543
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:48,180
 They come to the house, they see a locked closet, they go "that must be where the child

544
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,180
 porn is."

545
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:53,100
 They break the lock, they found a ton of weapons, pipe bombs, they found Google Earth maps of

546
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:58,180
 local schools, a Google Earth map of like a water refinery and a letter talking about

547
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:02,500
 how the world needs to burn, everyone's so evil to me, blah blah blah.

548
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:07,260
 Now they haven't located the child porn yet, but again it's an interesting connection.

549
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:10,460
 He's locked up right now, I think they have him on a 50-150 hold because they just don't

550
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:14,460
 know, or they charged him with just building the pipe bombs or something like that.

551
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:19,580
 But, you have all, oh and Steven Paddock's brother was arrested for child porn and that

552
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,740
 was a whole weird story.

553
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:24,260
 He actually got released, even though they found him with child porn they released him

554
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:27,020
 because they said "oh there's no witnesses, we'll testify against you."

555
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,460
 What about the cops who walked in the room with all the child porn?

556
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:34,420
 Anyways they released him and then another agency arrested him again and said "no, we'll

557
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,980
 charge him with the child porn."

558
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:40,420
 So we have this thread and just these four links of this child porn being linked through.

559
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:43,580
 Is it possible that there is a connection between the two?

560
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:49,940
 Again, I will go towards that idea that these people, I would say yes, other than Randall

561
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:53,700
 Drake which hasn't been convicted yet so we'll put him back in the box.

562
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:59,940
 Steven Paddock, Cho Sung Hoi, Adam Lanza, I'd say very likely that they had child pornography

563
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,440
 on their computers.

564
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:08,540
 So the question is, is there actually a link between the consumption of child pornography,

565
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,860
 being a pedophile and being a mass shooter?

566
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:15,020
 I don't think that every child molester is a mass shooter but I think you might find

567
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:20,140
 the odds of being mass shooters are more likely to be pedophiles or have child porn.

568
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:24,700
 And I would say that if you're already nutty enough to go and shoot up a whole group of

569
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,700
 people for absolutely no reason other than whatever stuff is wrong in your head, clicking

570
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:35,260
 a link on a dark web website full of child porn should be the least of your worries.

571
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:40,020
 And I think it's something that one thing may lead into the other because again when

572
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:46,980
 you're killing someone, that person is now frozen as a young person in their photo forever.

573
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:52,580
 You're locking them in to that age group that you like, that photo forever.

574
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,740
 It's never going to go away.

575
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:58,740
 You keep them forever young, just the way that a pedophile would want it.

576
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:05,020
 So I mean, I think if somebody out there listening to the show is a research psychologist and

577
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:09,820
 you're listening to it to figure me out, this might be a good dissertation to actually go

578
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:14,780
 through and really dig in to the people who are still alive.

579
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:18,740
 And shooters are still alive, you could really aggressively ask them if they're pedophiles.

580
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,260
 I don't know.

581
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:24,620
 But go through the victim numbers and find the ages of the victims and see how they correlate

582
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,140
 and all of this stuff.

583
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,180
 It wouldn't shock me.

584
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,660
 It just wouldn't shock me, unfortunately.

585
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:34,300
 But I wanted to kind of cover that story for you because I thought it was just kind of

586
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,900
 a weird blip on the conspiracy iceberg.

587
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,660
 Like it's just two words strung together.

588
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,620
 Was it part of the word soup?

589
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,660
 Or was it actually a hint to a bigger problem that we don't know about?

590
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,980
 We always talk about bullying with school shootings.

591
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,180
 We always talk about anti-anxiety medicine with school shootings.

592
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,780
 But is there something else we need to look at?

593
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:58,700
 Are school shootings linked to pedophiles and child molestation?

594
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:04,940
 And this is something we should look at as it seems that both of those lifestyles are

595
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:08,660
 starting to be a little more accepted in our world.

596
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,660
 That's not a good thing.

597
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,900
 It's not a good thing.

598
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,540
