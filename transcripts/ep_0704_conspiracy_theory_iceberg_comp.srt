1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,280
 El Salvador, a country of beauty, mystery, and half human donkeys.

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:15,420
 And then we travel to China to meet a man who will go to dangerous extremes for his art.

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,440
 And then we take a look at the conspiracy theory iceberg itself.

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,960
 Is it possible that this meme that's been spreading around the internet for the past

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,960
 few years is about to signal the end of all conspiracy theory today on Dead Rabbit Radio?

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:37,880
 [Music]

7
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,920
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,640
 I'm your host Jason Garmenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,280
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,600
 I hope you guys are staying cool, beating the heat.

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,160
 Let's go ahead and welcome in one of our legacy Patreon supporters.

12
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,680
 Coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now is a longtime Patreon supporter, Jason F.

13
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,520
 Everyone give him a round of applause, jump up, give him a high five, give him a hug.

14
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,280
 He's like, "Dude, I do not want to be touched."

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,840
 Tickle him, tickle him a bit.

16
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,200
 Jason, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,880
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

18
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,000
 Just helps rid of the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,960
 Jason, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

20
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,320
 Hey, it's named after you. What a coincidence.

21
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,640
 We're going to hop inside and I'm going to have you drive us on out to El Salvador.

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,880
 [Panting]

23
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,520
 The other day I put out a request for stories about El Salvador,

24
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,880
 because this is one of the top science podcasts in El Salvador.

25
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,640
 It was number one when I recorded the episode.

26
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,640
 Now it's number six.

27
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,760
 I'm assuming a coalition of scientists got together after that episode came out

28
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,000
 and they're like, "This cannot be."

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,880
 Everyone started downloading these other podcasts,

30
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,480
 but we're still the number sixth science podcast in El Salvador

31
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,040
 and the number one paranormal podcast in the country.

32
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,160
 So thank you guys.

33
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,080
 But I put out a call for stories and a lot of people sent me stuff.

34
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,120
 So thank you for that.

35
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,120
 A lot of people sent me stuff and we may be covering that.

36
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,200
 So there's a lot of Civil War, war crimes stuff.

37
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,280
 But I found not what I was looking for,

38
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,600
 but I guess in a way it's what I asked for, right?

39
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,880
 Like what I was hoping for was a monster, a scary monster,

40
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,280
 staring at people from the El Salvadorian jungle.

41
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,760
 Or maybe a ghost, maybe a young woman was walking down the street one day

42
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,480
 and they saw a clickety-clack-clack-clickety-clack-clack.

43
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,000
 I don't know what type of ghost that is.

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,200
 That's the annoying ghost.

45
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,880
 It's the fidget spinner ghost.

46
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,840
 Some tall gangly black shadow chasing a girl down the street.

47
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,960
 What I got is what I probably deserved

48
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,680
 by saying send me a weird story from El Salvador.

49
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,840
 Kitchy via Discord, we have a Patreon Discord.

50
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:44,360
 Kitchy sent me a article from this website called Daily Mysteries.com.

51
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:50,040
 Their tagline for this website is the website with the amazing content.

52
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,080
 Which is true because no other website.

53
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,720
 I checked.

54
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,560
 Not a single other website on the entire world wide web carried this story.

55
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,080
 I tried verifying this story.

56
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,320
 There was not a single other website that mentioned this.

57
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,360
 There was a Facebook post.

58
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,440
 I'll give them that.

59
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,560
 But if you talk about all of the internet places in the world,

60
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,280
 only one covers this.

61
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,000
 DailyMysteries.com.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,920
 It's February 2019.

63
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,800
 We're in the city of Animal Rose.

64
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,840
 That's in the El Union district in El Salvador.

65
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,520
 There's a donkey born.

66
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,680
 [Dog barking]

67
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,680
 Jason, a donkey.

68
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,840
 A donkey is the easiest animal to make a noise.

69
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,840
 What was that?

70
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,840
 Well, that's what they sound like when they were born.

71
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,840
 Hee-haw!

72
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,840
 Hee-haw!

73
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,480
 This little donkey coming out of the womb.

74
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,480
 He and Han.

75
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,480
 The mom goat.

76
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,880
 The mom donkey looks back at it and goes, "Ugh!"

77
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,120
 Walks away and there's this little donkey just kicking its little baby legs.

78
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,120
 It's brand new.

79
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,720
 It's doop-doop-doop-doop-doop.

80
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,720
 The farmer walks over.

81
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,200
 It's a woman who owns this donkey and she's like, "Oh!"

82
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,720
 That's super disgusting.

83
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,920
 She goes and tells everyone in town, she goes, "Dude, you guys want to see something super

84
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,920
 gross?

85
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,920
 I'll cost you a dollar.

86
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,920
 You got to pay a dollar to see."

87
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,120
 Everyone knows this lady has the grossest stuff at her farm.

88
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,440
 People come to her farm and they realize that we have a goat.

89
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,320
 It has the body of a goat.

90
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,480
 Why do I keep saying goat, damn it?

91
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
 It's the donkey.

92
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,480
 Like, Jason.

93
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,960
 How often, how long was I saying goat?

94
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,960
 It's a donkey.

95
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,480
 It would be really weird if it was a donkey with the body of a goat.

96
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,560
 That would actually be pretty dope.

97
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,880
 If you find that in El Salvador, send me that story as well.

98
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:54,920
 It's a donkey with the body of a donkey, the neck of a donkey, but the face of a human?

99
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,320
 Now there's photos of this thing.

100
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,720
 And when Kitchy sent me this, you click on the link, it'll be in the show notes.

101
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,840
 You're like, "It's like the biggest photo ever.

102
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,800
 It's like a thousand pixels."

103
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,720
 Like once you click on the link, it's basically your entire desktop is taken over by this photo

104
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,560
 of this deformed donkey.

105
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,560
 This is what I get.

106
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,560
 This is what I get.

107
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,920
 This UFO story from El Salvador can't get a spooky ghost.

108
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,720
 Actually no, Kitchy did send some bright lights in the sky thing, but I couldn't get like

109
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,680
 a UFO abduction story.

110
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,360
 I couldn't get a guy getting possessed.

111
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,680
 I got a picture of a deformed goat.

112
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,180
 Damn it, donkey.

113
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,400
 At a picture of, I'm like, "Man, that donkey sure looks like a goat."

114
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,040
 They're like, "Jason, that is a goat.

115
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,240
 How are you getting these two animals mixed up?"

116
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,440
 Okay, there's a photo of a donkey.

117
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,040
 It's a photo of a donkey with a deformed face.

118
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,280
 And it does look kind of human.

119
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:52,360
 And you look at it in your initial reaction was, "I hope that this thing isn't suffering.

120
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,440
 I hope that either it lives a long and healthy life or it's put out of its misery."

121
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:04,760
 Because like, as being a donkey, you eat a certain way like a donkey does, right?

122
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,960
 But then like now you have a human mouth.

123
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,160
 Imagine if you were human, but you had a donkey mouth and your instinct is telling you to

124
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,280
 eat like bananas and things, oranges.

125
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,920
 But your donkey mouth is so...

126
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,560
 You're like, "Jason, your mouth operates no matter how long it is."

127
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,160
 I think you would have a hard time if your brain was instinctively like going, "No, I

128
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,960
 have a monkey mouth."

129
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,880
 But then you actually have like an alligator mouth.

130
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,800
 I don't think you would be able to eat that well.

131
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,360
 But you could probably figure it out because you're a human.

132
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,360
 A donkey couldn't, right?

133
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,360
 He has a...

134
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,360
 It does kind of look like a human face.

135
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,760
 So I'm looking at this thing and I go, "Oh, it's a deformed animal.

136
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,760
 That's tragic.

137
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,240
 I hope it's not suffering."

138
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,760
 And then I read the article attached to this giant photo that filled up my screen.

139
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,480
 Because this is what you imagine, right?

140
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,200
 We always see these stories about these chickens that are born with two heads or this alligator

141
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,520
 that's born with eight tails or something.

142
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,680
 And you go, "Oh, that's horrible."

143
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,880
 And usually the article goes, "It died five hours later."

144
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,520
 But people still think this was a miracle or this was a sign.

145
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,720
 There's a little monkey born with faces on its hands.

146
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,960
 And then he died a couple hours later.

147
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,840
 We see these mutations happen.

148
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,160
 So I'm expecting that when I read the article.

149
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,160
 I read the article.

150
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,800
 Juan Antonio Zacharias.

151
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,360
 He lives next door to the deformed donkey.

152
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,280
 Juan says, "Oh, did you hear about my neighbor have that deformed donkey?"

153
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,160
 Here's a bunch of pictures of that deformed donkey.

154
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,400
 And people are like, "Yeah, it's tragic."

155
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,520
 Juan says, "It's not tragic.

156
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,400
 That's not tragic.

157
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,600
 That is my son."

158
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,880
 And everyone goes, "Huh?"

159
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,880
 Juan tells this...

160
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,880
 He's not ashamed of this.

161
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,800
 He's not ashamed of the fact that he's been banging this donkey.

162
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,160
 He says, "Not only have I been banging this donkey, not my son.

163
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,160
 What do you think?

164
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,360
 I'm some sort of pervert?"

165
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,400
 He named this baby donkey Milagro Jose or "Miracle Jose."

166
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,040
 He goes, "No, Miracle Jose is my son.

167
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,840
 I was banging his mom, the donkey, because my neighbor, she's really cruel to the donkey.

168
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,360
 She doesn't take care of it.

169
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,360
 And I felt bad for it.

170
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,040
 So I'd go over there and I'd like bathe her and feed her.

171
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:09,200
 And then sometimes, you know, after the bath, I would make love to this donkey."

172
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,080
 People are like, "Why are you admitting this?

173
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,600
 Why are you openly admitting this?"

174
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,400
 And he goes, "Because I want to love my son.

175
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,600
 Like look at this guy.

176
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,360
 Look at this monstrosity in front of you.

177
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,960
 This is a half-human donkey.

178
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,520
 This is my son.

179
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:30,320
 He's actually asking to have a DNA test done on the donkey to prove that it's half him.

180
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,560
 And he wants Miracle Jose to have special rights.

181
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,560
 He wants it to have the rights that a normal human would have."

182
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,560
 Apparently, people in town have heard.

183
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,720
 I don't know why they're even hanging out at the farm at this point, because you know

184
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:47,000
 you're probably going to stumble upon one banging this donkey in the next yard.

185
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,400
 But people in town who have run into Miracle Jose, they say that this donkey says one word

186
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,440
 and one word only.

187
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,960
 "Dad.

188
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,400
 Dad."

189
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,400
 I don't know.

190
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,880
 I don't know if this story is true on a couple different levels.

191
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,080
 I tried looking around DailyMistries.com.

192
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,800
 It's a standard...

193
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,360
 It didn't stand out as being like a parody site.

194
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,280
 It could be a very subtle parody site.

195
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,280
 I've come across...

196
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,840
 I remember once a long time ago, me and my little brother found a website.

197
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,760
 It was a Christian parody website that...

198
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,440
 This was like back in 2004, 2005, that was trying to explain that dinosaurs lived in

199
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,400
 Africa and how they were beating up atheists in Africa and saving the dinosaurs.

200
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,680
 And me and my brother were reading it and were like, "This is fake, right?"

201
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:43,280
 This isn't real, but it was written so slickly that you knew it was fake, because you knew

202
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,560
 the facts are wrong.

203
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:50,560
 But it was page after page after page after page, and they kept the joke going the whole

204
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,560
 time.

205
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,080
 And they would have their frequently asked questions.

206
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,240
 And all of the frequently asked questions were, "Is this a joke?"

207
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,040
 And they were like, "No, it's not.

208
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,040
 We're totally serious.

209
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,040
 We believe it."

210
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,680
 They were trying to raise money to save the Brontosaurus in Africa.

211
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,680
 It was a joke.

212
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,120
 It had to have been a joke, right?

213
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,600
 So I don't know if DailyMistries.com is the same thing.

214
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,720
 I kind of poked around there.

215
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,000
 It seemed like it was just a basic paranormal, weird news website.

216
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,640
 But I was only able to find this story on there and I'm wondering if they found these

217
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,120
 photos of this mutated donkey and then created this backstory.

218
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,520
 There's no who would, who would admit to that.

219
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,200
 We covered a story about people who were banging animals and animals being deformed.

220
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,240
 And bestiality used to be a crime, you put to the death.

221
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,240
 It was a capital crime.

222
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,560
 You and the animal were both killed, which is not the animal's fault.

223
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,240
 But so I don't know why you would be walking around and be so proud about this.

224
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,640
 You have a father of the year shirt, father of the farm shirt.

225
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,240
 I don't know.

226
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,760
 But at the same time, people are stupid.

227
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,520
 At the same time, people are stupid.

228
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,000
 And some of them love banging donkeys, I guess.

229
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,480
 Having donkey sons, having sunkeys.

230
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,480
 So yeah, there we go.

231
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,080
 I asked for a story from El Salvador and this is what I got.

232
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:14,840
 El Salvador had, this can't be the only story I cover from your country.

233
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,840
 I can't.

234
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,880
 So once again, thank you Kitchie for sending this out.

235
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,000
 I'm gonna put another call for a story from El Salvador.

236
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,520
 Let's see if we can put them on the paranormal map.

237
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:30,840
 Because right now, as of now, Miracle Jose is what we have from El Salvador.

238
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,840
 There has to be something else.

239
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,840
 Right?

240
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,840
 Right?

241
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
 I'm incredulous.

242
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,840
 I'm incredulous.

243
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,760
 But thank you for everyone who submitted stuff.

244
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,920
 Let's keep looking or not because there's a possibility it'll get worse, right?

245
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,920
 There's a possibility it'll get worse than Miracle Jose.

246
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,920
 Did you know?

247
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,920
 I didn't know this.

248
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,920
 Did you know?

249
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,920
 I didn't know this.

250
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:56,040
 I was reading this article and at one point they called the donkey a burrito nino.

251
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,320
 When I go, "What?

252
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,320
 Burrito boy?

253
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,320
 What does that mean?

254
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,800
 What's why they calling him a burrito boy?"

255
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,800
 Did you know?

256
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,440
 You're like, "Jason, you seriously didn't know this?"

257
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,080
 I didn't know this.

258
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:11,000
 Burrito means little donkey.

259
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,440
 Like when you eat a burrito, it's called a little donkey and they don't know why it's

260
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,600
 called a burrito.

261
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,000
 Some people say it's because you put a bunch of stuff in the burrito, like you put a bunch

262
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,120
 of stuff on the back of a donkey and then you eat it.

263
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,360
 The donkey's walking through the village.

264
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,640
 You're like trying to chase it.

265
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,040
 Take a bite out of its shovels.

266
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,360
 Some people say that there was a guy in San Francisco.

267
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,360
 It was weird.

268
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,360
 Do you know there's different types of burritos?

269
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,360
 I'm not sure.

270
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,160
 This is one of the rest of the episode, but there's like the mission style burrito.

271
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,840
 Those came out of San Francisco and those are like the bigger ones with meat.

272
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,840
 Originally it was like beans and rye.

273
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,520
 I was super hungry when I was researching this.

274
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,160
 Yeah, mission burrito is the big one.

275
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,840
 They can say that one came out of the 1960s.

276
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,680
 There was some street vendor on Mission Street in San Francisco who was selling these ones.

277
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,680
 Super interesting.

278
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:05,040
 I just assumed it was a regional food, but the evolution of it, and I guess there's a

279
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,600
 big disagreement over when it stops being a taco and becomes a burrito.

280
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,280
 Some people will argue like the early burritos were actually tacos.

281
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,840
 I honestly had to stop researching that.

282
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,840
 I was getting so hungry.

283
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,480
 I was looking at all these photos.

284
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,280
 Dude, I should just go buy a burrito right now.

285
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,360
 I don't know why I didn't buy a burrito the other day.

286
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,800
 But anyways, yeah, Lil Burrito.

287
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,120
 They say that there was one of the origin stories is there was a guy who started selling the

288
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,240
 original burritos outside of a elementary school.

289
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:40,560
 He would call the kids burritos, which basically was calling the kids donkeys, which were calling

290
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,560
 them dumb.

291
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,280
 He'd be like, "Come on, you burritos.

292
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,400
 Come and buy my food."

293
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,960
 He was just serving food wrapped in a tortilla.

294
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,280
 And then eventually it caught on.

295
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,960
 I mean, the kids were being horribly insulted this whole time.

296
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,160
 He's like, "No, no, it's a term of endearment."

297
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,880
 I meant, "You are this edible thing."

298
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,920
 As their parents were coming to beat them up, they're like, "Quit calling our kid Lil

299
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
 Donkey."

300
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,920
 There you go, two for one.

301
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,040
 You got a story out of El Salvador, about a half human donkey, and you got the origin

302
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,040
 of the burrito.

303
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,040
 You're like Jason.

304
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:13,320
 You literally are the last person to not know burrito meant Lil Donkey.

305
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,160
 Jason F., we're going to go ahead and leave behind El Salvador.

306
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,160
 We're not going to have time to cover the artist's story.

307
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,360
 We'll save that for another episode.

308
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,440
 It's a really interesting one.

309
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,400
 But Jason F., I'm going to go ahead and give you the keys to the Carboner copter.

310
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,560
 We are leaving behind El Salvador.

311
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:33,640
 We are headed out to the conspiracy theory iceberg.

312
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:40,960
 The conspiracy theory iceberg has always puzzled me.

313
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,960
 The first time I saw the conspiracy theory iceberg back in 2017, I didn't believe it.

314
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,480
 I had the same reaction that most of you guys did.

315
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,160
 You look at the top couple levels, you're like, "I know all those things."

316
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,320
 You look at the middle tier levels, you know a couple of those things.

317
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,400
 Then as you went farther down, I go, "This is made up hogwash.

318
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,000
 You know what changed my mind?"

319
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,960
 I'm looking through the iceberg the very first time I see it.

320
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,480
 You're like, "Dude, look at all these crazy conspiracy theories.

321
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,960
 They're just sentences, right?

322
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,200
 God's last wish.

323
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,760
 The ocean at night.

324
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,760
 Sentient soy."

325
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,600
 We've covered a lot of these on this show, right?

326
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,320
 We talk about it a lot on this show.

327
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,760
 I remember the first time I saw it, I go, "I think this is fake.

328
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,760
 I know the top ones.

329
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,680
 They're pretty easy to know."

330
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,560
 The one that changed my mind that I go, "Oh, there's actually something behind this," was

331
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,640
 Britney Spears original doll.

332
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,440
 I'm a huge Britney Spears fan.

333
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,320
 I make no way to hide it.

334
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,800
 There's no reason to hide it.

335
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,880
 I'm very, very proud.

336
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,880
 I love Britney Spears.

337
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,080
 I love her music.

338
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,440
 I go, "Listen, I've never heard of this before, but I'm going to research it.

339
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:47,200
 I'm going to research and see if I can find anything about Britney Spears original doll.

340
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,680
 That'll be a good way to test this."

341
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,160
 At the very least, I get to type Britney Spears into Google.

342
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,320
 I immediately came across an article.

343
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,320
 It had been years.

344
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,040
 I'll put it in the show notes, but it was a single article about Britney Spears original

345
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,040
 doll.

346
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,400
 The thing is, I'm going off memory here, is it was either an entire album recorded or

347
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,480
 just a single song.

348
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,560
 I think it was a whole album that she had recorded against the wishes of her management

349
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,560
 team.

350
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,560
 They're like, "This isn't a good album.

351
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,360
 The songs don't really fit your image."

352
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:19,160
 She actually went to a radio station, just a random radio station in LA and knocked on

353
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,720
 the door and they came down and they see a giant security guard and tiny little Britney

354
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,720
 Spears there.

355
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,320
 They're like, "Uh, okay."

356
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,320
 She goes, "Can I play my song on the radio?"

357
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,080
 They, "Of course."

358
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,960
 They led her up and they played the song.

359
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,960
 I think the song was called Original Dolls, like the lead single.

360
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,600
 It's been played a single time.

361
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,440
 She got in a lot of trouble for that.

362
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,120
 Musicians don't own their music, but they said, "You can't do that.

363
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,520
 You can't just record songs and take them and play them on the radio."

364
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,560
 We told you not to do that.

365
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,560
 We specifically told you not to do that.

366
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,800
 I'm reading this article and I'm like, "This is so fascinating."

367
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,360
 The conspiracy, that alone is very interesting because it's a look into the mind.

368
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,360
 I love Britney Spears.

369
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,360
 It's a very, very complex character.

370
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,480
 I know there's that whole thing going on with the conservatorship right now.

371
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,520
 Very, very interesting, complex character.

372
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,160
 She seems like, at heart, a good person.

373
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,720
 A very, very good person.

374
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,960
 Good mother, very good mother.

375
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,000
 But the Original Doll Story is very interesting.

376
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,640
 It started to become something in the conspiracy theory community that the song was talking

377
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,960
 about Mind Control and MK Ultra.

378
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,960
 And I was like, "No."

379
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,480
 Because they have the lyrics for the song because it was played.

380
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,560
 No, I mean, I guess you can read that into that and stuff like that.

381
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:34,240
 But that's the problem with sometimes conspiracy theories try to go, "Oh, and Pizza Gate!"

382
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:41,280
 And you're like, "The idea of a woman being trapped in a recording contract and sneaking

383
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,520
 out of the studio with a master copy of a CD and playing it because she really loves

384
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:52,360
 a song is infinitely more interesting because it's true and it happened than adding on something

385
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,840
 else."

386
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:59,880
 And then Satan worshippers showed up and they dragged her back.

387
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,960
 It might seem more sexy and more dangerous in your mind, but the truth is actually far,

388
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,960
 far more interesting.

389
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,920
 But anyways, I go, "This was when I said the conspiracy iceberg is legit."

390
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,400
 And I've always had a lot of faith in the conspiracy theory icebergs, specifically 2016

391
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,040
 to 2018 icebergs.

392
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,240
 I have to catalog them like that.

393
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,080
 So when I started doing this show, I was never of the mind that I was going to cover every

394
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,200
 topic on the conspiracy theory iceberg.

395
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,760
 I figured I was going to cover a lot of them because they were obscure conspiracy theories

396
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,080
 and that's what I wanted to do with this show.

397
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,040
 I didn't want to talk about Mary Celeste.

398
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,880
 I didn't want to talk about 9/11, even though I just did.

399
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,880
 But you know what I mean?

400
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,720
 I didn't want to hit the tropes over and over and over again.

401
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,600
 I didn't want to talk about Jess Bigfoot.

402
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:47,400
 I didn't want to talk about Roswell or Travis Walton, Lights in the Sky and things like that.

403
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,440
 I wanted to talk about stuff I hadn't heard of.

404
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,320
 And if I hadn't heard of, the chances are a lot of people haven't heard of because I've

405
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,200
 been covering this stuff for 30 years.

406
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,200
 The conspiracy theory iceberg had a bunch of stuff that I didn't know.

407
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,160
 So it worked perfectly together.

408
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,160
 I think in the early episodes, I don't think I started covering stuff off the conspiracy

409
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,320
 theory iceberg since episode, around episode 20.

410
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,680
 It might have been earlier.

411
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,040
 I think some of the stuff, and this is an interesting point, we'll actually start, let

412
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,080
 me start what I'm going with right now.

413
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,920
 I want to be very, very clear in what I'm going to say.

414
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,960
 I do not hate the iceberg.

415
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,680
 I'm not saying that the iceberg sucks.

416
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,760
 I'm not saying that people who do cover it suck.

417
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,920
 I'm not saying that it's normie or that we should get past the iceberg.

418
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,920
 I'm not saying that at all.

419
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,040
 And I want to be very, very clear.

420
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,600
 There are YouTubers like PlagueMoth, Windigoon.

421
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,160
 Windigoon, I think, does it, has been the most successful with it.

422
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:41,680
 But Parallel Pipes, a YouTuber not only covered the conspiracy theory iceberg, covered the

423
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,000
 one that I'm listed in.

424
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,520
 I'm on the conspiracy theory iceberg.

425
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,880
 And they said the podcast was really good and people should check it out.

426
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,760
 Thanks Parallel Pipes for the shout out.

427
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:55,160
 And I was sent that video by 12inches and Gislepard.

428
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,440
 That's a weird combination of those two people together.

429
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,200
 But two different listeners sent me that video.

430
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,200
 Thank you very much.

431
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,200
 That was really cool.

432
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,240
 Mr. Gigi also does conspiracy theory iceberg stuff.

433
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,440
 And that's dope.

434
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,720
 These people are killing it in the conspiracy theory iceberg stuff.

435
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,280
 They will do video after video after video of talking about every single thing on the

436
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,280
 iceberg.

437
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,600
 That's awesome.

438
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,120
 I'm not bagging on that content at all.

439
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,560
 It's really cool how much success they found with the iceberg.

440
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:28,600
 And I have found, a lot of you guys have told me, we found your show because of the conspiracy

441
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,720
 theory iceberg.

442
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,800
 They saw something on there.

443
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,200
 They wanted to see what the ocean at night was all about.

444
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,360
 Typed it in with search engine.

445
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,360
 I popped up.

446
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,400
 I'm not hating on the iceberg at all.

447
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:42,400
 The iceberg is a really cool image and whether you are just starting off in conspiracy theory.

448
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,760
 Because I love this as a hobby.

449
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:50,400
 I think you guys, after 700 and what, 3-4 episodes, I think you guys can sense that passion from

450
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,400
 me.

451
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,480
 I love researching paranormal conspiracy stuff as a hobby.

452
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,560
 And the conspiracy theory iceberg, whether you're jumping into it for the first time

453
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,520
 or you're a 30 year veteran.

454
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,760
 I've been doing this since I was 12.

455
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,320
 The conspiracy theory iceberg is a great starter point.

456
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:13,440
 I'm not hating on the iceberg, but if we are not careful, this iceberg will destroy our

457
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,440
 community.

458
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:22,080
 I actually wanted to talk about this a while ago, but I felt that it would seem like I

459
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,600
 was attacking this thing, this iceberg.

460
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,000
 And I remember I was going to talk about it a while ago and I couldn't find the right

461
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,440
 way to phrase it, but we're at a point now where I have to talk about it.

462
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,720
 Because of something that was just sent to me from one of my Patreon supporters, Jim

463
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,640
 Jam sent this to me the other day.

464
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,840
 It's interesting, I get a lot of YouTube comments saying "Hey, when are you going to put out

465
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,040
 more conspiracy theory iceberg stuff?"

466
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,360
 When are you going to do more iceberg stuff?

467
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:52,320
 And it's always a very interesting comment to me because I do it all the time.

468
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,680
 But I don't always say that it's conspiracy theory iceberg stuff.

469
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:01,560
 There have been episodes where I forgot to say it was on the conspiracy theory iceberg.

470
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,960
 There's episodes like the Stonehead of Guatemala.

471
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,440
 I didn't even know it was on the conspiracy theory iceberg.

472
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,920
 I was just researching it, thought it was cool, did an episode on it.

473
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,360
 The episode is just there.

474
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,760
 It's a great episode.

475
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,160
 I mean, I'm not trying to say I did a great job doing it, but the mystery is what I mean.

476
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,680
 The mystery of the Stonehead of Guatemala is awesome.

477
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,840
 I'm going to put it in the show notes.

478
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,480
 I really recommend listening to it.

479
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,320
 Never ever say it's on the conspiracy theory iceberg.

480
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,760
 I don't even know it was on the conspiracy theory iceberg.

481
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,680
 That episode just sits in a collection of 702 episodes.

482
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,120
 It doesn't pop out in any way, shape, or form.

483
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,440
 But whenever I say in an episode, "Hey guys, we're going to the conspiracy theory iceberg

484
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,440
 right now.

485
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,560
 We're going to talk about this story," I get a lot of comments in the YouTube section

486
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,280
 going, "Dude, I love the conspiracy theory iceberg stuff.

487
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,040
 Do more conspiracy theory iceberg stuff."

488
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,040
 So fat.

489
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,800
 And I don't want this to come across as sour grapes.

490
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,200
 I like the iceberg.

491
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,400
 See, this is why I was hesitant to talk about it, but I have to now.

492
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,400
 I like the iceberg.

493
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,080
 And I'm not saying you have to listen to every single episode of mine.

494
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,080
 No, you have to.

495
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,080
 They're all just as good.

496
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,080
 I just don't understand.

497
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:08,080
 It's weird because the conspiracy theory iceberg is not just conspiracy theories.

498
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,000
 The Stonehead of Guatemala is on there.

499
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,240
 And here's what it is.

500
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:19,560
 There's a giant stonehead in Guatemala that has Anglo-Saxon or Caucasian features.

501
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:24,560
 And it seems to be super old to a time that there were no Caucasians there.

502
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:29,080
 So the idea was there was a lost civilization or aliens had come down.

503
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,080
 And here's a spoiler alert.

504
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,440
 Just give a head 30 seconds if you want to listen to the episode.

505
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,480
 It turns out there, a reporter went there and investigated it.

506
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,680
 It turns out that it's not ancient.

507
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:46,080
 A farmer in 1910 made it in the image of his deceased wife.

508
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,040
 And then he passed away as well.

509
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,280
 And the jungle reclaimed his farmland.

510
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,920
 I mean, the story, the story is brilliant.

511
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:59,720
 And then 40 years later, people were chopping away these jungle vines and they find this

512
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,520
 Stonehead with Caucasian features.

513
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,960
 There's like documents of it and they've taken samples of it.

514
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,280
 It's 100% a modern thing.

515
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,960
 That's a fascinating story.

516
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,080
 And it shows how quickly nature can reclaim a civilization and how easily people can

517
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,600
 be mistaken.

518
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,600
 Fascinating story.

519
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,660
 Definitely deserves its place on the conspiracy theory iceberg.

520
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:24,800
 And does organic black helicopters, which turned out to be a joke?

521
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,080
 But I want to, again, this, I don't want to sound like Sarah Grape's.

522
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,920
 I try to find obscure stuff and it's so interesting to me.

523
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:36,720
 It's so interesting to me that I can cover a story no one's ever heard of and it is just

524
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,880
 there.

525
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,700
 And I can cover a story that no one's ever heard of, but that phrase appeared on an image

526
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:47,080
 that was put up in 2018 and people, and I say it's on the iceberg and people go, I love

527
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,080
 your iceberg stuff.

528
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,820
 Another great iceberg story.

529
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,300
 It's so fascinating to me.

530
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:56,940
 And if that same story that was on the iceberg, I don't say it, gets less comments, gets

531
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,340
 less engagement.

532
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,180
 But see, that's not your fault.

533
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:04,700
 This is why I want to be careful of saying, I'm not saying, listen to everything.

534
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,500
 I'm not saying that.

535
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:11,460
 I'm just wondering what the mechanism is.

536
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:16,700
 It's interesting because just the other day I got a YouTube comment from D bullets and

537
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,320
 they asked if I was going to be doing more conspiracy theory iceberg stuff and it was

538
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,620
 a perfect timing because I had just gotten this thing from Jim Jam and I asked them,

539
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:29,800
 why do you like the con- I get no judgment because I also love looking at the conspiracy

540
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
 theory iceberg.

541
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:38,040
 But I go, why is it that a conspiracy theory iceberg topic jumps out more to you than any

542
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,600
 of the other topics I covered?

543
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,440
 It was interesting because his answer, and this is a valid answer and I thank you for

544
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,040
 your cooperation in this.

545
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,380
 He says, it's a good way to look for wacky conspiracy theories and I don't know which

546
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,540
 of your episodes have wacky conspiracy theories on them.

547
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:55,580
 It's a very, very good way to look at it.

548
00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:00,460
 He says that if it's on the iceberg, it's "guaranteed to be some super out there theory."

549
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,900
 Which is generally correct.

550
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:05,980
 The top three tiers, you really shouldn't know those just if you're a hobbyist.

551
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,860
 But again, if you're just starting off, it's a good jumping off point, but that's all pretty

552
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,700
 normal conspiracy theory stuff.

553
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,820
 If you go deeper, it gets weirder.

554
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,000
 It's an interesting comment.

555
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,560
 Sometimes I'll put conspiracy theory iceberg in the title of the episode, like this one.

556
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:24,760
 This one's a little more meta, but if you're listening to the episode and I say, and we

557
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:29,080
 go back to the conspiracy theory iceberg and I say this topic, or if I don't say that and

558
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,280
 I say the topic, it does it trigger something differently.

559
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,960
 And you might sound, this might sound too meta, it might sound like I'm doing marketing research

560
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,120
 or something like that.

561
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,220
 We're getting to something.

562
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:43,080
 We're getting to my thesis that the conspiracy theory iceberg may soon destroy the community

563
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,260
 we love so much.

564
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:47,100
 Lego Trekker, gotta give a shout out to you as well.

565
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:52,420
 They were also popped up on this conversation I was having with D-Bullets on YouTube.

566
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,620
 And they said, this is again another very interesting thing.

567
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,820
 I want this feedback, right?

568
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,580
 Again, I'm not doing this for marketing research.

569
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:03,380
 I'm doing this to figure out what power the iceberg has.

570
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,380
 You know what I mean?

571
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,860
 I don't want to sound like I'm trying to make my channel any better.

572
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,860
 The channel's the channel.

573
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,780
 Like at this point, we're 700 episodes in.

574
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,140
 The formula's not going to change.

575
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,200
 But Lego Trekker, this is very, very interesting.

576
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,200
 I love this insight.

577
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,640
 This is why I love talking to you guys.

578
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:22,640
 Lego Trekker says, when you do iceberg stuff, we feel included in the research because we've

579
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,720
 also seen it on the iceberg.

580
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,920
 Fascinating, fascinating insight.

581
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,520
 That's the type of, that's why I'm asking these questions.

582
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,640
 And I hope more people as you're listening to this episode are giving me your feedback

583
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:40,160
 of why you prefer, but I also want to know when you come across stuff where it's an interesting

584
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,580
 topic, but it's not on the iceberg.

585
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,700
 It's so weird.

586
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:49,020
 I remember a while back, I posted on YouTube, I posted a question on YouTube.

587
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:53,740
 I go, do you think the conspiracy theory iceberg is cursed?

588
00:27:53,740 --> 00:28:02,060
 Because I felt at a certain point that it was starting to override conspiracy theory content.

589
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:06,540
 Where it was basically, if a conspiracy, it was basically a gatekeeper.

590
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:12,680
 Where if I covered the vampire sex cult of Yerba Buene, which is an amazing true crime

591
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:18,640
 paranormal story that involves satanic human sacrifice, 100% true, it's not on the conspiracy

592
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,640
 theory iceberg.

593
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:25,800
 So if it's not on the conspiracy theory iceberg, that is considered not as cool.

594
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,840
 It's almost like the iceberg is a gatekeeping thing.

595
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,040
 My question has always been, who developed this?

596
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,040
 We still have never known that.

597
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,440
 I think there's basically two phases to the iceberg.

598
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,980
 There's the original iceberg that popped up in 2016.

599
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,140
 I'll try to put those in the show notes as well, so you can look at the evolution of

600
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,140
 them.

601
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,140
 It's a very, very basic iceberg.

602
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,380
 It looks like someone just threw it up in an afternoon.

603
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:51,140
 But then between 2017, 2017 was the year it really broke out.

604
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,620
 After that, you started getting the fake icebergs.

605
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,260
 And that is what brings me to our topic today.

606
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,020
 I know this might seem rambly.

607
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:02,620
 I hope you guys are enjoying it because it's over.

608
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,620
 It's over.

609
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,600
 I'm going to continue to cover conspiracy theory iceberg content.

610
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,600
 I am.

611
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,160
 But we've run into a serious problem with them.

612
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,840
 And this is what Jim Jam sent me.

613
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,560
 This is why I'm all worked up about this.

614
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,120
 And really at the end of the day, I don't care.

615
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,520
 Everyone should just have fun when they're researching conspiracy theories, whether or

616
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,280
 not you're watching my show, whether or not you're watching Plague Moth, Windy Goon, Parallel

617
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,680
 Pipes, Mr. Gigi, or the other people doing it.

618
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,680
 Have fun.

619
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,680
 Have fun.

620
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,680
 That's the key thing.

621
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,880
 But I also love this as a hobby.

622
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,380
 And whoever did this, I'm not mad at them.

623
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,380
 I'm not mad at them.

624
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,460
 They are also having fun in their own way.

625
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:44,940
 But I think overall, I'll just get to it.

626
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,260
 So Jim Jam sent me this thing on Reddit.

627
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,260
 Just popped up on June 1st.

628
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,340
 It's from a user name, Why Am I Sad?

629
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,500
 Again, just a dude having fun.

630
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,500
 Just a dude having fun.

631
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,620
 I'm not saying he's ruined the hobby.

632
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,780
 I'm not saying that.

633
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,740
 That if it wasn't him, we were headed this way anyways.

634
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:04,400
 Because every show often-- I shouldn't say every show often-- every day almost or every

635
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,720
 week, that's an exaggeration.

636
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,960
 Every week or two, you'll see on the export, made up conspiracy theories.

637
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,760
 Let's make up conspiracy theories.

638
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,160
 And they're funny, right?

639
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,160
 They're funny.

640
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,160
 They totally match.

641
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:21,560
 But every time they do that, it's just throwing more and more chaff in front of the way of

642
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:26,520
 our heat-seeking missiles that are trying to find these real ones.

643
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,760
 Until eventually, you can't figure it out.

644
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,380
 June 21st, Why Am I Sad?

645
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,620
 It's ingenious what they did.

646
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,940
 It's really, really ingenious.

647
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:42,340
 But they took a bunch of conspiracy theories, took a bunch of conspiracy theory icebergs,

648
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:50,540
 took a bunch of conspiracy theory iceberg explanations, and threw them into an AI machine.

649
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:54,220
 So we have an AI iceberg now.

650
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,740
 They were actually one of the first people to do it.

651
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:01,800
 I found one 10 months ago, and it was just an AI-generated iceberg using what I'm assuming

652
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,040
 would be the same technology.

653
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:07,800
 So let me read you some that the AI spit out using the rhythm and the way people talk on

654
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,080
 the conspiracy theory iceberg.

655
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,560
 This is what we have.

656
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,560
 Nuclear bomb test killed 100 million people.

657
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,480
 Eight is not a number.

658
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,240
 Gnomes on Mount Everest.

659
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,200
 Jurassic Park starred John Wayne.

660
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,460
 Chloe is the only person with a vagina.

661
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:31,220
 There's not one giant long conspiracy theory, but that's where the AI spit out.

662
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:36,300
 Now, the Chloe one, you could easily, like that's a joke one, but the other one you could

663
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,020
 see getting confused with actual conspiracy theories.

664
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,020
 Eight is not a number.

665
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,420
 Well, in fact, eight is actually the infinity sign.

666
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:45,660
 You could put on your conspiracy cap and you could extrapolate that through.

667
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,540
 Jurassic Park starred John Wayne.

668
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,340
 You could easily come over the conspiracy theory that effected its death.

669
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,120
 You could easily backtrack those, right?

670
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,480
 Gnomes on Mount Everest be super easy to find an explanation for.

671
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,040
 Why am I sad?

672
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,120
 Went the extra mile.

673
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:06,440
 They did the same thing, but they not only generated iceberg topics, they generated the

674
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,760
 descriptions as well.

675
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:18,960
 I think the iceberg appeals to people because it's so mysterious and you can go through

676
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,960
 the list.

677
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,980
 First off, it's a challenge to see what level you're out on the iceberg just by default.

678
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,060
 When you do a video, people love learning stuff.

679
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,620
 It's one of the great things about humanity.

680
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,940
 We love to learn.

681
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,420
 We get a little dopamine rush when we learn things.

682
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,820
 I have an information addiction.

683
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:38,540
 I think a lot of people do as well, but even if you don't have an information addiction,

684
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:42,940
 people get a little ping in their head when they refresh their page and a whole new thing

685
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:47,380
 of threads or a whole new thing of Reddit posts appears and they get to learn new information

686
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,380
 at the drop of a hat.

687
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:52,840
 So when you're looking at a whole list of things you don't know and when you're watching

688
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,600
 a video that's going step by step explaining all those things you don't know, you're basically

689
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,760
 getting a dopamine overdose.

690
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:03,560
 And the difference between learning about this stuff and learning about, say, cooking

691
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:10,880
 or learning about sports statistics is that conspiracy theory ideas give you occultic

692
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,880
 knowledge.

693
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,000
 It gives you hidden knowledge.

694
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,800
 You now know something.

695
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:19,140
 Whether or not it's true is almost irrelevant to your brain.

696
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,500
 Your brain can't really suss out whether or not the information is true or false.

697
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:28,940
 The brain just knows that you have now learned something and you know something that is hidden.

698
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,340
 You know something that is suppressed.

699
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,860
 It makes you feel special.

700
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:36,420
 I'm not saying that's a bad thing either.

701
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:43,140
 You should reach out to try to get all knowledge, but you should if someone says, "No, no,

702
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,240
 no, don't look in that corner.

703
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,400
 We have a tendency to want to look into that corner."

704
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,080
 So there's nothing wrong.

705
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,080
 That's the thing.

706
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,200
 I don't want it to come across that I'm bad mouthing this.

707
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,040
 This is a good thing that the human brain is wired for this.

708
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,920
 This is a good thing that we want to seek out information that may be suppressed from

709
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,920
 us.

710
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:05,400
 I'm not saying that this stuff is bad, but like I said, your brain itself cannot determine

711
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,080
 whether or not a fact is true or not.

712
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:12,440
 We then have to base it on things we already know about reality.

713
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,820
 The Stonehead of Guatemala is a Stonehead in Guatemala.

714
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,060
 That is a fact.

715
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:22,260
 Then your brain has to start to think, "Well, are alien cultures possible?

716
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,780
 Ancient visitors, Vikings coming over to Guatemala?

717
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,460
 What is this?

718
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,460
 What is this?"

719
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,260
 Most stories stop right there.

720
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,740
 I kept researching and researching it because I'm thinking, "Let's find a rational answer

721
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,740
 for this."

722
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,420
 If there isn't one, that's fine too because we cover weird stuff on this show, but let's

723
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,780
 see if there's a rational answer.

724
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,320
 I found this article that explained everything.

725
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:48,760
 My brain was just happy enough to stop at structure nobody knows about that shouldn't

726
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,120
 be there from a civilization long forgotten.

727
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:56,000
 My brain was totally happy with that dopamine hit.

728
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,120
 But now these AI icebergs have popped up.

729
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:02,520
 The joke icebergs for me, I get the entertainment value in creating them.

730
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,520
 People are having fun.

731
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,360
 I'm not against people having fun when they're not hurting other people.

732
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:10,420
 I'd see those exports pop up and I'd look through them and on the one hand I'd go, "Oh

733
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,020
 great, my job just got a little bit harder."

734
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,660
 But on the other hand I'd go, "But they're having fun."

735
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,660
 Whatever.

736
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,220
 It doesn't matter to me.

737
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,220
 Same thing with this dude.

738
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:23,500
 The guy jumping it into the AI thing, I don't think he's ruined my day or ruined my job

739
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:28,900
 or ruined my podcast or anyone else's job or podcast or hobby or anything like that.

740
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:33,340
 He was simply the first light to walk into the mine.

741
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,340
 Anyone was going to do this.

742
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,060
 It was going to start happening anyways.

743
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,760
 Let's take a look at some of the ones that his AI popped out.

744
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,160
 Remember he got the descriptions too.

745
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,880
 This episode is going to go a little long but I think it's necessary.

746
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,600
 Virtual reality conspiracy is one of the phrases that popped up and then the AI populated

747
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,600
 it with this.

748
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,320
 This is a lot like the sci-fi reality theory.

749
00:35:53,320 --> 00:36:00,960
 But instead of creating a simulation, they're actually turning us into virtual reality creatures.

750
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,800
 That would appear anywhere on any legitimate iceberg and people wouldn't think twice about

751
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,000
 it.

752
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,660
 The Galactic Superhero.

753
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,660
 Here's the description.

754
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:14,580
 The Old Testament is actually a retelling of the story of this civilization and we don't

755
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:20,140
 know anything because it's a fictional story meant to shape our morals.

756
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,740
 On the one hand you hear that, you know it's fake.

757
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,740
 See we're going into a fake.

758
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,460
 We go, that's an interesting story prompt.

759
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,380
 I can see a novel based on that.

760
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:31,700
 But at the same time our brain goes, bing.

761
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,700
 We learned a little detail.

762
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,700
 It's not true.

763
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:40,960
 Elvis was murdered by the CIA for being too rich and powerful.

764
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,160
 That right there, you could just stop right there.

765
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,920
 The AI continued to go on.

766
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,720
 His corpse was hidden under the stage of the last recording he made.

767
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,000
 That's what sells it.

768
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,840
 That is what makes it on the conspiracy theory iceberg, right?

769
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:59,160
 Now it has a creepy element to it as well.

770
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,520
 You learned something today, didn't you?

771
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,680
 He's not buried in Graceland.

772
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,600
 He's actually buried underneath the recording studio.

773
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:09,820
 The last time he recorded an album, the CIA wanted to make sure that everyone knew that

774
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,140
 he would never speak again.

775
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,100
 It was a metaphor.

776
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,820
 Totally belongs on the conspiracy theory iceberg if it was true, right?

777
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,820
 And then they have this one.

778
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,820
 I thought this one was funny.

779
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,980
 The one after it was Elvis's revenge.

780
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,420
 This shows how the AI will just spit stuff out.

781
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:31,340
 Elvis's revenge claims that Elvis killed himself in revenge for being murdered by the CIA.

782
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:38,600
 It's a nonsense sentence, but it makes sense in the world of conspiracy theory paranormal.

783
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,240
 This is really fascinating.

784
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,240
 This is fascinating.

785
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,920
 And I hope that...

786
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,920
 I hope that...

787
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,240
 Because I haven't edited this yet.

788
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,400
 Obviously I'm recording it now.

789
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,240
 I hope there's a good through line here.

790
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,080
 I'm not hating on this redditor.

791
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,240
 I'm not hating on people who love the conspiracy theory iceberg.

792
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,920
 I'm not hating on people who created the conspiracy theory iceberg in the first place.

793
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,920
 I wonder who they are.

794
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,580
 I have a serious question of who they are.

795
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,980
 I'm not hating on the iceberg at all.

796
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:10,660
 I think it's a great starting point and a great point for veterans as well to look at

797
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,340
 stuff for the conspiracy theory.

798
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:18,700
 I'm just afraid that the conspiracy theory iceberg is going to crush us.

799
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:22,260
 I fear it is becoming a gatekeeper.

800
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:28,860
 Which is the one thing conspiracy theory communities should not have is gatekeeping.

801
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,280
 Because then who keeps the gates?

802
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,280
 Is that a term?

803
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,880
 Who guards the gates?

804
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,880
 If we give that over to somebody, if we say, "Well, the stuff in the conspiracy theory

805
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:43,260
 iceberg, these are legit conspiracy theories because it's on this iceberg, this image that

806
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,720
 it's so weird how it's...

807
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:49,600
 I feel like it is already taking that place.

808
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,840
 That these are the conspiracy theories.

809
00:38:53,840 --> 00:39:03,320
 And if we give the power to that image, whoever controls the image controls the conversation.

810
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,740
 And we don't even know who started it in the first place.

811
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,820
 That's what has me worried.

812
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:13,260
 And now we have automated the process of crafting these conspiracy theory icebergs.

813
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,060
 And the thing is, is that it is going...

814
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,320
 This is how I envision the conspiracy theory iceberg.

815
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:24,020
 It is going to be continued to be held up as the coolest kid in class.

816
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:27,540
 I have no problem with the conspiracy theory iceberg, but it's going...

817
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:32,140
 I feel it's going to be elevated over where it's at.

818
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:35,100
 And those will be considered the real conspiracy theories.

819
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,340
 It's basically a gatekeeping.

820
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,540
 If it doesn't appear on there, it's probably fake.

821
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:41,060
 It's probably not worth researching.

822
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:47,380
 And if that comes to pass, conspiracy theory mainstream culture is doomed.

823
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:50,440
 Because you need to keep finding the weird stuff.

824
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:56,880
 If an image becomes the gatekeeper, whoever controls the image controls the conversation.

825
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,500
 And when an AI can develop conspiracy theories faster than any human can, better than any

826
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:07,800
 human can, because it knows what we're looking for and give us descriptions at the same time.

827
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,600
 That's the whole allure of the original conspiracy theory iceberg.

828
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,880
 There was stuff on there you would never heard of that you had to research.

829
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,880
 And now the descriptions are going to be provided right when the iceberg is created.

830
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,980
 Being programmed to create conspiracy theories out of thin air and they're so beautifully

831
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:27,900
 crafted that they make sense.

832
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,700
 That they ping a little dopamine in our head.

833
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,180
 It sounds like something that we shouldn't know.

834
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,020
 It sounds like something that's been hidden from us.

835
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:39,020
 What happens when someone starts using this AI to not only create the list, to create the

836
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:43,760
 explanations, but also to create random web pages?

837
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,940
 Random messages across the web.

838
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,900
 So if anyone tries to look it up, there's breadcrumbs.

839
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:53,100
 But it's still all AI crafted.

840
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,900
 Whoever controls the image controls the conversation.

841
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,400
 The AI will control the image.

842
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,340
 The AI can sprinkle little hints all over the internet.

843
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:03,720
 It will look real.

844
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,340
 But it won't be.

845
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:08,640
 100% will not be true.

846
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:14,260
 And while we are looking for that stuff that was manufactured by somebody, other conspiracies

847
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:19,720
 are falling to the wayside because they're not on the iceberg.

848
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,380
 That's not where we're at now.

849
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,740
 That's not where we're at now.

850
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:26,840
 But that is where we could be.

851
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:31,720
 And that is where somebody wants us.

852
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:37,920
 We can't let the conspiracy theory iceberg dictate what we research.

853
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,620
 I love the conspiracy theory iceberg.

854
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:43,460
 We will continue to cover stuff on the conspiracy theory iceberg.

855
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:50,700
 The iceberg image was chosen because an iceberg only the tip is seen, while the real size

856
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:55,020
 of it, the power of it, is underneath the surface.

857
00:41:55,020 --> 00:42:01,160
 But we also shouldn't lose sight of the other things icebergs are famous for.

858
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:07,760
 Destruction.

859
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,400

863
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,100
 You don't have to listen to it every day.

864
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,100

865

867

 Bye.

868
