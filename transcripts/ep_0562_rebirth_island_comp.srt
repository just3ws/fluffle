1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
 A haunted footpath in Wisconsin may hold chilling secrets.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:15,000
 A true crime documentary captures the perfect moment when the horror may have become paranormal.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,880
 It was the perfect location for fishermen for hundreds of years and then eventually

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,040
 it couldn't.

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:28,280
 And then we traveled to the Soviet Union to uncover a deadly secret.

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:34,240
 We knew what was going on on Rebirth Island until all of the animals dropped dead on the

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,240
 spot.

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,880
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:47,280
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,280
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,280
 I hope you guys are having a great day too.

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,120
 We got a jam-pack episode today, so we are going to start off by giving a shout out to

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,120
 one of our legacy Patreon supporters, Reverend Samuel.

14
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:04,360
 Everyone give a round of applause to Reverend Samuel, pay him some tithe, do that as well.

15
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,160
 Reverend Samuel actually emailed me the other day, a while back, I think around the time

16
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,560
 that COVID was starting up.

17
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,160
 I had that 60 days to a better you, or maybe it was 30 days to a better you, it was one

18
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,160
 of the two.

19
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,960
 It was a period of time until a better you.

20
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,480
 And he actually, he is in a band called the Mad Cow Tippers and he shot music videos for

21
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,440
 this band, but he took that time period and he goes, you know what, I'm going to expand

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,040
 my skill set.

23
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:36,680
 And he took on the challenge of animating one of his band's music videos.

24
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,480
 It's amazing, it's absolutely amazing that he was able to do this and he was able to

25
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,920
 learn this skill.

26
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,040
 He's done illustrations, but he was like, I bought it a tatt- he said thank you, like

27
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,760
 you inspired me to go out.

28
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,600
 It's funny, he started off by saying you inspired me to go out and buy a tablet, and I'm thinking

29
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,840
 I didn't tell anyone to drop a bunch of money on a tablet.

30
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,920
 Were you trying to frame me?

31
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,080
 But anyways, he did and I'm going to put the video on the show notes, you can check it

32
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,080
 out.

33
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,800
 It's called the Corona Queen.

34
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:09,240
 It's like a, what type of song is that?

35
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,720
 It's like a, that doesn't help.

36
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,240
 It's like a folk song kind of thing, a little bit of a parody.

37
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,120
 It's a funny song and the music video looks amazing.

38
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,800
 So I want to give a shout out to the Mad Cow Tippers.

39
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,320
 He gave a shout out to Reverend Samuel.

40
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,160
 He is our Patreon supporter for this episode.

41
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,560
 He's going to be our captain, our pilot, our Corona captain.

42
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,560
 Hopefully not.

43
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,120
 Hopefully we'll put him in a biohazard suit.

44
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,560
 If you can't support the Patreon, that's fine too.

45
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,520
 Just help spread the word out about the show.

46
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,200
 Really, really helps out a lot.

47
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,760
 But Reverend Samuel, let's go ahead and get you into the front seat of that Jason Jalopy.

48
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,280
 We are headed out to Wisconsin, specifically, Stevens Point, Wisconsin.

49
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,280
 Yeah.

50
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,460
 Cars driving cross country.

51
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,000
 This is an interesting story because we have an exact geographic location.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,720
 You can visit this place, but there's little asterisks in Boston.

53
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,240
 Oh, it's not backing up yet.

54
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,440
 Don't start backing up yet.

55
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,400
 This is Stevens Point, Wisconsin.

56
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,000
 There is a trail.

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,520
 It's about 2,500 feet long, not super long.

58
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,480
 It's in between Cemetery Road and Little Chicago Road.

59
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,240
 Reverend Samuel drives us back to this area.

60
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,240
 It's the 1950s.

61
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,560
 It's back in time.

62
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,560
 Everything's sepia tone.

63
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,040
 We're walking around.

64
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,460
 We see a Boy Scout troop walking through the woods.

65
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:23,260
 The Scout Master is pointing at rocks and stuff like that.

66
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,220
 Be like, "Branches, look at this.

67
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,220
 This is a branch."

68
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,220
 What is this?

69
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,660
 This is the worst Scout Master ever.

70
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,780
 He's like, "What we are walking on is something no one has done."

71
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,260
 I don't even know what the Boy Scouts do.

72
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,060
 Don't they go out there and like make arrows and stuff like that?

73
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,820
 They're getting ready for the revolution, getting ready for the fall of man.

74
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:46,180
 Like you go and you hang out and then they go, "I want a fire badge."

75
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,760
 So you have to learn how to make a fire and then you make a fire and then you hope someone

76
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,240
 has the fire fighter badge.

77
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,440
 It's like, do you just hang out with them and you do different skills?

78
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,040
 Like I'm climbing a tree and they're like, "Jason, get down from that tree."

79
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,240
 And then I get down from the tree badge.

80
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,480
 But I don't know anything about the Boy Scouts.

81
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,680
 But I do know about this story because I actually researched this.

82
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,040
 Boy Scouts and the Scout Master are walking through the woods.

83
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,240
 The Scout Master goes, "Oh, this is a perfect place to earn our..."

84
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,400
 Scout Master's feet are tired and he wants the rest badge.

85
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,940
 And everyone's like, "Oh, not this badge again."

86
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,440
 They already have like 10 of those.

87
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,740
 Let's make camp here.

88
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,740
 So they do.

89
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,580
 They go a little bit off the trail and they make camp in the woods.

90
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:31,540
 The sun sets and they're throwing marshmallows on sticks and stuff like that, making marshmallow...

91
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,740
 What are those things called?

92
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,420
 They're called the verb.

93
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,420
 That is you.

94
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,420
 They're roasting marshmallows.

95
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,420
 I don't even...

96
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,420
 I don't think they're even called that.

97
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,220
 I just think they're called marshmallows.

98
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,340
 Anyways, anyways.

99
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,000
 Sun sets, everyone goes to sleep.

100
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,280
 And when the Scout Master wakes up the next morning, "Oh, that was a good night's sleep."

101
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,960
 He's like, "Ah, Scouts.

102
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,960
 Wake up.

103
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,320
 It's time to go walking through the woods and stuff like that."

104
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,320
 Scouts?

105
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,320
 Scouts?

106
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,320
 Scouts?

107
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,320
 His voice echoes through the woods.

108
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,960
 Scouts, where are you?

109
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,880
 Billy, Tommy, Jerry, Joe, Michael, Tito, where are you guys?

110
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,920
 Voice just is...

111
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,920
 No one's answering, I guess.

112
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,920
 I guess you get the point.

113
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,920
 No one's answering.

114
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,980
 And so he starts looking in a little tense.

115
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,980
 Everyone's gone.

116
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,980
 He's there all alone.

117
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,300
 He's like, "No, my one duty was to protect these kids."

118
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,380
 He takes down his protecting kids badge.

119
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,180
 He's like, "Ah, I don't deserve this."

120
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,220
 He spent about an hour looking for the kids, and then he called the cops, because after

121
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,700
 an hour, what are you going to do?

122
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,740
 If you don't even find one of them, you've got to get a kid, the cops involved.

123
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,700
 The cops come out and they begin searching for the kids.

124
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,140
 It becomes a big search in this area, but this story took place in the fall.

125
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,860
 I should have said that earlier, but I'm saying it now.

126
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,240
 It takes place in the fall and the Wisconsin winter is approaching.

127
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,240
 [Wheeze]

128
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,920
 The cops are like, "Listen, man, we've been looking for these kids for a couple of weeks

129
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,120
 now and it's getting real cold.

130
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,840
 I mean, unless you got some money for some nice fleece jacket, Scoutmaster, we're not

131
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,720
 going to be out there in the woods looking for these kids."

132
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,360
 So the Scoutmaster didn't have any money.

133
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,240
 The kids were never seen again.

134
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,180
 And to this day, that patch of land is known as Boy Scout Lane.

135
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,980
 And they say if you walk down this path late at night.

136
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,980
 [Heehee]

137
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,980
 What was that?

138
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,980
 [Heehee]

139
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,980
 Oh no.

140
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,980
 What?

141
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,980
 [Heehee]

142
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,980
 So it's tickling a monkey.

143
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,980
 Tickling a cartoon monkey.

144
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,980
 Those were Boy Scouts.

145
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,100
 They're supposed to be the laughter of boys.

146
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,980
 I've never heard a boy laugh in my life.

147
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:39,240
 I've never ever heard one apparently.

148
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,240
 [Heehee]

149
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:48,880
 Anyways, that's apparently the sound of Boy Scouts laughing in the darkness.

150
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,280
 This place is still haunted to this day.

151
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,680
 Now this story has been going around for quite a long time and of course people are going

152
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,680
 to look into this.

153
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,680
 It's so sensational.

154
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,680
 It's creepy.

155
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,040
 And this is really what we know now.

156
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:07,740
 There's been no reports that we can find of a group of kids disappearing in the woods.

157
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,820
 That's never been verified.

158
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,260
 You think that would be big news.

159
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:16,500
 One thing I've learned on this show, stuff you'd think would be big news, it is, but

160
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,220
 the farther back you go, the chances of being able to find newspaper articles regarding it

161
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,740
 gets a little more dicey.

162
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:27,100
 A good example of that is the episode we did recently called the one that I got, the

163
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,320
 hate strike violation, the hate speech violation on YouTube before.

164
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,320
 The lady vanishes.

165
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,320
 Again, listen to it.

166
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,520
 There's nothing in there, but YouTube's going nuts.

167
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,960
 I got a hate speech violation for that episode, but apparently I don't like the French.

168
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,960
 It was about these mother and daughter, they're in France and they disappeared.

169
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,680
 And you listen to the episode, it was a sensational story and these journalists, these people

170
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,200
 looking into this, were able to track it back to an article that everyone thought didn't

171
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,200
 exist.

172
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,600
 So sometimes, and it took them like 50 years to find this article.

173
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:01,180
 So sometimes these events happen, but it's hard to track down any knowledge of it.

174
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:06,420
 What makes me think this story is an urban legend is there's multiple versions of it.

175
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,500
 So Boy Scout Lane is the actual name of a place.

176
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,700
 And people swear up and down that it's haunted, but the origin story changes drastically.

177
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,860
 That was the version I liked the best.

178
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:22,300
 The other ones were the scouts are on a bus trip down Boy Scout Lane, but it wasn't named

179
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,300
 that at the time.

180
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,920
 It was just a lane, but it was more of a trail than anything apparently like from the photos

181
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,920
 of it.

182
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,920
 So I don't know what the bus was doing off-roading.

183
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,480
 Well, maybe this is why the bus went off-road and crashed into a tree and all the Boy Scouts

184
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,740
 burned to death on the bus.

185
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,740
 That's one version of it.

186
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,900
 That's why there's ghosts there.

187
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:42,000
 The other one is that the scout master went crazy and slaughtered all of the Boy Scouts.

188
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,160
 And then when he realized what evil he had wrought, he hung himself.

189
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,720
 I don't want to tell that story for 5-10 minutes, right?

190
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
 It's nothing entertaining about that.

191
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,720
 It's kind of grisly.

192
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,200
 That's the reason why there's those ghosts.

193
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,660
 And apparently you can sometimes look up and see the ghost of the hanging dude in the tree,

194
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,660
 but I don't know.

195
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,660
 I've never been there.

196
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,020
 I mean, that seems like a bit of a retcon, because none of the other stories have that.

197
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,380
 They're like, "Oh yeah, and I saw his ghost in the tree just to make your story more believable."

198
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:11,660
 The funniest one I thought, you're mileage may vary on how funny you think it is, is

199
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:16,300
 that the scouts at night when the scout master was asleep, the scouts go, "You know what,

200
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,380
 it'd be really keen, guys.

201
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,220
 Let's go exploring in the woods.

202
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,220
 Let's do this."

203
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:27,440
 They take this oil lantern with us, put an extra oil, and we'll all carry bags of oil

204
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,120
 on us in case we run out of oil.

205
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,400
 And they're walking through the forest with an oil lantern and one of them butterfingers

206
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:37,880
 it, straight drops it, starts a forest fire, and it surrounds them, and they all burn to

207
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,880
 death.

208
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,880
 Now you're like, "Just so that's not funny."

209
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,880
 "Just so that's horrifying.

210
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,880
 That's not funny."

211
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,280
 Well, it's kind of funny, because, okay, so maybe it's not super funny.

212
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:53,060
 I just thought the image of a Boy Scout tripping and setting the forest on fire.

213
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:59,420
 I guess it's not super funny, but I mean, out of those options, it's the funniest.

214
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,220
 The bus catching on fire, that's not funny.

215
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,220
 That's horrifying.

216
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,140
 The scout master murdering everybody.

217
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,820
 The prize, let's give a prize.

218
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,420
 We'll do this, this episode only.

219
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:12,580
 The paranormal prize goes to entire troop missing due to mysterious circumstances.

220
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,700
 Yay!

221
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:18,940
 And then runner up is them all burning to death because some kid's too clumsy and sets

222
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,940
 everyone on fire.

223
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,360
 But anyway, so that is the story.

224
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,640
 The reason why I wanted to profile this is, one, because it's an interesting story, but

225
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,000
 two, I've talked about this a lot on the show.

226
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,160
 I'm very suspicious of, this is weird, because you know how much I hate people who lie to

227
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,160
 get money.

228
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,160
 Talking about all these crazy events, they're grifters.

229
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,800
 I also have a weird suspicion of anti-grifters.

230
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,200
 If something falls into your lap, you happen to buy a house.

231
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,260
 It turns out to be a haunted murder house and everyone wants to visit it and you're

232
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:52,860
 like, "No, I want to live here with the murder ghost all by myself because I'm serial lonely.

233
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,620
 Now I finally have friends and they can never leave."

234
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,260
 And the ghosts are like, "Please, please exercise as they're like banging on the windows.

235
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,460
 Let us out, let us out."

236
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,780
 They're calling out for priests, blacking out on the street, "Hey, get rid of us."

237
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:06,380
 I find that weird that people have like stole cemeteries.

238
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:12,020
 They could turn that into a huge tourist attraction like that town, Roswell.

239
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,720
 Roswell had a whole television show based on it.

240
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,560
 Stole cemetery, they could turn the town into a tourist attraction.

241
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,960
 There was another one we did.

242
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,960
 It was something in Connecticut.

243
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:27,080
 It was the Dark Forest Society, the Dark Forest Entity or something like that.

244
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:31,760
 There was a company that bought up this section of forest that everyone thought was haunted

245
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,760
 and they don't let anyone inside of it.

246
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,840
 This is the same thing.

247
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:40,160
 Now Boy Scout Lane is private property and if you go there, it's likely you'll get arrested.

248
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,380
 If I came across property that was haunted, I would totally charge people money to go

249
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,380
 through it.

250
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:52,100
 I would probably be a fake body from a tree and hire a bunch of little kids to run around

251
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,100
 in the woods laughing.

252
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,860
 Actually, I'd probably just record their laughter and be like, "Job well done, kids."

253
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,860
 They're like, "What?

254
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,100
 How much am I going to get paid for this?"

255
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,980
 I'm like, "Yeah, you get paid in being famous in the woods."

256
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:06,020
 But anyways, I would, now I'm out in myself as a fraudster.

257
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,180
 You don't know, okay, maybe not commit fraud.

258
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,360
 But you know what I mean?

259
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,120
 I'm always surprised people aren't.

260
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,720
 It's more suspicious to me.

261
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,640
 I don't think the kids vanished or they set themselves on fire or anything like that.

262
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,720
 I think it's more suspicious that somebody bought this property and is now not letting

263
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,200
 anyone on the property.

264
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,600
 That makes me think the place is actually haunted.

265
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,320
 And it might even be more than haunted.

266
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,920
 It may be a gateway.

267
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,240
 Because why else wouldn't you want anyone else to go there?

268
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,720
 Unless maybe you're just a private person.

269
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,920
 But why would you buy a chunk of woods, a 2,500 foot path, declare it private property?

270
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,780
 That makes me more suspicious there's something else going on here.

271
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:45,540
 But suspicions aside, Reverend Samuel, fire up that dead rabbit, Durgible.

272
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,180
 We are leaving behind Wisconsin.

273
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:53,740
 We are headed out to Frederick, Colorado.

274
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,000
 Durgible's flying over the country.

275
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,580
 This story actually started with a recommendation from KillerRip987.

276
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,940
 I was doing a Patreon exclusive livestream.

277
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,100
 This was about a month ago.

278
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,080
 We were talking about a bunch of different stuff, which we normally do on the livestreams.

279
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:15,520
 And KillerRip987 said, "Have you seen the Netflix documentary, American Murder, The

280
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,840
 Family Next Door?"

281
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,840
 And I hadn't.

282
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,840
 I hadn't.

283
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,920
 I was familiar with the case it was based on, but I hadn't seen the documentary.

284
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,040
 Now this is a story and a Dead Rabbit Recommends.

285
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,360
 Dead Rabbit Recommends, You Watching American Murder, The Family Next Door.

286
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,000
 It's available on Netflix.

287
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,760
 It's a full hour and a half long documentary.

288
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,800
 There's no narrator.

289
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,380
 There's no reenactments.

290
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:45,580
 There's nothing in the documentary that is used except for footage taken.

291
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:50,420
 There's a film term for it where you only use existing film stock.

292
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:56,020
 It is a true crime story told through the eyes of Facebook videos, cop, police officer

293
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:01,580
 body cams, residential ring cameras on people's houses.

294
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:05,200
 The entire documentary is told through that type of existing footage.

295
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,800
 And it's the story of a man, his wife, and their two daughters.

296
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,800
 It's brilliant.

297
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,360
 I've never seen a documentary made like that.

298
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,760
 It's a very, very well done film.

299
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,760
 So thank you, KillerRip97.

300
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,040
 I recommend you guys watching that.

301
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,760
 But what's interesting is there's a scene in the movie.

302
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,920
 So it's all existing footage.

303
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,880
 It all was made by people on the ground.

304
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,300
 Not like camera crews, like footage being taken by police officer body cams.

305
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,980
 You can't create moments like this.

306
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,780
 There's a moment in the documentary very, very early on when his wife and his daughters

307
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,420
 are first declared missing.

308
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:48,260
 And they go, the police officer shows up with his body cam.

309
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,820
 And they go and they talk to Chris Watts, which is the husband.

310
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:56,940
 And they go to his neighbor's house, who has a security camera set up outside his house.

311
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,940
 They go to the neighbor.

312
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,520
 They go, your camera faces my house.

313
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,700
 And he's like, yeah, we've been having break-ins.

314
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,120
 So my camera actually is set up this way.

315
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,080
 Now he has his remote control.

316
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,240
 They're watching television.

317
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:13,920
 He's getting ready to switch the television over to the camera channel, right?

318
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,720
 The personal surveillance channel.

319
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,880
 He's basically changing channels from what he was watching on television to the replay

320
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,980
 of the previous night's event.

321
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,660
 Then Chris Watts was the father.

322
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,360
 When Chris Watts' wife and daughters went missing, the cops like, can we see that footage?

323
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,480
 And he's like, yeah, sure.

324
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:38,560
 And as the channel is changing, a commercial comes up for American Horror Story Apocalypse.

325
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,400
 We're from the point of view of the police officer.

326
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,200
 He's standing in this guy's living room.

327
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,440
 So you have the neighbor.

328
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,360
 You have Chris Watts standing next to this big screen television set.

329
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,720
 And the neighbor's getting ready to change the channel.

330
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,520
 The American Horror Story Apocalypse ad starts off.

331
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:58,820
 And one of the images shows a fetus inside an hourglass.

332
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,020
 And Chris Watts looks at the television.

333
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,700
 He's waiting for it to change to the surveillance video.

334
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,700
 He looks at the television.

335
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:10,300
 Then he looks up at the officer and goes, my wife is pregnant, by the way.

336
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,580
 18 weeks.

337
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,620
 The cop is just kind of silent for a second.

338
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,020
 No, the neighbor didn't know she was pregnant.

339
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,300
 Cop didn't know.

340
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,320
 And the ad continues to play.

341
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,440
 And this is a bit of a spoiler for the movie.

342
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,760
 So if you don't want to be spoiled, skip ahead a minute or two.

343
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,240
 The ad continues to play.

344
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,640
 And you can watch the ad as well.

345
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,680
 We'll have it in the show notes.

346
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,400
 You see a woman laying in a pit.

347
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:43,960
 And then oil covers her skin and dissolves everything, showing nothing but a skull.

348
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:49,240
 And then these hands come out of the oil and pulls the skull into the ground.

349
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:56,300
 And then the video clicks over to the ring video showing the street the night before.

350
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,620
 American Horror Story Apocalypse is about the end of the world.

351
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,740
 So in American Horror Story, it tends to have these weird visuals in their ads and things

352
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,740
 like that.

353
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:12,700
 It was perfect timing that this ad was playing during this investigation.

354
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:18,180
 What ended up happening is Chris Watts--we only have his version of the story.

355
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:25,240
 Chris Watts said that he suffocated his wife and then went into his children's bedrooms.

356
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,480
 They were like eight and six or something like that.

357
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,440
 And took the girls out of the bedrooms and say, "We need to go for a drive."

358
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,940
 And the girls were obviously saying, "What's wrong with mommy?"

359
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,740
 And he's like, "Mommy's just sleeping.

360
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,240
 Mommy's just sleeping."

361
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:44,920
 Mommy is tucked in underneath the seat of the vehicle, like the SUV.

362
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:51,860
 And he takes his two children and his wife out to his job site, a remote oil facility.

363
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,580
 It was these giant oil reservoirs.

364
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,500
 That's where he worked out in the middle of Colorado.

365
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,540
 He's giant tanks of oil.

366
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,660
 When he gets out there, he goes to the back seat.

367
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,540
 He has a blanket.

368
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,660
 He puts it over the head of one of the girls and suffocates her.

369
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,100
 And then he does the same thing to the other girl.

370
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,820
 He's now murdered his entire family.

371
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:16,720
 He buries his wife and he takes his two daughters up to the top of the reservoir.

372
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:23,840
 And there's a little hole at the top and he pushes their bodies into the oily darkness

373
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,880
 and closes the reservoir.

374
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,440
 Tragic story, obviously.

375
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,440
 He was found guilty.

376
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,320
 He's in prison for the rest of his life.

377
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,280
 But that ad told that story.

378
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:42,540
 And it's interesting, the visual of the fetus appearing on screen is what provoked him to

379
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,900
 say my wife is pregnant, by the way.

380
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,940
 The detail that wasn't revealed to any of the friends and family.

381
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:54,220
 That was a really, really bizarre moment for this documentary.

382
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,460
 So give it a shot.

383
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,580
 Watch American Murder, The Family and Next Star.

384
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,220
 I mean, even when knowing the-- I knew the Indian.

385
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,020
 I'd read the articles when this was all going on.

386
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,220
 But as far as like just a film.

387
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,280
 It's very, very well made.

388
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,280
 And then check for that moment.

389
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,760
 I want to give a shout out too.

390
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:15,080
 There was a Reddit-- when I was watching the documentary, that stuck out to me, that scene.

391
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,960
 But then Reddit user debar10 clipped it, put it on Reddit.

392
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,800
 So if you just want to watch that scene, it's going to be in the show notes.

393
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,640
 But Reverend Samuel, let's leave behind Colorado.

394
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,000
 Call in that carpenter copter.

395
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 We are headed out to the Soviet Union.

396
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,160
 Helicopter is flying out there.

397
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,740
 This was actually a request from Igor Lukian on YouTube.

398
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,820
 So thank you very much for sending this.

399
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,620
 It was a really interesting story.

400
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:46,740
 And I got most, if not all of this information from Zarya Gorvid.

401
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,700
 She's a journalist and she wrote this article for Reuters.

402
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,500
 So amazing job on this.

403
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,820
 Reverend Samuel, you see that little island sitting there in the Aral Sea?

404
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,820
 That is Vosrozodinia Island.

405
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,820
 Right?

406
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,820
 You're Reverend Samuel shaking his head.

407
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,320
 It's like, that's not how you pronounce it.

408
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,320
 I'm like, I don't know.

409
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,320
 We don't know.

410
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,960
 But it might not.

411
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,760
 But it's known as Rebirth Island.

412
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,740
 Or it used to be known as Rebirth Island.

413
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,040
 It doesn't exist anymore.

414
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:21,700
 But we're back in the year 1948 and we see a bunch of Soviet troops bringing barges

415
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,800
 onto the island.

416
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:27,120
 They said, you know what, this is the perfect place to set up our bio weapons laboratory.

417
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,060
 Because it's nowhere near anywhere important in the Soviet Union.

418
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,980
 We just recently discovered it.

419
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,180
 Is this island in the middle of the Aral Sea?

420
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,820
 It didn't even appear on maps in the Soviet Union.

421
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:42,860
 They had discovered it like a hundred years before 1948.

422
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,860
 Very very recent find.

423
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,940
 So they go, if we just found it then we know the United States doesn't have anything on

424
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,940
 it.

425
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,060
 And if anything does go wrong, I mean like whatever, it's not going to help the wildlife

426
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,060
 here.

427
00:20:54,060 --> 00:21:02,480
 They set this place up and they start going to town.

428
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,480
 Not literally.

429
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,120
 They're like hey take this to town.

430
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,520
 It's like no no no, it's just a figure of speech.

431
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,640
 Anthrax, Smallpox, Black Plague, all of the hits, all of the classics.

432
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:16,760
 They are trying to create stores of weapons, of bio weapons on this island.

433
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,760
 But that's not all.

434
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,000
 They also want to make these weapons as lethal as possible.

435
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,380
 The whole complex ended up being called Arlsk 7.

436
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:29,580
 It was one of the most secure compounds in the Soviet Union.

437
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,700
 Nothing could get in, nothing could get out.

438
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,140
 You needed to take a boat or a plane, which made it actually perfect so you couldn't worry

439
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:40,020
 about someone accidentally, you know, like butterfingering a can of black plague.

440
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,580
 They hire some Boy Scouts to work over there.

441
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,580
 Whoops.

442
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,580
 You didn't have to worry about that.

443
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:49,940
 And if it did happen, well I mean tough nuggets to that dude, but you don't have to worry about

444
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:53,080
 him taking a train and stalling grad or something like that.

445
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,000
 But people did fish in that area.

446
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,520
 It's the fourth largest sea in the world.

447
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,560
 So you had a bunch of fishermen, you had a bunch of fish.

448
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:07,720
 In 1971, there was a young scientist on a boat headed towards Arlsk 7.

449
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,720
 She's on the, it's a normal crew, it's a normal day.

450
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:17,400
 But a brown haze appears to be floating over the water.

451
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:22,220
 She's like, that's not on the map, right?

452
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,420
 The boat goes through the haze.

453
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:27,620
 Cause I don't think they had a chance to turn around.

454
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,780
 I don't think they were like, well let's find out what that is.

455
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,220
 We're only near a massive bio weapon facility.

456
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,220
 She was headed there.

457
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,620
 She knew what it was capable of.

458
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:41,460
 She actually had already been vaccinated against weaponized smallpox.

459
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,780
 Now just regular smallpox.

460
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,500
 She wasn't just rubbing up against cows and had boils on them.

461
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:52,600
 This was smallpox that was designed to be used to kill humans.

462
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,800
 Even though she had the vaccine, she still got it.

463
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,320
 She still came down with this smallpox.

464
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,400
 She ended up taking it back to her hometown.

465
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,120
 She's probably like, I don't feel good.

466
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,680
 I'm gonna go and sink the work today.

467
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,080
 I gotta go back home.

468
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,540
 Three people in her hometown died.

469
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,560
 She survived, but she spread it.

470
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:16,040
 In 1972, fishermen in the area see a fishing boat out in the middle of nowhere.

471
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,040
 Going over the waves.

472
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,660
 I don't see anyone fishing.

473
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,820
 So is it a fishing boat?

474
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,820
 Is it a fishing boat if no one's fishing from it?

475
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,500
 That's a philosophical question.

476
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:28,020
 They find on this fishing boat two dead bodies.

477
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,540
 Both died of the black plague.

478
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:38,020
 That same year, fishermen all over the area are pulling up nets of nothing but dead fish.

479
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,300
 1988.

480
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:45,420
 Within one hour, 50,000 antelope dropped dead.

481
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,280
 They weren't on the island.

482
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:53,400
 But I mean, I don't think anyone was like, oh, they might have all just seen a scary movie.

483
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,960
 Even though they weren't located on the island, the idea was something got off the island.

484
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,680
 This island, nothing was supposed to leave from.

485
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,500
 50,000 antelope dropped dead within an hour.

486
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:11,120
 That same year, in another part of the Soviet Union, a massive anthrax leak.

487
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,600
 This wasn't, they didn't have everything stored on this island.

488
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,700
 People put all your bio weapons in one basket.

489
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,180
 They were working on another part of the Soviet Union.

490
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,180
 Anthrax leaked out.

491
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,060
 105 people killed like that.

492
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:25,340
 Now it could have been worse, it could have been 50,000, but still, that's a lot of people.

493
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,620
 The Soviet Union is like, oh, great.

494
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,020
 Anthrax is actually one of the hardest things to kill.

495
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,300
 And they've weaponized it.

496
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,620
 I keep using the word weaponized.

497
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:38,540
 What they did with anthrax is they actually made it smaller, so it's easier to breathe

498
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,540
 in.

499
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:44,640
 And a lot of times, good old fashioned anthrax, your grandpa's anthrax, will get stuck in

500
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,560
 your nose hairs, get stuck in your sinus cavities and stuff like that.

501
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,200
 It won't get into the lungs, where it belongs.

502
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,780
 So they actually made it.

503
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,900
 They actually weaponized anthrax by making it smaller.

504
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,800
 So when you breathe it in, it's going in you, it will kill you.

505
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,000
 It doesn't clump up.

506
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,320
 Anthrax also normally just makes you hemorrhage, which when I say just makes you hemorrhage

507
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,280
 is saying, oh, he just got hit by a train.

508
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,480
 Hemorrhaging is pretty bad.

509
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,740
 They made this stuff as small as a human hair, so it could fly right into your nose.

510
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:17,780
 Not only would it cause you to hemorrhage, it would cause your flesh to rot as well.

511
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:23,340
 So even if they could somehow stop the bleeding, you basically turned it into a zombie anyways.

512
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,660
 That's what it means by weaponizing it.

513
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,420
 It wasn't like they just put it in a bullet and shot it at you.

514
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,460
 They were actually making it easier.

515
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:35,460
 They were jumping 10,000 years ahead in evolution, trying to create the most perfect deadly disease.

516
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,500
 But what happened was they had this leak in another part of Soviet Union.

517
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:41,680
 It's really, really hard to kill anthrax.

518
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,820
 You just can't grab some Clorox wipes.

519
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,360
 So they go, what are we going to do with all this anthrax we've created in this laboratory

520
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,720
 on the other side of the Soviet Union?

521
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,600
 And someone goes, I know where we can put it.

522
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,320
 Let's take it to Verostadena Island.

523
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,800
 And they're like, where is that?

524
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,240
 And he goes, let me just point out it on the map.

525
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,240
 Rebirth Island.

526
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,240
 They're like there.

527
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:08,140
 They have one to 200 tons of anthrax and they're digging trenches on the island and they're

528
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:12,020
 pouring anthrax in with bleach.

529
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,020
 That's what they're using, even though that doesn't work at all.

530
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,540
 They're pouring anthrax in, they're pouring just a little bit of bleach.

531
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:21,940
 I don't know if they had 100 to 200 tons of bleach, but, and then they bury it.

532
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:27,260
 These pits that they were digging to bury this stuff in, they were so large.

533
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,140
 These pits were so huge.

534
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,860
 It wasn't like they just dug straight down like Minecraft.

535
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,520
 Like one to 200 tons is a lot of stuff.

536
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,000
 They were so huge.

537
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,600
 You had people in the United States watching spy satellites?

538
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,600
 No joke.

539
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,680
 They saw these giant trenches and they're like, oh great, what are they doing?

540
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,800
 And then they see all these trucks come in and they're like, uh, and they're watching

541
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,480
 them pour in all this liquid and then they see the bleach show up and they're like, Mr.

542
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,680
 President, I think we have a problem.

543
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:58,680
 United States actually called up the Soviet Union and said, hey guys, we saw what you

544
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,000
 did last summer.

545
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,180
 We will give you money to help you properly dispose of this because this is such a bad

546
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,180
 idea.

547
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:11,260
 Like I know we're in a cold war and sometimes it's a hot war.

548
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:14,820
 We're currently fighting all over the Middle East and in South America.

549
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:18,500
 But let us help you out with this guys.

550
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,640
 And Soviet Union was like, yeah, we probably do need a little help with 100 to 200 tons

551
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,020
 of weaponized anthrax.

552
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:29,420
 So now it's your 1991 and we're walking around Arlesk 7.

553
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,420
 It's a ghost town.

554
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,640
 It was a literal town.

555
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,240
 Like you had all your scientists living there and their families, the kids are out playing

556
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,240
 with balls.

557
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,240
 They're knocking over beakers.

558
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,000
 They're like, Billy, no, you've doomed us all.

559
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,360
 You had kids out there playing football and stuff like that.

560
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,040
 It was a town on this island that also had this bio weapons facility.

561
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,520
 And then like off the, oh you know, about a mile outside of town, you had these giant

562
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,640
 pits of anthrax.

563
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,120
 They were able to dig up a bunch of it.

564
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,160
 They were able to destroy more of it.

565
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,200
 But again, I wouldn't plan a summer vacation there.

566
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,040
 But again, the island doesn't exist.

567
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,040
 The island doesn't exist anymore.

568
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,780
 Soil was completely contaminated.

569
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,780
 It's the year 1991.

570
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,020
 The Cold War is winding down.

571
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:09,220
 And so the Soviet Union is just like, uh, you guys can just leave.

572
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,220
 And they're like, what?

573
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,540
 And they're like, just leave.

574
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,540
 Just leave now.

575
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,780
 We, everyone leave now.

576
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:17,820
 I don't actually know why they bounced, but the whole town left.

577
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,700
 Maybe they all went to Boy Scout Lane.

578
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,780
 There was just a scout master there to this day.

579
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,940
 They were basically just let go.

580
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,700
 They're all ordered to leave.

581
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,020
 And they just left all the biological weapons there.

582
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:33,760
 Now I'm sure they took one or two really good ones as insurance.

583
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,920
 The boss is like, fire me, will you?

584
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,520
 Take this, govachov.

585
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,000
 I'm sure that the Soviet military kept some of the more sugar ones, but you can go there

586
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,240
 to- you can literally go there today.

587
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,960
 I keep saying the island doesn't exist anymore.

588
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,240
 I'll get to that in a second.

589
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:53,160
 You can charter a boat there today, walk around in a full hazmat suit, and pick up bottles

590
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,160
 and stuff like that.

591
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,160
 I don't recommend it.

592
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,160
 I don't recommend it.

593
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,360
 The journalist went on one of these trips and they were like smugglers there and they

594
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,980
 were stealing steel, coppering copper, doing all that stuff.

595
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,820
 But there's biological agents still there.

596
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,540
 It's actually also a level on call of duty.

597
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:13,500
 So if you guys recognized when I pronounced that name expertly right away, you can be

598
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,820
 like, oh yeah, dude, I got so many headshots on that level.

599
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:20,140
 Yeah, it's actually a real place that was creating weapons that'll kill everybody.

600
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,700
 But the soil's contaminated.

601
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,980
 There's a bunch of biological contaminants in jars there as well.

602
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,760
 You just imagine a few of them broken by squirrels, mutated squirrels over the years.

603
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,760
 You can visit it.

604
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,200
 But I keep saying the island doesn't exist anymore because it doesn't.

605
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,400
 It's a peninsula now.

606
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:42,120
 The sea has dried up so much in that area that you can literally walk to an island that

607
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,600
 was chosen because it's hard to get to.

608
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:53,560
 You can walk across the dirt to this place where mankind tried to create the perfect

609
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,180
 weapon and succeed it.

610
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:59,460
 You always gotta think about these time bombs out there.

611
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:04,780
 You have a government create something so toxic it could kill 50,000 antelope in an

612
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,020
 hour that just dropped dead.

613
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,300
 You know that's sitting in a laboratory somewhere.

614
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,620
 And sure, the United States has biological weapons.

615
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,860
 All nations have these.

616
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,540
 Not me, not all of them.

617
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:22,460
 I don't think that Antigua is sitting on a supply of weaponized smallpox, but this

618
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,580
 is something that militaries do.

619
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,920
 And we know that as rational people.

620
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,300
 We may not agree with it, but we know that it exists.

621
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:35,340
 However, we hope that they're responsible in the production of them and the use of them.

622
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:40,340
 But when you have these bioweapon labs that just are abandoned and become part of nature

623
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:47,660
 that were chosen for their remoteness now easily accessible, that's terrifying.

624
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:51,600
 I'm not really worried about humans going there and trying to steal the weapons.

625
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,740
 Like Alcada or Isis or anything like that trying to get these biological weapons.

626
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,660
 I'm not really concerned about that.

627
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:00,540
 It's easier for them to- I'm concerned about them having those weapons, but it's just

628
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,620
 as easy for them to buy them.

629
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:06,660
 I'm more worried about the natural world reclaiming that island and dispensing these

630
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,660
 toxins.

631
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:14,420
 An oak tree growing up in the middle of a laboratory, knocking vials left and right.

632
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:19,940
 A curious rodent grabbing a test tube, taking it back to the mainland.

633
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:24,680
 A bird looking for prey carries something shiny away.

634
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,040
 That's my concern.

635
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,560
 Because when you mess around with the natural world, a lot of times the natural world pushes

636
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,560
 back.

637
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:37,920
 It's not sentient, but just through fate and time and accident and synchronicity, things

638
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,360
 happen.

639
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,960
 One day it could be 50,000 antelope killed.

640
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:49,760
 Tomorrow it could be 100,000 mammals dead in a 50 kilometer radius.

641
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,980
 Five weeks later, the numbers double they triple.

642
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:59,940
 We've seen with this COVID crisis that it doesn't take much to push humanity to the

643
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,100
 brink.

644
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:07,420
 And that was a respiratory disease that targets people with underlying conditions.

645
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:15,220
 What was worked on this island, now Peninsula, was created to kill mankind.

646
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:20,760
 If you thought the lockdowns were rough, things could get a thousand times worse any day that

647
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:38,800
 a curious animal decides to carry a virus off of Rebirth Island.

648
00:32:38,800 --> 00:33:04,260
 Dead Rabbit Radio is the daily paranormal conspiracy and true crime podcast.
