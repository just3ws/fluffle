1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 As Russian special forces move through Ukraine, we find out what their true targets are.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Hillary Clinton's Adrenochrome factories.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 And then we travel to China to meet a scientist who one day accidentally swallowed a germ.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 But this wasn't any normal germ. It was a germ that turned him into a bloodthirsty vampire.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 [Music]

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too. I hope you guys had a great weekend.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 We got a ton of stuff to cover so don't swallow any germs yet.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 First off, let's go ahead and welcome in one of our Thanksgiving live stream contributors.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Everyone give it up for Yong Hemlock.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Give him a big round of applause as he's summer salting into Dead Rabbit Command.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Yong Hemlock, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 If you guys can't support the show financially, I totally understand.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Just help spread the word about the show. Tell your friends, tell your family, tell your enemies.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 As you're crushing them beneath your heel, listen to Dead Rabbit Radio.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Don't kill them because otherwise they won't listen to it.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 But those are also great ways to help the show grow.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Now Yong Hemlock, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jet.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 We're going to leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 And we are flying on out to the very subject that no one wants to hear about.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 But some crazy things are going on.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Yong Hemlock, take us all the way out to Ukraine.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 The reason why we're flying out to Ukraine is right now,

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 we haven't picked up a newspaper in the past couple weeks, Russia has invaded Ukraine.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 They've been there for a couple of weeks, they invaded on Christian's birthday.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 The weirdest of all.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 You know what the thing is, is like originally I said, because we didn't cover the election, we don't do politics.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 We really didn't cover COVID either.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Like early on I said, you know what, people hear about this all the time.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 The last thing they want to do is turn on a conspiracy theory podcast and hear about COVID.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 So we never really touched that issue, right?

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Every show often.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 And I was planning on taking the same tact and probably going forward, Will, with the war in Ukraine.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Because you hear about it all the time, it's all over your Facebook feed, it's all over the news.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 You want a place to get away from it.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 However, I can't turn weird stuff like this down, man.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 This stuff is just showing up on the internet.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 I can't turn it down.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 I actually saw a Skitso van.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 I saw a photo of a Skitso van.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Those are those vans with all the paintings on it.

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Not like the cool barbarian slaying the dragon and holding the busty winch.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 No, it's like stuff on the side of the van that says Stephen King killed John Lennon and stuff like that.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 I saw a Skitso van about the war in Ukraine.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 And it said, "Spetsnaz freeze captured kids."

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 I was like, "What?"

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 I'm not gonna understand what those words mean individually.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 But what in the world Spetsnaz is Russia's special forces.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 And I saw that on the side of the car.

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 No context.

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 No context.

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 And I was like, "Hmm, I wonder if that'll pop up on my radar?"

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 And it did because I look up conspiracy theories all the time.

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 This is apparently what is truly going on.

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 The lame stream media won't tell you about this.

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Spetsnaz, which is Russian special forces, are currently moving through the country of Ukraine.

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 And this has nothing to do with geopolitics.

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 This has nothing to do with the expansion of Russia.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 No. You fool. You fool for paying attention to current events.

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Nothing. None of that. None of that.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 What the real scoop is, is that Vladimir Putin was pacing around in his palace, his building, his house.

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 I don't know where he lives.

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 He's walking around and he goes, "What are we gonna do about all those Adrenochrome processing factories in Ukraine?"

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 And he's been fretting over this for years, right?

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 He scratches his head. He wakes up every night sweaty.

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Only if I could destroy those Adrenochrome factories.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 But how?

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 I don't know. I'll commit my entire military to going in.

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 And this whole war is about shutting down Adrenochrome factories.

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Now, if you don't understand what Adrenochrome is, it is this chemical that apparently you remove from the base of the skull of a terrified child,

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 and then you inject it into your eyeball, your eyeball, and then you get high or something.

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Here's the thing with the Adrenochrome mythology.

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 It doesn't make much sense, but you take the Adrenochrome as a real chemical and it's like decaying adrenaline and you inject it,

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 and you either live forever or you get super high.

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 It's addictive. It's the reason why Hillary Clinton's always walking around looking like a zombie most of the time,

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 because she's addicted to Adrenochrome, not because she's a 70-year-old woman.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 And what's so weird about it? It was always set up as you would take a child, you would scare him.

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Apparently, Halloween's the best time to get this Adrenochrome.

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 You would scare a child and then you would suck out their Adrenochrome with a needle and then you would turn it into this drug, right?

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Or you would just inject it straight into your own eyeball or whatever.

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Apparently, there's always been a step missing.

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 It's not just child, it's not just terrified child, hypodermic needle, your eyeball.

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 It's terrified child, massive industrial Adrenochrome processing plant.

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 This was never part of the mythology.

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 I mean, this was never part of the totally true stuff.

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 That you need these giant processing plants that have like, pfft, just like smoke towers and like armed guards, I'm assuming.

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 If you were kidnapping kids and taking them to the factory, I think you'd want it to be fairly secured.

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Also, do you have to follow OSHA requirements when you're at a factory that has terrified children?

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 How does this work? Like, are the kids hooked up to these giant pumps?

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Is it a fun factory? Maybe there's like a balloon house in the middle of it.

93
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 I don't know. You can't keep a kid terrified 24 hours a day.

94
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Eventually, he'll get used to it.

95
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 So maybe they just terrify them a bit and drain them and then they get into the bouncy house after the kids have been scared to death.

96
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 They're like, "Here you go!" You're bouncing around, then you go in the ball pit and then some guards like, "Nope, stop, I'm scaring you again. Come on, kids."

97
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 What a horrible existence for these poor fictional children.

98
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 So anyways, that's the Adrenochrome mythology. Now they have these giant industrial plants.

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Apparently, these plants are all over the eastern...

100
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Apparently, just out of coincidence, all of these plants are located on the border of Ukraine and Russia.

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 And every tactical part that Russia needs to invade is an Adrenochrome plant. Who would have thought that?

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 So Russia is pouring their troops in and sending their special forces into Ukraine,

103
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 not to take it over, not to set up another public government or whatever.

104
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 No, it's to destroy Hillary Clinton's Adrenochrome factories.

105
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 So that's where we're at right now with the mythology.

106
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 Vladimir Putin, Adrenochrome factories, that's the reason behind the war.

107
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 In all this information we're getting from the very reputable website,

108
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 the best website named after a 1990s horror movie, Dark Outposts.

109
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 DarkOutposts.com is always keeping us abreast of all of these disturbing allegations.

110
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Apparently, Spetsnaz, Russian special forces, are moving ahead of the advancing army,

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 and they're taking out these processing plants.

112
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 So far, they've rescued 100 children. They've rescued 100 children. They're in these basements under...

113
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 There's no ball pit. They didn't mention a ball pit or a bouncy house.

114
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 The special forces are going in and they're rescuing these kids.

115
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 But see, there's a bit of a conundrum going on.

116
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 Because you're rescuing these kids and some of them are from Estonia, some of them are from Russia,

117
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 some of them are from Ukraine. They're just visiting. They just can walk back home.

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 After the torture, they're like, "See you tomorrow!"

119
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 But there's a bunch of American kids down there.

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 There's a bunch of American kids who are kidnapped and Vladimir Putin's like,

121
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 "Oh no, what am I going to do with all of these American kids?"

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 So Vladimir Putin called up President Donald Trump,

123
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 who according to this storyline is still the president.

124
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Joe Biden's like a hologram.

125
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Or I think they kind of established that he's a hologram or a clone in this version of events that is published every day.

126
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 This guy, think about it, a dude as ridiculous as all this sounds, a man painted this on his van.

127
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 We can look at this and go, "That's really weird."

128
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 And kind of crass that people are taking this current war zone and turning it into conspiracy theory.

129
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Who would believe this? A guy does. At least one guy does.

130
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Because he painted his van like that.

131
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 Again, I thought he was just a single lunatic.

132
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 DarkOutpost.com has a huge reach. This is a really big website in this community.

133
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 So they believe that Joe Biden, President Joe Biden, is a hologram or a giant.

134
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 Or a giant hologram or clone. I'm not really for sure on that.

135
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 Vladimir Putin calls up President Trump in Florida, which is where the real White House is, the non-holographic one.

136
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 And he goes, "Hey Trump, I have all of these American kids and I don't know what to do with them.

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Because if I send them back to America, Joe Biden is going to get them."

138
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 So can you ensure that you can take these kids?

139
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 And President Trump, to his credit, says, "Yes, if you want to send over a bunch of fictional children, I will take care of them."

140
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Because Putin, I know that you're really waging this whole war just to take out these Adrenochrome factories

141
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 that were built by Hillary Clinton back during whenever mythical time that Hillary Clinton had enough power to do that.

142
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 That's where we're at right now. If you've ever been concerned about fictional American children getting back home, fret no longer.

143
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Because they are currently headed out to Florida, I guess. I don't know.

144
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 At a certain point, the mythology kind of breaks down.

145
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Because if Joe Biden's just a hologram, then why would you care if he got the kids?

146
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 What's a hologram going to do to a bunch of kids? So he's still real, I guess?

147
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Anyways, I always wonder if these people read their own information.

148
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Because so much of it stops making sense.

149
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Technically, this one never made sense, right?

150
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 I don't know why you all of a sudden have to have these huge industrial factories.

151
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 It kind of takes away from that this is a secret drug only used by the elite.

152
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 If they need a city block, if they need an entire city block to have this factory processing this stuff.

153
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 Because people are working there, right? People are going in for job interviews and they're like,

154
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 "Yeah, I really want to work in this factory. What do you do?"

155
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 And the guy's like, "Don't you ask that question, you're not getting on the job."

156
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 And then you're working in the factory and you just see these huge vats of red dust being processed.

157
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 And you're like, "Huh, I wonder what all of that stuff is."

158
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 And then you see a bunch of little kids walking into a room and you're like, "Uh, I don't know. I really don't know what's going on here."

159
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 But all have to know. You don't ever work at a Ford factory and go,

160
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 "Do we make cars or do we make toys or do we make lollipops?"

161
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 Like, you know what you're making.

162
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Young Hemlock, let's go ahead and attach the keys to the carbonar copter.

163
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 We're going to leave behind the darkout post. We're headed all the way out to Shanghai, China.

164
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 [imitates car engine]

165
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 I want to say up front, I got most of my information from a website called PandaYo.

166
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 That's so ridiculous. I don't know why that's any more ridiculous than Dead Wrap Radio.

167
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 I got most of my, or really all my information from a website called PandaYo.com

168
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 and there's article written by Jeffrey W.

169
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 So thanks, Jeff. This is a really, really entertaining story.

170
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 We're in Shanghai, China. We're walking down the street.

171
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 It's the fall of 1995 and we're just kind of grooving there.

172
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 We're sitting out on a bench now outside of a Chinese laboratory.

173
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 We're eating some popcorn and we're just waiting for the fireworks.

174
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 We're waiting for this laboratory story to get started.

175
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 I guess we should probably be in the laboratory. I don't know why we are narratively sitting outside.

176
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Because inside the laboratory, there is a scientist going by the last name of Ling.

177
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 No first name given, but his last name is Ling. We're going to call him Joe.

178
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 So Joe is walking around the laboratory in Shanghai and he's looking at all the experiments going on.

179
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 He looks at a beaker and he's like, "Exactly what I expected. Fluid and a beaker. Good job, Mark and Mark Nodds."

180
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Then he walks to the next laboratory and there's a robot arm picking up a ping-pong ball.

181
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 He's like, "Alright, dude. Great on that AI." The robot gives him a thumbs up.

182
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 He's like, "Yeah, this is the best place to work."

183
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 As he's walking through this laboratory, he's like, "You know, I really enjoy working in this unnamed laboratory in Shanghai."

184
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 But my favorite thing I love to do is to go into my own laboratory.

185
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 I don't even know why he's doing the tour. That's more for us than for him.

186
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 He goes into the tour and there's a bunch of beakers sitting there and he's like, "Just show your clear. This is what I imagine a laboratory or a science lab looks like."

187
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 There's just beakers everywhere. He walks in and all these beakers have different colors on them.

188
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 There's a microscope with a little slide and stuff like that. He's like, "Oh, yeah, I'm at home in my laboratory. What a good place to be."

189
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 And as he's talking, he doesn't realize that a germ is flying around.

190
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 This is so ridiculous. I've spent more time building this up.

191
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 Here's the start of the story, okay? This guy named Ling accidentally swallows a germ at a laboratory.

192
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 So I don't know if they had really lacked security. I don't know if one germ can do this, but he swallows a germ in a laboratory.

193
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 He actually feels the germ go down his throat and something starts going wrong with him.

194
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 He does quickly realize this one germ is more than just the average germ.

195
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 He's thirsty all of a sudden. Oh, man. So thirsty.

196
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Maybe that germ has something to do with this.

197
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 So he goes and he's like drinking water. But he's still thirsty.

198
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 He can't really figure it out. So then he goes to the company vending machine and gets some of that Chinese milk that I saw in Transformers Movie.

199
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Still not quenching his thirst.

200
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 And then as he's looking for maybe like a Pepsi or Coca-Cola, he's walking past a room and he sees a scientist holding up a blood bag.

201
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 And they're pouring it down the sink or something like that. And he goes, "Oh, that's what I'm thirsty for. I'm thirsty for blood."

202
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 But, you know, it's kind of hard to drink human blood. If you guys have never tried it, it's difficult.

203
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 But luckily he works at a research laboratory and they have tons of human blood around.

204
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 So one night he goes in there and he uses his key carton and he goes into where they store all the blood and he starts drinking the blood out of the bags.

205
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 Mmm, this is so good. This is what really quenched my thirst. It wasn't a Pepsi. It wasn't a Coke.

206
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 It was human plasma that I needed. And he begins doing that. Every night he goes into the laboratory.

207
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 He pretends to do regular science stuff. He's like, "Hey, I need this blood." They're like, "Oh, I thought you were a germ scientist."

208
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 He's like, "Yeah, I want to see what happens if you put blood on a germ." Just quit asking questions and give me that blood.

209
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 He begins drinking the human blood. He begins demanding it for more scientific experiments.

210
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 And then he runs out because they didn't have that much blood, right? So then he goes, "Oh, man, I really need to drink more blood. What other things in this laboratory can I drink?"

211
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 So he's like looking at scientists and he's like, "Oh, no, that scientist could probably beat me up."

212
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 And then he looks at another scientist and he goes, "Oh, I don't know. She looks kind of squirrely. She might be able to scratch my eyes out or something like that."

213
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 But then as he's walking through the laboratory, apparently there's like a rat place where they have all of these rats, which is why it's called a rat place.

214
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 And at night he begins breaking in and killing the rats, ripping them open with his teeth and squeezing them in like a gogurt, drinking all that blood up.

215
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 But again, this laboratory only has a fixed amount of rats. You can imagine the scientist. He's like, "Oh, no, I have a big experiment due today. I don't want to get fired."

216
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 And then he goes in and all the rats are gone. He's like, "Oh, no. Oh, no, what did I procrastinate? Why did I wait until the last day to do my science?

217
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 I'm totally going to lose my job." All the rats are gone. All the human blood is gone. Nobody's suspecting anything weird at this point.

218
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Right? You would probably start to figure, wait a second. Everything in this laboratory that has blood in it is gone, but it must not be something.

219
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 We haven't done an inventory of all of our germs. Maybe a germ's missing. We don't know.

220
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 But Joe Ling is still walking around drinking all this blood, but now he's out of rat blood. He's out of human blood. So he starts to go insane.

221
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 The argument could be made. He went insane the second he started drinking human blood. But now he's truly going insane.

222
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 So at night, instead of breaking the laboratory and drinking blood, he's walking through the streets of Shanghai and attacking women.

223
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Clip, clip, clip, clip, clip, clip. High heels making the sound against a cobblestone street. Apparently there's streets in Shanghai, China, like the 1800s of England.

224
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 Click, click, click, click. And then behind them, ugh, ugh, ugh. And the women turn around in the darkness and go, "What was that?"

225
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 And then they see a scientist. They see a scientist standing there in a blood-soaked laboratory coat. And she's like, "Oh, it's a scientist. There's nothing to be scared of then."

226
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 Click, click, click, and she's walking. But then, ah, Joe attacks her and rips her throat open and drinks all of her blood.

227
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 And then goes to work the next day. He's not insane. So we were like, "Oh, we won't suspect this guy. He's not insane."

228
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 But it's only because he just had some fresh blood. So as night continues to descend, he once again starts to go insane.

229
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 He has to go drink more blood. And this crime spree is going on for a while. And the authorities in Shanghai are like, "Oh, dude, this totally sucks.

230
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 We keep having all these women with their throats ripped open. This is really bad for the tourist industry. And for those women, we should find out who's doing this."

231
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 So the police begin to walk through the area. They're trying to find this killer. And Joe is continuing to stalk and kill these women.

232
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 The police aren't catching them. And the media is like, "You have to find this serial killer." And the people are like, "We're afraid to go out at night."

233
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 And there is a scientist in the laboratory who's really happy and constantly covered in blood. And he's like, "I don't know. I'm not a suspect."

234
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 And all this is going on. And then eventually, one night, a woman's walking through the park, clip, clip, clip, clip, clip, little high heels on the cobblestone park.

235
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 And then behind the tree, it's Joe Ling. And then, behind like a couple bushes are police officers. All things have converged at this point.

236
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 He jumps out from behind the tree to attack the women. The police jump out of the bushes to attack Joe. They open fire.

237
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 Joe Ling turns around and this huge fight breaks out. Joe begins gutting these police officers in the park.

238
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 They thought they could just shoot this guy. They were sorely mistaken. But then a sniper from a building does shoot him and kills him.

239
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 So the sniper was correct. Those two police officers with revolvers, they were sorely mistaken. They were actually killed.

240
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 A sniper who was watching from above blows this vampire's brains out, kills him.

241
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 "Little germ, little germ rolls out of his stomach. I'll get you next time."

242
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 Little germ, high heels on the cobblestone street. The cops now know that it's Joe Ling who's been attacking these women.

243
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 So now they want to figure out why. Why is this respected scientist in a blood-soaked laboratory coat attacking these women?

244
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 So they go back to his house and they find his diary. Luckily, he kept a diary. I don't know of any adult man who keeps a diary outside of like a journal.

245
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 Maybe you're on a submarine and you have to write stuff like "Fought an octopus off today." It was a good day.

246
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 And I know on boats they keep journals. Watch out, iceberg. Exclamation point, exclamation point, exclamation point.

247
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 But most civilians don't keep diaries. Maybe scientists too? I don't know. But anyways, this guy does.

248
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 He has a pink fuzzy blood-soaked diary with a little key. You can't open it without the key.

249
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 And they just break the lock and they start reading it and they said that it starts off fairly sane.

250
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 It's like, "Today I became a scientist. I hope this works out." And then like he writes about finding a new beaker walking down the street.

251
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 He's like, "This is my favorite beaker ever." And then as they're going through it, it's like, "Today I swallowed a germ." Uh-oh.

252
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 And that one in the world, this guy would even write in this diary. But what's so weird about this is as the diary goes on, it becomes more and more insane.

253
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 It becomes the ramblings of a madman, which he was. He was killing women in the street.

254
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 This is an interesting cultural thing too, because remember this whole story takes place in China?

255
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 And one thing they notice, this is really interesting, one thing they notice as they're flipping through the diary, the language changes.

256
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 It starts off in Chinese, because he's Chinese, this story takes place in Shanghai, but as he progressively gets more and more insane,

257
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 and the vampirism takes more charge of his body, the writing turns to Hebrew.

258
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 That's weird. I think that's one of the most curious details about this story.

259
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Like, I wonder if in the Chinese culture, the Hebrew language is considered like super weird, right? Super weird, super esoteric.

260
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 That's just an interesting detail. I don't think I've come across that before. We've come across the stories of people going crazy in the diary becoming more and more rambling.

261
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 But this one, it becomes more and more rambling, and then they turn a page and it's like, "Mashugana!" It's like in straight Hebrew.

262
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 So then, I guess the cops are like, "We don't know what this says." These are truly the scribbles of a madman, but apparently they got someone who could speak Hebrew,

263
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 and then the story continues. As he became a vampire, I don't know if they're saying he became Jewish, or if he just was so insane he could only speak Hebrew,

264
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 or that Hebrew is like this language of magic and this forbidden knowledge, like the Kabbalah type stuff.

265
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 I don't know, really interesting cultural shift. I haven't seen that before, where the language changes, let alone changes into Hebrew.

266
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 This is a story a long time ago, actually it was a long time ago, feels like forever ago, but maybe a couple weeks ago, we covered the zombie story of Chengdu,

267
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 which is a town in China that had a zombie uprising. Jeffrey W. wrote an article that was basically the five most famous urban legends in China, and this is one of them.

268
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Now, he was able to find some stuff that may have backed up the story of the zombie of Chengdu, specifically that a case of rabies may have gone around town, that a man got rabies,

269
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 and then he bit a pig, and gave the pig rabies, and then the family killed the pig and ate it, and then the family got rabies, and he goes, "That might have been the start of the zombie story."

270
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 He says, "I'm not able to find anything that could point to the beginning of this urban legend, but it's so popular."

271
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Oddly enough, Shanghai has this obsession, the city itself has this obsession with vampires. Pre-pandemic, this stuff has stopped recently, but I'm sure it'll come back.

272
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 Pre-pandemic, they had a lot of vampire tours of Shanghai, they had vampire parties in Shanghai, and you go, "Jay, so that's kind of normal. A lot of big cities will have stuff like that."

273
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 Yeah, maybe, but you'll have big costume parties and stuff like this, but this city is vampire-central in China. They're very, very vampiric.

274
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 I can't think of another word, but they do seem to have an obsession with vampires, and you don't see that in other provinces or other towns in China, at least that I could see.

275
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 So, whatever the origin for this story was, the city of Shanghai has a long history of really liking the vampire mythos, and they have these huge--

276
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 When I say vampire parties, I'm not saying a couple buddies down at the local bar dressed up from Walmart costumes.

277
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Like, there are these elaborate vampire parties that were happening pre-pandemic, so they may be coming back now.

278
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 It's interesting, because on one hand, the vampire myth is so old, right? You can look at almost any culture of having a blood-sucking fiend.

279
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 But this story has a lot of the hallmarks of the Western European vampire.

280
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 But some of them not, right? This guy could be killed with a bullet to the brain, he was able to go out into the sun.

281
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 The fact that the writing changed to Hebrew does link it not to a Western European vampire, but definitely a Middle East vampire, right?

282
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 So these old legends, it's this just kind of combination of myths with a Shanghai spin on it, right?

283
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 Coming out of modern age, this is 1995, it starts off as a virus out of a laboratory.

284
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Part of me when I was reading this, I thought it might be viral marketing for that new Marvel movie, Morbius, or Sony movie, whoever in the world is making it.

285
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 It's kind of the same thing, a guy accidentally becomes a vampire, and then he becomes superhero.

286
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 But yeah, it has these different cultural influences on it, but the vampire itself is such an old story, you find it all over the place.

287
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 We do tend to look at the Western European vampires kind of being the gold standard or the blood-red standard of vampires, that's the most common one.

288
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 But we can't forget that these creatures have existed throughout all cultures, and I think the reason why they are is because these creatures exist in some form.

289
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 Now of course I would love it if Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel was real and like I could run up and stab people with wooden stakes, and they would disappear,

290
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 they wouldn't leave a body that I'd have to dispose of later, like if you had to fight supernatural vampires, it would be dope assuming I wasn't killed immediately.

291
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 But I don't know, I don't think that's true, but the idea of a blood-sucking fiend, it's just too universal for it to be made up.

292
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 But because we focus on the movie versions of it, one, a lot of people just dismiss these legends.

293
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 I've talked before on podcasts that I think a war would be the perfect place for a vampire to hunt, because you're not doing autopsy in a war zone.

294
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 But there's another killing ground that is just as fertile for the vampire.

295
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 We'll wrap the episode up like this, I was talking to a friend of mine at work.

296
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 We were talking about Mexican and South American cryptids.

297
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 And she told me a story that she had heard as a young girl.

298
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 She said there was a family that was trying to cross the border from Mexico into the United States. Now they knew they couldn't do it legally, they weren't going to be able to go through that process.

299
00:26:47,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 She had a mom and a dad, older brother, younger sister, and they were going to cross the border somewhere between Mexico and the United States and try to find a better life up north.

300
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 But as they made their way through the rugged countryside, the father realized something was following him.

301
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 One morning, the family woke up and the father was dead.

302
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 He was pale, with a look of fear spread across his face.

303
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 They don't know how he died, but it seemed like all the blood was drained from his body.

304
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 The family continues. The next morning, when they wake up, the older brother is dead.

305
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 Pale, a look of terror on his face.

306
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 The mother and the daughter continue to make their way across the hostile landscape that separates Mexico and the United States.

307
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 And one morning, a young girl crosses into this country alone.

308
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 When she is picked up by authorities, she tells them the tale.

309
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 "I didn't leave alone. I left with my family. But something out there was hunting us. And it picked us off one by one. I'm the only one left."

310
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 So whether it's the story of a vampire hunting lonely women walking down darkened streets in the massive city of Shanghai,

311
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 or if it's a creature stalking a family searching for a better life as they march across the desolate landscape that separates Mexico and the United States,

312
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 remember this, there's nothing romantic about the vampire.

313
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 It doesn't live in a dark castle, watching the machinations of humanity pass it by.

314
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 No, it's a predator.

315
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 It's a blood-soaked maniac that hunts down the lonely, the lost, the desperate, and takes them, drinks their blood, and discards them like trash.

316
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 The vampire is nothing to be traveled with. It is one of the few cryptids that is recognized around the world.

317
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 Every culture has a version of this creature.

318
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 So just remember that the next time the sun sets, the next time the world is draped in darkness,

319
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:49,000
 that there is a creature out there that has existed in human stories for thousands of years across the world.

320
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 Countless civilizations have told the story of a blood-sucking fiend.

321
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 Just remember that out there, they very well may be a creature who is designed to do one thing, to kill humans, to kill you.
