1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Is it possible that the banking system is using ATMs to support serial killers?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Then we travel to Russia to take a look at the Brosno Dragon, a creature so large, so vicious,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 it changed the course of European history today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 I hope you guys are having a great day too. I'm actually recording this episode right after I recorded yesterday's episode.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Yesterday's episode was kind of weird, but I hope you guys liked it. I had a lot of fun doing that episode,

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 but I did eat. I did eat in between the episodes if you were concerned about my mental state.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Someone who's never concerned about my mental state coming into the day actually.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 He might be extremely concerned about my mental state, but coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now,

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 give it up for our newest Patreon supporter, First.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Everyone give a round of applause to First walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 First, you're going to be our captain, our pilot this episode.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 If you guys can't swear to Patreon, I totally understand.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Just help spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 So first, we're going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Dead Rabbit Durgable.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 We're going to go ahead and get started here. Let's leave behind Dead Rabbit Command.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 We're headed all the way out to a local ATM machine.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 You're like, really? That's as far as I get to fly the Durgable? Yes.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 We're looking for an ATM machine. We got to pull out some cash.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 I'm going to borrow some money from you. Hey, bro. Can I borrow $200?

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 First, go ahead and land the Dead Rabbit Durgable at this ATM machine.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 We're going to walk up to it, get your card ready.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 And I'm like standing behind you, kind of looking around, making sure no one sneaks up on us.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 And you're getting money out. And that's the whole segment. That's the end of the story.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Give me money, please. No, I actually, it's so funny.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Yesterday we talked about the Insanity episode.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 We talked about a young woman who believed she was getting messages from the universe about her soulmate.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 And then we were talking about my fairly insane beliefs involving the law of attraction

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 and how I think the universe works and stuff like that.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 I really, really liked that episode. I hope you guys enjoyed it too.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 It was a little bit different than what we normally do.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 But this first story could have easily have fallen into the Insanity episode.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 And what's funny is I got this recommendation on the Patreon Discord from Petolum.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Petolum posted it and even they said, "This guy's a lunatic."

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 And other people on the Patreon Discord was like, "Dude, yeah, this is crazy.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 I can't believe that someone believes this."

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 And you know what?

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 I think I kind of like this conspiracy theory.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 I gotta say, I could have included on the Insanity episode, but let's dig into this one.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 This one's really kind of cool. This guy did his work.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Let's go back as we're gonna take in the dirgeable here.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 But let's hop back in the dirgeable and we're headed, oh, you see, I sound disappointed.

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 And I'm like, oh man, first gets to do more stuff.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 First, fly this dirgeable. We're leaving behind an ATM machine.

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 We're headed to Blood Mountain, Georgia. That's a real place.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Get up and fight.

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 I'm trying to get her down the hill. She's punching me. She's beating me up.

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Her little dog is yip-yip-yipping at me.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 But I was able to overpower her.

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 And the reason why I was able to finally get her to calm down and start fighting, stop fighting back was I said,

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 "Listen, lady, all I want is your pin number and your ATM card. All I want is your cash."

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 And then the officer and the dog and she is now captive of this lunatic.

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 And she decides that she needs to start buying time.

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 This is something that police officers actually recommend doing, but may not always work out.

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Don't give the accurate pin number to your ATM card because if that's what he wants,

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 once he gets the cash out of the ATM, what's the point in keeping you alive?

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 So she kept giving him fake pin numbers.

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 He would go to the ATM, find out it was fake, come back and he would torture her to get the right pin number.

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 She'd give him another fake one.

62
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 She's really trying to buy time until she can get rescued.

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 But after four days of torture, she gives him the correct pin number.

64
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 She knows that she's now signed her own death warrant.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 And he does brutally murder this woman.

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Talk about a blood curdling quote. He told the cops, "It was hard in reference to murdering Meredith. It was hard.

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 You gotta remember we had spent several good days together."

68
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 And he murdered multiple people.

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 A lot of times you'll see serial killers with, not all the time, not all the time,

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 but you'll see serial killers with a collection of the ATM cards of their victims.

71
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 And this is on Reddit. JP Strikes posted this.

72
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 And he got just downvoted and people were really, really going after this guy to the point that it was removed.

73
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Like the, I don't even remember what subreddit it was on, but the mods removed.

74
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 I think it was on the serial killer subreddit. Here's a guy putting forth a theory.

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 And they hated it. The mods hated it. The people hated it. Luckily, I had archived it and patoled him.

76
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I find this absolutely fascinating.

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 JP Strikes has a theory. ATMs cause murders.

78
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 Automatic teller machines, if you don't know what the acronym stands for.

79
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Cash machines. You know, you need to get some cash out. Like, the money you just gave me.

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 So think about it. This is fascinating. Think about it this way.

81
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 You want to rob somebody. You know they probably have more money in their ATM than they have on them.

82
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Most people don't really carry a lot of cash anyways.

83
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 So you can break into their house, force them to give you the debit card, and then get the pin number from them

84
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 and leave them alone. And what's the first thing they're going to do? They're going to call the cops

85
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 and they're going to change their bank account. So the card's not going to work.

86
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 So the other option is, this is not advice. I'm not giving you advice.

87
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Right now there's some crook. You got his pin in favor together. He's like, "All right. I've been waiting.

88
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 I'm listening to 756 episodes for this advice."

89
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Secondly, you could kidnap somebody and get their debit card and get their pin number

90
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 and take money out of the ATM.

91
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 And most ATMs have a daily limit. You can set it higher, but generally the default limit is $2 to $300 a day

92
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 you can pull out of an ATM.

93
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 So let's say that I kidnap someone. I got their ATM card. I could take them to the ATM.

94
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 I could pull out, let's say $300. And then I look at their balance and it's like $10,000.

95
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 I can let them go. And what's the first thing? I got $300 now. I can let them go.

96
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 What's the first thing they're going to do? They're going to report that their card was stolen.

97
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 The first thing you're going to do is call the police. Then they're going to report that the card was stolen.

98
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 So all of that trouble, I only got $300, even though they have $10,000 in their account.

99
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 If they are able to report the crime, I am limited to the amount I can pull out in a day.

100
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 I can keep them alive and keep visiting the ATM, but there's always the chance that they're going to break free.

101
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 And it's a lot of trouble having a captive. It really is. I'm not speaking from personal experience.

102
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 I can just imagine you have to have a place to store them. You have to check on them to make sure they're not escaping

103
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 and make sure they're not hiding. Now they're going to kill you. The prey has become the predator.

104
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 But you can do that. You can keep them missing for as long as possible.

105
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Now, not everyone, like if I went missing, people would know I was missing right away because I'm just a social butterfly.

106
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 People would be like, "Hey, I haven't seen Jason in a day." But not everyone has that.

107
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 Some people can be missing for a week and nobody knows.

108
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 But if you have a captive, you have to provide for a captive. You have to have a place for a captive.

109
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 And this is fascinating. What JP Strikes is saying is that ATM machines actually encourage serial killers,

110
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 kidnappers, really, may start as kidnappers to kill the victim once they get the ATM card and the PIN code.

111
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 Because when you're killed, there's no one to escape.

112
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 Right? I've gotten the PIN number. I've gotten the ATM card. I kill you.

113
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 And I can pull out money until someone reports you missing.

114
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 And if you're an elderly person with no family, if you're a stranger in the area,

115
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 an immigrant from another country, a wanderer from town to town, right?

116
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Kidnap them. This is not advice, but you kidnap them.

117
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 You get the PIN number. You get the ATM card.

118
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 And because there's that daily limit, which the daily limit is to protect you,

119
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 but it's also to protect the bank. If someone steals my ATM card and drains my account

120
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 and they look at the video footage and it's not me, I'm obviously getting my money back.

121
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 The bank is out. The bank then has to file paperwork with the FDIC, Federally Insured Money and all that stuff,

122
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 but they're out that, let's say I had $10,000 in my account and that bank loses $10,000 that day.

123
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 That's on them. I get my money back. So the daily limits isn't just to protect the person.

124
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 And what JP Strikes the Saint, it doesn't protect the person.

125
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 It actually encourages the kidnapper to kill you and they keep you hidden for much longer.

126
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 And you're able to get $200 a day, $200 a day.

127
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 And he goes on to name all of these serial killers. One of them was that one guy we first talked about,

128
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Gary Michael Hilton. He was eventually found guilty of about four or five killings.

129
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 He's been named a person of interest in about 81 different killings.

130
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 He was just a drifter. But think about it. A drifter knows that they can pick a random person off the street

131
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 and get probably $200 from them. Keep going a couple days and you're going to get more money.

132
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 Two, four, six, eight. You guys know how to count by twos.

133
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 Fascinating conspiracy theory and he says that the ATMs encourage it because, one, they have the daily limits.

134
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 So it encourages the person to kill the victim. And if you could drain the account that day,

135
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 then the chances of you kidnapping someone, getting the ATM, getting the pin code,

136
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 draining their account and letting them go because what do you care? You got $10,000 from a simple kidnapping.

137
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 He also stated this. He got so much hate from this. This is so bizarre.

138
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Look at the show notes. You'll see the link because I was able to archive it.

139
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 People really were really missing the boat. A lot of them are like, "You think Ted Bundy wanted ATM cards?"

140
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 He's like, "I'm not saying all serial killers, but I'm saying there's enough of a pattern

141
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 that ATM machines, if they remove daily limits, just want to be such a big issue."

142
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 And he says, "Here's the other thing. There is not a separate criminal code for forced ATM withdrawals."

143
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 It's listed as like, "Strong arm robbery."

144
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 So you can't -- there's no statistic saying this is how many people were forced to pull money out of the ATM.

145
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 He says, "You have to go case by case and look and see where the ATM was a component of the crime."

146
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 He said, "Several states have actually tried passing laws, making this a separate felony,

147
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 and it's been shot down." And he goes, "Who do you think is shutting this down?

148
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Do you think it's the meth-addled robbers who don't want people to know about this crime wave?

149
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Or do you think it's the banks who don't want their customers to know that it's a huge problem?

150
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 Not necessarily the murder part of it, but just the ATM robberies in general.

151
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 What if you knew that -- I'm just throwing a number out here --

152
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 but what if you knew like, in the top 10 crimes, number seven was being forced to get money out of your ATM at gunpoint?

153
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Would you feel comfortable ever using an ATM? Would you feel comfortable carrying an ATM card?

154
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 If you knew -- and I don't know what it was -- it could be a minor -- it could not happen a lot, but we don't know.

155
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 The criminal code, that's not a separate thing.

156
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 So really, really interesting conspiracy theory. It got scrubbed the second it went up.

157
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 I don't know if there's anything to it, honestly, but it's one of those things that makes sense.

158
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 There's really two conspiracy theories. One, that daily limits encourage people to kill the victims as quick as possible

159
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 so they can cover up the crime, and instead of getting $200, they can maybe get a week's worth of money, and then they're gone, right?

160
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 It's easy to disguise your face when you're using the camera, wear a hat.

161
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 This sounds like I'm giving a lot of advice, but I'm not.

162
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 Kill someone, they aren't found, people don't even know they're missing for a week, two weeks, three weeks.

163
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Really, it depends on the person, depends on their social patterns, whether or not they have a job, whether or not they're new to the area.

164
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 That's conspiracy theory number one. The conspiracy theory number two is that serial killing aside, this is an issue, and it's being covered up

165
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 because the banks have a vested interest in people using ATMs.

166
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 ATMs allow them to have less branches, less branches, less employees.

167
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 So you put an ATM on every corner, but do ATMs have they caused a giant spike in violent crime, but we can't tell because it just listed a strong armed robbery?

168
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 Very, very fascinating conspiracy theory. I find it, again, just a part of being a conspiracy theorist, I find it super interesting that he posted it and it was immediately blasted down.

169
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 So, I don't know, I really liked it, Peltulum, thank you for sending it over, I know kind of the idea was look at this crazy guy, but I don't think the banks are actively encouraging serial killing,

170
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 and even he wasn't making that argument. He was saying there are steps they can do to mitigate these crimes from going forward, and he just got blasted off.

171
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Not in a good way, not in a rocket ship, I mean, people just shoot him out of the door on a subreddit where people are constantly throwing out conspiracy theories or just regular theories about crime.

172
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 Very, very fascinating. Very, very fascinating insight. So, thank you very much, JP Strikes, and thank you very much, Peltulum, for sending that over.

173
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 First, let's go ahead and toss you the keys of the Carbentercopter, we are leaving behind Blood Mountain Georgia, why would you name a place like that? You're asking for bad stuff to happen.

174
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 We are headed all the way out to Russia.

175
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 And I wanted to do a really quick Dead Rabbit Recommends, this one, it was actually sent to me by long time supporter of the show, long time Patreon supporter,

176
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 big supporting member of the Patreon Discord, Rudy Jazz. Rudy Jazz also done a bunch of fan art for the program, really, really appreciate their support.

177
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Rudy Jazz has been going on and on and on, as long as I'm knowing him, about the Borderlands, this movie called the Borderlands.

178
00:15:50,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 And finally, I said, you know what, I'll give it a shot. I'm a fan of found footage movies, I love horror movies, it's getting a recommendation from Rudy.

179
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 The Borderlands in a nutshell, because I don't want to give too much away, but it's a really interesting premise, there is a miracle at a local church, in like the outskirts of Britain, it's a British film.

180
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 And the Vatican has set up this group to prove or disprove miracles. And we see these three men come out to this church to see what's going on.

181
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 Now, two of them have been doing this job for a long time, they don't really believe in this stuff. And then you have a young tech guy who's just been hired, who's still very, the truth is out there, kind of personality.

182
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 And that's really all I can say about the movie, because the movie just has its twists and its turns and it's very atmospheric.

183
00:16:49,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 And really to give anything else away, I think, because Rudy was very nice and not telling me anything about it. It's a very, very well done horror movie. It's spooky and it's atmospheric.

184
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 And I've been thinking about it for days. Dead Rabbit Radio recommends the Borderlands. It's also known as Final Prayer, which is a more generic title, you might find it under either one.

185
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 But I'll put it in the show notes. Dead Rabbit Radio recommends the Borderlands.

186
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 And first is flying the carbonicopter and we're sitting in the back and we all just watched the Borderlands and everyone's like, I'm good. I'm done investigating the paranormal. I'm fine. I don't have to hear anymore.

187
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 You're jumping off the helicopter without a parachute. It's really cool movie for paranormal investigators. It really, really is.

188
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 That's why I think it resonated with me and with Rudy and I think it will resonate with you too. It's really cool as a paranormal investigator.

189
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 But anyways, if you haven't jumped out of the carbonicopter, parachute or not, we are headed out to Lake Brosno. That's an Andrea Pole, Russia.

190
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 This lake, Lake Brosno, it's 141 feet deep of fresh water with little fishes.

191
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 And the local fishermen, one thing they notice about this lake is sometimes they find fish in the lake that aren't native to that lake.

192
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 It's a weird thing. They say sometimes they'll find fish that aren't even freshwater fish. I mean, those ones are dead.

193
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 They'll be in the middle of the lake. And other times they'll find fish that aren't native to it. So they believe, local fishermen believe, there has to be some sort of tunnel system under the lake.

194
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 Now that wouldn't be out of the ordinary. But this lake also has volcanic rifts underneath it.

195
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 So every so often bubbles will rise to the surface. I'm not a fisherman myself, but if I was a fisherman, I don't think I would fish on top of a volcano.

196
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 And then also there is gas underneath this crust as well.

197
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 So there are, every so often you'll be out there and you'll see bubbles. You'll see it looks like something rising to the surface.

198
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Or you'll see what looks like a wake of a giant creature swimming. But it's most likely a geological issue.

199
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 So the fact that there's sea monster sightings here is really a no-brainer.

200
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 Because until people started to think about, like in modern times, think about, oh, we must be on top of a volcanic rift,

201
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 or there must be some sort of hydrogen bubbling up from here or whatever it was.

202
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 You would just, you know what it is now, but 500 years ago you would think it was a sea monster, this roiling water just out of nowhere.

203
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 You'd think it was some sort of sea monster. So the fact that Lake Brosno is the home of the Brosno dragon, this massive monster, it's really a no-brainer.

204
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Right, you would see these legends popping up. But this sea monster may have changed the course of European history.

205
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Well, according to the locals, it did. 13th century Europe.

206
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 [cackling]

207
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 That was a horse. That was a horse that was on the Crypt Keeper.

208
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 There was a man, known as Batu Khan, go that way! And he like points his sword ahead and then all these other guys are riding their horses.

209
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 [cackling]

210
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 And all these horses, like thousands of them, clop, clop, clop, clop, and there's like dust everywhere.

211
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 The people in the back are like, the archers can't see anything, their eyes are full of dust.

212
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 And you had like 40,000 troops marching across Europe and they'd go into like Moscow, or what is modern day Moscow?

213
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 Slink, slink, slide, ugh, there's like stabbing people. And then there's like babies running away, they're like, I'll grow up somewhere else.

214
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 And then they go to this other big city and like the horse is like stepping on houses.

215
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 And they're like, how did we build houses so small that a horse could step on them?

216
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 And like these mongol--actually what's interesting is this army was the Tatar Mongol army.

217
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 We talk a lot about Tataria, this lost empire of Tatar.

218
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 They pop up in history all the time, I don't understand why people still think it was this lost civilization.

219
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 They're listed as the Tatar Mongol Empire. They're just shooting arrows at enemy soldiers and civilians alike.

220
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 No, no, ugh, getting shot, they got dust in their eyes, they only wanted to shoot soldiers, but they ended up massacring entire cities.

221
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 And so Batu Khan and his Tatar Mongol warriors are just laying waste to modern day Russia.

222
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 But as he's leading his massive army, they get to Lake Brosno.

223
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 And past Lake Brosno is the town of Novgorod.

224
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 And Batu Khan, it goes, I will soon slaughter everyone in that town.

225
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 But you know what, we've already slaughtered so many people, let's stop and get a drink of water.

226
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 So they stop at Lake Brosno and you have all of the soldiers, his entire army is there.

227
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 The horses are drinking water, some soldiers are taking baths, some archers are watching other eyes, they're like, ugh, finally I can see.

228
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 And Batu Khan is looking over his men and he's like, dude, what a glorious army, like no one can defeat us.

229
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 I'm sure history will always remember the Tatar Mongols, this will not be lost in world history.

230
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 And then all of a sudden, the lake water begins to royal, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

231
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 Imagine that sound 40,000 times.

232
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 If we begin just eating horses, if we begin eating soldiers, this creature which is described as something looking like the Loch Ness Monster.

233
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Big fat body, little fin legs, long neck, head, arm, arm, arm.

234
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 It just starts eating these people.

235
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 Now, I, the Loch Ness Monster I never thought was big enough to swallow a horse whole.

236
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 For one, I don't think the Loch Ness Monster is real.

237
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 That's one of those cryptids that I think is completely manufactured.

238
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 But the idea of like a sea monster, could one of those dinosaurs, like a, could a Brontosaurus eat a horse whole?

239
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 Go on.

240
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 And then there'd be no more horse left.

241
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 But anyway, so this creature, look that up Jamie, look up Brontosaurus eating a horse.

242
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 This creature jumps out of the lake and begins eating the horses and eating the soldiers.

243
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 Now it's not like Batu Khan lost a lot of troops in this battle.

244
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 But, like let's say he, this thing ate 10 horses and 15 men.

245
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 Just spitballing, right?

246
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 Doesn't, doesn't matter.

247
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 Like if you had an army of 40,000 people and 10 horses and 15 men were eaten, you may think, well we can continue to know of Gorod.

248
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 But the, the sheer horror of seeing a monster jump up out of the water and start eating your men.

249
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 The panic came over the army and they fled the area.

250
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 These soldiers had slaughtered innocents, killed enemy kings, seen their own countrymen get their heads smashed open and swords go through their livers and blow up.

251
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 I'm assuming one of them stepped on a landmine at some point and saw all that stuff.

252
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 But watch, you know, giant monster jump out and start eating people.

253
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 That's a little too much, right?

254
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 So Batu Khan's army fled the area and because of that, Novgorod was never invaded.

255
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 So we're gonna put a little pin in that because I know you're obviously asking a question.

256
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 Is that true?

257
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 That's what I started asking.

258
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 But let's jump ahead before I answer that question.

259
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 Let's jump ahead.

260
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 The modern day sightings of this thing, because there's still modern day sightings.

261
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 People say that they see him.

262
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 They see this Loch Ness monster-esque creature, the Browsner Dragon, swimming through the water.

263
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 Sometimes when fishermen go missing in this lake, it's chalked up to the monster got eaten by the Browsner Dragon.

264
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Apparently in World War II, a Nazi plane was flying over Lake Browsner and he wasn't having none of it.

265
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 If anything, the Browsner Dragon is a patriot to the motherland.

266
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 The Browsner Dragon jumped up out of the water.

267
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 You're like, Jason, okay, this is obviously made up.

268
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Hold on, hold on.

269
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 He jumped out of the water.

270
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 I'm like, how a dolphin does at SeaWorld?

271
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 Jumped out of the water all the way up.

272
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 You're like, damn it, Jason, this story is totally fictional.

273
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 He jumped all the way up.

274
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 This is in the newspaper.

275
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 I'll explain in a second.

276
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 He jumped all the way up and ate the airplane.

277
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Arrr.

278
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 Bet you it did not taste as good as Tatar Mongol horse.

279
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 But nowadays, other than that World War II excitement, mostly just sometimes seeing his head breaking the surface, a lot of ripples, a lot of missing fishermen.

280
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 So I looked into this and I found a lot of articles saying what I just told you.

281
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 And one of the articles I found was in Pravda.

282
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 Okay, so if you're a citizen of the Russian Federation, you probably just shut off the podcast and said, ah, I'm done.

283
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 Because Pravda is the equivalent of, imagine if the US government ran the weekly world news.

284
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 It's basically a state sponsor.

285
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 Is it still state sponsored?

286
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 It used to be, but I think Pravda means truth or people or something like that.

287
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 It's nothing.

288
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 They run a lot of fake stuff.

289
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 We've covered a Pravda story before and it was the same thing.

290
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Really sensational journalism.

291
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 And a lot of times it's just not true.

292
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 It was interesting because this article in Pravda, which again is a newspaper, but it's just not a truth telling one.

293
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 Allegedly, I know that the lawyer was typing up a form right there. Allegedly not a truth telling one.

294
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 It was interesting because I said, okay, so here's the thing.

295
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 I go, you know, Pravda did the article, but I'm gonna keep researching it.

296
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 I'm not gonna say the toilet made it up.

297
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 The big question is this.

298
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Was the city of Novgorod invaded?

299
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 So I started looking into that.

300
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 I started looking up the wrath of Batu Khan and his march across Europe.

301
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 And lo and behold, Novgorod, he really did invade this portion of Europe.

302
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 And he really did lay waste to all these cities.

303
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 That stuff is true.

304
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 When he got to Novgorod, he did not destroy the city.

305
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 It was only one of two cities that was not completely obliterated by Batu Khan.

306
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 So you go, whoa, he got there, he got near it, and he didn't continue to destroy the city.

307
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 So why? Is there any possibility that this Brosno dragon exists?

308
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 Now, I understand Pravda wants to give spirit to the citizens of Mother Russia.

309
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 But the reason why, so that's true.

310
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 He did not destroy Novgorod.

311
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 The reason why he did not destroy Novgorod, like the other cities surrounding it, was because they surrendered.

312
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 They came up, they saw what had happened to all these other cities and the absolute madness and mayhem and destruction.

313
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 So there you go, tell you what, we are now Tatar Mongols.

314
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 Good sir.

315
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 What, you thought that we were Russians?

316
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Oh, that was just an act.

317
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 What are you talking about?

318
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 We were Tatar Mongols before it was cool.

319
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 The really, really interesting story, and we're still left to the question, is the Brosno dragon real?

320
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Now, while I think the Loch Ness monster is a hoax, I do believe that they're probably RC.

321
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 I'll believe this for sure.

322
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 I think there were sea monsters when we first started sailing the oceans.

323
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 I believe that back when men first got on these massive boats and were cutting across the ocean for the first time,

324
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 they probably encountered beasts that would defy explanation today.

325
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 And then they just got whittled down and we hunted them and stuff like that, like massive squids and things like that.

326
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 We're crushing boats.

327
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 I totally believe at some point there could have been a Kraken.

328
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 And then we just encroached on their territory and then we started hunting them and now today they're just myths and fables.

329
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 And I don't know, I really don't believe the idea that a dinosaur could be alive today, but I do think at some point in human history,

330
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 there probably were these massive creatures trapped in lakes.

331
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 And that's why those stories resonate with us because there is a consciousness, like there's a societal consciousness with those things.

332
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 I do believe that.

333
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 I do believe there are probably definitely monsters in the oceans when we first set sail across them.

334
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 Just like there were great beasts, bears and lions and now they're endangered in a lot of areas.

335
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 And 400 years from now people may go, "Yeah, you know, there are bears," but they weren't as big as people said they were.

336
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 Because they'll have no co- they'll be gone.

337
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 And then a thousand years from now people will be like, "Well, what's a bear?"

338
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 They have teddy bears like that. People were scared of a teddy bear.

339
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 But I want to wrap it up like this because I can't prove whether or not the Brosno Dragon exists.

340
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 I want to wrap it up like this.

341
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 I was really enthralled by the idea of a cryptid changing the course of world history.

342
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 Stopping this invasion.

343
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 Brosno Dragons didn't, they just surrendered. They were conquered, but they weren't destroyed.

344
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 And I thought about this. Let's put our conspiracy caps on for a second.

345
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 We're going to wrap it up like this and it's kind of an open-ended thought.

346
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 We talk a lot about aliens coming down and going bleep blop.

347
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 We want you to be environmentally friendly. You can't destroy the world.

348
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 I so funny want to make that voice. It makes it sound like I want this thing.

349
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 I want the world destroyed. But it's just so rote and so lame when aliens, they travel billions of light years to just be like,

350
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 "Don't throw soda cans out of your car. Don't, you know, go to renewable energy and don't drop nukes and all that stuff."

351
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 Which I mean, sure, I'm not saying we should drop nukes, but we always hear that message from aliens.

352
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 Like they have some sort of stake in the planet or want humans to join the brotherhood, the galactic brotherhood.

353
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 My question is this. Do cryptids affect policy?

354
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 Because remember, cryptids are native to this planet.

355
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 Bigfoot has a more vested interest in the sustainability of the forest than the grey aliens do.

356
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 Do cryptids interact with us?

357
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 Dude, dude, this wasn't what I was going for, but this thought just popped in my head.

358
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 What if cryptids are the Illuminati?

359
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 What if they're the ones that are secretly pulling the strings behind the scenes?

360
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 I'm saying there's like a, I just imagine now there's like a council table and like Mothman and Bigfoot.

361
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 And there's like a walking ass mobster who's like, "That guy says he doesn't believe in me one more time.

362
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 I'm going to personally crush him with my flippers."

363
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 And you have the, I'm not saying like there's a hall of justice full of cryptids, but what if, because what I'm thinking is that a cryptid would have a vested interest in keeping out an occupying force.

364
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 So do cryptids play a part in local politics?

365
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 And really with the Illuminati thing, world politics.

366
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 It's a bizarre question because you do imagine this kind of cartoonish type committee of all of these creatures, but there basically some of them prey on humanity.

367
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
 Very few cryptids protect humanity, if you think about it.

368
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 There's very few cryptids that are good.

369
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 Almost all of them either want nothing to do with us or we're a food source or they're devouring our souls or something like that.

370
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 So they wouldn't want an army of 40,000 Tatar Mongols killing everyone.

371
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 They're like, "I have to eat those fishermen."

372
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 If you raise the city and no one's using this anymore as a fishing village, what am I going to eat?

373
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 I don't know. It's kind of a weird conspiracy theory.

374
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 And I don't even know if it's, I don't know if it's a conspiracy theory or just the insane ramblings of someone, but is it po-

375
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 My question is this. Why and-

376
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 Because most cryptids are fairly intelligent.

377
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 Bigfoot in the lore is as clever as a human.

378
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 What if the cryptids are, I guess there's two questions here.

379
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 One, do cryptids have a vested interest in keeping their environment the way that it is?

380
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 And the answer to that would be yes.

381
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 And then two, how deep does that power go?

382
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 Are there cryptids out there that have infiltrated levels of our government?

383
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 What if cryptids are the real end boss of the world?

384
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 And we're thinking that it's this ethnic group or that ethnic group or this religion or that religion or aliens, reptilians taking over the planet.

385
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 What if that's all smoke screen?

386
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 What if the real rulers of the world are not sitting on starships or in high-rise office buildings or on thrones,

387
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 but live deep underwater in bottomless lakes, stalk the forest constantly out of sight,

388
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 or simply live on the edge of reality, watching in the darkness for their next victim?

389
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 What if the real rulers of the world are the creatures that nobody believes in?

390
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 The perfect hiding spot.

391
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 They are whispers in the shadows.

392
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 Secret rulers of all mankind.
