1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
 What do blind people see when they dream? And then we visit one of the last

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:13,240
 uncontacted tribes in the world. Are the inhabitants of North Sentinel Island

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:19,040
 actually guarding alien artifacts? Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:28,400
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,520
 host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day. I hope you're having a great day too.

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,160
 It's actually still Thanksgiving for me because I recorded these the day before.

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,800
 For you, future listener, it's no longer Thanksgiving. It's still Thanksgiving

8
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,880
 for me and I have right here, because I'm celebrating Thanksgiving, a

9
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:50,120
 strawberry-ta. Strawberry-ta. It is sparkling margarita in a can. I actually

10
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,760
 have had this before. It's pretty good and before anyone says that it's a girl

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,720
 drink, I'll have you know it is 8% alcohol. That makes it 16 proof. That's not a

12
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,600
 girl drink. I also, this isn't a sponsorship or anything. I'm just

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,200
 celebrating Thanksgiving and then after I recorded this I'm gonna eat some

14
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,240
 Thanksgiving dinner, some instant potatoes, and some stovetop stuffing. And I

15
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,280
 got these little turkey TV, they're not even TV dinners. They're like complete,

16
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,160
 but it's like eats is all capitalized. So that's it. I like having a

17
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,680
 laid-back Thanksgiving. My family's all over the place, so I like just kind of

18
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,960
 chilling. And I'm chilling with you guys. I'm chilling with you guys, so that's

19
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,120
 totally cool too. And I hope you guys had a great Thanksgiving and if you're in

20
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,880
 parts of the world that don't celebrate Thanksgiving, I hope you had a great

21
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,240
 Thursday. So we're gonna go ahead and talk about a couple different things here.

22
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,360
 First story we're gonna talk about is something of particular interest to me

23
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,280
 and I think it's something that people have thought about and that's do blind

24
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,960
 people. What do blind people dream of? I said on an earlier episode people who

25
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,920
 wear glasses all the time in their dreams do they wear glasses? I've wondered

26
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,280
 about that. Like in the dream are you wearing glasses on your face and if

27
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,040
 your glasses aren't on your face in your dream or your dreams blurry? I wear glasses

28
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,400
 off and on. Like I starting to wear them more as I get older but generally only

29
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,640
 wear them if I'm gonna be doing a lot of reading. Most of the time I don't have

30
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,760
 my glasses on. But I was wondering about how the blind people, how the blind

31
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,280
 people, what blind people dream. Now I will say this to start this off, this will

32
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,640
 probably get a lot of listeners to just drop the show but I used to hook up with

33
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,480
 this blind chick a couple years ago and she kind of explained it to me. So she

34
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,440
 had this or has this degenerative "I" thing and started when she was like a

35
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,800
 teenager where her field of vision gets smaller and smaller and smaller and

36
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,480
 smaller. She may eventually end up being completely blind or it may just stop.

37
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,680
 I used to know the name of it but it's this thing. So she was

38
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,720
 explaining it to me one night and she said this was so bizarre. So she goes

39
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,320
 "my field of vision is very limited but my mind is still processing the visual

40
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:01,480
 input as if I still had a normal field of vision. So we're over at my apartment.

41
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,240
 In my apartment, my apartment's messy as is and there was something on the floor

42
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,320
 like a wrapper or I don't know candy bar something. Not a candy bar but there was

43
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,000
 something on the floor." And she said "you see that on the floor?" She goes "what I'm

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,880
 seeing right now is she goes "you're just seeing like a little green box sitting on

45
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,320
 the floor and then the rest of it is just the wood paneling, the wood floor." She

46
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,240
 goes "when I look at it, I see the green box sitting on the floor and I see that

47
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,480
 green box replicated a hundred times in every direction because her brain is

48
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,600
 saying, since it only has this little field of vision, her brain is assuming

49
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,120
 that that obstacle is everywhere." She goes "but if I look a couple feet over

50
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,560
 where there is no obstacle on the floor, I'll just see wood paneling go on forever

51
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,040
 and ever." So her brain is trying to process the limited information

52
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,840
 that it has and so that's why she kind of has to focus. That's why she can't

53
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,320
 drive. That's why she kind of has to focus when she's navigating. She had

54
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,880
 the walking stick and everything like that but you know you would

55
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,120
 talk to her, you wouldn't know that she was legally blind but she had to be very

56
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,660
 careful. And because it was degenerative, it wasn't like it happened

57
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,560
 overnight. Her brain has learned to cope with this loss of vision. And I

58
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,160
 will say this too, it was super bizarre. She was super nice and incredibly hot.

59
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,640
 She did all this stuff that I don't want to go into because then

60
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,440
 people could probably identify her better but she just lived the life

61
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,320
 normally and did all this stuff and she was she's amazing woman but anyways she

62
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,000
 doesn't listen to podcasts though so I hold that against her. The point is is

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,960
 that the brain will try to figure out how to cope with any obstacle that comes

64
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,760
 in its way. And that's where we get into the idea of dreaming because what

65
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:55,920
 dream what scientists feel dreams are is it is a way to do practice runs

66
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,840
 especially nightmares. Nightmares science believes is a way to do practice runs of

67
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:06,680
 tragic and traumatic events so when these things really do happen you're

68
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,800
 prepared for it mentally. It's a theory but I think it's actually pretty good

69
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,720
 theory. Now of course we have dreams about dragons and nightmares about like

70
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,960
 stuff that'll never happen but it's still your brain just basically putting

71
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,400
 itself in a traumatic state to prepare itself for something traumatic happening.

72
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,160
 In the future it's a safety mechanism basically. So this is where we're going

73
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,680
 to get into what do blind people dream about. I know that was a bit of a lead-up

74
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,600
 but I think it's important because we're going to get into how the what my

75
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,200
 friend's experience was with her waking vision you'll see kind of start to play

76
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,720
 out in the dreams as well. So Danish researchers did a study. It's a very

77
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,880
 small study. There's only 50 people. They had 11 blind people who were blind

78
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,640
 from birth. 14 people who became blind after the age of I think it was one and

79
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:00,720
 then 25 non-blind people or seeing people. They did they had to take surveys on

80
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,840
 their dreams. They had to ask questions like did you see was it in color? Did you

81
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,480
 taste smell, feel pain? What emotions did you have? What type of themes did the

82
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,800
 stories have? Seeing people had at least one visual dream. Now this was I think a

83
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,480
 six-week survey. So within the six weeks seeing people on average had at least one

84
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:24,560
 visual dream usually more but at least one. The blind from birth had none. No

85
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,800
 visual dreams which is to be expected. They've never seen anything. People who

86
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,360
 became blind the older they got since they'd become blind the less likely they

87
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,960
 would see something because their their brain now is working being like oh

88
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,040
 there's no visual stimuli coming in so we don't have to produce visual stimuli

89
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:45,160
 in the dreams. What's interesting and also they had across the board across the

90
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,840
 three groups they had the same they were able to identify themes in their

91
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:54,720
 dreams but one of the weirdest things was that when it came for nightmares blind

92
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,800
 people had over tripled the amount of nightmares of the seeing people. 25% of

93
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,600
 the blind people said they had a nightmare versus 7% of the seeing people

94
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,240
 who said they had a nightmare and and when they were looking at that they said

95
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,920
 this is kind of showing that the brain is going through basically practice runs

96
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,680
 for reality because the blind people their nightmares were things that they

97
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,600
 worry about things that are major obstacles for people who are blind

98
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,600
 things like getting lost. Falling in manholes was a very common nightmare in

99
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,360
 this group. I've never once worried about falling in a manhole. I've thought about

100
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,720
 climbing into them and seeing what was down there but I've never thought like

101
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,120
 oh no what if I'm walking on the street and I fall in a manhole that's not a

102
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,960
 problem that I face. Getting hit by a car was a common one because I have to

103
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,360
 deal with that. Losing their guide dog so I mean these are real threats that blind

104
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,000
 people face and so their brain is doing those practices so if that happens if

105
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,940
 they're out walking and their dog runs away goes chases a squirrel or whatever

106
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,620
 their brain will know how to deal with a situation that immediate panic will

107
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,720
 start to be quelled because basically this has already happened to them a

108
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,240
 hundred times in their sleep but even though this is first time it's ever

109
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,160
 happened in real life. So and then there's this quote I thought this was an

110
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,280
 interesting quote from this one study. It said when a blind man is asked if he

111
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:17,000
 dreams the answer is an immediate yes but if we ask him if he sees anything in

112
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,240
 the dream the answer is always doubtful because he does not know what it is to

113
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,640
 see. Even if there were images and colors in his brain during the dream how could

114
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,920
 he recognize them. There is therefore no direct way through the dream reports to

115
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,760
 evaluate the presence of a visual activation in the dream of congenitally

116
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:42,240
 blind subjects. So it's weird they may actually see in their dream but they

117
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,840
 don't people who are blind from birth could never explain it. Their dreams

118
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,880
 could be full of visual stimuli but it they wouldn't never be able to explain

119
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,960
 it to somebody and I think the story is interesting. I find it absolutely

120
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:05,120
 fascinating because that's almost how we try to talk about like cosmic level

121
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,800
 things or there's there's so much stuff in the world that we don't have the

122
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,560
 language to explain not only to ourselves but to other people. I find that

123
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,960
 fascinating. I find everything with the human brain fascinating because it's

124
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:24,360
 not just like oh I'm blind but everything else is normal like their their brain

125
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,800
 still is processing all that information and the brain if if they're

126
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,120
 just if just their eyes are blind their brain is still able to receive visual

127
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,440
 stimuli it's just not getting there. So what's that part of the brain doing? Is

128
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,640
 it creating its own? How would you define a color to someone who's never

129
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,320
 seen the color red? I find all that stuff fascinating. It's all philosophical

130
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,200
 arguments at a certain point but these people are living that philosophical

131
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,680
 argument. Absolutely fascinating. The next story we're going to cover is an odd one.

132
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,360
 It's one that I saw pop up a couple times on the conspiracy iceberg. I figured

133
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,760
 there's nothing to it. There's no resources behind it. A lot of people

134
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,640
 requested it and I said I'll look into it. It wasn't something I was too thrilled

135
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,960
 about and then I looked into it and I was like okay there's something here. So the

136
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:17,160
 conspiracy theory is that the sentinels, the sentinels are guarding alien

137
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,000
 artifacts so to get into it I'm gonna have to give you some background to who

138
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,800
 the sentinels are. There is an island off the coast of India, the Andaman islands

139
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,160
 and there's multiple islands there and there's there's a lot of tribes there.

140
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:37,000
 I think there's like four or five tribes there that are throwbacks. Now out of

141
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,720
 most of those tribes there are trade and contact with the Indian government and

142
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,160
 they're like yeah we know you guys are like way back. You guys are still using

143
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,880
 spears and stuff like that but we want to have regular contact with you. When the

144
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,080
 people in those islands are like yeah okay you know that's fine you know

145
00:10:54,080 --> 00:11:00,600
 it's a it's beneficial to both sides. One India gets to contact the people you

146
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,720
 know and then the people on the islands get food and supplies and stuff from

147
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:09,280
 India. However one of the islands, North Sentinel Island has a tribe on there

148
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,440
 called the Sentinelese. They are completely for the most part uncontacted

149
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,840
 by the modern world. They know we exist and we know they exist but there's been

150
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:21,640
 no formal contact between the two. There's been attempts but there's been no

151
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,720
 like shaking hands, sending ambassadors, stuff like that. India has said this

152
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,640
 island's off limits. They don't want to talk to us. They're a fully functioning

153
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,880
 basically prehistoric society. They don't want to talk to us. There have been

154
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:41,560
 attempts where people have gone there and two of the so two of the elders from

155
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,200
 the Sentinelese came and met the sailors. They ended up getting diseases, the

156
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,920
 Sentinelese, because they're such a throwback. It's the same thing

157
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:57,160
 that when the Europeans came to America and so the government of India was like

158
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,880
 okay we can't be messing with these people. Like they're fully functioning

159
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,800
 tribe. We're only gonna make things worse. And they have tribes like this.

160
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,440
 Brazil has a couple of tribes like this. South America overall has a couple

161
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,640
 tribes like this. But the government actually says don't go near them let

162
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,600
 them be. There was a time where some sailors came to the island and they

163
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,880
 gave them like pigs and some toys and things like that. The Sentinelese came

164
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,360
 out, killed the pig and buried. They'd never seen a pig before. They didn't know

165
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,120
 what it was. They've only really lived on this island. Killed the pig, basically

166
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,480
 ran people off of spears. There have been times where the Sentinelese will come out

167
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,120
 and they'll look like they're going to accept the explorers and then they

168
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,920
 chase them off of spears. They shoot arrows at them. So they're a very very

169
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,040
 like closed off tribe. They don't want to get to know people on the mainland. So

170
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,960
 this guy just a couple days ago felt that he was in his heart to go

171
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,160
 preach Christianity to the Sentinelese. You're not supposed to go there.

172
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,160
 It's completely illegal to go there. He hired some fishermen, said let me take me

173
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,560
 to the Sentinelese islands. I'll talk about Jesus. They killed him. They just

174
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,480
 lit him up full of arrows. And India in response arrested the fishermen. Because

175
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,080
 India has said that they've killed other there a couple years ago. There was a

176
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,800
 fishing boat that the two fishermen fell asleep in their boat and it drifted

177
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,160
 too close to North Sentinel Island. They lit him up. The Sentinelese fired much

178
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:27,000
 arrows, killed him. India said we consider that island to be a sovereign

179
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,240
 state. You invaded their border. They have the right to do that. We're not going

180
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,040
 to interfere with that island. So India really has their back. Now let's go into

181
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,680
 a little bit more history of the Sentinelese and then we're going to get

182
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,080
 into the conspiracy theory because this all wraps up together. Sentinelese they

183
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,880
 believe they're about 40,000 years old. Not the people on the island but I mean

184
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,000
 the civilization somewhere around there. They believe they traveled from Africa to

185
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,240
 the island. I don't know how but somehow they got from Africa to this island. I

186
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,440
 guess if you have 40,000 years you can kind of do anything. We don't know how

187
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,400
 many of them are on the island. Estimates have ranged over time anywhere from 40

188
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:07,640
 to 500. So sometimes there's peaks in the population, sometimes there's valleys

189
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,960
 but we don't know because we've never been there. We can fly drones overhead, we

190
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,840
 can sit on the beach, not on their beach because they'll kill us, but you can sit

191
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,760
 in a boat, look at them from a distance. They don't know how to write. They don't

192
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,120
 even know how to make fire. What we can tell is they wait for lightning to

193
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,880
 strike and they keep the fire going for as long as they can. Very very primitive

194
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:35,480
 people. There's a little bit of relation between, like I said, there's other

195
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,880
 tribes on the other islands in that area. There's a little bit of relation of the

196
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,280
 language between the Sentinelese and one other tribe but it's still such a

197
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,320
 far gap. They can't communicate with each other. So they're basically cut off

198
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,520
 even from their closest neighbor. We know that they, anything that washes up on

199
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,960
 the island they use, we've seen them with metal but they don't know how to do

200
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,840
 metal working. So when we see them with metal we go, "Oh they must be getting

201
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:05,120
 debris that washes up on the island, making these spearheads, making whatever."

202
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,400
 Dude, and you're thinking, Jason, you're reading a Wikipedia article about

203
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:15,240
 North Sentinel Island on board. No, because this gets really good. Trust me,

204
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,240
 I'm just have to set this stuff up because we're gonna go back to this stuff.

205
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,560
 The idea, that's the setup. The idea that the Sentinelese are guarding alien

206
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:29,600
 artifacts. Let's take a look at that. Now, of course, the planet's been around for

207
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,080
 billions of years. If there were ever aliens moving through the, so let's

208
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,300
 assume the aliens are the aliens coming from other planets, not

209
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,880
 interdimensional things like that for the sake of the story. Aliens coming through

210
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,440
 the galaxy and things like that. Over the course of four billion years, it's

211
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,840
 possible that artifacts and ships, I mean you have such a long period of time,

212
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,520
 things are dropped off on our planet and actually there have been some scientists

213
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:55,200
 that to look for proof of alien life, they're not looking up into the sky

214
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,720
 because that's such a small window of time. They want to look at the Earth and

215
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:05,280
 Mars and Venus for energy signatures that they believe would be coming from

216
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,600
 alien craft. And they said, well we know Venus is basically a big old hot swamp,

217
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,160
 not a literal swamp, like I used to believe. I said this in our earlier

218
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,840
 episode when I was a kid, I was taught that Venus had lush rainforest jungles

219
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,120
 full of dinosaurs. And that's why I was so cloudy and I believed that until I was

220
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,960
 about 15 and I would quote that all the time to people and no one was ever like

221
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:31,040
 "you're an idiot, that's not true." And I always wondered why whenever people talked

222
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,600
 about looking for a life on other planets, I'm like why are you worried about

223
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,840
 microbes on Mars? There's dinosaurs on Venus and I literally would tell people

224
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:42,840
 that and they would never question it. But anyway so there's no jungles on Venus.

225
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:47,640
 Any alien craft that crashed on Venus would have been liquefied by now, you

226
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:52,680
 know, given the time period of millions of years. But if an alien ship or an

227
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,800
 alien satellite or alien artifact was crashed or left behind on Mars or Earth,

228
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,600
 we should be able to detect some sort of energy signature from it. And that's one

229
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,760
 of the things with the idea of an alien artifact being left on North Sentinel

230
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,680
 Island. If it was just a piece of metal that had like, you know, alien

231
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,320
 graffiti on it, that's very interesting but it doesn't really help. It would be

232
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:17,440
 like yeah okay, an alien ship crashed here. But what people are looking for when we

233
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:22,000
 talk about alien artifacts isn't necessarily just a hunk of metal. It

234
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,960
 would be something that would be incontrovertible proof of alien technology.

235
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:32,520
 Is it alien technology? A piece of metal is a piece of metal. And you go oh an

236
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,640
 alien must have crashed here but a power source or a weapon or something like

237
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:43,040
 that is what we would really want to find. Something that would change, not just

238
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,240
 change our view of the universe and say yes there is living stuff out here, here's

239
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:52,280
 a picture of an alien like you know a Betty Boop alien on the side of a ship

240
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,320
 or you know like how they used to paint the World War II bombers. That would

241
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,400
 just be proof there's aliens. We would want some sort of artifact that would

242
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,480
 give us free energy or teach us the secrets of the universe or something

243
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,640
 like that. And if those things existed on this planet we should pick up the

244
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,320
 energy signature. We haven't on North Sentinel Island. So you're thinking well

245
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,400
 Jason okay then I guess you are saying there's no alien artifacts on North

246
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,280
 Sentinel Island. Then I say don't interrupt me. Not done. And I'll go back to

247
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,120
 this. A little bit of pushback on detecting for alien signatures. It's

248
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,800
 possible that there would be alien signatures in our solar system. We just

249
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,600
 don't have the technology to decipher what it is. We don't know what it is. If

250
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,920
 they're not using nuclear or chemical or something like that they may be using

251
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:37,080
 some sort of power source or artifact that's undetectable. So a little bit of

252
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,160
 pushback on that. I'm not so sold on the idea that if an alien artifact was here

253
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,480
 we would detect it but we're giving it our best shot trying to detect these

254
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,640
 things. I don't think there's alien technology on North Sentinel Island. I

255
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,040
 don't believe the Sentinelese are protecting alien technology. This is

256
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,800
 what I think. And I have I have some interesting I don't want to say evidence

257
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:04,200
 but I have some interesting facts to support this. Let's say I was an alien

258
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,320
 and I wanted to put something hide something on Earth that nobody would

259
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:14,240
 find. You could say you would could put it on a place that was going to be

260
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:20,560
 guarded by a bunch of prehistoric people that wouldn't know what it was. So

261
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,680
 that you won't have to worry about them dealing with it. However here's the thing.

262
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:28,240
 You wouldn't necessarily know when you put it there that somebody else a more

263
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,800
 powerful government wasn't just going to show up and take it. You could say I'm

264
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,360
 gonna put it here and these people around it will never know what it is. But

265
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,280
 there's a always a chance that somebody else will just go in. If this tribe was

266
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,920
 located anywhere else in the world at any other point in time they would have

267
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,360
 just been taken over. Like all the other indigenous people on the planet. It's

268
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:52,200
 just because this isn't a super strategic area where you know all of this

269
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,600
 stuff started really coming out like the 1800s where they're like I just kind of

270
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,200
 leave them alone. But if it was a more strategic area and if it was in the 1400s

271
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,640
 when these people were discovered and all this stuff going on they would have

272
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,560
 just been taken over. Nowadays there's enough land enough resources and stuff

273
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,680
 like that that they don't have to deal with this island that has enough to

274
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,240
 natural. So if you were an alien race and you wanted to hide something yes. Hiding

275
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,040
 it among an indigenous population who don't know what it is is a good idea.

276
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,920
 But if they had done this with a Navajo, it was just the Navajo God-seem world who

277
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,680
 would have found this huge reactor. If it landed there accidentally, if an alien

278
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,200
 didn't purposely put it there, if it landed there accidentally then the same

279
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,440
 thing. Eventually the chances of somebody sumlin across it and if it landed

280
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,840
 there accidentally it could have landed anywhere, it could have landed in New York

281
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,400
 City, it could have landed in North Sentinel Island. In New York City they

282
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,200
 wouldn't have known what it was, in North Sentinel Island they wouldn't have, but

283
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,760
 then they're not necessarily guarding it. It's just a piece of wreckage that's

284
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:53,360
 there and they're there as well. But what if the alien knew that no one was going

285
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:59,080
 to go there? The alien knew for a fact that for hundreds of years no one was

286
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,760
 ever going to go there, that group of people were going to be left alone by

287
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,920
 the government of India. They knew for a fact that was going to happen. You would

288
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,800
 put it there because you'd have the best of both worlds. You'd have a group of

289
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,000
 people who would have no idea what it was. They'd probably stay away from it if it

290
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,800
 was too creepy and you knew no one would go to discover it. You would actually be

291
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,840
 able to say we know eventually they're going to discover it in the year like

292
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,720
 2100 or 2055 or whatever, but we're gonna place this here now and we know if for

293
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,640
 the next 500 years no one's going to mess with it because of all these policies

294
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,520
 with India and the way that people are structured and all that stuff. Now of

295
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,520
 course this... okay we're coming to the end here. Of course they would have no

296
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,200
 way of predicting if India was going to go there tomorrow, 400 years ago, or 300

297
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:47,680
 years in the future. Aliens wouldn't know that, but time travelers would. They're

298
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,120
 not guarding alien artifacts on North Sentinel Island. They're guarding a

299
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:58,280
 time machine. Hear me out. And let me back up here. If this conspiracy is true,

300
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:02,120
 I'm not saying that it's true, but let's assume that they are guarding something.

301
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:07,040
 For the sake of the narrative, they're guarding a time machine because in the

302
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,920
 future they would know for a fact how history would play out. They would know

303
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,040
 that they would try to make contact with the tribe. The tribe wouldn't want it.

304
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,160
 The government of India would step in and say nobody contact this tribe. People

305
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:23,400
 from the future would know how even... and they would know for a fact in the year 2049

306
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,280
 eventually someone does go to the island and that's when we move to time machine.

307
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,520
 But for now we're gonna put it here. It's perfect location because it is

308
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,640
 completely isolated. It's an island that you cannot get to. You will be arrested

309
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,680
 if you go to and you survive. If you die, you die. But it's close enough to the

310
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:47,960
 mainland that you can leave the island and get to the mainland. Sri Lanka, India,

311
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:53,720
 wherever you want to go. It's possible that the people, the North Sentinelese,

312
00:22:53,720 --> 00:23:00,320
 were brought from the past by the time travelers, bring them from the past in

313
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,600
 Africa and put them on the island. That's why the language doesn't match up.

314
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,800
 They're there to guard the time machine. They said we're gonna go back to Africa.

315
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,240
 We're gonna get this tribe of people. We're gonna put them on this island. We'll

316
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,720
 take care of them. We'll give them the metal they need. Maybe make a lightning

317
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,080
 strike every once in a while to give them fire. We'll watch over them because

318
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,120
 they're going to protect this time machine that will give us access to come

319
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,840
 and go as we please. Where we're completely concealed, we're close enough to

320
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:34,160
 the mainland. And you go, okay Jason, interesting theory. But do you have any

321
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:39,560
 proof? I'll say this. I have more proof of that theory than of alien artifacts. And

322
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:47,160
 this is why. In 2004, the Indian Ocean earthquake, the Boxing Day earthquake,

323
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:53,680
 massive earthquake, huge tsunami, hundreds of thousands of people killed.

324
00:23:53,680 --> 00:24:01,500
 Just devastated the coastlines of that area. North Sentinel Island, the

325
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,920
 earthquake was so powerful it lifted it up three to seven feet in some areas.

326
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:11,200
 Just completely crumpled the ground underneath it. Massive tsunami, hit

327
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,080
 North Sentinel Island, hit the rest of the Andaman Islands. As the world was

328
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,720
 starting to put everything back together after the tsunami, officials in India

329
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:24,840
 said they're all dead. The Sentinelese are all dead. The other tribes on those

330
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,960
 islands are all dead. That tsunami wiped out all the coastlines in this area.

331
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,960
 Those islands had no chance. Let's get a helicopter and fly overhead and confirm

332
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,880
 what we already know. Helicopter flies overhead. They see a villager come out,

333
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,840
 shake his spear angrily at the helicopter. Helicopter goes, well at least

334
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:50,120
 there's one of them. None of them died. None of them. As far as we can tell, they

335
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:55,600
 just went on as normal. This massive tsunami and earthquake that devastated

336
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,600
 the lives of millions of people and took the lives of hundreds of thousands of

337
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:05,760
 people, didn't even scratch a population between 40 and 500. The official line is

338
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,120
 that there, because they're such a primitive society, they're used to

339
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,560
 being a tune to nature and they could tell the animals were acting weird. They

340
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,240
 could tell the birds were acting weird and all this stuff. They found high

341
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:20,360
 ground. The other tribes in the area also found high ground because they didn't

342
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:26,280
 suffer massive casualties. So they knew it was coming in a way. They used their

343
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:30,440
 nature-based instincts for being so close to the earth they knew something was

344
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:36,600
 coming. I have another theory. They were warned from the future. Get to higher

345
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:43,080
 ground. Their God spoke to them. And the time tribe, people from the future, not

346
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,600
 only would they know that was going to happen, they would warn the people on

347
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,760
 the other islands as well because it would look weird if only the sentinels

348
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,560
 survived the tsunami and all the other tribes are wiped out. You just go to the

349
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,800
 other tribes and say, "Hey, get to high ground. Make sure you're at high ground

350
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,360
 before such and such time tomorrow. Disguise yourself as a villager." They

351
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,120
 wouldn't know. Make it as some sort of miracle or maybe the leaders of the

352
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:09,760
 other tribes are from the future. But for whatever reason, they were warned

353
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,640
 whether it was their own natural instinct or a message from somebody who

354
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,120
 knew what was going to happen. They suffered. As far as we can tell, no

355
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,160
 casualties. Their society definitely continues. And its higher coastlines, like

356
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,960
 I said, were destroyed. You can watch the YouTube footage of the tsunami and

357
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,800
 imagine a prehistoric village surviving that. Is it possible that there is a

358
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,640
 time machine on North Sentinel Island? When I started looking at the theory

359
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,440
 that the sentinels were guarding alien artifacts, like I said, I figured there

360
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,280
 wasn't anything there. But what I found is far more interesting than why I could

361
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:50,640
 have thought of originally. I have no proof of any of this, just facts that can

362
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,680
 be put together in any way because that's one of the problems with facts.

363
00:26:54,680 --> 00:27:01,600
 But I will say this, if I had a time machine, I would put it someplace that I

364
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:08,160
 knew not only no one would ever go to, but the people there would have no idea

365
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:14,040
 what it was. And North Sentinel Island is the perfect place in the modern world

366
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:18,200
 for a time machine from the future.
