 Are children really the future of mankind or telepathic freaks ready to expose our secrets?
 And then we attend a real-life exorcism to take a look at a story of a Monsignor
 who had been expelling demons left and right a professional exorcist who's traveled around the world
 But his biggest challenge ever
 Sending a human soul back to hell that soul
 Belong to Judas today on Dead Rabbit Radio
 Hey everyone welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter. I'm having a great day
 I hope you guys are having a great day - we got a ton of stuff to cover
 So we're gonna get started right away sliding into Dead Rabbit Command on a ocean of milk
 It's totally flooding. I hope you're not lactose intolerant. You may die this episode

 That's fine, too. Just help spread the word about the show really really helps out a lot milk umochi
 We're gonna give you some gloves and some boots
 Now you're just a silly puddle of milk with there's boots and gloves there and we're gonna shovel you in
 We're gonna put you in buckets and just put the bucket in the Dead Rabbit Robo
 Everyone grab an ore we're leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We are headed out - I didn't think this one out
 There's no water where we're going to we circle around America and we end up in a small town in suburban America
 We're gonna crash this party with so over like who wants free milk look at mochi's like no no don't drink me don't drink
 Who wants free milk?
 There's this dude named Mike. It's his birthday party and he's sitting there and he's an adult
 He's like in his 20s and he's like has a little birthday
 Still likes birthday hats and he has the pinata and balloons and everything he's sitting there and his five-year-old niece
 Natalie walks up and goes hi uncle Mike. I love you so much. I drew a picture of you
 And he's like the cheapskate. That's the only gift you can get come on
 I know you get allowance good she shows him the picture and the pictures in the show notes
 But I'll describe it to you because some of you are driving you guys are trying to look it up
 Cars are sliding everywhere. You hit a giant puddle of milk. It's a picture of a birthday cake. It's all poorly drawn
 I think he's five she's five so don't expect to see some Thomas can Kate stuff
 It's a birthday cake and then there's a man. These are all stick figures. There's a stick figure sitting in a chair
 There's another stick figure on what appears to be their knees in
 front of the man in the chair and
 Then there's a third stick figure who is identified as a woman has a long hair like how a little girl would draw a woman
 Stick figure and she has her hands to her face
 She's sad Mike's looking at this picture and he's like what one one tarnation is this I love you uncle Mike
 You save that forever
 She goes back
 Who's the drink more milk? So why are we talking about this this child's drawing?
 There was a post online recently where it was like misunderstood children's drawings like isn't it so funny?
 It's supposed to be this thing, but it's really this other thing. You had all these responses. Oh that one's fake
 That one's real da da da da da da da da, but in the middle of all that stuff is a deleted post. It's actually been removed from the internet
 Now I have also posted his post on I put it in the show notes, but I removed his name
 I actually took a screenshot of it. I was so interested by the story when I saw it
 I took a screenshot
 But I posted so you could actually see what he wrote I removed any identifying information from the post itself because obviously he doesn't
 Want this part to remain out there connected to him, but he says I got this picture from my five-year-old niece
 The weirdest thing is and again this was all about like children's drawings like funny children's runs that could be misinterpreted
 He goes I asked her what's going on in this picture and she goes
 I don't know she goes that's you in the chair
 But I don't know who that person is by you and he points to the woman who's walking away goes
 Who's that and she goes that's your girlfriend?
 She's sad
 And he said he goes what is really terrifying?
 Was at the time not all this birthday party was going on
 But he goes in this period of time. I was cheating on my girlfriend
 when my girlfriend left he goes I had more than one woman swing by my place and
 Give me a blowjob. We weren't sleeping together
 Eaton's not cheating. This was his motto. He goes. There's no way she would have known that
 There's no way at all. She would have known that
 But here is a drawing of what was going on now
 According to this this is gone now. We have the screenshot, but there's no follow-up to this that I could find
 So it's not like his girlfriend caught him
 But one of the things I've never cheated on anyone in a relationship
 But one of the things about when you do cheat on someone in the relationship, they know
 They know so his girlfriend probably was sad because she knew something was off and she couldn't figure it out. I find that super
 Fascinating and so funny. I saw that it was so fascinating to me. I took a screen. I read
 nonsense all the time and I saw that and it stuck with me and I read that during the vacation I
 Took a screenshot, which I'm glad I did. I you know stuff gets deleted all the time
 And it's a one-off creepy story, right? This guy is engaging in a horrible act
 He's cheating on his significant other and this child somehow knows what's going on
 She she says I don't know what the person's doing down between like the little girl wasn't drawing a sex act
 But she was somehow seeing this she didn't know what it was though and
 What's so funny about this is I have a similar story that I have had in my maybe folder for over a year
 I researched this 400 episodes ago, and I thought it was too creepy
 Even for a radio. I thought it was too weird and too disturbing even for dead rabbit radio, but it is so related to this
 Milk-o-mucci get behind the wheel of that Jason Jalopy. We're driving a couple houses down
 It's the same neighborhood is a really weird neighborhood or once again in a suburban neighborhood in America
 I presume it could be in the Balkan states where I know but we're walking into this house. It's really nice
 Really nice house. There's a little party going on people drink and wine watching the big game
 And as you kind of move through the house you start to see like the crowd gets a little younger
 So now it's like teenagers and stuff like that. Hey walla you want to go play ping-pong?
 Where's the beaver at apparently this house is in the 1950s this story actually takes place in the early 2000s
 But you know how parties kind of break out you have the adults hang out the little kids are normally hanging out with the adults
 Then you have the middle kids are kind of making their own group and then the teenager
 It's a pretty big party and in this crowd of people
 There's a young man named
 What I'm gonna make up a name if this is his actual name if you're listening to this and this happened to you and your name
 Having to be Jones. I apologize, but we're gonna meet this young man named Jones
 And before this party even starts I have to go back in time a little bit before this party even starts
 Jones is sitting at home alone. It's early 2000s. He's just hanging out listening to some 41 and he comes up with an idea
 It's like some 41
 Will make me think of this next thing some 41 makes him think hmm. I wonder what it would be like to
 Taste my own ejaculate
 He used those words I don't think he was dr. Rangstein, but he thinks I wonder what happened if I tasted this stuff
 Wonder what happens. He's not gonna turn into a month. He's not gonna turn into Frankenstein
 It's not that he was just wondering he was curious about tasting it
 But he's this guy is Jones
 Thing Jones is a go-getter Jones does he's not just gonna like put it in a cup
 like some lame-o Jones actually comes up with the idea to
 Somehow do this apparently apparently he belongs to Cirque du Soleil
 He's going to not only taste his own ejaculate. He's going to ejaculate into his own mouth
 So he's gonna like
 He gets a hot wheels track and makes a loop-de-loop or something like that
 I assume he's standing on his arms standing on his hands at this point
 Anyways, he comes up with this idea to ejaculate in his own mouth and he does and then he instantly regrets it
 Right. He which which is the post-coital regret
 He's like that was
 One I didn't turn into the wolf man to my arms are super uncomfortable three
 This this is grow this is just gross in my mouth the next day
 So that all happened the day before the party next day. It's the party. Hey now you're an all-star
 He's so glad some 41 is not playing on the radio. He could never listen to that band again
 So I can on the parties doing finger guns to people. Oh, Joan. You're such a crack up
 Do you ever call someone he's like a cut up oh that guy's such a load
 That's mid from now on when someone's really funny be like dude. You're such a load
 So that joke makes sense. Anyways, he's walking around he goes and he's on the trampoline in the backyard
 There's this big trampoline in the backyard everyone's bouncing up and down on it and
 There's all these kids all these young people teenagers everything are jumping on this giant trampoline
 one of the people on the trampoline is this boy named opi and
 He was mute. He was deaf and he was mentally challenged, but that's okay. It's a trampoline, right?
 You don't need any of that stuff to enjoy bouncing up and bouncing up and down and almost breaking your limbs every three seconds
 So Jones is bouncing on the trampoline opi's bouncing on the trampoline a bunch of people are bouncing on the trampoline
 But over time
 Families are like Betty time to go home. Oh, oh your dad's such a load. Oh those jokes. He was telling
 Time over time
 People are leaving the party till eventually only Jones and opi are bouncing up and down
 On this trampoline the sun barely peeking over the mountain range a crow a crow is sitting watching the two young men
 still on the trampoline
 Jones Jones is not aware of the sinister events him and opi are bouncing on trampoline by themselves and then opi
 Kind of like does a little belly flop just are doing tricks
 Super showing off he kind of jumps down and then he's sitting there and opi stares at Jones and starts
 laughing
 But opi's laughing and Jones is kind of still bouncing on the trampoline being like why is he why is he laughing?
 opi's like younger than him opi's younger teenager and
 Jones is still bouncing up and down on the trampoline and opi is kind of rocking back and forth laughing and
 Is pointing at Jones laughing and Jones kind of starts bouncing slower and slower and goes. Why are you laughing at me?
 He said that opi pointed at his crotch and started pretending to masturbate and then pointing out his mouth
 While the whole time with his other hand pointing at me and he's laughing
 Jones has lost all interest in the trampoline at this point no bouncing allowed. He's just staring at opi
 And he thought there was no way
 There is no way this kid
 Could have known what I did
 Was just yesterday. I totally regret doing I instantly regretted doing it and here it is just me and opi on this trampoline and he
 knows my shame
 Jones just kind of shook his head, but he knew that the kid was right
 Jones
 Takes one final jump off the trampoline and heads back inside the house
 It's creepy. It's so funny because I didn't tell that story one because I don't want to embarrass the guy even though he posted it online
 I assumed at some point he would erase it. It has been erased
 -
 It's more sexually suggestive than a lot of stuff I cover on the show three. It's downright disturbing
 I find this really fascinating and find the story really fascinating
 Because what you have is two children spread across these stories take place across different decades and they're able to not only see
 Something they shouldn't have information about but they're actually able to see a secret the narrators are trying to hide
 It's not like they're thinking. Oh, you had grapes today, right? Did you have grape jelly all over your shirt?
 They're actually seeing something that you would remain that you wished would remain hidden
 It's like they're tapped into some sort of guilt matrix
 Very odd detail could be completely made up could be a one-off thing
 I thought it was weird that I've come across at least two cases of this and you wonder if it happens more often
 That more I'm not saying all children, but there could be a lot of children out there who are able to
 tap into other people's sins
 They can't make sense of them because these sins are so adult
 The emotions are so adult the actions are so adult and the children can't really understand
 What they're seeing or sensing
 So they have to use childlike terms to describe it
 But here's the thing we all know we all know children are creepy by default
 So if even a few of them have this power
 No more no more babies. No more babies can be born now the next time babies are like walking by I'm like move along
 Nothing to see here. No mental stuff to see here. They see me eat a bunch of grapes drinking my patreon supporters milk you mochi
 Let's go ahead and call in that carbonicop to relieve me behind the suburban neighborhood. We are headed out to
 the Vatican City
 This is a really cool story that was sent to me by AZ
 Really really appreciate this one. It's funny when he sent it over to me
 I kind of thought it was a joke not that he was playing a joke on me his live or fools
 It's that it sounded funny when I first heard of it and then I looked into it and it's quite terrifying
 It was a nice little twist. I was like I liked being surprised on the story. So thank you, AZ
 We're in Vatican City and we are here just in time. We're attending a
 Exorcism
 seminar
 You're like dude, this is so awesome. We sold that movie. I brought my own holy water. No, we're it's a stuffy
 It's a stuffy seminar. There's a slide projector
 Super boring, but we're sitting there and Monsignor Steven Rosetti is he's doing the slideshow
 He's doing this presentation about exorcisms
 and
 He's talking about this case he had a
 There was an exorcism that took two
 Years to complete. That's one thing a lot of people get confused about exorcisms
 They think it's like the movie you just show up do a couple rituals
 Maybe it takes like a day or two throw some holy water say the right words demon spins around jumps out finds the nearest trampoline
 Wee wee there's a little kid sitting on it. He was like, oh, this is not gonna end well for me
 I got a lot of secrets
 Exorcisms can take a long period of time which is an interesting tidbit, which is an interesting exorcism tidbit
 It's not generally a one night thing
 So they'll often take breaks they'll often we covered a story about that a long time ago
 It's actually the one episode of the show that gave me nightmares. I'll put it in the show notes
 Where the exorcists took a break and they shouldn't have and really bad things happen
 I actually had nightmares after recording that episode, but
 You have this Monsignor they're doing this exorcism for two years they get a couple demons out
 The guy's doing okay demons show back up continue the exorcisms or he just they had some just holding on that whole time
 But two years into this they're doing this
 Exorcism and one of the things is you want to know the demons name you want to know who you're dealing with so a lot of times
 You'll compel them to tell you their name
 so the Monsignor is demanding to know this demons name and
 It gives a name that the Monsignor didn't expect you do because you heard the intro to this episode, but he didn't expect it
 This demon really this spirit says I am Judas is
 cariat
 This person's eyes go from side to side. I don't know if I pronounced that right, but I am Judas
 I'm the dude who sold Jesus out to the Romans for 30 pieces of silver
 If you haven't attended if you've never attended Bible school
 He was one of the disciples who's the traitor he betrayed Jesus and said he's over there and the Romans grabbed Jesus
 held the quote-unquote trial crucified him Jesus comes back to life
 There
 School now you got it. You got the whole story Judas is obviously obviously. He's a
 Pivotal evil figure evil human figure in biblical tradition. He is the one who turned in Jesus Christ
 So Monsignor Steven Rosetti is looking at this dude and he's like
 On the bed and he's talking and saying I'm Judas and now
 Steven Rosetti says listen, I have been doing exorcisms for a long time and I've never encountered
 Someone possessed by a ghost
 He says that after this exorcism and I'll get into how they get rid of Judas in a second
 But after the exorcism he talks to other exorcists and he goes hey guys you won't believe what happened
 They're like Judas. He's like, what do you know?
 apparently Judas had been popping up in
 Possessions it's not super common
 But he does there's actually a exorcism case that lasted from
 1975 to 1978 it was a woman in Switzerland
 There's actually a transcript of that
 Exorcism it'll be in the show notes originally I was going to do like a dramatic reading of it
 I decided not to
 Decided not to be in the haunted closet playing the role of an actual evil spirit repeating the words
 So you can do that you can do that at home, but basically I'll sum it up for you
 It's the priest compelling him to leave and Judas mean like now I like it here boss
 There's a lot of stretching actually that's a little more dramatic than actually is but he's telling him a leave and Judas is like
 No, no, and then Judas is like you don't understand like the priest. I I'm a little so I'm a little sauce
 Authentic it is but Judas is basically like you the priest today suck because they don't teach the way that Jesus wanted them
 The guy's like writing it down. He's like I hope the Pope gets this
 This is my complaint letter to him basically Judas is complaining that
 Satan not even complaining. He's saying that Satan's winning and here's all the ways to defeat Satan
 But I'm kind of poking you I'm kind of poking you and saying you'll never defeat me because you guys aren't teaching the eight
 Cataclysms you're only teaching the six so it's a little suspect on that, but anyways, it wasn't interesting reading
 I'm just gonna read the words of a departed spirit in my haunted closet, and it was super long
 He's talking to these other exorcists, and they say oh no, we've encountered Judas as well
 And one thing he found in common with all these other exorcists and his experience as well
 Nearly impossible to remove
 nearly impossible to
 Exercise out of the human body the Monsignor says that he has gone toe to toe with some high ranking demons
 There's a method to this an exorcism at its core is basically
 Scientific for lack of a better term you had like science you want to add baking soda and vinegar
 You make you make the volcano that's how volcanoes are born
 You know it's gonna do it the exact same time you get the measurements right same thing with exorcisms
 You say the right words you command the right things use the right items like holy water holy relics the demon will leave the body
 The none of this is working on Judas holy water. He's taking a bath. He's like more more. I'm so filthy from being possessed
 The rights weren't working on the exorcism rights were working and the Monsignors thinking about this again
 This isn't a one-day thing that they're dealing with Judas. He's thinking about it. He goes Jesus in the Bible
 Jesus gives his disciples the ability to
 Command demons out of bodies. That's one of the powers that Jesus passes on to his followers
 But it's fallen angels is specifically what they have the power to get rid of not fallen humans
 Jesus like I'll teach you guys that tomorrow. He's flying up to heaven. No, no, I think we're gonna need that
 He's like bye. See you when I come back
 so they don't know that skill and he goes we tried everything to exercise this man of
 Judas he wouldn't leave
 Apparently what happened is the end the Virgin Mary showed up. I don't know
 Here's the thing here's the thing I believe in demons and I believe in exorcisms and stuff like that
 I don't know how this happened. I don't know if she came like in the vision
 I don't know she walks through the door and they're like whoa, and it's like you and Judas Judas actually nothing about Jews
 Judas would know her
 Judas probably in real life outside of outside of the exorcism Judas would have met Jesus his mom
 You have the disciples over for dinner. Mary's like making a bunch of like food make much of lasagna. They're like, whoa
 This is magical. This doesn't exist back now and she's like, I know it's gonna be super delicious someday
 He would have known her but anyways the Virgin Mary shows up. I don't know if it was a vision
 I don't know if she physically showed up
 If she physically if she physically showed up, I think he would have gone with that
 I don't think he would have told this whole story about Judas first. He would show up the Vatican be like guys
 I know we're having an exorcism seminar, but you won't believe what just happened the Virgin Mary just showed up
 She's walked into a room and they're like why'd she walk in the room? He's like, okay
 Now let me tell you the Judas story because you don't bury the lead on the Blessed Virgin Mary just walking into a room
 Being like hey guys, what's up got any lasagna? How's my lasagna recipe doing?
 Mary comes down and she compels Judas to leave this young man's body and that's when Judas is like I'm out and
 He floats away the spirit floats away. It's an interesting story again
 There's a lot of ifs if you're skeptic
 It's just kind of a fun story if you believe in demons and things like that. It's actually incredibly chilling
 Because the one thing you want to hope for is if you do get possessed by a demon, which is one thing you don't want
 There's a lot of things you don't want you want to get attacked by someone possessed by demon either
 But you want to at least believe that someone could rescue you someone could pull your consciousness out of that demonic control
 And we have all these safety mechanisms and all of these prayers and rituals that can help
 Reverse the demonic possession, but now they're running into something that is immune to all of that
 And it's a fellow human not just a human, but one of the most reviled humans in
 Biblical tradition
 Possessing people
 The idea of whether or not a human can possess somebody is
 Theologically divisive
 Some say they shouldn't be able to do that. That's the province of demons. That's something that demons have the ability to do
 They can corrupt you they can make promises to you. They can trick you
 But the idea of someone being possessed by a ghost is
 It's not unheard of
 But it's so rare
 The only other instance I could really think of we covered it back on episode
 367 the patriarch there was an allegation. It was never proven
 There's an allegation that the father of the family was possessed by the grandfather of the family and he murdered everyone or convinced them to kill themselves
 I think
 But being possessed being possessed by demons is synonymous. That's really what possession is demonic possessions being possessed by an earth human is quite rare and
 There's the and we don't even know if that was the case in the patriarch episode
 The question is is could it happen at all? Like it would basically be like you have a house and then it's possessed by another house
 It would be like two houses mixed together, but you know what I mean like a human soul and
 A human soul not in a body. How do those interact? It's the same thing
 The demon would latch on to some sort of parasite. It's almost designed for demonic possession
 It's almost designed to take control of you now a demon can pretend to be a human
 Right a demon could pretend to be a human and you think you're possessed by a human
 But the same exorcism rights would work against that thing because they're not actually a human
 This thing claiming to be Judas apparently was Judas none of the proper rights of exorcism would work on this dude
 And I actually think being possessed by a ghost might be scarier
 Because you imagine that demons live in this world
 They're looking at the game board the idea of the demonic war between heaven and hell is they have an endgame
 They go we know eventually Jesus is going to come back
 We're gonna have this huge battle and Armageddon
 We're quote-unquote prophesies to lose but we think we can actually win we think we can do this
 So let's summon our troops. We see people are starting to live really good lives
 We see someone who's gonna end up inspiring millions. Let's go to them. Let's ruin their lives
 We see this person out here. They're making a difference in their community. Let's go to them
 Let's get them addicted to drugs like we are looking at this game board
 And if we can keep upsetting the pieces if we keep attaching ourselves to these people
 Who are trying to better themselves try to better the world?
 We can maybe
 Pull out a W in the end
 The demons are looking at this huge battle plan
 There's seven billion and counting moving pieces and
 The demons may be looking at these things where we're gonna put our forces here. We're gonna deal with this
 We're gonna do this you just moving through the masses of humanity may go unknown
 May be totally unseen
 You're not a pivotal player in this war between heaven and hell just like me just a dude living life
 Trying to make the best of it, but since the ghost has no plan
 It's just energy. It's angry energy. It's mad that it didn't get what it wanted on earth
 Everyone's a target
 Not just the youth ministers not just the drug counselors not just the politicians
 Every single person can fall victim to a possessed human
 Doesn't matter who you are. It doesn't matter what you plan on doing. It doesn't matter what you've done in the past
 Everyone is a target
 That is terrifying
 When you go into politics, you know people are gonna write you nasty letters
 You know people may try to assassinate you you know that there will be spiritual forces trying to go to you one way or the other
 You don't expect that when you're the garbage man
 You don't expect that when you're a video game tester
 You don't expect that when you're just a student
 But there you are
 Looking at your reflection in the mirror one day
 You get a flash of something else
 behind your own eyes
 You never played a Ouija board you never went to have your tarot cards read you never engaged in anything that could open yourself up to
 demonic forces
 But sometimes when you're sitting at home eating dinner
 Your right hand shakes a bit
 When it reaches for that knife
 You never wanted to change the world you never wanted to do anything more than have fun
 But now you find yourself somehow
 Standing outside a stranger's home in the middle of a rainstorm
 You don't get to live your life now
 It lives your life
 It drives you it commands you it makes you do horrible things and you can just watch it
 from behind your own eyes
 And after you have annihilated families after you have led police on a multi-state
 Hunt it is not until you are tried
 convicted in sentence to death
 That the spirit of this vicious bloodthirsty human
 Leaves your body leaves you to sit in the cell leaves you to contemplate
 Leaves you the memories of the crimes it committed
 And when the appeals have run out
 When you yourself are being laid down on that metal bed a
 Needle inserted into your arm that will slowly inject medication that will stop your heart
 You pray for mercy, but none comes
