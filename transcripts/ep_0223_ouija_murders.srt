1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 What happens when your alibi is the worst alibi ever?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 And then we take a look at a topic that's particularly scary to me, and one of the reasons why I'll never use them.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 We're gonna look at murders caused by Ouija boards today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 [Music]

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host, Taysa Carpenter.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 I'm having a great day. I hope you guys are having a great day too.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 You know, I had this girl come over yesterday and she fengshui'd my apartment.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 She came over and she's like, "Move this here and move that there and do this and do that."

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 And you're thinking, "Why'd you let her boss you around for four hours right after you got off work?"

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Well, she brought a vacuum cleaner and a bunch of cleaning supplies.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 She could have turned the place into an ISIS training camp for all I cared. She brought a vacuum cleaner.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 The place looks, the place is spotless. Well, little asterisks next to that.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 The living room, kitchen, that whole area is spotless.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 I gotta move some boxes around in my bedroom, but yeah, I was just like, "Do whatever. I don't care."

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 And she's like, "Can I move this here?" I was like, "I don't care."

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 She's like, "What if this one here, I don't care. I really don't care.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 I'm not like totally picky about where stuff goes."

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 But she wanted to just fengshui'd it up. It looks great.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 She even made a little corner. She's like, "Here, let's put this pillow down on the ground."

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 So when girls come over, it looks to be a girl spot and I'm like, "That looks creepy."

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 I said, "If a sheriff walked into my apartment and saw what you set up right over there, he would have put me in handcuffs."

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 So that's the one thing I said I don't want.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 And I also said, "Don't touch my mic. Don't go anywhere near my mic.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 I don't want you even in that corner of the room."

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 And every so often, she'd be kind of walking around and she'd get over there and I'd be like, "Huh?"

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 She's like, "Oh, oh, sorry."

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 But thanks for coming over and totally cleaning my apartment.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 You know how many times I've tried kidding women to do that.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 They'll come over and let me do all sorts of horrible things to them,

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 but ask them to take the garbage out when they leave and they're like,

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 shocked that I would dare do a thing.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 And then this girl, just a friend of mine comes over and busts ass on a Sunday.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 She cleans it all up. So thank you.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 I'm not going to use your real name, but thank you, young maiden, for functuating my place.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 And we'll see if it works.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 It's definitely worth--

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 At one point, I flipped a carpet over because we couldn't vacuum it. It was too shaggy.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Because my apartment is kind of like a combination of floor rugs.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 And I flipped it over and about $3 in change fell out of it.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 I go-- it was almost like opening up a portal to another dimension.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 I didn't even know change could stick to a carpet, but apparently it can.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Anyways, thank you for functuating my apartment.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Anyway, okay, so, but let's go ahead and move on to our first story.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Now, our first story, let's take a little trip.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Let's take a trip to a police investigation room-- interrogation room.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 That's the word I'm looking for, interrogation room.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 We are in Washington Canyon, Virginia.

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 And there's two police detectives sitting around.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Do cops still smoke cigarettes?

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 I guess they probably can't smoke in doors either.

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 But there are two cops with nicotine patches sitting in this interrogation room.

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 And there's this 23-year-old kid sitting across the table from them.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 His name is James Michael Wright.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 It was very, very recent. This just came out in the news.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 So James is sitting there at the table.

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Two cops are sitting there chewing nicotine gum.

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Got some locenges in there as well.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 And so the cops are like, "James, you just have to tell us why you did it."

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 James is just sitting there and he goes, "I told you guys. I told you guys a hundred times."

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 It was an accident.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 It was an accident. Why won't you believe me?"

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 And the two cops look at each other and they go, "You accidentally murdered a person."

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 James is like, "Yes! Thank you! I'm so glad you finally got it."

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 And then the cops go, "You accidentally murdered three people on three separate occasions."

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 And he goes, "Finally, thank you. Can this nightmare end? Do you believe me now?"

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 James Michael Wright is a carny, or was a carny.

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 This is all a legend, but anyways, he was a carny.

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 He worked for this traveling carnival, which of course is like the most stereotypical occupation for a serial killer,

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 other than just putting on your resume serial killer.

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 So he's a carny and people started noticing that he was hanging out with these young women

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 and they weren't coming back. They were disappearing.

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 One of them was related to one of his coworkers at the carnival.

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 And then other ones were like girls that he met at the carnival.

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 But what happened was he got on a car accident. The cops had actually been looking for him.

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 But when he got on a car accident, the cops are like, "Oh, now we know where he's at."

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 He's in the hospital. So they went to the hospital to interview him.

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 And they started asking him about these girls that he was with.

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 So the first victim, the first person who had an accident was that it was February 28th, 2019.

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 So very, very recent, February 28th, James says, "Okay, listen, I was dating this girl

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 and we did get in a bit of a fight and during the fight, I accidentally shot her."

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 And then a barrister body by my house. And the cops are like, "That is completely ridiculous."

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 He's like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on."

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 So yes, it does sound a little convenient that I did happen to be engaged in a fight with somebody.

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 And then I accidentally shot them, but it can happen.

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Accidents happen. That's what we all know, right?

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 And the cops are like, "Oh, my God."

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 In March 9th, so what is that?

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 That's easy to do. Nine days later.

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 March 9th, he's having sex with this other girl in the middle of the woods.

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 And everything's fine. There's no fight, no problem at all.

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 So, and after they're done having sex, after they're done with the love-making session,

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 James and the woman get up and start walking through the forest and he sees an animal run by

93
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 and he pulls a swears to God, "This is what happened."

94
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 He sees an animal run by. He pulls his gun out to shoot the animal.

95
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 The animal is moving so fast and as he continues to aim his gun right when he thinks he can shoot the animal,

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 the gun is aiming at the back of the girl's head and he kills her.

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 Total accident. He did not mean to kill her, but he's like, "Great. This happened nine days ago.

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 I just accidentally killed someone. And again, I killed this person. This is terrible."

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 He then hides her body underneath a log by his house.

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 March 17th. How many days is that? It doesn't matter.

101
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 It's like, what, two weeks since the last one?

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Now imagine if this guy's telling the truth. He's not. But imagine if this guy's telling the truth.

103
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 How bad does your luck have to be to accidentally kill someone on the 28th?

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Because I can see you're getting in a fight and then maybe fighting over the gun or something stupid like that,

105
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 or you're in a fight and it's a crime of passion. I guess it's not really an accident,

106
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 but to accidentally kill someone on the 28th of February, nine days later, you accidentally kill someone else.

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 And I would just become a hermit, not hang out with anyone. On March 17th, James is just on a walk,

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 just on a nice nature stroll with this young woman. All these victims are like,

109
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 I think the youngest one was 16 and the oldest one was in her early 20s. They're all quite young.

110
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 He's walking with this woman, enjoying the nature. They didn't have sex. They haven't been in a fight.

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 He's thinking, he's in the clear. He's thinking, there's not going to be any accidents today.

112
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 I'm not going to instigate any way that I could possibly accidentally kill someone with this damn, damn gun.

113
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 And he pulls the gun out and he's looking at it and he trips on a log and shoots him in the back of the head.

114
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 And that's not it. Because then he's like, okay, great. Now I got to get rid of this body.

115
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 So he throws the body in the back of his pickup truck and while he's driving the pickup truck,

116
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 the body accidentally, accidentally, guys, police officers totally believe this,

117
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 accidentally the body flew out of the back of his pickup truck into the river.

118
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 And I don't think they found her body yet. But so obviously the cops don't believe any of this,

119
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 but the cops also have some other issues here.

120
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Their biggest one is he casually really killed three people in less than a month.

121
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Three women just shot him, quote, unquote, accidentally.

122
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 So now they're really thinking he was a carny. So that's incredibly suspicious.

123
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 But he worked for a type of company that moved from region to region.

124
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 So now police are having to go through every place that that carnival has been at with him

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 and having to match up victim profiles and stuff like that.

126
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 So definitely he's considered a serial killer because he killed three women,

127
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 but he may have killed a lot more, hopefully not, hopefully not.

128
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 I do though have to say I would have loved to just be in that interrogation room as he was valiantly trying to fight that.

129
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 These were all accidents, officer. These are all accidents. I totally didn't mean to do that.

130
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 Here, give me your gun and I'll show you. They're like, no, no, no, no, no.

131
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 Just stay there and we don't believe you. We need some more nicotine.

132
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 Let's go ahead and move on to our why can't cops smoke in an interrogation room?

133
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Actually, I'm kind of making a statement and I don't know. Maybe they can.

134
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 I doubt it. I'm sure some lawyer would be like, oh my God, my asthma.

135
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 But it's like that's very intimidating.

136
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Actually, you know what? I'm pretty sure they do smoke in interrogation rooms.

137
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 I'm pretty sure they do, but they should if they don't, they should be able to.

138
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 Because if you don't like cigarette smoke, BFD dude, you're in an interrogation room.

139
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 And if you don't mind smoke, just like, hey, officer, give me a cigarette and then you build that rapport.

140
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 So I had to take a nicotine break after talking about all that stuff.

141
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 Man, being addicted to stuff sucks.

142
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 But now we're going to talk about being actually that is a great segue.

143
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 We're going to talk about being addicted to Ouija boards.

144
00:09:37,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

145
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 It actually opens up a gateway and I have better things to do with my time and I don't want giant gateways opened up.

146
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 So I've always just kind of stayed away from them.

147
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Like my sister used to make them.

148
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 She's not like she was wood carver and stuff like that. She's like working for a factory.

149
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 She would make them somehow. She'd make them on paper, some cutting board or something like that.

150
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 Whatever. I've never just really liked them.

151
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 I've just never been, it's a combination of they're stupid and I'm scared of them.

152
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 So I don't mess with them.

153
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 It's funny because I'll do tarot cards and palm readings. I'll do tarot cards and I'll read palms.

154
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 I'm not letting anyone else do that stuff because I know how the gimmick works.

155
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 But you know, I'm not going to pay a psychic to do that stuff, but I know how to do it myself.

156
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 So I mean, like stuff like that I'm fine with.

157
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 I've never really done any sort of divination and any sort of mirror scrying or throwing chicken bones.

158
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 None of that stuff. But I think that the risk reward is less.

159
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 So I throw a couple chicken bones and just make them my floor dirty.

160
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 And then I'll have this girl come over and clean it up again.

161
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 No, that was a one-shot deal, man.

162
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 I don't think that that took a while for to convince someone to do that.

163
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Actually, she called me up and she goes, "Hey, I want to come over and punctuate your place."

164
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 I've been thinking a lot about it.

165
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 I have to keep it clean.

166
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 But anyways, that aside, it's just been something that I've always been really kind of like,

167
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 because I don't know.

168
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Like if I knew 100% that it was fake, I'd be like, fine, whatever.

169
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 No, no, even then it would be a waste of time.

170
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 But what I'm getting at, I think just by this introduction, you can kind of tell my relationship with Ouija boards.

171
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 It's not a love-hate relationship.

172
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 It's a don't-care-or-terrified relationship.

173
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 And then I read these articles and I realize, again, why I don't mess with Ouija boards.

174
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Why I don't mess with Ouija boards at all.

175
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Let's go ahead. Put our fears aside.

176
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 Put my fears aside. You may be fine with them, but let's put our fear aside.

177
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Climb into the dead rabbit-durgible.

178
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 And we're going to leave wherever we just were.

179
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 We're going to leave Virginia.

180
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 And as we're flying away, we hear the guy going, "I swear, God, it was an accident. It was an accident."

181
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 Officer, yuck, yuck. And we're flying away.

182
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 And we're going to Prescott, Arizona.

183
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 We're actually also going back in time to the year 1933.

184
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 So it's just everything's super dusty.

185
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 People are sepia-toned.

186
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 There's not a lot of food. The music sucks.

187
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 It's a terrible, terrible time to be alive.

188
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 The only good thing about being alive in the 1930s is knowing, like, let's say you were 20 in the '30s,

189
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 you would be 50 by the time the '50s rolled around.

190
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 Is my math right?

191
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 No, you'd be 40.

192
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 The only good thing about being alive in the '30s is knowing eventually you would, like, get to see, like, the Beatles and Elvis show up.

193
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 If you were elderly in the '30s, you were S-O-L.

194
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 That would be the worst thing to be.

195
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 But anyways, we're going back to 1933.

196
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 And we're going to meet a mother and her teenage daughter.

197
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 The mother is Dorothea Irene Turley.

198
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 That is an old name.

199
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 And if you thought that name was super old, her daughter's name is Maddie.

200
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 I actually know a girl named Maddie, and she's kind of cool.

201
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 She's a little weird.

202
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 But, what, she'll sue me now.

203
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 But anyways, so Maddie, I've known modern-day Maddies.

204
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 But Dorothea, I'd never...

205
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Dorothea is on the border of straight up calling someone diarrhea.

206
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 Or Dorothea diarrhea.

207
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Like, it's right on that board.

208
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Sorry if I have a listener named Dorothea.

209
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Dorothea was a regular user of a Ouija board.

210
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 She loved the Ouija board. It was something that she used all the time.

211
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 They were sold as both products of entertainment and a way to contact the debt.

212
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 But like anything, some people take it super, super seriously.

213
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Video games are meant to be an entertaining distraction/art form to some.

214
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 But some people like that's all they ever do.

215
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 This was her Super Smash Brothers, this Ouija board thing.

216
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 And she's sitting there with the Ouija board one day, and her and her teenage daughter are playing it.

217
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 There's dust everywhere. They have to keep dusting off the Ouija board.

218
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 And they're really hungry. They got no food.

219
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 But they do have this form of entertainment. They're playing the Ouija board.

220
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 And the Ouija board, for whatever reason, spells out for Maddie to kill her father.

221
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Now, if it's fake-- not the story, the story's real.

222
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 But again, if the Ouija board's fake, it's super easy to manipulate people with these things as well.

223
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 If Dorothea wanted her husband dead for whatever reason, it would be easy to make it go to kill Daddy or whatever like that.

224
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 But that wasn't the argument here.

225
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 At the time, Dorothea just goes, "Maddie, you have to do what the board says."

226
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 And Maddie's like, "Uh, I don't know about that."

227
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 And her quote, Dorothea's quote was, "The board cannot be denied."

228
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 Almost like a religious text, a voice from beyond telling them what to do.

229
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 So, Maddie goes, "We need to double check this. There has to be a way to verify this. Should we pray?"

230
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 And Dorothea's like, "No, no, no. I have these spirit cards we'll use. I'll use these spirit cards to see if this is the right path of action."

231
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 I don't know what they were. It could have been some spin-off of the Ouija board.

232
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 It could be a variation of tarot cards.

233
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 But anyways, they consulted their spirit cards, and it confirmed that Maddie had to kill her father.

234
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Now, her father is milking the cows at this time.

235
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 Like, it's in the middle, it's either early morning or mid-afternoon, because it's farm time.

236
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 This isn't late at night. He's not out of the bar or something like that.

237
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 He's getting milk so the family can survive.

238
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 And as he walks up, he gets these two pales of milk, and he's like, "Mmm, mm, mm, mm, can't wait to drink this cow pus, this unpasteurized cow pus."

239
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 He's carrying in and looking at how delicious it is. It's all clumpy.

240
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 His daughter grabs the shotgun and is walking behind him.

241
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 And he does-- I mean, dude, it's a farm. People are carrying shotguns all the time.

242
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 He's not even really thinking, "Why does my daughter have a shotgun?"

243
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 Imagine you right now walking down the street and you turn around and one of your relatives is carrying a shotgun behind you.

244
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 You'd be very, very worried. But back then, everyone had shotguns.

245
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 He's walking, and he sees his daughter behind him with the shotgun and doesn't think twice about it.

246
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 But, it suddenly gets two shotgun blasts through the back. He drops dead.

247
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 And it doesn't really say how the police get involved in this.

248
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 So maybe they noticed he was missing. I don't think the family would report it.

249
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 But anyways, the cops get involved and they arrest them.

250
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 And at first, the daughter, Maddie, says it was an accident.

251
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 I was walking with the shotgun, and I tripped and I fell and I shot him twice.

252
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 And the cops go, "That's a good story. It's a good story, kid."

253
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 But both shotgun blasts were in the exact same spot.

254
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 So you would have had to shoot and then re-aim it and shoot again, like the recoil.

255
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 And she's like, "Dagnabbit, physics! Physics got me again."

256
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 So then the story came out about, then she goes, "Well, my mom told me too, because the Ouija board told her too."

257
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 And it was this whole thing. So the police started to think that she wanted the husband dead, but Dorothy is like, "No, no, no, no, no."

258
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 The Ouija board made us. The Ouija board made us.

259
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 I never wanted him dead, but the Ouija board told me to, and the board can't be denied.

260
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 That's actually not a good defense in court.

261
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 But what happened to these people? Maddie, young teenage Maddie, was sent to a reform school.

262
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 That was it. One of those like hard-ass reform schools you see in those 70s exploitation films.

263
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 But this one was in the 30s, so again, just a dusty version of a mature girl sitting around smoking cigarettes.

264
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 She did that. The mom got sentenced to 15 years to life, but that ruling got overturned on appeal.

265
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 And she walked. Both people really didn't pay for the crime, and it was all because of Ouija board.

266
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 They blew this dude away. Super bizarre.

267
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 I would just imagine that they got found guilty, and then the appeal judge goes, "I don't know what to do. I don't know if she should be let go."

268
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 "Let me consult my Ouija board." The Ouija board's like, "Let her go. Let her go."

269
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 "Also kill your husband." And the circle continues. But that's not the only...

270
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 There's actually quite a few deaths by Ouija boards. I found them in this article from Mysterious Universe's website, which is a great website.

271
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 But these are the two most interesting ones. So the next one, if you want to read the other four, I mean, there's a ton of them.

272
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 But these are the two that I thought were the most interesting.

273
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 Let's hop back into the Dead Rabbit Durgable. We're going to Minko, Oklahoma.

274
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 This is February or 2001, so we're going to forget all that old-timey superstitious nonsense. This is new-timey superstitious nonsense.

275
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 This is 2001. This is February. And these people are sitting in this house in Oklahoma, and they're playing with their Ouija board.

276
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 Now, this one, we have a whole new group of characters. We have Carol. She's a grandma. She's 53 years old.

277
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 You have her adult daughter, Tammy, and then you have a 10-year-old granddaughter and a 15-year-old granddaughter.

278
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 And it's late one night, and they're playing the Ouija board. Now, again, Carol absolutely loved the Ouija board.

279
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 This was her Grand Theft Auto V. This is what she lived for. She's playing it all the time.

280
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 They're sitting around having fun with this Ouija board. And this night, they get a particular message.

281
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 This story is weird, by the way. If you thought the first one was just like, "Oh, maybe she tried murdering because she wanted to get out of marriage,"

282
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 then this one is straight up bizarre. They're playing with the Ouija board. And Tammy's husband is asleep in the bedroom, playing with the Ouija board.

283
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 And the Ouija board spells out to kill Tammy's husband, Brian. The family just kind of sits there for a second.

284
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 It's at night. Candles going. Spooky time. They're having fun, and it says to kill Brian.

285
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 And Carol's sitting there looking at the Ouija board. She stands up, goes into the kitchen, gets a knife.

286
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 Now, Tammy and the granddaughters are sitting in this room, as Carol's doing this.

287
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 They watch her go into the kitchen, grab a knife, go into the bedroom where Brian is asleep.

288
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 Tammy and her daughters are sitting in this living room here. They hear Brian cry out for help suddenly.

289
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 "Help me! Help me!" And they just sit there and do nothing until he stops moaning in pain and dies.

290
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 So Carol then comes out of the bedroom with the knife and tries to attack the 15-year-old granddaughter.

291
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 And at this point, Tammy wrestles the knife away from her. She's 53 years old. She's a grandma.

292
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 I'm pretty sure her daughter could take her, but she gets the knife away from the grandma and says,

293
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 "We have to go. We have to go. We have to go." Because now they are kind of snapping out of it.

294
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 There is a dead body. There is a murder victim in the next room that the grandma just killed.

295
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 So all the girls, and this is, again, is such a weird detail. All the girls pile into the car and they let the grandma drive.

296
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 The woman who just killed a dude, they go, "You drive. You drive shotgun," and the mom hops into the passenger seat.

297
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Crazy grandma gets in the driver's seat. They start driving on the road, and almost immediately, Carol, the grandma,

298
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 crashes the car into a street pole with the intent of killing all of them in a car accident.

299
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 It doesn't work, but she breaks both of her ankles. She then hobbles out of the car.

300
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Everyone hobbles out of the car at that point because it's a smoking mess.

301
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 She hobbles out of the car, walks up to her 15-year-old granddaughter and is like, "Ugh."

302
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 And she pushes her 15-year-old granddaughter into incoming traffic, almost getting hit by a car.

303
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 At that point, the grandma takes off through the forest.

304
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 When the cops find her a couple hours later, both ankles are still broken.

305
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 She's totally naked in the middle of the woods. No drugs or alcohol in her system.

306
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 No history of mental illness. No history of, like, high stress. No domestic strife in the house.

307
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 She just completely broke that night because of one message in the Ouija board, and she was sentenced to a psychiatric hospital.

308
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 And it's funny, because as I was telling that story, I realized I didn't verify any of that.

309
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 I got all of that stuff from one website, so I'm gonna take a quick break here, and I'm gonna make sure this story is true.

310
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Hold on one second. Yeah, totally true. Just looked it up. Actually happened.

311
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 It's so funny, because as I was reading that, I was like, "This sounds too good to be true."

312
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 And when I was doing the research, sometimes I get caught up in the research, and it's not until I start talking about it out loud,

313
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 that I go, "Hmm, that sounds a little weird." Nope, totally true.

314
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 Tons of news articles on actual news websites, local news websites talking about this murder.

315
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 It's weird because I had never heard of it. And you think it would be something that is more well known.

316
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 A Ouija board driving a woman to kill. Fairly recently, within our lifetimes,

317
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 a woman who by all accounts was totally normal before this night, getting a message and murdering a person,

318
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 and then attempting to murder other people, and then running away with broken feet,

319
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 and then finding her naked in the middle of the woods.

320
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 We talk about on this show, we talk about portals and haunted places and cursed places and things like that.

321
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 But there's something uniquely terrifying about being able to curse the place you're in right now, almost by accident.

322
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Accidents have kind of been a big theme this episode, but I don't think when, I think at the very most, Carol and Tammy and the granddaughters

323
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 thought this was a fun game that they talked to spooky ghosts.

324
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 But the idea of it inviting in some sort of malevolent demon into that house that prompts this insane series of events

325
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 that took place over the course of maybe what, a half hour, if that, to go from a loving family to a murder.

326
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 Tammy was actually accused of accessory to murder, because helping the grandma kind of get away, but those charges were dropped.

327
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 But to go from a peaceful family environment to a murder, a getaway, multiple attempted murders,

328
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 and then someone doing what would seem to be physically impossible, running out into the dark night with broken legs,

329
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 stripping their clothes off as they run wild through the forest and dark branches scratching their skin,

330
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 what was her, what was she going through mentally?

331
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 What visions and things were she seeing in her head?

332
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 And the thing is, is like, I honestly don't know which version of this story is scarier.

333
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 We have a version where a family's playing with a Ouija board at night, it's dark, the candles are lit,

334
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 and somewhere in those shadows something is opened.

335
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 And a dark force, a demon, is crawling through the darkness of the living room towards Carol.

336
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 It's unseen to the rest of the family.

337
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 They're just having fun with this game, and this creature is creeping up behind them.

338
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 A shadow in a world of shadows, and it creeps up her back and crawls into her brain and turns her into a murderer.

339
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 Or, none of that happened, but a totally perfectly normal human being who never committed a violent act in their life,

340
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 who snapped and murdered a man in cold blood.

341
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 I don't know which one's scarier, because you can avoid playing with Ouija boards and not having to worry about

342
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 that fidgety creature standing in your closet waiting for you to turn your back before it gets you.

343
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 You can avoid doing that, but can you avoid simply going insane one day?

344
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 You can avoid living a perfectly normal life, getting married, having kids, having grandkids,

345
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 birthday parties, anniversaries, retirements, and then one day you're plunging a knife into a man's chest.

346
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 One requires some sort of belief in the spiritual, and the other one simply requires belief

347
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 that humans can hide deep, deep evil, and they don't need a Ouija board to access it.
