1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,440
 When a drowning man is resuscitated and brought back to the world of the living, he has to wonder

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,820
 What world is he now living in?

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:18,680
 And then we take a look at the story of Marcus who when he was only nine months old his father died in a tragic accident

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:24,800
 So how is it possible that 20 years later when Marcus was out on a camping trip?

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,800
 He stared off into the forest

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,520
 And saw his father

7
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,920
 staring back today on Dead Rabbit Radio

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:47,240
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio. I'm your host Jason Carpenter

9
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,400
 I'm having a great day. Hope you guys are having a great day too. Hope you guys are having so much fun

10
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:58,640
 We only got two episodes left until the end of season 18. After that, I'm gonna take a two-week break, but I will be back

11
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,920
 After those two weeks, I will also be doing my YouTube shorts, TikToks, the whole time

12
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,800
 So if you want more Dead Rabbit Radio, just tune into the YouTube or the TikTok or the Instagram

13
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,800
 I post this stuff everywhere, but daily one-minute true crime videos

14
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,720
 They take me like five minutes to do so I'm not taking a break off of those

15
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:24,040
 But someone who I never take a break off. Maybe I'll take a bite out of walking into Dead Rabbit Command right now

16
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,080
 I'm so hungry. Give it up for Strand. Woohoo. Yeah

17
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,560
 Licking our lips. We're gonna eat you up Strand. Strand. Strand of spaghetti, hopefully. Strand

18
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,480
 You're gonna be our captain or pilot this episode if you guys can't support the patreon

19
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,640
 I totally understand. Just help spread the word about this show that really really helps me a lot

20
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:50,900
 I won't make any promises that I won't eat you, but I'll try not to. Strand, let's go ahead and break out the hair

21
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:58,320
 Hovercraft. We're gonna leave behind Dead Rabbit Command. We're gonna glide all the way out to Tyler, Texas

22
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:11,080
 Is that the sound of hovercraft makes? I really only know it from the GI Joe toys and as we're going out there too

23
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,760
 I want to say check out the newest episode of the asylum case studies

24
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:22,320
 The asylum case studies is a podcast that I've been lucky enough to be a part of a couple times and on this news episode

25
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:28,020
 Me and the host Tressa we review the movie Megaparana. It was terrible

26
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:35,020
 It was a fun experience the movies awful so as strand is using this hovercraft watch over those megaparana's - I should have warned

27
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,400
 I should have warned strand before he took it out. I realized his head is gone

28
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,020
 He's getting eaten a lot in this episode. He's now officially dead strand. We'll put your head back on take us out to Tyler, Texas

29
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,020
 And let's take a look at this story here

30
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:54,840
 This story takes place. We don't really have a time for this, but I'd say probably in the past ten years in Tyler, Texas

31
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,840
 There is a man

32
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,040
 Being pulled out of the water. Come on. Help me get him up

33
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,980
 They're like his friends are straining to get him out and they throw him on the ground that he's all

34
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,560
 He's like dying and stuff and they're like hurry up dude hurry up guys do that thing

35
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,360
 We saw do the thing we saw and people like what do we watch a lot of stuff or adults?

36
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,120
 We've seen tons and you know the thing like you push on his tummy and you breathe in his mouth

37
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,680
 So they're like okay, so they're doing that. They're giving him CPR and then all of a sudden

38
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:30,960
 He spits up a bunch of water. Do you like that sound effect? It sounded like I was actually coughing and

39
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,160
 He sits up and he's like whoa

40
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,720
 Where what what where am I guys? What wait who are you? Who are you guys? What's going on?

41
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,200
 What happened his friends are like dude you won't believe it like you drowned

42
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,880
 He's like who are you guys and

43
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:55,720
 This is the journey of this young man. We're gonna call him. We don't have a name for this. We're gonna call him Terrence

44
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,120
 Terrence has no idea where he is

45
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,800
 Terrence has no idea

46
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,920
 who he is

47
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,340
 Because he's looking at this group of people. He goes. I don't know any of you. I don't know why I'm at what's going on

48
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:15,840
 The last thing I remember I was hanging out with one friend one one friend. I remember being inside

49
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,960
 I don't remember being in Tyler, Texas

50
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,480
 What is going on and his friends have to convince him?

51
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:30,280
 I don't know how wondering how much oxygen your brain was deprived of but you are Terrence and

52
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,960
 We're your friends and we're down here at this body of water and you almost drowned and he goes no

53
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,560
 None of that is true

54
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,040
 none of it

55
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:47,220
 So of course if your friend was doing this of course you're gonna call an ambulance right you're gonna take him down to the

56
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:53,320
 Hospital you're gonna do something so that's what they do they take one hospital because they go we were really concerned about you like

57
00:04:53,320 --> 00:05:00,040
 You would have to have some serious level brain damage to have this level of amnesia

58
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,920
 To just not know anything and they're like would be the trauma queen you're only in the water for ten minutes

59
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:12,000
 Your lips are only half blue so he goes to the hospital and they run a bunch of tests on him. He's totally fine

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,760
 He didn't have massive amounts of oxygen deprivation

61
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,920
 He didn't suffer any sort of brain damage that they can tell and they're like, okay, you can go ahead and take your friend home

62
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:27,560
 He's okay, and it's like what are you talking about? What home? I'm not from around here. I'm not Terrence. I

63
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:34,800
 Don't know what's going on and they're like great the doctor at that point already locked him out of the hospital your problem

64
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,400
 He's your problem now. We already ran all the tests so they take him home

65
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,380
 And he walks in the house. He's like this is exactly what I figured. I don't know this house

66
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:50,800
 But the thing is as much as he's saying he doesn't know any of this stuff everyone knows him

67
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,480
 And he walks in the house. It's not like familiar to him at all

68
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:02,220
 But it's his house. He starts to go through like old yearbooks because at this point you would start to be convinced maybe I

69
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,440
 Am Terrence

70
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,180
 Well when he starts finding physical evidence right when he's going through old yearbooks and it's like pictures of him

71
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,680
 He's like

72
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,560
 Opens it up. Nobody signed it except for his mom signed it. You're my superstar

73
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,160
 He's like oh man super depressing. I wake up in someone else's life, and he's a tweed

74
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,040
 He goes through old yearbooks

75
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,240
 He's in him

76
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,560
 What is he going to do right? So he's like obviously I must have just forgotten this stuff, but maybe not

77
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,720
 He's at this war with himself, but while he's in this life

78
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,400
 He has a job

79
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:47,360
 Right, he doesn't do it. It's a totally different job than he remembers when he's like I should just do this job

80
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,200
 I guess he's walking into the police station because I guess I'm a detective

81
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,840
 Is he's interrogating murder suspects? They're like I didn't do it. He's like yeah, probably I don't know

82
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,040
 I don't remember any of my training. You're free to go bloody hobo. He's walking out

83
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,680
 He's like man that's got that bloody hobo sure was honest with me

84
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,520
 He has a totally different job than he remembers totally different life than he remembers and

85
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,680
 four years go by and

86
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,160
 for four years he is slowly

87
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,520
 Complimating to what he thinks is a new life, but everyone around him goes no Terrence. This is you

88
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,360
 So for four years he goes in he's doing all of his stuff

89
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,440
 And he goes you know I've been holding on to this past for so long

90
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,560
 And maybe it was

91
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,840
 Maybe it was just maybe it was just a dramatic brain injury. I

92
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:47,000
 Think I need to stop focusing on the past and be Terrence

93
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,240
 And what happens is as he starts to make that change things

94
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,240
 Get better and over the next four years

95
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,560
 Right the first four years he was fighting it now the next four years

96
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,480
 He actually got a promotion at work

97
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,120
 His social life is doing well. He's

98
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,760
 Frigging him out by going who are you who are you?

99
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:14,080
 He was like I may not remember exactly who they are or who they were but they you know

100
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,280
 I should hang out with these people they are calling me constantly going are you okay Terrence?

101
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,520
 Or we're still really worried about you so he gets a promotion at work

102
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,960
 He's making new connections with his friends his social life's working out and the next four years of his life

103
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,940
 Are some of the best four years of his life or at least the best four years he can remember

104
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,780
 And then one day

105
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:39,180
 He wakes up face down in a puddle of his own piss

106
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,360
 In a dirty room in his best friend's house

107
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,100
 He's feels this

108
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:54,180
 Warm urine on his cheek and he's looking at the carpet. He rolls over and he goes

109
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,640
 Dammit, I'm back in my real life

110
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:07,720
 That's the story of a man who used salvia one day

111
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,160
 Salvia is a it's it's such an interesting drug. It's legal a lot of places

112
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,400
 Do it I hope that was a story that didn't make you go

113
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,940
 I should try that so it's a super hardcore mind-altering drug and I know there's a lot of

114
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:30,480
 Psychonauts out there and to be like well technically doesn't alter your mind it messes with your brain whatever chemical

115
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,680
 Reaction that has it's not good and this the story this man's story is one day

116
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,640
 His buddy goes hey you want to smoke some salvia and he said sure and he took a hit and

117
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,760
 The next thing you know he woke up in Tyler, Texas being pulled out of the water

118
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,000
 while his friends are trying to bring him back to life and he lived eight years in

119
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,320
 Tyler, Texas as this new person and in reality he was probably high for maybe

120
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,960
 Like a couple minutes

121
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,860
 Right, so he wasn't in the puddle of his for eight years his friends are like

122
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:09,960
 Ah, he'll pick himself up eventually the whole trip like generally when you do salvia it lasts for about five minutes

123
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,080
 And then you figured give him extra two minutes to be on himself

124
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,160
 So he's probably down there for a list in ten minutes, but in his brain

125
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,760
 It was an eight-year journey in another man's life

126
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:28,480
 Salvia salvia is I've never done salvia. I've been offered it many a times

127
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,520
 I've never done it, but I've known really close friends of mine who have done salvia

128
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:39,180
 And it's it's a trippy drug not not because it literally takes you on a trip

129
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:44,340
 It does that but the way it works one of my cousins a very very good friend of mine named Billy

130
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:48,340
 he was into all sorts of drugs and

131
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:55,860
 He tried salvia and I'll always ask people to do it. So who was like well like what was your trip because it's always crazy

132
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:02,400
 He goes I smoked so I've sent him on my porch, right? This is orange veal. So you could do this. He was sitting on his porch

133
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:08,300
 And he was smoking salvia and he goes all the I might have told the story before in the podcast

134
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:13,500
 So excuse me if I'm repeating myself. I find it so fascinating my buddy Billy cousin Billy is smoking

135
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:19,400
 Salvia on the porch. He goes I took a hit and the next thing I know I was a brick. I

136
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:24,360
 Was a brick I go what he goes. I was a brick

137
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,080
 Like a brick in a building. I turned into a brick

138
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,620
 He goes specifically it was like just my head like I still had my body

139
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,060
 but my head was a brick and

140
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:39,420
 The brick was in he goes I could look both ways and I could look up and down

141
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,420
 He goes it was a brick wall that went on for infinity

142
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,060
 in

143
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,940
 Every direction he goes I looked and I looked to my right and I looked to my left and I just see

144
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:54,980
 Nothing but billions of bricks in both directions and up and down he goes and it scared me so bad

145
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,980
 I was trying to get out of the brick wall

146
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,680
 And I put on a little pink Floyd and everything was okay. You know, he goes I jumped up

147
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,160
 I because I knew my body was still humid and I begin running as fast as I could

148
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:14,600
 Down green back which is a main thoroughfare in Orangeville. He's running down green back

149
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,840
 He's over by the youth center right a past

150
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,920
 Telling you guys exactly where this is that if you ever want to visit it. It's past

151
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,840
 Cable Park you keep going

152
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,920
 There's like a youth center on the right hand side if you're headed towards Roosevelt

153
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:32,220
 Anyways, he's running down the street. He's giving people directions. He's like no keep go and turn make a lefty cable park

154
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:37,780
 He's running down the street as fast as he can. He goes where the wall was moving with me

155
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:41,140
 And no matter how fast I ran I

156
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:45,660
 Could just feel the wall there was no escaping

157
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,500
 the wall

158
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,980
 And it lasted like for five minutes and then he turned back

159
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,380
 to cousin Billy

160
00:12:53,380 --> 00:13:00,420
 Now when he told me that story I laughed I laughed so hard because I could just imagine him running down the street just sweating

161
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,260
 afraid that he was a brick wall, but

162
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:07,440
 My cousin Billy is now doing 17 to life in prison

163
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,240
 Because he killed the dude

164
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,360
 stabbed him

165
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,180
 And so you think is that story

166
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:22,360
 What was he seeing a future now he was into some stuff, right?

167
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:28,420
 He was into some stuff and I remember once we were talking and he goes Jason. I hope I never kill anybody. I

168
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:33,980
 Hope I never kill anybody, but he lived a life where that was possible

169
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,940
 Right that was something that could happen

170
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:45,440
 So the question is is like did the salvia show him the future?

171
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,580
 I mean, I hope he gets out right. I hope he gets out. I really need to write him

172
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:54,540
 It drives me nuts that I don't write him, but you have to think was it showing him in the future

173
00:13:54,540 --> 00:14:00,180
 Did he already feel like he had nothing he was just a brick in an endless wall just another rat in the rat race?

174
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:05,940
 Or is it actually showing like this is your future now? He could have changed it, right?

175
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,940
 I don't think the future is predetermined

176
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:14,980
 But it's so fascinating salvia so fascinating then you have a story like this and what I find interesting about this is we talk so much on

177
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:20,920
 This show and we'll actually kind of mention it on tomorrow's episode last episode quantum immortality, right?

178
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,320
 We talk about it a lot on this show and I find it endlessly intriguing

179
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,920
 That's kind of what this is quantum immortality is where you dying you slot into another body

180
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,800
 No, I'm not saying this guy died because he did salvia, but what if it triggered the same thing?

181
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:40,720
 What if he actually did go into the body of someone in Tyler, Texas who had died and then it popped up with his new personality in it and

182
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,760
 Then he's going around like was it totally hallucination

183
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:52,740
 Or did he actually in another timeline spend eight years in this body and if he hadn't jumped into that body that body would have just been dead

184
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:58,520
 They would have mourned their friend who drowned that day and that would have been the end of it

185
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:04,580
 But because this dude teleported into the body of Terrence they got another eight years with him

186
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,280
 I don't know fascinating fascinating story

187
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,600
 And I let me source this too because some of you guys may be familiar with this story

188
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,600
 I found this on the X board

189
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:19,700
 Someone was talking about salvia and they said they heard it on a podcast now because the exports completely anonymous

190
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,880
 I don't know what podcasts it's from some of the details may because we're playing a game of telephone at this point

191
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,600
 They heard it on a podcast. I'm hearing it from this anonymous poster, but they had a really interesting thread on

192
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:39,780
 The export about salvia experiences and the poster who told that story said his question was like what in the world is salvia

193
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,680
 He tells that story

194
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,080
 I just told you about in Terrence was a fake name right well. He was a fake person

195
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:50,640
 Right. He was who knows who that person was or if he even existed Terrence from Tyler, Texas

196
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,240
 He also shares this story. It's very short

197
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:01,500
 He says I also heard a story about a guy who was doing salvia once and he hit it and the next thing he knew

198
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:07,800
 He was a coat of paint on the side of a barn and

199
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,960
 He was that coat of paint on the side of a barn for 20 years

200
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,800
 and

201
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:22,720
 He felt every minute of just being pasted on that barn every minute of every day for

202
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,400
 20 years and

203
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,800
 Then he's back with us

204
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:33,240
 So what is salvia do you actually teleport to another reality?

205
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:40,160
 Did he go to another body or did he just imagine all of this and then you'd wonder when you'd wake up out?

206
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,220
 I remember once I read a story a long time ago these two dudes the very

207
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:53,000
 hilarious the very first time the very first time these two guys were smoking some salvia it was September 11th 2001 and

208
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,900
 They smoked it and then who's interrupted and they're like a plane just crashing to the World Trade Center and

209
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:08,280
 I remember hearing this story like in 2005 and they go we don't know what's real like as we still can't

210
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:15,880
 Figure out if this is real where where we are. They're currently deployed into Iraq. They're like guys wake up. Wake up

211
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,240
 We're in Fallujah. They're like, I don't know. I don't know this all be a dream

212
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:27,700
 Yeah, they smoked it and the news turned on right whatever they were watching the view or whatever and it the news got interrupted with a plane

213
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:33,860
 Crescent of World Trade Center and they sat there. They were like all these years later. We don't know what's real

214
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,600
 We don't know if we smoked ourselves

215
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:44,860
 Into the war on terror which to them that's what it would feel like they took it some salvia and then as their trip was starting

216
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:51,000
 Everything changed in America fascinating fascinating. I again. I'm not saying you guys should do it

217
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,040
 I think it's probably highly dangerous, but and it doesn't seem to be super recreational

218
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,380
 I'm surprised more people don't do it

219
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:06,660
 Turning what coat of paint on the side of a barn for 20 years. Do people abuse cough syrup?

220
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:14,420
 Strand let's go ahead and touch the keys of the carbon or cofter. We are leaving behind Tyler, Texas or are we?

221
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:17,380
 We're headed all the way out to

222
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,580
 the Pacific Northwest

223
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:30,440
 1982-ish around that time is when this story starts off and we're in the Pacific Northwest

224
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:37,200
 And there we're gonna meet a little boy named Marcus. It's not his actual name. That's the name we're gonna be going

225
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,200
 We don't know the person's actual name

226
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,960
 Marcus was a little nine-month-old baby. So what do you do at nine months?

227
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,240
 You just kind of gurgle and roll around on your tummy. He's doing that

228
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,280
 He can't he's not even smart enough to do it at the same time. He has to roll then girl and

229
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,580
 While Marcus was just being bounced on somebody's knee

230
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:04,320
 His father and his father's friends were down at the river and they had a canoe and it got stuck. Oh

231
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,340
 Come on man. They're trying to move the canoe off

232
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:11,940
 Trying to get off these rocks and they go hey Marcus is dead

233
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:16,700
 That's the only name they know by the only reason he's cool because he has a cool baby

234
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:22,620
 Hey Marcus his dad can you come over here and help us get it unstuck and Marcus's dad was like sure and they're

235
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,580
 fighting with the canoe trying to get it off the rocks and

236
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:30,980
 The undertoe snags up Marcus's dad

237
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,820
 pulls him under a

238
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:37,940
 Few days later and a couple miles down the river

239
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:42,300
 Marcus's dad turns back up. He's dead. He had drowned

240
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:47,140
 That wasn't a theme. I wasn't trying to do a drowned theme episode

241
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,140
 I didn't even think about it when I put these two stories together

242
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,140
 But Marcus's father passed away when he was only nine months old

243
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:59,860
 Never gonna flash forward 20 years were around the year 2002 and

244
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:03,140
 Marcus finds himself camping in

245
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:07,940
 The same area where his father passed away like after 20 years, right?

246
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:14,300
 He didn't really even get to know the dad like I don't know if a friend of mine got killed on a certain city block

247
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,220
 If I would feel comfortable going back there

248
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,460
 I'm like, oh no, he died in the only Chipotle in town. No

249
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:23,140
 You know what I mean like life goes on

250
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:29,460
 Life goes on my uncle Jeff got shot in that gang shooting at a jack-in-the-box

251
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,140
 In orange veil and I still went to that jack-in-the-box

252
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:37,940
 I mean like it happened when I was a little kid, but I'll admit when I went to the jack-in-the-box

253
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,380
 I was always like, uh

254
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,740
 Like I was never happy because you'd have to sit in that drive-through and you'd be like oh

255
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:47,460
 This is where uncle Jeff got shot right. I did a whole episode on on that. I'll put that in the show notes

256
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,740
 Well, I was like, yeah, we you'd end up going to the jack-in-the-box

257
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:55,220
 The only jack-in-the-box within like 20 miles or whatever, but it's like oh man

258
00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:00,140
 So I get it like you would go back. He didn't even really get to know his dad, right?

259
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,660
 I knew uncle Jeff on the other side. He survived the shotgun blast to the head, but it really messed them up

260
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,300
 anyways

261
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,740
 What's it talking about? Oh, yeah, I was talking about this story. It was talking about this story

262
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:15,300
 I'm supposed to be talking about so he goes to hang out of the river because it had been such a long amount of time

263
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,340
 And what else are you gonna do? It's the place where you hang out

264
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:22,660
 So there 20 years later Marcus is on a camping trip with his girlfriend

265
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:26,420
 His best friend and his best friend's girlfriend

266
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,140
 So it's a little quartet a little group of four people

267
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:36,300
 Headed up camping and you know what? It seems like Marcus kind of needs a camping trip when you look at not only

268
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:42,300
 Marcus's story when he wrote this out when you look at other posts that he made he struggles a lot with depression

269
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:47,460
 struggles a lot with depression and he even states that he has had

270
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,580
 Run-ins

271
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,580
 with suicide

272
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:57,220
 I don't know if that means suicidal ideation or if he's attempted suicide

273
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:02,980
 But he does say that you know suicide has played a factor in his personal life. He's posting on the depression subreddits

274
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:08,500
 And he mentions suicidality in this story as well

275
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:16,820
 So it's 9 30 p.m. And him and his best friend they kind of walk away from the camp

276
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:20,740
 The girls are being attacked by badgers. They're like, oh you guys can handle it

277
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:26,500
 They walk away from the camp and there's like this rocky outcropping and both of them are just sitting there smoking cigarettes

278
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,340
 And Marcus is looking out over the river

279
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,860
 The same river

280
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,860
 that his father drowned in

281
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,340
 And not the exact same location

282
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,300
 But the same general area

283
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,300
 He's smoking a cigarette and he's sitting on this rock

284
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:49,220
 He looks across the river and he sees someone standing there

285
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:55,060
 Someone's standing there and this person is staring at Marcus

286
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,980
 Now, you know what? It's a public area

287
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:05,220
 You're allowed to stand and stare where you want to stare, but it's a little late to just be standing in the forest

288
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,140
 Right? It doesn't look like he has a camp set up

289
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:12,900
 What's this guy doing there and as Marcus is looking at this guy it dawns on him. This just isn't some random dude

290
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,420
 That's his dad

291
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:23,220
 Now he was nine months old when his father died. He never really got to see him or he did see him, but he didn't really remember it

292
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,180
 But over the years

293
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,060
 You know, he'd seen photographs people talked about his father

294
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:34,020
 He can kind of put a mental picture together and he goes that's clearly

295
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:37,300
 Who was standing on the other side of this river?

296
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:43,060
 Somehow through the distance somehow through the darkness he knew this was his dad and he turned to his friend

297
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,860
 He goes do you see that guy over there?

298
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,060
 And the friend looks over and goes what?

299
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:55,300
 No, I don't see that at all. What are you looking at? Is there like a deer or something?

300
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:01,780
 And as Marcus is staring at this figure all of a sudden a spotlight appears

301
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:08,980
 Suddenly the area around his father is lit up. He can clearly see now

302
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,180
 This is his father

303
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:17,140
 The man turns and starts walking about 20 feet to his left

304
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:21,540
 And then moves a little bit back into the tree line

305
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:26,020
 But Marcus still can clearly see his dad

306
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,500
 turn around

307
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:33,380
 And pick up a bag and start kind of rustling through a bag

308
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:38,020
 Marcus is shaking at this point

309
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:42,820
 He's watching his father prepare something

310
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:48,580
 His best friend goes dude, what what are you looking at? What's wrong?

311
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:53,540
 But Marcus can't even speak he knows that from the best friend's point of view

312
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,820
 He's just staring out into the darkness. He's just looking at nothing

313
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:03,860
 But he sees this entire area clearly illuminated by some sort of spotlight that is shining on his father

314
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,900
 And the dad turns around now

315
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,940
 And he's holding a noose

316
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:14,900
 He throws one into the rope up over a tree branch

317
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,500
 Ties it down

318
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,740
 Puts the noose around his neck

319
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:25,380
 Stares directly into Marcus's eyes

320
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,140
 And then hangs himself

321
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:36,100
 And even while hanging there as he slowly sways back and forth

322
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,300
 The entire time he's staring

323
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,660
 directly at

324
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,380
 Marcus

325
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:51,780
 You have to imagine right that this would open up a whole lot of questions

326
00:25:52,340 --> 00:26:00,420
 First off first off did I bring enough pants because I pooped in these like that would be a terrifying thing to see

327
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:05,860
 But once a little bit of time and a little bit of distance is between this horrific vision

328
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:09,060
 Or haunting or whatever you want to call it

329
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:13,060
 Marcus starts to

330
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:19,700
 This is so this is where Marcus goes with this and I totally think this is a valid way to look into this Marcus went into this whole thing thinking

331
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,740
 Was I lied to

332
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:26,580
 Was I lied to because people do do this this does happen

333
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:32,340
 He goes what I started to think was that my father did not die by accident

334
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,220
 My father killed himself

335
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,820
 And he was showing me that he killed himself

336
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:44,740
 And that took him on such a journey that he began questioning

337
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:48,100
 Members of his family was like hey, what happened to my dad and they'd be like well

338
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,300
 He's trying to get that canoe loose and he drowned be like well, you know, I think I'm old enough now

339
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:55,300
 I think you can tell me the truth and be like what are you talking about? He drowned

340
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:59,700
 He took this journey so far. He's questioning his family

341
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,940
 He goes and he gets a copy of the death certificate of his father

342
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,300
 accidental

343
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,420
 So

344
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:14,420
 That's one way to look at it, right? You're at the place where your father died and families do often cover up suicides

345
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:17,220
 Suicide tends to run in families

346
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:22,740
 Right if you have a close relative who committed suicide the chances of you committing suicide go up

347
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:27,380
 Father committed suicide. I can imagine it doesn't guarantee it. It doesn't guarantee it at all

348
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:33,300
 But we do see those patterns. So if his dad we know that Marcus is dealing with suicide as an issue

349
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,180
 If his dad committed suicide that would track

350
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:39,540
 Right that would make sense

351
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:43,940
 So then he started thinking okay, so maybe my dad really did die in a

352
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:47,540
 Accidental way. He was trying to get this boat loose and he drowned

353
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:51,460
 Was my dad trying to warn me of something

354
00:27:51,460 --> 00:28:00,500
 Because I do struggle with suicide the the wording he used I want to read this exactly what he said when he talked about suicide

355
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,260
 he said quote

356
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:07,220
 I had numerous close calls with suicide as a young adult

357
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:14,660
 So I don't know if that means he would mentally was like he had the suicidal ideation. He's like, oh my god

358
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,740
 I'm gonna kill myself. I'm gonna kill myself and he gets someone

359
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:22,420
 To like talk him down or if he actually attempted suicide. There's a big difference between the two

360
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:25,940
 Right, there's suicidal ideation where you just think about it all the time

361
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:29,620
 There's the stuff where you you can't stop thinking about swallowing the pills

362
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:33,860
 And then there's the one where you've swallowed the pills and you're calling 911

363
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,820
 Like it's the same thing between wanting to be like, oh, I swear to god

364
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,620
 I'm gonna beat my brother up with a baseball bat versus

365
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:44,180
 grabbing the pad versus grabbing the bat and taking a swing at him because he

366
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,300
 Wants to keep watching his favorite show and you know it sucks

367
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:52,100
 Big difference. So I don't know but he goes was my father warning me

368
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:57,140
 He does talk about the close calls with suicide. He goes but none of them involved hanging

369
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:03,620
 So it wasn't like he ever attempted to hang himself for really even thought about hanging. So why was this?

370
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,380
 Vision of his dad hanging himself. He he didn't really understand that

371
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:14,180
 And then he thought and this is kind of where I was kind of going with it

372
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:18,180
 Originally when I was reading the narrative, it did seem like maybe his dad was trying to

373
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:22,020
 Tell the truth right showing up. This is the real way I died

374
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,860
 but

375
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:27,220
 When you kept reading it and he started talking about his investigation you go, okay

376
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:31,620
 I believe that I mean the family can lie but the coroner generally won't right

377
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:36,820
 So the other one was that maybe it wasn't my father at all

378
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:42,660
 Which is the creepiest one right that it was some sort of demon

379
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,780
 Some sort of wraith

380
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,660
 Taunting this young man

381
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:52,660
 Man who already struggles with suicidal tendencies

382
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:57,140
 This demon this dark spirit

383
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:03,780
 Is taunting him is showing him his biological father killing himself

384
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,740
 in the woods

385
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:11,140
 Staring at marcus directly while it hangs

386
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:15,540
 And it's like this entity was trying to

387
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:18,740
 Goed marcus on

388
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:24,420
 Even lie right even lie say your father really died this way come join him

389
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,380
 Come join me. I meant to say I'm your dad

390
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:33,140
 I you I said it in the third person, but I'm not really a demon disguised join me son

391
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,860
 Join me

392
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:41,460
 A malevolent force trying to trick him into committing suicide

393
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:45,860
 You know what's interesting is we don't know which one it was

394
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:51,620
 Right the thing with the paranormal is you very rarely get a concrete answer

395
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:56,580
 So was this his father showing him this horrible vision for some reason

396
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,300
 To warn him

397
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,300
 Like was it a at least a good reason

398
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:07,780
 Or was it a darker force trying to manipulate marcus into committing suicide?

399
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:15,940
 We don't know and one of the issues is is that the person who posted this goes by the username

400
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,740
 plasmo des maniac

401
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:23,860
 And this I looked through this person's posting history. They generally

402
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,740
 posted in a subreddit for depression

403
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:31,940
 Talking about how things you know they can get better

404
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:35,940
 But a lot of times they're bad and just kind of you know trying to help other people out with depression

405
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,940
 They haven't posted in 10 months

406
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:45,060
 This story was posted 11 months ago and they have not posted again for the last 10 months

407
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:50,100
 And and I should add too that marcus is now 40

408
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,820
 This story just didn't happen a while ago

409
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:59,860
 This this story happened 20 years ago this marcus character again. It's a fake name. He's 41 now

410
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:05,940
 He says his age i'm 41 years old and so he's been dealing with this story for 20 years

411
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,420
 Why does he bring it up?

412
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:13,540
 11 months ago and then one month later stops posting for good

413
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:18,660
 As far as we know right maybe he does maybe he will start posting

414
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:26,660
 In in you know still be posting but kind of the implication the unfortunate implication is that something's happened

415
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:31,940
 And then just to put another weird twist on this. I don't know why this happened

416
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:34,340
 He posted this story 11 months ago

417
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:39,140
 And then one month later he was posting in the in a depression subreddit

418
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:44,180
 And in the thread they were posting in was how do you cope with suicidal thoughts?

419
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:52,420
 The last thing he wrote was when talking about suicidal thoughts he

420
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:55,860
 How he struggles with them or how he copes with them he goes

421
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:00,980
 I go shopping maybe at a grocery store and just make a point to talk to people that work there

422
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:06,340
 I don't want to take out my issues on them. So it kind of tricks me into being nice and happy for a minute

423
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:09,220
 Eventually I don't feel like dying

424
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:18,740
 It's an odd story it's a it's a it's a fascinating ghost story and then the real life story is absolutely tragic

425
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:22,340
 Like we this guy's been struggling with this vision for 20 years

426
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:30,820
 He saw it when he was in his early 20s now. He's 41 and he was never able to make sense of this all that time two decades. He's not able to

427
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:34,180
 Figure out why his dad did this

428
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,980
 Was it his dad?

429
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:40,260
 Why did he get this message? Why did his dad kill himself?

430
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:48,580
 Or was it even his dad he can't figure that out we can't figure it out and it's possible that we will never figure it out

431
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,820
 I

432
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,700
 I'm hoping

433
00:33:53,700 --> 00:34:00,580
 He just left reddit reddit is such a cesspool reddit's one of the worst websites on the surface of the internet hands down

434
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:06,100
 So if someone stops using reddit, I'm totally fine with that. I think it's probably a good thing

435
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:13,540
 But it's also possible the reason why he hasn't posted in 10 months is because the struggle became too great

436
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,580
 Keeping up the illusion that he was happy

437
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:21,700
 was too great

438
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:26,740
 And I hope not I hope not right. I don't wish suicide on anybody

439
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:29,860
 death really on anybody as well

440
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:37,140
 We're left with nothing but questions. What did he see on the other side of this river? Was it taunting him?

441
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,540
 Was it trying to warn him?

442
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:46,500
 It's the warning thing seems so weird because do you think the dad would just be like you got a lot to live for bro?

443
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,940
 I'm a ghost

444
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:51,300
 I'm a ghost with the most I'm beatlejuice. I didn't know your dad was beatlejuice, bro

445
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,980
 and

446
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:58,260
 Don't kill yourself dude because although it's cool to be a ghost. Look at me. I'm dancing with these cockroaches and stuff like that

447
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,860
 Hanging out with christini richie or wanona rider. Whoever was in that movie

448
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,820
 Don't be a ghost yet

449
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,220
 That's what you would think a warning would be right

450
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:13,220
 You don't I mean like if someone just give you guys a heads up if you die and then you want to warn me of some calamity

451
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,820
 Don't show up and just stare at me

452
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,460
 I'm not gonna get what you're saying

453
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,780
 And especially don't do something gross, right?

454
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:22,740
 so

455
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:27,060
 You know, there's other ways to do it even if you couldn't talk even if you want beatlejuice and you could

456
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:31,220
 Go on a cartoon slide even if you weren't beatlejuice. You have to figure out another way

457
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:36,500
 I lean more towards this was something malignant in the woods showing him

458
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,980
 something

459
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:44,820
 So grotesque something so grotesque that it stuck with him for 20 years

460
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:48,580
 Something that was so awful that even 20 years later

461
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:56,100
 He's still seeking answers and not in the kind of way like is my apartment haunted in the kind of way is why would my dad do that to me?

462
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:00,500
 Like I already grew up without a dad and then the next time I see him

463
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:06,260
 He's hanging himself in the middle of the woods and he has to know that I struggle with suicidal thoughts

464
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:12,180
 It has to be something darker. It has to be something more malevolent

465
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:18,100
 And if that's the case

466
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:21,300
 This may have been marcus's vision

467
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:26,180
 And marcus may have gone on the next 20 years dealing with that

468
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:32,500
 But this thing wouldn't be limited to marcus. This thing may still be out there in the woods

469
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,500
 Waiting watching

470
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:40,580
 Hunting

471
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:47,380
 It stands in the darkness ready to take the shape of a person's greatest fear

472
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:54,180
 What will it show to you?
