00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
 A childish nursery rhyme keeps a young mother up at night, a magical hand that was very

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:13,760
 popular among thieves, and a brutal murderer haunts the streets of Sweden today on Dead

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,760
 Rabbit Radio.

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:25,360
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,360
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter.

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,360
 I'm having a great day.

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,520
 I hope you're having a great day too.

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,520
 I am having a great day.

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,840
 I actually got this awesome feedback from a YouTube user.

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,600
 Gray of PTA is the YouTube user's name.

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,080
 I saw this today.

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,040
 Dead Rabbit Radio is the Art Bell show of 2018 for me now.

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,760
 Absolutely loving what you do.

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,760
 Thank you Gray.

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,760
 Thank you very much.

16
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,960
 You know Art Bell, I was actually talking to a friend of mine the other day about Art

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,160
 Bell.

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,320
 I only wish I could be as awesome as that show, but I appreciate your comment.

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,920
 That was in reference to the Conjuring 2 episode.

20
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,920
 I really liked that one.

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,920
 I really like.

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,760
 I always try my last episode.

23
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,560
 I always try to walk away and go, "That was my best episode."

24
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,560
 So I really liked that one.

25
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,560
 Thank you for your feedback.

26
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,160
 I've gotten a lot of great feedback from you guys.

27
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,680
 I just wanted to highlight that one because Art Bell, Coast to Coast AM, they're definitely

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,000
 formative influences in this show.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,720
 George Norrie as well, but we got a lot to talk about.

30
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,960
 So we're going to jump right into the first story.

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,200
 Now two of these stories were sent to me from Lana.

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,520
 I've talked about Lana before.

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,520
 She's my friend.

34
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,680
 She's actually, I think I'm going to have to eventually name her like my top researcher

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,960
 because she sends me a bunch of stuff throughout the day.

36
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,600
 The first one she sent me, I was like, "Eh, nah."

37
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,080
 And I kind of looked in and I go, "I don't know.

38
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,080
 It sounds fake."

39
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,560
 And I looked into it and it does appear to be real.

40
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,040
 Appears to be very, very eerie with a rational explanation and then a twist.

41
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,320
 So in England, I'm not going to do any accents today.

42
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,480
 In England, I might do some accents, but in England, there was a British mom and she

43
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,200
 had her kids and she would put her kids to bed.

44
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,200
 And she'd be sleeping in her bedroom and she would hear this.

45
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:14,880
 [Singing]

46
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,760
 Now you go Jason, that's just a nursery rhyme.

47
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,080
 You pulled off the internet some creepy nursery rhyme, but we'll get to that in a second.

48
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,680
 So it freaked her out, obviously, because she doesn't know where it's coming from.

49
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,400
 And then a couple nights later, she hears it again.

50
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:35,400
 Now sometimes it would play over and over and over for hours on end.

51
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,720
 And sometimes it would happen just once a night.

52
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,040
 It didn't happen all the time.

53
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,680
 But for months this went on.

54
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,360
 Maybe for a week she wouldn't hear it.

55
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,420
 And then late at night in bed, she'd hear the song again.

56
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,040
 So she looked all over the house, she couldn't figure out what it was.

57
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,120
 She was getting terrified.

58
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,920
 It sounds like a creepy voice.

59
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,600
 She ended up contacting the Ipswich Borough Council.

60
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,880
 So she lives in the town of Ipswich, which I thought was made up.

61
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,280
 I thought it was a town from HP Lovecraft.

62
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,280
 But he might also have a town called Ipswich.

63
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:16,520
 But anyway, so she contacts the city council and they go, "Well, if it happens again, call

64
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,520
 us up.

65
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,520
 We'll go out there."

66
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,280
 Now obviously they probably think she's a lunatic.

67
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,320
 But it does happen again.

68
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,160
 She does call them up, they go out there and they hear it, playing his day.

69
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,760
 And at this point they go, "Okay, this is obviously, there has to be rational explanation

70
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,760
 for this."

71
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,080
 So they begin looking around the area and they found that, "Okay, so this is where it gets

72
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,080
 funny."

73
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,480
 So there is a shopping center nearby that was broadcasting the signal.

74
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,080
 And they go, "Oh, sorry, we had it turned up too loud.

75
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,480
 We'll shut it off."

76
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,640
 And no harm, no foul, right?

77
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,000
 The question is, is why was the shopping center broadcasting this signal late at night?

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,640
 It's their burglar alarm.

79
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,280
 It's to stop what they call opportunistic burglar.

80
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,480
 So someone who's dead set on breaking into this place, into like this industrial park,

81
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,200
 they're gonna break it no matter what.

82
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,160
 But if you're just out with your mates one night and you're like, "Oh, let's smash some

83
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,800
 glass."

84
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:14,960
 And you walk onto the property and you hear that nursery rhyme, you're going to leave.

85
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,360
 That is absolutely terrifying.

86
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,920
 What it was was that they had it turned up louder than they thought it was.

87
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,720
 It was only supposed to be heard on the property.

88
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,040
 And spiders, oddly enough.

89
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,760
 Lana was like, "Did you hear about the spiders setting off the security alarm?"

90
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,600
 And I'm like, "Lana, you're off your rocker.

91
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
 That's impossible."

92
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,000
 What was happening was spiders were crawling across, which is creepy in and of itself.

93
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,280
 Spiders were crawling across the security camera lens.

94
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,440
 It was picking up their heat signature and it was activating the song.

95
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,440
 I have a couple questions.

96
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,160
 How many spiders are there on Ipswitch?

97
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,280
 Why are there so many giant spiders around this security camera setup?

98
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,320
 And how many just random people were walking through that park over the years late at night

99
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,920
 going, "Hey, let's take a shortcut through the industrial park."

100
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,920
 And they hear the...

101
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,720
 It's raining, it's pouring.

102
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,440
 I mean, like, what?

103
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,440
 Terrifying.

104
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,720
 How many nightmares did this place fuel?

105
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,320
 At this point, I would be more likely to break into that place just to hear the loudspeaker

106
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,400
 sound.

107
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,760
 But I gotta give this story a credit.

108
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,000
 And it's intriguing.

109
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,640
 And two, that is a novel way to deter most people from trespassing on your property.

110
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:26,000
 Now, just to say this in fair play, the woman's name is never mentioned in the article.

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 And the locations are fairly vague.

112
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,080
 It could be fake.

113
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,320
 There's a photo of a spider crawling on a security camera, which almost looks too good.

114
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,520
 So it could be a fake story.

115
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,200
 But as a story in and of itself, as a news article in and of itself, it is pretty creepy.

116
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,320
 So let's hear that song one more time.

117
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,760
 I can't imagine hearing that multiple times a night for months on end.

118
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,760
 Terrifying.

119
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,520
 And hats off to the burglar people.

120
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,120
 Not the burglars themselves, but the burglar preventionists.

121
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,620
 It's a good idea.

122
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,480
 Next thing to know, they'll have, like, tiptoe through the tulips, ring around the rosy.

123
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,480
 They can do all sorts of stuff.

124
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,600
 Start playing the ring video.

125
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,640
 Like, have monitors throughout your complex.

126
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,200
 And once you set off an alarm, the ring video starts.

127
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
 That would...

128
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
 I would leave.

129
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,200
 I would leave the planet.

130
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:15,200
 If I was walking through a complex and a bunch of ring videos, started up on multiple monitors.

131
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:22,200
 [eerie music]

132
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:43,200
 [eerie music]

133
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,120
 Let's go ahead and move on to our next story.

134
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,680
 Yeah, we're going like that, 'cause I got three of them today.

135
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,680
 You know what?

136
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,520
 Let's do the murderer one next.

137
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,800
 So, in Sweden, let's go back in time.

138
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,080
 We're already in Britain right now.

139
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,480
 We're saying goodbye to the mom.

140
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
 She can sleep well now.

141
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,680
 I wonder if she was hot.

142
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,680
 I think she was single.

143
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,320
 We're saying goodbye to the mom.

144
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,320
 Bye, mom.

145
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,760
 Saying goodbye to her kids.

146
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,720
 And then we're going to take a plane and go through a time portal, 'cause now we're

147
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,200
 going to Sweden in the year 1932.

148
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,200
 [makes noise]

149
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,200
 Now we're landing in Sweden in 1932.

150
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,200
 So, what would that be?

151
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
 Like, a little...

152
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,200
 About 90 years ago, roughly.

153
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,200
 I don't know.

154
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
 I don't know.

155
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,200
 Anyway, so there was a young prostitute there.

156
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,200
 There was a lot of prostitutes there, but the one in particular we're going to talk about

157
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,200
 was plying her trade.

158
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,200
 Her name was Lily Lindström.

159
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,200
 32-year-old prostitute.

160
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,200
 She worked out of her apartment.

161
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,200
 Her neighbors knew her.

162
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,200
 She seemed to be a relatively nice person.

163
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,200
 Her neighbors didn't have much of a problem with her.

164
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,200
 One of her neighbors said she always came to my apartment and asked for condoms.

165
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,200
 She might have been a prostitute too, I don't know.

166
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,200
 But anyway, so everything was going fine for Lily.

167
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,200
 And then one day she doesn't knock on her neighbor's door.

168
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,200
 And the neighbor's not like, "Man, she must have gotten enough condoms."

169
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,200
 She actually talked to the neighbor quite frequently.

170
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,200
 Like, every morning they would have tea together or coffee or whatever they do in Sweden.

171
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,200
 She doesn't come to the neighbor's door.

172
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,200
 And after a couple days...

173
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
 Oh yeah, look, I'm looking at my notes here.

174
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,200
 Her neighbor, Minnie Johnson, actually was a prostitute.

175
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
 That's why she had so many condoms.

176
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:22,200
 Anyway, so after a couple days she alerts the landlord or the authorities or probably both.

177
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,200
 And the cops come into the room.

178
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,200
 And unfortunately Lily's dead.

179
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,200
 And the cops are like, "Okay, interesting crime scene."

180
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,200
 Lily was laying face down in the bed.

181
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,200
 She was naked, completely naked, and her clothes were folded up and placed on a chair.

182
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:44,200
 They knew that she had recently had sex because they found a used condom.

183
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,200
 And it was hanging out of her body still.

184
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,200
 She had suffered repeated blows from a blunt object to the back of the head.

185
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,200
 And that's what killed her.

186
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,200
 What they thought was weird, the police, is there was really no blood at the scene.

187
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:09,200
 And to the police on the ground in the room, they thought that the blood had actually been drained from her body.

188
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,200
 There was that much of an absence of blood.

189
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:17,200
 So the police were like, "Okay, so she was killed possibly during the sex act."

190
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,200
 Some people think it was like a doggie-soul thing and the perpetrator hit her on the back of the head then.

191
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,200
 So she was hit multiple times in the back of the head with a blunt object.

192
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,200
 They don't think it was a fist because there was damage to the back of the head.

193
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,200
 Like, more damage than just getting punched multiple times.

194
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,200
 But there wasn't much blood.

195
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:46,200
 In fact, there was so little blood that the cops theorized that one, her body was drained of the blood,

196
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
 but they were like, "Yeah, that's very unlikely."

197
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:54,200
 Or the killer cleaned the blood up from the scene before they left.

198
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,200
 That's not unheard of. Obviously criminals will try to clean up stuff.

199
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,200
 But the police seemed uniquely clean for a crime scene.

200
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:08,200
 What was weird was where the bashes were in her head and her neck.

201
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,200
 They found saliva.

202
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,200
 And they're like, "What?"

203
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,200
 So there's not a lot of blood in the body.

204
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
 They find-- there's not a lot of blood.

205
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,200
 They find saliva on the neck by the wounds, on the wounds.

206
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
 And then they find the ladle.

207
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,200
 The ladle was stained with blood.

208
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,200
 So at this point the cops are like, "This might be a vampire."

209
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:37,200
 Now, of course, they don't think that's an actual, like, magical, metaphysical, supernatural vampire flying around.

210
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,200
 But this is a killer who killed a woman when she was not suspecting it, bashed her open,

211
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,200
 licked her wounds, and then drank more of her blood, and possibly drank so much of her blood

212
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,200
 that her body was mostly drained of it. Because what is-- how much blood's in you, like, 8 pints? 10 pints?

213
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,200
 I mean, it would take a lot, but if you brought a bucket, you could take some home with you.

214
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,200
 So they have saliva on the wounds. They have a bloodstained, a gravy ladle.

215
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,200
 Cops are like, "Okay, whatever sicko did this, killed this woman, most likely drank her blood."

216
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,200
 Sweden police, they obviously-- they get to work on it.

217
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:15,200
 You know, there's a big misconception that police don't investigate the deaths of prostitutes.

218
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,200
 And that's not true. I read a lot of true crime books, and a lot of times you'll hear people go,

219
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,200
 "Oh, just prostitutes died and the cops don't care about prostitutes." It's the opposite.

220
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:30,200
 Cops tend to know prostitutes more than they know other people, because they talk to them all the time.

221
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,200
 Cops are constantly arresting prostitutes and then checking up on them and, hey, how's everything going?

222
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,200
 Police know prostitutes better than they know most people.

223
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,200
 And when a prostitute goes missing or gets murdered, it actually really affects the police officer

224
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,200
 because it's somebody in their working area. They know their name, they know their life story.

225
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,200
 They've had them in the back of the car multiple times, and the girl's like,

226
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,200
 "I'm just trying to get back to my feet. I'm trying to get custody of my kids, whatever it is."

227
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:59,200
 The reason why police have a hard time solving the murders of prostitutes is they're very, very mobile.

228
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,200
 A lot of times they'll work entire coastlines.

229
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,200
 So they may know them for the two years that they're in Detroit or the two years they're in Portland,

230
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,200
 but eventually they'll say, "You know what? Business isn't that good here.

231
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,200
 I'm going to go down to San Francisco or I'm going to go up to New York or whatever."

232
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,200
 Because they will just up and leave, a lot of times the police are like,

233
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,200
 when a prostitute goes missing, they're like, "Hey, have you guys seen Lily?"

234
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,200
 And people are like, "I don't know." Like, she talked about going to New York,

235
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,200
 and the cops are like, "Oh, okay, I wish her the best of luck."

236
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,200
 She's really in the back of someone's truck, you know, rotting.

237
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,200
 And so you could rack up a lot of prostitute kills,

238
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:41,200
 but the idea that police just don't care about investigating prostitute murders is not true.

239
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,200
 Anyway, so the Swedish police are like, "Okay, let's catch this guy.

240
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,200
 Let's find out who drank this woman's blood."

241
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:53,200
 Allegedly, eventually they're going to find him and they're going to be able to sit him down and say,

242
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,200
 "What happened?" But at the time they're saying, you know,

243
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,200
 "Someone's killed this woman, drank her blood, killed her during intercourse. This is horrible."

244
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:05,200
 So that happened in 1932, May 4th of 1932.

245
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,200
 In August of 1933, nothing.

246
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:15,200
 Didn't find the guy. 1942, nothing. 1986, nothing.

247
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,200
 They've never found this killer, ever.

248
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:29,200
 A guy murders a woman, most likely drank a portion of her blood, leaves, never caught.

249
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,200
 Never another murder in that area that matched this description.

250
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:40,200
 He's no one as the Atlas Vampire, because it took place in the neighborhood, like the Atlas neighborhood.

251
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:45,200
 This person may have died eight years later during the war.

252
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:53,200
 This person may have gone on to have grandchildren and great-grandchildren and kept the secret until he passed away himself.

253
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,200
 May have been an upstanding member of society, may have been a drug user.

254
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,200
 Who knows?

255
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,200
 May have been a mystical vampire, but that's unlikely.

256
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,200
 May have just been a man who loves to drink human blood and kill a woman.

257
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,200
 Not a serial killer, no other murders have ever been linked to this, but terrifying.

258
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:20,200
 Creepy story. If they had caught him, it would have just been another weirdo who did another weird thing.

259
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:27,200
 But the fact that he was still out there, I guess if he was young enough, he could still be out there, but that's unlikely.

260
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,200
 But he was probably, is very likely, he was alive during my lifetime.

261
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:38,200
 He was an old man while I was a kid, collecting daffodils and looking at windmills.

262
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,200
 I think that's Holland actually, but maybe he moved there.

263
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,200
 Spooky stuff, man. That's definitely a Halloween story for you.

264
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:52,200
 Lana has this thing about serial killers operating during wartime, and I do think that's an interesting topic as well.

265
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:59,200
 Because of this Atlas vampire guy, this happens in 1932, and 10 years were in the middle of the start of World War II,

266
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:08,200
 who's to say he doesn't go somewhere else, into a war zone, and engage in his blood-drinking fetish, young maidens, from Deutschland.

267
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:17,200
 The last story I want to talk about fascinates me. Again, it is a recommendation from Lana in a roundabout way.

268
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,200
 She sent me the story about Bella in the Witch Tree.

269
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:29,200
 A young woman was murdered and stuffed in a tree, and her hands were cut off, and her body was found quite a time later.

270
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:36,200
 They just found her skeleton, and then after her body was found and put in the ground, graffiti started appearing around town,

271
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,200
 going, "Who put Bella in the Elm Tree?" or "Who put Bella in the Witch Tree?" or something like that.

272
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:47,200
 I'd heard that story before, I didn't find it necessarily that compelling. I don't know.

273
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,200
 But anyways, when I was reading-- that was a good intro to this-- this part is compelling.

274
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:57,200
 So when I was reading about Bella, and they never figured out if that was her real name, it is kind of a weird story,

275
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:05,200
 but it's not worth a whole segment. One of the theories was that her hands were cut off to create what's known as a hand of glory.

276
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,200
 And I was like, "Oh, what's that?" I click on that link, down the rabbit hole.

277
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:18,200
 Hand of glory is actually a very popular magic totem. They were in vogue from the 16th to the 18th century.

278
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:25,200
 You had a 200-year time span then in Europe, specifically in England, where if you had a hand of glory,

279
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:30,200
 basically it was the old-timey equivalent of the Infinity Gauntlet.

280
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:36,200
 So, what did-- hey, let me tell you how-- no, no, no, I'll tell you what it does first.

281
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,200
 And then you can decide whether or not it's worth the trouble to actually make one.

282
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:46,200
 If you have the hand of glory, and you have it-- it's like a candle-type thing,

283
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,200
 I never mind, I'll explain to you what it is, and then that'll make more sense.

284
00:16:49,200 --> 00:17:01,200
 Okay, so what the hand of glory is, is when a prisoner, when a criminal, has been hung or stuck in a gibbet and they die,

285
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:07,200
 you cut off their left hand. If they're a murderer, you cut off the hand that did the murder.

286
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:12,200
 But generally, you just take the left hand. And there is a preparation where you have to dry it,

287
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:17,200
 and you have to rub all these, like, 11 herbs and spices on it, and do all sorts of stuff.

288
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:23,200
 Here's the actual recipe. It must be cut from the body of a criminal on the gibbet, but it also-- the gallows work, too.

289
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:31,200
 You have to pickle it in salt and the urine of a man, a woman, a dog, a horse, and a mare.

290
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:38,200
 So, I think a mare is a female horse. So, you got to get this hand. That seems to be the easy part.

291
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:44,200
 Then you have to get salt, and you have to pee in a bucket, and then the opposite sex has to pee in the bucket.

292
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:49,200
 Then you got to get dog, piss, horse pee, and mare pee. So now you got a pretty big bucket.

293
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,200
 You're walking around with this. You have to smoke it with herbs. You thought it was joking about 11 herbs and spices.

294
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,200
 You have to smoke it with herbs and hay for a month. You hang it on a nook tree for three nights in a row.

295
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:06,200
 Then you lay it across roads. Then you hang it on the church door for one night while the maker keeps watch in the porch.

296
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:11,200
 So, you got to, like, I guess you got to sit on the steps of the church while there's his hand just hanging there.

297
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,200
 And then it says, "And if it be--" Old English is so annoying, quote.

298
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:23,200
 "And if it be that no fear hath driven you forth from the porch, then the hand be true one, and it be yours."

299
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:29,200
 So, you're going to sit there with this hand that you've been, like, smoking, and it's covered in piss of, like, five different--

300
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:35,200
 four different species. Men and women are the same species. And all the herbs and stuff.

301
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,200
 And then you got to sit there at the church, and the hand's going to hang there.

302
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,200
 And if you don't get too scared, you get the hand. You get this hand of glory.

303
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,200
 At this point, it looks disgusting. Now you got to make the candle. You thought you were done.

304
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,200
 No, now you just have the hand. There's two ways to have the candle.

305
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:54,200
 You can cover the fingers in wax and have each finger be its own candle.

306
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,200
 So, you'll have five candles in total. For those of you who don't know how many fingers humans have.

307
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:07,200
 Or you can make a candle and it sit like you-- you close the hand up like it's a fist with its index finger pointing out

308
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,200
 and you put the candle in there. And you go, "Okay, well, you know, that's pretty good."

309
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,200
 No, hold on. The candle has to be made out of the fat of the convict.

310
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,200
 So that's an ingredient you should want way in the beginning.

311
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:28,200
 It should say-- the recipe should say-- cut off his hand and scoop out some fat from him.

312
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,200
 Because if you've been smoking this thing for a month, chances are the body's not there anymore.

313
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:38,200
 So while you're cutting the hand off, you then got to, like, reach in and pull out a bunch of dead man's fat.

314
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,200
 You make the wick out of the hair of the dead man.

315
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:47,200
 Damn it, now you got to go back to the body. Just tell me all of the ingredients I need from the corpse first.

316
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,200
 So you get the fat, you get the hand, you get some hair, and you make the wick.

317
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:58,200
 So you can pour the fat-- fat-- the dead man's wax on the fingertips and make little wicks out of hair that way.

318
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,200
 Or you can just have him hold a candle.

319
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,200
 And you're like, "Jason, that is, like, the most absurd recipe."

320
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,200
 And it's very, very convoluted. What benefit would I have from having a hand of glory?

321
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:17,200
 Well, here's one. It can provide light that only you can see. Everyone else is in the dark. That is stupid.

322
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:24,200
 That's the-- okay, that's the first benefit. And I was like, "I would not do half of that stuff,

323
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,200
 especially dig out the fat of a dead man, just so I could be the only one in a lit room."

324
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:35,200
 And fun fact, while I was researching this, I found out in Harry Potter,

325
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:42,200
 Dracus Malfoy, who I think is a bad guy. I'm not for sure. He uses a hand of glory to walk around

326
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,200
 and out of all the powers I'm about to list, he only uses that one.

327
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,200
 So no one else can see the light except for him.

328
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:57,200
 I hate those books. The next thing that this thing does, now we start to get a little more effective.

329
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,200
 It may or may not allow you to go invisible. That sounds really chancey.

330
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:09,200
 You're going to walk into an armory full of British guards, and you may or may not be invisible. You don't know.

331
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,200
 You won't know until they start spearing you and you end up in a gibbet.

332
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:20,200
 The more well-known and useful tactics for the hand of glory, and the reason why thieves prize these,

333
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,200
 because these are real. They have one in a museum over in Britain.

334
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,200
 They're very real and there's been tons of text written about these things.

335
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,200
 It allows you to get into any locked place. Any door that's locked, you can use the hand of glory

336
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,200
 and it magically makes the lock come undone.

337
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,200
 It'll put anyone around you to sleep, or it'll freeze them in place.

338
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,200
 Now I have a, I think I know where that part of the magic came from.

339
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:51,200
 So let's say you're standing at Burger King, and a guy walks into Burger King holding a severed hand

340
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:58,200
 with a candle that's made, it has the same yellow-white color that human fat has.

341
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,200
 And the wick is burning hair and he's walking around, are you going to move?

342
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,200
 Or are you going to be so petrified of what happens next?

343
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,200
 You're just going to be like, continue eating your whopper.

344
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,200
 You're in shock. There's a man with a severed hand that smells like piss walking by you.

345
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,200
 Now, why would make people fall asleep? The same thing.

346
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,200
 I would not wake up if I was asleep and that guy walked in.

347
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,200
 I would just pretend to be asleep and let him steal my valuables.

348
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:30,200
 If you decided to do the candles with the fingertips, you could light each fingertip

349
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:35,200
 and it would tell you if a fingertip didn't light, that means there's someone still awake in your house.

350
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,200
 And you're like, Jason, a lot of this stuff has to do with sleeping,

351
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,200
 because thievery was such a serious crime back then.

352
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,200
 And it was a very lucrative crime.

353
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,200
 You break into someone's house, you take all that stuff, you don't have to work for it.

354
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:54,200
 Thievery was generally, it was a death sentence back then, because it was such a heinous crime.

355
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,200
 Nowadays, it's like, oh, someone broke into my car or the cops don't even investigate it.

356
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:04,200
 But back then, you would want what was in my car so badly, you would cut off someone's hand

357
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,200
 and soak it in piss for a month.

358
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,200
 So these hands of glories were prized possessions among thieves.

359
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,200
 However, all magic has counter magic.

360
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,200
 There's two ways you can stop this.

361
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,200
 So, some guy walks into Burger King and he's holding this dead man's hand.

362
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,200
 He's holding this hand of glory and it's lit and you can smell the human fat and the piss just burning.

363
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:33,200
 The smell of burning hair is bad enough, but add all those other smells to it.

364
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:39,200
 But you, you didn't order your Coca-Cola like you normally do at Burger King.

365
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,200
 Today, you have a cup of blue milk.

366
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:48,200
 Now, blue milk is also known as uncurdled milk, which basically means milk you can drink.

367
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,200
 Is he's walking by you with the candle and he's like, oh yes, I'm gonna steal the whopper recipe.

368
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,200
 You can throw your milk on the candle and it puts it out and then everyone in the room will wake up.

369
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,200
 Everyone who was motionless before can start moving again and they'll beat up the thief and then he'll be executed.

370
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,200
 The other way is that, so you're like, okay, so I can keep milk everywhere, but it has to be uncurdled.

371
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,200
 So you have to keep refreshing your milk supply. Milk was very valuable.

372
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:17,200
 How can I protect my house? Is there a Brinks security system for 16th century England?

373
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:25,200
 And there was. You could create a counter effect for the hand of glory in your house.

374
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:31,200
 This is what you need to do. You need to rub the threshold so, you know, like over the doorway of your house

375
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:38,200
 and then you have to take the other entry points with a unjuint, un-guint.

376
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,200
 I'm assuming that's some sort of goo. Anyways, it's disgusting enough.

377
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:49,200
 It takes the fat, all this fat. You have to get a white hen, take the fat out of it.

378
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,200
 You have to take the blood of a screech owl, which sounds incredibly pleasant.

379
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,200
 So you have your fat from a hen. You have your blood from a screech owl.

380
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,200
 Simple ingredient. You need a tumor from a black cat.

381
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:10,200
 So you've got to get a black cat who has a tumor and cut it off, mix this all together in the middle of summer,

382
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:16,200
 and then rub it all over your house. So instead of a guy breaking into your house that smells of horse piss,

383
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:23,200
 now your house always smells like a cat tumor. This stuff, people did all of this.

384
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:30,200
 It's amazing to think that only, what would that be, 400 years ago?

385
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:35,200
 No doubt. So it's, because it lasted from the 16th century to the 18th century.

386
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:45,200
 So we're talking three to 500 years ago in a civilized industrial country, more industrial towards the end.

387
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,200
 You had people chopping the hands off of convicts, walking around through the dark,

388
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:55,200
 and other people cutting the tumors off of cats and rubbing them all over their house.

389
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,200
 And then they would sit back and light a pipe and go, "Ah, we're safe tonight, madam.

390
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,200
 I've rubbed the cat tumor over the door. We can do whatever we want."

391
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:15,200
 Bizarre. And there's this battle, this magical battle, that people both sides completely believed in.

392
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:23,200
 Whether or not it was effective is almost irrelevant, because both sides believed in it so heavily,

393
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,200
 they did the grossest stuff possible to prevent the other side from winning.

394
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,200
 The idea that you could cut off a thief's hand and use that to help you be a better thief,

395
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,200
 magically, it makes sense. Logically, it's completely stupid.

396
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:47,200
 And really, the ending point should be, you're cutting it off of a thief or criminal who got caught.

397
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:57,200
 And that's your lucky charm. A dude who failed doing what you want to do is your genie.

398
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:04,200
 But again, when we look at superstitions and magic and things like this, logic rarely plays out.

399
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:10,200
 It's a fascinating story, though. The fact that hundreds, possibly thousands of people did these things

400
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,200
 to protect themselves or to commit crimes.

401
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:19,200
 Within a reasonable amount of time from us is just very, very fascinating.

402
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,200
 We're a very superstitious species. We continue to be superstitious.

403
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:29,200
 And it may not be healthy, but it makes for a really good story.

404
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,200
