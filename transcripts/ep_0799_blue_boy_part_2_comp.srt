1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 When the parents of a three-year-old girl go missing, no one really knows what's going on.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 But when they reappear, the story becomes even more bizarre.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 And then we travel to Detroit to take a look at a ghostly haunting that has us ask the question,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 "Is terror in the eye of the Beholder?"

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Today on Dead Rabbit Radio.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 [Music]

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 [Laughs]

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Is that Santa Claus or Jabba the Hutt? Who knows?

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of Dead Rabbit Radio.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I'm your host Jason Carpenter, I'm having a great day.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Hope you guys are having a great day too and wearing a Santa hat.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Which is completely meaningless because this is a podcast and you can't see me.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 But just imagine me with the Santa hat on for these episodes.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Talk about all this horrible stuff that we're going to be talking about.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 I'm feeling a little bit better for those of you who are wondering.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 I don't know what I'm sick with, so as long as I'm not sweating out of my eyeballs anymore,

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 I will consider that better.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 But someone who always makes me feel better coming into Dead Rabbit Command right now,

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 a friend of mine and longtime supporter of the show, give it up for Molly.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Everyone give a big round of applause to Molly walking into Dead Rabbit Command.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Molly actually sent us that story not too long ago, where I put it in the show notes.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Where she visited her son's place of work and the ghost followed her home,

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 or followed her into her dreams, however you want to put it.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Really, really good episode. We'll put it in the show notes.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Molly, you're going to be our captain or pilot this episode.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 If you guys can't support the Patreon, I totally understand.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Just help spread the word about the show really, really helps out a lot.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 That's how Molly actually ended up on the show. She doesn't support the Patreon,

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 but she talks about my podcast more than I do.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 She promotes the podcast more than I do. So, Molly, that is how you've earned this opportunity.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Thank you. I really, really appreciate that.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Molly, I'm going to go ahead and toss you the keys to the Jason Jalopy.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 We are leaving behind Dead Rabbit Command. We are driving all the way out to Greenwood, Indiana.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 This is a true crime story that's happening right now.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 And I just cannot wrap my head around this. And every day I'm looking for updates on this,

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 and the news articles are like, "We don't know either."

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 We have no idea. We're talking to the police investigating this thing,

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 and nobody knows what's going on.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 When this story first popped up, I wanted to cover it the day I first found out about it,

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 about earlier this week, but I was like, "No, there has to be more information. It can't be this weird."

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 So, let's go back to early December, the week of the 6th of December, 2021.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 So, incredibly recent. In Greenwood, Indiana, Molly's driving the Jason Jalopy,

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 and we pull up to a house, and there's a little girl in the house going,

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 "Mmm, I'm so scared, and I'm a baby."

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 And doing all this stuff, we walk up, we're looking in the window,

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 and there's this three-year-old girl sitting there in the dark house going,

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 "Mmm, somebody help me."

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 The grandma of this child shows up, and she's knocking on the door, and she's super worried.

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 So, like, that we're sitting in the Jason Jalopy eating popcorn.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 I'm like, "Look at that human misery. Isn't that hilarious?"

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 What's going on is that the grandma goes to the house, she hadn't heard from her daughter,

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 or her son-in-law, but she goes to the house, and there's this three-year-old baby just left there.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 So, she calls the police, and the police start investigating this, and who knows what's going on.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 The grandma said, "Listen, my daughter, she had a miscarriage back in June earlier this year,

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 and I think it kind of, like, affected her.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 I think she's having this postpartum-esque mental issue going on."

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 And my son-in-law is just coo-coo-coo!

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 She starts making all these sound effects, and the cops are like, "Oh, man, she must really not like her son-in-law."

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 She goes, "My son's a little off, too. My son-in-law's a little off, too."

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 So, when both of these people go missing, you have to think, "Did they run away? Did they get kidnapped?"

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Grandma takes possession of the three-year-old little granddaughter, and the police go,

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 "We'll try to find them. That is our job, after all."

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 So, they set up a thing to detect pings on their cell phones. Nothing.

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 There's no record of them pulling money out of ATMs, and this is when the police start...

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 When people go missing, when people, like, run away, they'll access their ATM so they can track them.

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 But this one, they don't know. They don't know if they're purposely running away.

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 They don't know if they've been kidnapped.

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 A week goes by, and then the police are sitting there in their headquarters.

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Boop boop boop. Boop boop boop. Boop boop boop.

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 They have this monitor. It was detecting a ping on their cell phones.

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Boop boop boop. Boop boop boop.

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 The detectives are like, "Hurry up. Get the sergeant over here. We've got to look at this,"

73
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 and they're all looking at this monitor, and they see a little dot going, "Do-do-do-do."

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 We've got a ping, sir. Where's it at, officer?

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 There. He points at the monitor, and the camera pulls back.

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 They're in Florida!

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Specifically, they're at the Daily-Own Springs State Park in Volusia County, Florida.

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 And the detectives in Greenwood, Indiana, they make a phone call, because we don't want to drive down there.

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Call the police down in Florida. Let's find out what's going on, because at this point, the police are concerned about their safety,

80
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 but also they're guilty of child neglect. They just left their daughter in this house.

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 So the police down in Volusia County show up at Daily-Own Springs,

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 and there is a stolen moving truck there, a stolen Pinsky truck there,

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 in the parking lot of the state park. So the police go, "This has to be them."

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 And they go, and they kind of like are like hiding in the bushes, and then they get bored at some point,

85
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 and one of them is like crawling out of the bushes, and they're like, "Where are you going? There's supposed to be a state guard."

86
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 He's like, "Oh, it's boring over here." And they begin inspecting the van.

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 And inside the van, there's actually body cam footage of this. Inside the van, there's a baby!

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 A little baby! Me! Me!

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 The cop's like, "Oh, great, my day just got way more complicated." A little baby person.

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 And you're looking at this body cam footage, and first off, you hear the officer go,

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 "There's a baby in here, and if you're looking, you don't see a baby, because it's so full of garbage."

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 The back of this truck is full of just trash, and like dirty diapers, and like just rubble.

93
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 And underneath the rubble, you can barely see a child's car seat that is held down.

94
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 It's like attached to the flatbed of this moving truck with bungee cords.

95
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 So the police are automatically, they start filling out more infractions.

96
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 They're like, "What else can we charge this missing couple with?"

97
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 Because they're not at the parking lot. There's just this truck that they're assuming belongs to these people,

98
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 because they have this stolen truck. There's a baby here, but they're like,

99
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 "Do they have another baby?" I thought the whole reason why we're looking for them is that they left their baby in Greenwood, Indiana.

100
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 And the cops are like, "Yeah, they should not have another baby in their car, but here is one."

101
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 And then as the cops are trying to investigate, they're trying to process it,

102
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 who comes walking out of the wilderness, pushing a stroller, an empty stroller,

103
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Lincoln and Amanda Germano.

104
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 So the police are like, "Okay, this is what we expected. We expected to find them here.

105
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 We didn't expect to find a baby." So they separate Lincoln and Amanda and they go,

106
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 "Why are you guys here? Why'd you guys leave your other daughter behind in Indiana?"

107
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 And the biggest question we have is, "Who's this?" They're pointing at the baby. Who's this?

108
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 So the main question the cops have right now is, "What is this baby doing here?

109
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Whose baby is this?" Because it's clearly not yours. We know you had a miscarriage back in June.

110
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 I don't actually know if they confronted Amanda with that, but they said, "This isn't your baby."

111
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Now at first, both of them said, "Amanda and Lincoln, they're separated at this point."

112
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 Both of them said, "Oh, no, that's not our baby." But as the cops kept pressing them,

113
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 with simple questions like, "Whose baby is it? Where did you find it? And what's his name?"

114
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 They then changed their story and they go, "Oh, that's our baby."

115
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 That's our baby. We actually gave birth to him at home.

116
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 So we don't have any paperwork for him. And the cops go, "What's his name?" And they gave two separate names.

117
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 She said his name was John. And Lincoln said the baby's name was Emanuel Rodriguez.

118
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 And the reason why they ended up in daily-owned springs was that Lincoln apparently is suffering from some sort of affliction.

119
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Most likely the mental affliction mentioned earlier. And he believes that the daily-owned springs have magical properties.

120
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 If he drinks the water, he'll be healed. And the police are like, "Uh, okay, that's not true."

121
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 And it's okay to like, journey around the country, drink in strange sources of water and hoping for a cure.

122
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 But one, you can't leave your kid at home when you do it.

123
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 No, you can't appear with someone else's kid. So please just tell us where you got the kid.

124
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 And as of now, the stories we've been going on for about a week since they've been arrested, they still are like, "That's our baby."

125
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 They're like, "It's clearly not your baby." Yeah, yeah, it's our baby.

126
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 So they're in the court system right now. And the judge said, "Okay, part of--if you guys pay bail,

127
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 part of the order is you can't contact the baby."

128
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Because the baby's being raised by like the Florida Department of Health and Human Services or whatever.

129
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 And the judge goes, "You guys are being charged with child neglect. Lincoln's being charged also with grand theft because he stole the Pinsky truck."

130
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 And they go, "If you do--or if you are able to pay bail, one of the things is you can't talk to this baby."

131
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 And Amanda goes, "How long do I have to wait before I can talk to the baby?"

132
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 Like, "I want to see my baby again." The judge is like, "That's not your baby. You never get to talk to your baby again."

133
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 The judge actually said, "We'll see. I'll get back to you on that." But this is clearly not their child.

134
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 So at this point, where we're at in the story is the Department of Health and Human Services, whatever that specific department is in Florida,

135
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 they have a baby that they have no idea where this child's from.

136
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 They're getting DNA from the child right now and they're like, "Maybe we'll match it against something in a genealogy database

137
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 and find the parents, but how did they get the baby in the first place? Did they kidnap the baby? Did they buy the baby?

138
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Or--this is the way my mind works. When I read this, I thought--they disappear from their house.

139
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 Their cell phones don't ping at all for a week until they pop up in Florida with this new baby, who at first they say isn't theirs,

140
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 but they both claim is theirs to the point that they want to see the baby during the trial.

141
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 They call him for the defense and he all of a sudden he can talk and go, "Oh, no, there's one of my parents. I'm thinking,

142
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 what if they slipped into some sort of alternate universe? This is an insight into my mind."

143
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 What if they fell into some sort of alternate universe where she had a baby?

144
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 She had a little baby boy and that would explain why the cell phones didn't ping because they're coming back out of the alternate universe

145
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 in Florida and maybe, because she's got fully on, as they were re-entering our universe, they couldn't remember who the baby belonged to,

146
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 but now they know the baby's theirs. Now, this is the reason why I'm never on a jury because I'm sitting there and taking notes.

147
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 They're all presenting all this evidence. They're like, "Here's photos of them kidnapping the baby. Here's photos of them breaking into the truck

148
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 that the baby was in and I'm past the prosecutors giving all the information I write or," in my notes,

149
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 and then I draw like a little portal, I draw a baby falling out of a portal into their hands.

150
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 So here's the thing, I'm thinking like that because I'm a paranormal-minded person. I'm also not an idiot.

151
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 I know that that's unlikely. This is one of the stories that I've been, because I've been wanting to talk about it all week on the show,

152
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 I've just been looking for more information. This is a story I've been telling my friends.

153
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 And one of them goes, "Oh, they probably bought the baby." And I go, "Yeah, I think it's kind of hard to buy babies."

154
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Like, I know people used to sell them on Craigslist, but they always got arrested fairly quickly. I don't think it's that easy to buy a baby.

155
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 And my friend looks at me and goes, "Well, I got a story for you then."

156
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 "Molly, let's go ahead and hop in that dead rabbit dirgeable we are leaving behind. Daily Own Springs, Florida."

157
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 "We're even going to buy that baby. We hope you find your real parents." We are headed all the way out to the Pacific Northwest.

158
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 This is a story a friend told me. I'm going to change some basic facts about it because you'll understand why.

159
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 There's certain things I have to leave out of the story just to make sure that everyone's not killed because I told this story.

160
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Anyways, let's check this out. So he was telling me a couple years ago, and when I say a couple years ago, we're talking like 10, 15 years ago.

161
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 He worked at a facility, like a shelter for battered children, battered wives type of thing.

162
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 And there are parts of the Pacific Northwest, and we're taking this whole region because I don't want to specify where this story took place.

163
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 But there are parts of the Pacific Northwest that are wild.

164
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 And I don't mean like grizzly bears and mountain lions, like lawless parts of the Pacific Northwest.

165
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 People come out here because they don't want to have the interference from the government.

166
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 So you have this shelter in this region of the Pacific Northwest, and one day the police drop off an 11-year-old girl.

167
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 And my friend said, "This girl was 11 years old, but she acted like she was 7. She acted very childlike."

168
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Like even at 11, you're starting to kind of put stuff together, but this girl acted really, really young, young for her age.

169
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 And when she wasn't doing anything at the shelter, wasn't helping out or getting to meet other people,

170
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 she would just sit there in color in a coloring book and just sit on the edge of her bed and her legs would kind of kick like a little girl.

171
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 And so my friend was telling me, so he goes, "The police came and they dropped her off, and they let us know what the situation was."

172
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 So this 11-year-old girl was trafficked when she was around the age of 9.

173
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 What had happened was, in this lawless region of the Pacific Northwest, apparently there is like this commune, this trailer park type situation.

174
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 And it was just a bunch of old men living there.

175
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Living off the land, hanging out with each other, drinking a couple beers.

176
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 But they also bought this girl.

177
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 The whole community got together, chipped their money together, and bought a 9-year-old girl.

178
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 And she served the whole community. She went from house to house, her trailer to trailer.

179
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 She was cooking for them. She was cleaning up their place.

180
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 And of course, because people are disgusting, she was being sexually abused.

181
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 She was being sexually abused by this group of old men, and she would go from house to house throughout the week.

182
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 One day one of these guys is taking her somewhere and she's sitting in the car.

183
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 This started when she was 9, now she's 11.

184
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 And it's late at night and this car is driving through the wilderness.

185
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 And she'd probably planned on this, she'd probably thought about this for a long time.

186
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 But now was the moment. As this car was driving down the road late at night,

187
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 she's watching the woods pass by, staring at the passenger window.

188
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 She finally makes the decision to jump out of the car.

189
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 She opens her car door and she leaps out of a moving vehicle and takes off into the woods.

190
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 But she doesn't actually. And this is a very, very interesting thing.

191
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 There's a tip if you're ever being pursued by someone, be it law enforcement or criminal gang.

192
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 You're caught by moving. You are caught by running.

193
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 She jumped out of the car, ran a short distance, and then jumped into a ditch right by the road.

194
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 Covered herself up. And when the dude stopped the car and jumped out and was freaking out obviously,

195
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 because this is the entire community's quote-unquote property,

196
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 he's screaming out into the woods and he's assuming she has bolted into the wilderness.

197
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 But she's right in that ditch and he gets a hold of other people in the community

198
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 and these other cars pull up and they're screaming for her.

199
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 And they're both offering great prizes. Oh, we're so sorry. I don't know why you ran away.

200
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 When you come back, we're going to give you the best dress. We're going to give you the prettiest dress.

201
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 We're going to give you all these sweets and all these treats. We love you.

202
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 As well as threats. You come out of here right now. I'm going to bash your head and get out of there. Come on.

203
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 And she's close enough to the road to hear all of this.

204
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 When you run, you get caught. If you can stay still, it's a lot harder to catch you, honestly.

205
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 She lays in that ditch, I think for almost a day.

206
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 And then crawls out of it when she thinks the coast is clear and it is clear.

207
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 And I don't know if she's picked up. There's a lot of this story took place so long ago

208
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 and I have a feeling like I'm kind of hearing it from someone who was there.

209
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 But I think there were a prefiary to what was going on at the actual shelter.

210
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 So they didn't have a lot of immediate information as well.

211
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 But they're saying that eventually, I don't know if another person came by and picked her up

212
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 or if the police found her and picked her up or if she walked for miles and miles.

213
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 But eventually she does end up in the hands of the police and the police sent her to the shelter.

214
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 And at this point, the people in the community, the old creepy community,

215
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 realize that the girl is at the shelter.

216
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 With this shelter, I used to volunteer at a woman's shelter in Sacramento.

217
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 And one of the things we were told, we could never reveal the location of the shelter.

218
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 It was like this giant office building. You would never know.

219
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 You'd think it was like an 18-T call center. It was a woman's shelter.

220
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 It doesn't exist anymore. Sadly, it doesn't exist anymore. These places are needed.

221
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 But we had security and there were no signs outside the building.

222
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 You didn't know where it was at. And it was against the law for like, we had to swear.

223
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 I think we had a sign of document saying if we revealed the information, like it was a criminal act.

224
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 But anyway, so here, it's different in this small town. Everyone knew where this shelter was.

225
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 And when this girl showed up, information must have leaked down.

226
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 They began calling the shelter and doing the same thing, being like, oh, it's totally misunderstanding.

227
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 If you send her back, we're going to love her. Just let her know how much we love her and how much we want her back and all this stuff.

228
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 And then they'd also get phone calls about threats. We're going to come in there and we're going to kill everyone there, burn the place down.

229
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 And then eventually, I guess she was there for a while, the facility, the shelter said, we don't have the security to protect her or protect our people.

230
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 So working with law enforcement, she was shipped to another location.

231
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 That's where the story ends. It's really interesting though to think like, I assumed buying a child would be fairly difficult.

232
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 But the fact that I can just be talking, I mean, I do have a lot of friends and I have a friend who have had a variety of careers over the years.

233
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 It's very interesting that as I was just telling the story, I told it to a bunch of people here in town.

234
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 One of the people I told had secondhand experience. Like again, they weren't actually involved in this.

235
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 They were kind of on the sidelines of it, but they were kind of watching everything.

236
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 And like, what are the chances of that? Now, obviously it happened. So there is some chance of it, but maybe buying children is easier than I thought.

237
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 I'm not recommending it. But you know what I mean? Like, maybe it's more common than I thought.

238
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 So maybe I personally think, I mean, going back to the Germanas, putting the alternate reality thing aside, I think it would be easier to kidnap a baby than buy a baby.

239
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 But if the baby was kidnapped, you think there would be reports of a missing baby.

240
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 So was the baby sold when they do this DNA test or they're going to be able to find this kid's real parents?

241
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 Do the parents of the baby want to be found because they sold the baby? I mean, if they sold the baby, they have to be found.

242
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 They have to be prosecuted. But what a bizarre story. And I guess it's probably more common than you think. Buying kids.

243
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 Who would have thought? I thought that was something, every so often you'd see an article of someone getting busted because they were selling their kid for like $1,000 on Craigslist or like $1,000 in trade and drugs and stuff like that.

244
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 And they always get arrested. So I figured, oh, you know, that's good. Law enforcement's doing their job. That person's going to prison for a long time.

245
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 Then we have stories like my friend told me that. Maybe it's more common. Isn't that terrifying?

246
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 But hopefully, hopefully both stories will have a happy ending. And I'll keep you guys updated too on that Germanic story.

247
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 We'll see what else pops out of that. But Molly, let's go ahead and tashi the keys to the carbonar copter.

248
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 We are leaving behind the Pacific Northwest. We are flying all the way out to Detroit, Michigan.

249
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 So Molly, bring this carbonar copter nice and low. We're hovering over this little house in Detroit, Michigan. The year is 2017.

250
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 I found this story posted online by Chick-fil-A26. We're going to call you Marcus. If that's your real name, that's just a shot in the dark.

251
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 And Marcus goes on to say this house was his cousin's house. He was visiting from out of town and apparently his family often comes up to this location.

252
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 And he goes, "It was a typical house that you would find in Detroit." He said it was a very narrow but a big house and had like the kitchen, the bathroom.

253
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 I mean, every house has those, hopefully. He said it was this narrow house. It was big and you had like the basement. You had the attic.

254
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 It was just basically as spooky as a house you could imagine in Detroit. And apparently this is the most common type of house out there.

255
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 But he's staying at his cousin's house for the week. And while he's there, he's sharing a room with his nine-year-old nephew.

256
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 And for the most of the week, everything's totally fine. He does get a little weird at how he gets a weird vibe coming from the kitchen and the upstairs bathroom.

257
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 But other than that, his biggest complication is his nine-year-old nephew being like, "And now the new hundred Pokemon added in Sapphire Gold are these."

258
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 And he's like, "Oh my God, please, please kill me." Everything else, though, paranormal-wise seems to just be...

259
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 He wouldn't even classify it as paranormal. It just gets kind of a weird vibe in those two areas.

260
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 Well, one night he comes back from this family event. They've all been out hanging out and he gets home and he tells his nephew, he goes,

261
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 "Hey, I know we'll spend the night in your room. I know you have another hundred Pokemon to tell me about from Ruby Rose and Black Petals or whatever the newest game is.

262
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 But I'm gonna see... He actually tells his nephew this. I'm gonna sleep downstairs for just a couple hours.

263
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 And then I'll go up to the room and join you. But I definitely need some sleep. It's midnight. We're getting home.

264
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 I need a little bit of sleep. You can tell me all about Fortnite dances tomorrow. But let me sleep for a little bit on the couch.

265
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 And the nephew goes, "Oh yeah, that's totally fine." So Marcus goes to sleep on the couch and he's asleep for about two hours.

266
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 [snoring]

267
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 And then he wakes up. And the way he's sleeping is he's facing the couch. So his back is facing the living room.

268
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 And he wakes up and he senses. All these things kind of happen at once. He senses someone standing next to the couch, standing facing his back.

269
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 He's laying there. And he realizes someone's in the room with him and he can... It's the odd. I've never had this happen to me.

270
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 He can actually sense that it's the presence of a child next to him. So as he's groggily waking up from his sleep on the couch, he's waiting to be hit with a litany of new Pokemon names.

271
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 He figures his nephew is standing there. He tells his nephew, "Go, come on man, go away. We'll learn all about this stuff. I just need a little bit more sleep."

272
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 And he starts to try to drift off again, but the boy, the presence of his child, is still standing next to the couch.

273
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 So Marcus rolls over to face his nephew and what he sees is not his nephew.

274
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 But what he's looking at is so bizarre, he is still rationalizing it as his nephew.

275
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 He rolls over and he sees a boy standing there, a pale blue boy, wearing worn overalls and sporting a really, really bad buzz cut, a badly shaven head.

276
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 And this little boy is just staring at Marcus.

277
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 And as Marcus is staring back at this child and his brain still isn't perceiving it, he's still acting like as if his nephew is standing here.

278
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 It's a very, very weird set of circumstances and it does happen. It does happen in the world of the paranormal. Your brain will go, "Well, that's impossible. Therefore, X is what I'm looking at."

279
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 He's sitting and he's looking at this pale blue boy and he immediately just feels intense sadness come over him.

280
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 And then he just feels his body begin to be drained of energy. All he can sense is heartbreak and melancholy.

281
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 He feels like his energy is being drained out of him.

282
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 And he rolls back over. I'm just going to ignore my nephew, he'll eventually go back to bed.

283
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 But I'm just too tired right now and for whatever reason my nephew is bumming me out.

284
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 For whatever reason my nephew has a bad haircut, I didn't see him do that earlier.

285
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 And for whatever reason my nephew is his pale blue.

286
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 And then he realizes, this is the point, he's been staring at this kid for a while, but this is the point when he turns his back to the kid.

287
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 And finally clicks in his head, "That's not my nephew!"

288
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 And he rolls back over and the living room is completely empty.

289
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 Well, I mean there's furniture, there's furniture and stuff. The blue boy didn't rob him, but there's no one in the living room with him.

290
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 So he jumps up, he actually runs upstairs. He realizes now he's either had a horrible nightmare, a very realistic nightmare, or he's just seen a ghost.

291
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 So he runs upstairs into his nephew's bedroom, he's like "Please tell me about all the Pokemon, whatever, I just need to sleep in this room, it's super spooky downstairs."

292
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 He actually doesn't say it's super spooky downstairs, he doesn't tell anyone about this story.

293
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 He just leaves it be, he woke up in the middle of the night, saw this pale blue phantom of a boy, and he felt like it was draining his energy out of him.

294
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 And he dismissed it as being his nephew, but then he realized his nephew is not a pale blue vampire.

295
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 Two years later, Marcus is talking to his twin sister, we'll call her Jenny, and he goes "Hey Jenny, this is going to sound kind of weird, but when you're ever at the cousin's house in Detroit, do you ever have a weird feeling there? Does that house ever kind of creep you out?"

296
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 She looks at Marcus and she goes "You know what, I've never told this story to anyone, you're not going to believe this, you're not going to believe this."

297
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 But one day, I was sleeping in the middle of the house, I slept on the couch in the living room, I woke up in the middle of the night, and I saw a little boy, Marcus is sitting there, totally freaking out, he's told no one this story.

298
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 Jenny continues, "I woke up in the middle of the night and I see this pale blue boy standing in the kitchen."

299
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 He had it on these overalls, he had this really bad haircut, it was like he had his head shaved by an amateur or blind person or something like that, it was just all messed up.

300
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 He's standing next to the kitchen table and I'm on the couch and I'm looking, the living room is dark, but I can clearly see this pale blue boy standing in the kitchen.

301
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 And his eyes were pitch black and his mouth was twisted wide open, "Ohhhhhhh!"

302
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 Letting out a silent scream.

303
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 So the sound effect I had was just so you could fix it in your head, but imagine me going "Ohhhh!" but take out the sound effect, he was just screaming in silence.

304
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 Pitch black eyes, mouth wide open, not a sound to be heard in the house.

305
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 She goes, "It was absolutely terrifying, I never told anyone about it."

306
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 So Marcus, what was your weird paranormal event? Why do you feel uncomfortable there?

307
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 Marcus realized then they saw the same boy, these two twins.

308
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 And what's interesting about this story, the fact that there's this little boy walking around this house, this little ghost boy, is that he wraps it up like this.

309
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 And I never thought about this before. He wraps up his post with this question.

310
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 How come the boy looked more menacing to her and he looked more "peaceful" to me?

311
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 I read that and I go, "That's so fascinating, I never thought about that before."

312
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 Now I have encountered a version of a blue boy in my own life.

313
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 I'll put the episode in the show notes. I was basically in my, I wouldn't say my early days of ghost hunting,

314
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 but in the middle of them I used to be a physical ghost hunter.

315
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 Now, in a way, I just sit at home and read spooky stories, but I used to go out to haunted locations constantly.

316
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 I was a ghost hunter through and through. Now I'm more of a ghost researcher, but...

317
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 I used to be a ghost hunter on location for years, actually I did it.

318
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 And one of these locations I picked up a blue boy and he haunted me for a while.

319
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 I'll find the episode, I'll put it in the show notes. It's really interesting, it's really creepy.

320
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 I thought it was losing my mind, really. I was like, "This is impossible, I believe in ghosts."

321
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 But this is impossible, why is this thing following me around?

322
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 So when you come across stories of the pale blue boy, that's one of the things that I read and I go,

323
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 "Oh yeah, I know, that's true. That phenomenon's true. I've seen that with my own eyes.

324
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 The dogs, the two-dimensional dogs that walk on walls and walk down streets.

325
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 No matter which angle you look at them from, they're flat. I've seen those. I've seen those.

326
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 So, the phenomenon rings true to me.

327
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 But the idea, this is so fascinating to me, I never really thought about this before.

328
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 The idea that a ghost would appear to two different people in different forms is very, very interesting.

329
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 Because what we have, it's not just seen in two different forms. It's not someone going into a haunted house,

330
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 they experience a cold spot and then someone else going into the same haunted house and they see a shadow man.

331
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 I would argue that those are just people at different levels of perception of the paranormal.

332
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 What we're seeing is two twins, a set of twins, both perceiving the same person,

333
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 but one of them sees it as this menacing thing. Like, which one would you rather wake up to, right?

334
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 You're like, "Neither!" And I've shut the podcast off ten minutes ago.

335
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 I don't want to hear this story. Which one would you rather wake up to, though?

336
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 The little blue boy standing next to your couch just staring at you,

337
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 or the one in the kitchen screaming silently with this horrible twisted look on its face.

338
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 And you have to wonder, like, what is -- how -- why did he see the more peaceful version and she saw the hideous version?

339
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 Because I started thinking about all the times that I've had ghostly encounters

340
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 and times where I may bring people to locations. I used to go ghost hunting all the time.

341
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 It was actually a great first date activity. I did it a lot.

342
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 It's sometimes second date. It works better on the second date, because basically you have to convince a girl to drive you down in the middle of nowhere.

343
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 Not many will do that on the first date. Second date, though.

344
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 My point is, is that I've never thought about this before, that we could both encounter the same paranormal entity

345
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 and I could see it in a sense that maybe it is friendly or just a shadow passing in the woods.

346
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 And when she sees it, it's this hideous creature coming right towards us.

347
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 We're perceiving the same thing on different wavelengths. We're perceiving the same --

348
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 and the reason why this is -- I never thought about this before. This is incredibly dangerous, right?

349
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 Because there may be a haunted location that I go to, and I'm like, yeah, this place has a reputation of being haunted,

350
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 but I've personally never seen anything or walking around, and I'm perceiving it all as just places that have ghosts.

351
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 Places that have cold spots or maybe hearing things in the distance, which is actually really rare when you're walking around a haunted place and you hear voices.

352
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 When you're -- you know, I could be perceiving it one way, and if I do come across something, say, like a little blue boy,

353
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 who was, in my experience, completely sinister. He was actually actively trying to scare me, this little kid, so I was more in line with Jenny's reaction to this.

354
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 But it's just so interesting because I've done that multiple times. I've taken girls to haunted locations, and I'm wondering if it could have been --

355
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 what I'm trying to say is I've taken them to a place where the haunting is fairly benign, right?

356
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 But I'm exposing them to danger because whatever's there may be more vicious towards them for whatever reason.

357
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 You see what I mean? That's what we have here. Imagine these two people were ghost hunters, and the guy goes,

358
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 "Oh, we got to go to this place. It's this abandoned house in Detroit." I went there the other day, and there was a little blue boy standing in the corner,

359
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 and then she shows up, and the blue boy is crawling on all fours towards her and trying to, like, attack her, like, a little spider monkey.

360
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 And she's like, "Dude, don't take me here. This is the most violent haunting I've ever had." Is it possible that two ghost hunters,

361
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 or just two random people, can encounter the same ghost? And one is the terrifying representation of that ghost,

362
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 while the other person's like, "Oh, yeah, I just am slightly chilled." Ghost hunting is a dangerous game because you really never know what you're going to encounter.

363
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 You could go to the same asylum that Zach Baggins has been to, and the ghost hunters have been to, and they run tours every Halloween,

364
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 and it's creepy, and it's fun, and you bring all your EF readers, and you have a good time, and you go hunting ghosts.

365
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 And then you show up. Then you show up, and for whatever reason, you're delicious to the entities there.

366
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 They can taste you as you're getting out of the car in the parking lot. And you figure it's safe.

367
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 You've heard the rumors how this place is haunted, and all these people have investigated it.

368
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 But for whatever reason, you're just so delicious, so sweet, so pure to the entities in that building.

369
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 They've never seen something like you. They've never sensed your life force before.

370
00:35:51,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 And as you're walking into that "haunted asylum" that you've seen so many times on the sci-fi channel, with your buddies, you're going to go and have a good time doing some amateur ghost hunting.

371
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 But what you don't understand is you're about to start a feeding frenzy.

372
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 These spirits, these demons, whatever you want to call them, are licking their lips as you walk through that door.

373
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 Ghost hunting is a dangerous game, and at the very least you'll have a good time with your buddies. You'll have some stories to tell.

374
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 But at the very most, you could be opening yourself up to demonic possession.

375
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 A lot of people think of ghost hunting as a fun time walking through darkness and trying to record an EVP.

376
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 Trying to see a ghost, trying to find proof.

377
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 But to an experienced ghost hunter, you realize that every time you walk into a haunted location, you are doing the equivalent of walking into a minefield.

378
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 All the dangers are hidden. It's a dangerous, dangerous hobby.

379
00:36:51,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 You think you're just going to have this fun ghost hunting adventure, but while you're in this building, you are under constant psychic assault.

380
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 Your soul is drained. Your life force is drained.

381
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 You get dizzy, you gotta sit down. Your friends are worried about you. "Hey, do you want to leave? Do you want to leave?"

382
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 "Yeah, yeah, we'll leave in a second, just I'm not feeling that good." I gotta sit down.

383
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 And in that brief period of time, that infestation, that possession has already begun.

384
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 By the time you leave the asylum, you're no longer in control of your body.

385
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 Something else is walking out of that asylum wearing your skin.

386
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 Now, it doesn't mean everyone who goes into a house is going to get possessed. No.

387
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 But if you have the right set of attributes, if you have the things that these creatures are looking for, and if you don't have the fortitude to stand up against them,

388
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 you may not walk out of that building.

389
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 Well, your body may, but something else is happening there.

390
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 While the real you is left behind in that asylum.

391
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 Another tormented spirit. Another trapped soul.

392
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 Walking through the darkness of this abandoned hospital in agony and fear.

393
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 Doom to roam these halls until you become strong enough, vengeful enough to inhabit a body of somebody else.

394
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 You always wanted to be a ghost hunter, but now you're simply a ghost.

395
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,000
 Haunting a location that you read about online.

396
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 You've become part of the legend. You've become part of the curse.

397
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 All because you just looked too delicious to the demons in the darkness.
